","Having seen Tarantino's 3 previous films, going into the cinema, my expectations for 'Kill Bill' were already over the roof. However, regardless of my high hopes for quality entertainment, I was not prepared for this film. I was dumbfounded. I was blown away. I had quite simply never seen anything even remotely like it.<br/><br/>In 'Kill Bill', the revenge plot serves only as a larger story arc, thus allowing Tarantino to play with as many different genres as he likes, and boy - what a mix he dishes out! With complete disregard for the conventions of filmmaking, he paints an expressionistic masterpiece in his own unique style, the likes of which the world has never seen before. Cinema rarely gets this exciting. With 'Kill Bill', Tarantino proved once and for all that all the hype around his persona is justified: he IS the most daring, original - and entertaining! - filmmaker of his generation. Simply amazing: 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget And B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>All-Time Favorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/"

","Just saw Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and was surprised, to be honest, at how incredibly GOOD this film is. Here is a craftsman (or artist, if you prefer) at the top of his game. Some of the shots are simply incredible; the score is, for the most part, vintage Tarantino selections- and the RZA does a very good job at filling the blanks; Uma Thurman is a great female lead, for sheer presence (and decent acting chops). Even Lucy Liu, who I expected was going to re-hash her Charlie's Angel character, burst on the scene like a flaming nunchuck.<br/><br/>The stringing together of the scenes was impeccable. The transitions, the intercutting between dialogue, the flashbacks... I simply could not get enough. Tarantino IS, indeed, having fun here. He is giving us a film that may not go down as a classic, Pulp Fiction style, but that shows us what is yet to come. I doubt that he's lost his writing talents (as some have claimed), and I actually disagree that the dialogue in the film is ""poor"", or that there are ""no memorable lines"" (Empire). The kung-fu genre has never been a particularly good park to display Shakespearean writing virtuosisms. The lines work fine. The plot is simple enough, but Tarantino takes a burger and serves it as ""steak tartare with sauce au poivre and asparagus terrine"". He basically manages to cram so much information into the film that plot is simply irrelevent. What is relevent is the Bride's thirst for blood, her primal sense of vengeance and our total devotion to her. Bill, of course, is one of the greatest characters to ever NOT appear on screen. Overall, a great movie and an example of how a filmmaker's tool is not his pen: it's his eye."

","This is movie is unusual, but it works for me. It kept me intrigued from the beginning with the plot which is not entirely clearly, but that made it more interesting for me. There's a lot of action in the movie which I found excellent and enjoyed a lot. It might not be realistic, but its a movie so it doesn't have to be. The plot is amazing and I can't wait to watch volume 2 soon because of how intriguing volume 1 was."
"C-rocodile","10","395","667","1 March 2005"," Gorgeous!
","A lot of people have come up to me and said ""How can you love Quentin that much, he is just too extreme!"" or ""Oh come on, Kill Bill is just SO not realistic.."" Yes. No.<br/><br/>Mr. Quentin Tarantino is rather extreme, yes, and it's lovely! And No. Kill Bill is not realistic, but it's not meant to be realistic! Just like... Lord of the Rings, that's not realistic either! But because it has clear unreal elements, like wizards, it's acceptable?<br/><br/>You don't go to see Kill Bill, or any other Q.T-film to see ""Stepmom"", in the same way you don't go to a Marilyn Manson concert hoping that they will play some Spice Girls..<br/><br/>Kill Bill, both volume 1 and 2, is absolutely gorgeous! The art direction is beautiful! The camera angles are perfect... just Gorgeous! The lighting, the sound, the dialogs... and of course, the details! No one works with small details the way Quentin does. I must also say that the soundtrack is brilliant and the whole film is just so well casted! Uma Thurman is perfect in the leading role, Darryl Hannah has never been this good before, ever! And Chiaki Kuriyama, even though she has a quite small role, is excellent, even better than she is in ""Battle Royale"". David Carradine is painfully perfect, Michael Madsen is ALWAYS excellent, but never as good as when he works with Tarantino. I must also say that Sonny Chiba was great. I've never been a big fan of Vivica A Fox until now, and I used to think that Lucy Liu was just your average actor but she turned out to be fierce. Pretty much everyone who is in this film is ten times better than they've ever been.<br/><br/>But above all things, Kill Bill is artistic, beautiful... Perfect colors, perfect everything... gotta love it."
"Brent_P","9","284","479","6 March 2005"," Instant classic, but not for all audiences.
","I know it's a couple years late, but I had to write a review for some of the few people that haven't seen one of my favorite and refreshing I've seen over the last few years. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is yet another quality film of Tarantino's short, but distinguished list.<br/><br/>Kill Bill involves a nameless woman (Uma Thurman) who is slowing seeking revenge on her former hit squad the Viper Squad and her boss Bill (David Caradine.) Her former hit squad wronged her by gunning down her closest friends and family during her wedding and putting her into a coma while being pregnant. A few years later she awakens in a hospital, without child, and tries to track down each member of the squad. As the story progresses (through this film and the sequel), you find out who she really, why Bill wanted her dead and the fate of her daughter.<br/><br/>The movie is really a combination of Tarantino's love for the 70's over-dramatized Kung-Fu movie era and story of revenge with rich dialog. Yes, this movie is violent, but in a cheesy way. This created some controversy and really had audiences stirred up, failing to realize it was supposed to be over the top without no sense of realism. Like I said, it was supposed to be a tribute more so than a gruesome action flick. With all cheesiness aside, I can understand how some people could feel a little woozy after seeing someone lose an arm and having 4 gallons of Kool-Aid red blood shoot out of the body like a whale's blow hole. What really makes this movie is Tarantino ability to make bad to mediocre actors seem like good ones, a smart and hilarious dialog and a good storyline. Of course, this is what he does in pretty much in all of his movies.<br/><br/>There are various plot holes in the story, but we are really meant to ignore them unlike most movies. Just like the gory scenes, come to grips to the fact that the most of the implausibilities are there just to fill in the gaps of the movie. The movie also features a couple of classic Tarantino showdowns, including an unforgettable one with the Japanese infamous crime lord, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui.) Once again, Tarantino puts his imagination at work again in his story telling by using some of his old techniques like jumping timelines and some new ones like adding Japanese animation for character backgrounds.<br/><br/>I wouldn't really recommend this film to someone who is really not from the Pulp Fiction era. This film is really just homage to flicks that frequently appear on Sunday Samurai Showcase, revenge and Tarantino's continuous fascination with Uma Thurman. This film contains extreme violence and sometimes strange dialog coupled with some pretty good acting and directing. If you're not a fan of Tarantino's films, you should pass on this one because it is doesn't stray to far from his other stuff. If you like his other works, this is a must see due to its originality and quality. And, if you just don't like Tarantino himself, and find him annoying like everybody else, I don't blame you but it's still worth your while seeing."
"Rooster99","10","229","396","14 March 2005"," This movie was brilliant!
","Man, what a film. As a fan of 70's martial arts movies, it was great to see all of the references. I also thought the use of B&W throughout was extremely effective. The cartoon sequences seemed a bit much, but did fit in with the overall feel of the film. I have seen many people posting about the sheer amount of blood and guts, but you have to remember this was Tarantino's homage to Bruce Lee-era action pictures. In those movies, the stories were very similar epics of revenge, and they never had much of a budget for good ""gore"" effects. It was more or less ""throw some fake blood on the guy who just got killed"" type of effects, which were duplicated accurately by some of the deaths in this movie. The plot also followed closely the plot of most 70's Kung Fu movies; something despicable happens to the weak hero (whole village razed, family slaughtered, etc..) and the hero goes away for years to learn the secrets of a particular style of Kung Fu. All of these movies contained the ""secret move"" which the master normally does not teach, except of course, in this rare instance. That move, as depicted in Kill Bill Vol. 2, is always used on the evil leader of the clan whom had brought death and chaos to the hero.<br/><br/>Kill Bill was a terrific modern take on those movies which were always set in ancient China. I was very impressed with Uma Thurman's swordplay, at no point did I feel that it looked scripted or fake. Even when fighting against more than 50 Crazy 8's, it replicated admirably the incredibly one-sided fights from some of the best martial arts movies made 30 years ago.<br/><br/>All in all, a great and original film! R."
"davispittman","8","18","26","28 February 2018"," Well made action film
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) is a unique film. I've never seen anything quite like it. My commentary for this film is almost all positive. First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she's in. It's not just the action sequences that she is great in, she's just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn't just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she's in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman's dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they're not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I'm usually not a big fan of that, but here it works. Good job Tarantino! 8/10."
"atlasmb","7","8","10","28 April 2019"," Revenge Is Never A Straight Line
","Quentin Tarantino is certainly a cinephile's director. Many of the reviews that gut this film laud his abilities and his other works. An undeniably distinctive auteur, Tarantino is often criticized for self-indulgence, but that is what makes each of his works feel like a monument to a vision.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" feels like a schoolboy's dream about an unstoppable protagonist who faces impossible odds. Take Bruce Lee's ""Enter the Dragon"", infuse it with the stylistic sensibilities of anime, and accent it with pop culture references, especially some strong musical numbers. The result is a personal saga that is the stuff of mythology.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is the nameless protagonist who virtually rises from the dead to seek a vengeance of desolation and mutilation. A perfect blade is fashioned for her mission, and it amplifies her lethality. Thurman gives a multi-leveled performance full of emotion and cold determination. She faces some strong adversaries and their minions, and she suffers through the terrible toll of her quest.<br/><br/>Stylistically, KB plays with slo-mo, bold colors, silhouettes, and ""Crouching Tiger"" physics. Tarantino uses angles and viewpoints effortlessly.<br/><br/>In one of the film's best moments, Thurman faces off against Lucy Liu, circling to the strains of Santa Esmerelda's introduction to ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood""---one of the greatest dance tracks of all time. In a less subtle scene, she takes to the dance floor in a break-dance killing frenzy to ""Nobody But Me"" by the Human Beinz.<br/><br/>A major question for each viewer is: how much gore is too much? Tarantino never shies from depicting carnage and dismemberment. In fact, he glorifies it in this film which, for my sensibilities, is an unnecessary distraction and a tasteless extravagance. In one scene he creates a literal bloodbath (bath of blood). Consequently, this film is not for everyone."
"miro-6","3","21","33","19 October 2003"," 8.5 ?? How many people Tarantino payed for reaching that ?
","We have been waiting many years for this new Tarantino movie. It was better waiting more and get something else. How people could rate this mess 8.5? Unbelieveble. This movie seems a chinese movie from 35 years ago which has been remade using famous occidental actors. The plot is pretty cheap, banal and simple. The movie is monotonous and also a little beat boring. Based just on some sword duel (all identical) and that's it. It is not spectacular, too few crowd in the movie, nothing is new. The real vote for this movie should be 1 but, as other many times, the director of the cinematography helps the director to raise some vote more using nice games of colors and giving a nice look to a real useless filmband. I'll don't see for sure the next one (Kill Bill chapter 2). I already know that, after killing, in this one, 3 of her 5 ennemies, Mamba will kill the other 2 in the next one. Just one difference: the duel between Mamba an Bill will be longer. For that reason she killed 3 people in the first movie and just 2 in the second one. If you wanna waste 9$ and be scammed from this fake 8.5 go and gape."
"janyeap","Null","133","266","9 October 2003"," An adrenaline-driven coaster-ride through gratingly bold and captivating martial-arts extravaganza.
","Sure it's outlandishly violent and bloody. Can anyone expect Tarantino's movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker?  Of course not!  Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the '60s and '70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It's impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride's gory face as she's introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?<br/><br/>This film's a sampling of the Tarantino 'fury,' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It's almost as if I'm watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that's displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It's examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite 'old-school' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there's a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.<br/><br/>
Even at 'The House Of Blue Leaves', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill's DVAS members.'  My adrenaline's still flowing as I'm recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts. A+"
"james_a_young","3","87","171","20 October 2003"," Over-rated, incoherent and boring
","***MILD SPOILERS***<br/><br/>What a dissappointment, especially after the awesome trailer.  I had several problems with this film:<br/><br/>1)  I didn't care about any of the characters.  There was no introduction to any of them (apart from the super-violent anime section introducing Lucy Liu), so I did not understand or care about their  motivation.  Why was any of this happening?<br/><br/>2)  It lacked the dark humour of Tarantino's earlier films, especially in terms of the sparkling character dialogue (e.g. Samuel L Jackson & John Travolta in Pulp Fiction), of which there was none.  The dark moments (e.g. the rapist hospital worker) were humour free and quite sickening.<br/><br/>3)  Swapping the timelines around is an old Tarantino trick that worked brilliantly in Pulp Fiction, but added nothing to this movie except you knew the ending about 5 minutes into the film.<br/><br/>4)  I got bored.  The final battle lasts forever and becomes dull after the first few people get their limbs removed.  The scenes where Uma Thurman convinces Sonny Chiba to make her a sword add nothing but minutes to the movie.<br/><br/>Why wasn't it edited down and made into a single, complete, BETTER movie? So dissappointed."
"Wix_Moran","9","98","196","24 November 2004"," Style rules substance
","Do I think this movie is absolutely brilliant? Yes. Do I think this is the all time greatest movie ever, or even a top 50? Nope. I find the dichotomy between people who hate this movie and those that think it's the greatest film ever made is interesting. Even more interesting is the apparent split between fans of Volumes 1 and 2. Like the thread says, I think most of it's a matter of those who prefer style to substance. For my past, Volume 1 destroys Volume 2, but I concede that everyone has their own tastes and experiences and that no one pinion has any more weight than the other. Two scenes in particular really make this movie brilliant in my opinion, and both are fairly subtle in their portrayal but fascinating by their tone and the cinematic elements that come together to carry them off:<br/><br/>1.) The scene where Oren and the Crazy 88 enter the House of the Blue Leaves. Absolutely magical. The score, the pacing, the atmosphere....simply magnificent. The slow motion pull away and the obvious hierarchy of characters, Lucy Liu was absolutely made for that part and that part was made for that scene. The beautiful and menacing Gogo Yubari and the goofy 88s trailing behind. You can also feel the tension the owners feel at having such esteemed guests but one's who admittedly exude as much fear as they do respect. Add to this the nameless, faceless people dancing who are oblivious to the regality (and lethality) of Oren's entourage. <br/><br/>2.) Oren is called out by Kiddo who subsequently whacks off Sophie's arm in a highly symbolic gesture. Words can't describe how moving that scene is. The score is superb and the timing is nothing short of perfect. I especially love the way the crowd pauses after the arm slicing...like they're all stunned or still convincing themselves it rally happened...then all rush out screaming. Kiddo makes a slow, deliberate plod through the panicked crowd, a march to destiny filmed from several perspectives that combine holistically to give the segment a life of it's own.<br/><br/>One aspect of this movie that puzzles me is the emphasis it's critics make of the gore. For my part the gore was so outlandish it's hard for me to see how anyone could take it seriously, and that was part of the appeal. Buckets of blood spraying 15 feet in the air is so beyond the realm of reality how could you possibly take it seriously? For my part it was borderline comical and really brought out the flavor of the scenes, rather than being their focus. And regardless of what you think of Tarrentino as a director, the man is bar none the best at matching musical scores to a scene in the business. A few other noteworthy scenes...<br/><br/>*The end-fight between Oren and Kiddo....marvelous stuff. The backdrop of the snow and the water, the smooth silence interrupted by the fountain, again, a great accompanying score. Fine piece of film craftsmanship.<br/><br/>*Kiddo's overhead film shot while walking to the bathroom of the House of the Blue Leaves. Simply amazing. 5,6,7,8s performing live is just quirky yet proper enough to really add some depth and the unique filming make this a scene to behold."

","It has been six years since we have seen a movie from one of the world's most talked about directors, Quentin Tarantino, but the wait for me, has been worth the while. Tarantino can now add the martial arts masterpiece 'Kill Bill' to his resume, a film that left me speechless after I had seen it.  It certainly is one intense, hateful movie, containing some of the greatest sword fighting sequences ever filmed in a movie. Tarantino has made KB with class, precision and close intense attention to every detail. But, what else should we expect from a movie freak, like Quentin Tarantino?<br/><br/>An entire wedding party is slaughtered during a dress rehearsal in a rural chapel: the pregnant woman in the blood-splattered wedding dress is Black Mamba, better known as 'The Bride'. The assassin, Bill, and his circle known as 'The Vipers' leave 'TB' for dead, however she was merely comatose. Four years later, 'TB' suddenly awakes from her coma, ferociously focused on one mission, to seek revenge on her former master. One by one, she will kill the various assassins. She is saving Bill for last.<br/><br/>I am not sure where I want to start with my review of Kill Bill. I love parts of it, but then find other parts to be extremely difficult to watch. Quentin Tarantino has written and directed another powerful piece of cinema, in a way that only he could. This time we see more violence, the action and the result of that violence, with it being a bit over-powering in the end. But without the violence, KB would have not been the movie it was.<br/><br/>This time Tarantino has not focussed on the dialogue in this movie, when it came to writing its script, more he wanted to show what the characters he had created, and why they were in the position they were in. For me I can appreciate both aspects of what Tarantino shows, as he can express himself either visually or with dialogue.<br/><br/>The other part I like about KB is the way Tarantino dedicated the movie to certain aspects of cinema history. To quote Quentin he said Kill Bill is 'my yakuza movie, my samurai movie, my spaghetti western movie', and it was quite clear for me how passionate Tarantino was in showing these parts. However it was also so much more, with one of the great sections of the movie being presented in Japanese animation. I also believe that there was a clear reference to black and white movies and silent movies, as KB had these sections a few times. I also feel that Tarantino is in some way trying to show his appreciation to Pulp Fiction, the movie that made him successful, via KB. If this is true, I do not feel it is gloating, rather I give Tarantino great praise, because some movie makers ignore the movies that give them success, but not here.<br/><br/>While 'KB' has some interesting characters, none are what I would call 'likeable'. 'The Bride', aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) is a girl totally driven by the desire to get revenge. Thurman really suits her part well, as she not only looks attractive, but is really believable as this American martial arts tough girl. Helping 'TB' on her quest is Samuri sword expert Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). This character brings a very oriental feel to the movie, something I liked. The bickering with his assistant was fun to see being played out.<br/><br/>'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad' are the cruel callous people who inflict horrific harm on 'TB'. Bill (David Carradine) is their leader, a person we only hear and see in hand gestures, which is reminiscent of Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. Bill still has a very strong presence in the film, even though we never see him. Under Bill are killers like O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), whose introduction, via the Japanese Animation, was great. Under Cottonmouth is her personal assistant, lawyer and translator, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), who was present at the slaughtering of 'TB'. When 'TB' sees Sofie once again, she is pretty bitter about what Sofie let have happen to her. What we hear has happened to Sofie at the hands of 'TB', is truly unbelievable.<br/><br/>Another of Cottonmouth's women is a little girl, Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), who is more deadly than she looks. Her school girl sound and look is very interesting, while her confrontation with 'TB' highly entertaining. Then there is the evil nurse, Elle Driver, aka Californian Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), who shows very little emotion towards 'TB', other than hate. Vernita Green (Vivica A Fox) is another woman that 'TB' has on her hit list. Her demise was highly entertaining to say the least, again reminiscent of Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>All the scenes with fighting in KB are a highlight for me, especially the sword fighting, as they are so fun and intense, with the last hour of the movie purely exhausting, with the final showdown between 'TB' and Cottonmouth & co. being terrific. The middle section of film was also great, as it tells the majority of the KB Vol. 1 story, although parts are pretty disturbing.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is another film by Quentin Tarantino, where I have to say it was 'exceptionally well made'. There is a scene in Volume 1, which reminded me of 'Matrix Reloaded'. Now I have heard that Tarantino hates the Matrix franchise, and you can see what he is making a stand against, film's laden with SFX. KB is 'not guilty' of being that. The violence is very graphic in KB, but at certain times the violence was 'laughable', as it seemed to look deliberately fake. But perhaps I am wrong? Volume 1 ended at a good point, setting up the conclusion, Volume 2 beautifully. So Kill Bill: Volume 2, get here, A.S.A.P.<br/><br/>CMRS gives 'Kill Bill: Volume 1': 4.5 (Very Good - Brilliant Film)"

So why did the usa use hundred of thousands of soldiers to win the war when they could have used some one like uma thurman.

"Cocephus","Null","121","249","12 October 2003"," An Instant Classic
","`The fourth film by Quinton Tarantino', as the credits shamelessly explain, is yet another bankable classic from a director who's already changed the art with `Reservoir Dogs', `Pulp Fiction' and `Jackie Brown'.<br/><br/>From `Kill Bill's first surprising gunshot to its monumental cliffhanger ending (right up there with `Luke, I am your father'),  the movie is relentlessly intense, tearing an audience between wanting more action and wanting a cigarette to calm frayed nerves. We follow the tale of `The Bride' (played to convincing, vengeful perfection by Uma Thurman) as she sets out to murder her former colleagues, members of the `Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', and their leader, the enigmatic, faceless Bill. After attempting to leave the group of assassins for a normal life, the Bride is tracked down on her wedding day and witnesses the murder of her wedding party, right before Bill puts her in a coma. Four years later, a very angry Bride wakes up.<br/><br/>Tarantino pulls no punches, creating, as one critic put it, `The most violent film ever released by an American film distributor'. Squirting blood and flying limbs abound, but the director does it all with a breathtaking sense of style. We witness one sword-dance in silhouette, one in black and white, one over a beautifully filmed snow-covered Japanese garden, and even a sequence in Anime. `KB's story is minimal, but Tarantino's aim is style: Sergio Leone, Cheh Chang and Bruce Lee are all paid homage, and then gracefully outdone.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, primarily Japanese artists performing American styles, is haunting: Tarantino breaks form by not using well-known American classic rock (who could forget being `Stuck in the Middle' of Mr. Blonde and a helpless cop?), but by doing so sets the perfect mood of the film. They're songs we've never heard before, but feel strangely connected to.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is in two volumes. However, the end feels right, coming after an epic battle that puts `Reloaded's `Burly Brawl' to shame. `Kill Bill' is a testament to Tarantino's ability to take the craft of his idols and make it his own, mixing classic cult film style and mixing it with his own wicked sense of Cool. Not for the faint of heart or anyone looking for a `feel-good' film, but `Kill Bill' is at the very least an instant classic."

","Well,ladies and gentlemen,it's a new millennium and Quentin Tarantino has got a new movie for us. After changing the popular film landscape in the 1990's with the classics ""Reservoir Dogs"",""Pulp Fiction"",and to a much lesser extent,""Jackie Brown"",Tarantino spent a half a decade in hibernation,accompanied by little more than a television set,a movie projector,and collection of Johnny Cash records and a bong. But now he is back after a six year hiatus with ""Kill Bill"",a thrill ride with the grand style of his earlier films and a brilliant tribute to those Shaw Brothers martial arts flicks of the 1970's and the action heroes of that same decade with includs Charles Bronson,Telly Savalas,Burt Reynolds,Clint Eastwood,Fred Williamson,Steve McQueen,Jim Brown and James Coburn. ""Kill Bill"" is also a chockablock of references to bygone movies like ""Master Of The Flying Guillotine"",""The Wu"",and the television shows like ""Hattori Hanzo"". This contains many of the elements that have made his earlier films so entertaining and he continues the tradition of that to.<br/><br/>You have the wicked wit,the funky score,the hip-retro cultural artifacts and lots of non-stop,brace in your face action that is not to be missed. Also once again,he has divided the action into chapters with voiceover narrattion to boot,plus he's even got a new trick up his sleeve in which the story is told with some fancy Japanese anime. Basically the film gives much of the screen time to actress Uma Therman and she carries the film with the assurance of a golden diva that she is. The film rises and falls with her,and Thurman pulls that off beautifully in one of the best performances of the year. Thurman plays a professional assassin,attached to a criminal group of bodacious martial arts-trained killers(Vivica A. Fox,Daryl Hannah,and Lucy Liu)who are lead by the unseen,shadowy Bill(unseen in the first installment played by David Carradine). Among the crew she was called Black Mamba,but otherwise simply known as The Bride because she was betrayed on her wedding day when they gunned her down and left her and her near-term child for dead. But she gets her revenge against the ones that tried to kill her and from there the story is a thrill ride of sorts leading up to the next so expect the unexpected. However,a lot of body parts get slashed here and some of it is very gruesome includes scenes of decapitation of heads and a half a head,a leg in severely cut off and a Achilles Tendon gets slashed,a eye and some fingers get chopped off too. This film also has brought back some really good Kung-Fu stars from the 1970's which includes Sonny Chiba,aka ""The Street Fighter"",and so many more....... I'm surprised that martial arts actress Michelle Yeoh is not in this one. And by the way,what Quentin Tarantino movie wouldn't be correct without his main man Samuel L. Jackson in the role as The Organ Man. Jackson,however was in two Tarantino films including the role he should have gotten the Oscar for in ""Pulp Fiction"",which also starred Thurman and opposite Pam Grier in ""Jackie Brown"".<br/><br/>However,the film ends in a cliffhanger so we will have to wait for the next installment which will be out in early 2004. Be forewarned,this not for the kiddies,so use caution when seeing it. In all,one hellva thrill ride."
"l8apex32","1","148","317","28 October 2003"," No story to the movie
","Spoiler Alert!!! I like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The story line was strong in RD and less so in PF. PF, though, had interesting sub-plots that loosely wove together to make a good movie.<br/><br/>I also see the genius in the dialog in RD and in the characters in Pulp Fiction. I was expecting to see something in this movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Kill Bill was not interesting, nor genius and did not have a plot. Basically, the main character was screwed over in a previous time in her life and made a top 5 hit-list of people from which to extract revenge.<br/><br/>The way she extracts revenge is to engage in hand-to-hand or martial weapon on weapon combat. Of course, the protagonist wins the fights and the people are checked off the list.<br/><br/>I think Luci Liu (sp?) is the 3rd person on the list. The movie goes into a 20 minute section on how she gets a Okinawan curved sword. Now armed with the best weapon, she takes on Liu's whole team of trained martial artists - and whips them all single handedly. I'm talking 20, 30, 40 individuals who all attack her at the same time in the same room. She still wins.<br/><br/>Then, she battles the ""board leader"", and after sufficient scenery changes, she wins again.<br/><br/>Each of these battles is full of graphic violence and blood, as you'd expect from the director (I won't try to spell his name). But, you can only show an arm getting lopped off and the resulting gieser of blood so many times. Wait, my mistake, you can show it for 2 hours if you are the movie Kill Bill.<br/><br/>After the Liu's character is killed, #3 is checked off and the movie ends.<br/><br/>There is no plot. The special effects and battle scenes were state of the art, but do not make a movie.<br/><br/>I have no interest in ""Part 2"" because I have no interest in any of the characters or in more film about Uma killing people with swords. 2 hours was 1.5 hours too much.<br/><br/>Two thumbs down. Don't believe the (if any) hype."
"springsunnywinter","10","70","142","29 May 2007"," One of my most favourite films
","When I saw Kill Bill for the first time I just fell in love with the film. Kill Bill is definitely a true masterpiece with a classic story about a brutal betrayal and an epic vendetta! Four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own wedding, The Bride emerges from a coma and decides it's time for payback...with a vengeance. Casting was excellent everyone did a fantastic job in their own place, Uma was the best and no other actress could of taken her place. My favourite member of the deadly viper squad is Elle driver the one with the eye patch I also liked the tune she was whistling in the hospital, I was wondering that how did she lose her eye which was explained in Vol 2. They never showed Bill's face in the film that kept the suspense for the sequel which was a terrific idea especially for me because I never knew what the actor looked like before. The two best scenes are: <br/><br/>1. The animated sequence because it was a different story from the film's which made a suitable mood for the perspective. Overall it is the best idea ever the other two films I've seen with animated sequences are Lola Rennt a German movie & Karam an Indian movie and both of them are my all time most favourite films as well as Kill Bill.<br/><br/>2. The sword fight with the Crazy 88s just before her revenge with O-Ren-Ishi because it was so unexpected when hundreds of them jumped out of nowhere ready to fight. I thought it was going to be simple because Bill was the main target but it turned out to be more difficult.<br/><br/>The main reason why it is one of my favourite is because I'm a huge fan of revenge movies and Kill Bill gives a very deep insight of the topic e.g. Like the Old Klingon Proverb on the screen before the film which is ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" & when Hattori Hanzo said that ""Revenge is never a straight line. It's a forest and like a forest it's easy to lose your way...to get lost...to forget where you came in"". It definitely deserves to be on the IMDb top 250 and Vol 2 was also good but not better than Vol 1."
"kluseba","3","12","19","5 April 2010"," Bang! Slay! Smash! Boom! Rape! Kill! Die! - Welcome to Tarantino's new world!
","I can't understand the brilliant and positive critics all around this movie. Has anyone seen the Asian action movies which Tarantion want to honour? Or is everybody thinking that one can't give an bad review to a film that has been directed by someone who has created so well received cult movies as ""Reservoir dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" or who has been involved in ""From dusk 'til dawn""? Well, I think that the whole story of this film is just very superficial (simple story of vengeance), has many lacks of logic (as the main actress escapes from the hospital after having been in a coma)and is mostly focused on some gore effects and exaggerated fight scenes without any Asian elegance or philosophy (the almost endless fight scene around the fountain of blood). Sometimes, I think that an aggressive teenager who likes some gore and splatter horror movies and some fight movies in the key of Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jean-Claude van Damme rather that Ti Lung or David Chiang had the idea of such a movie, but not a adult who knows the whole genre and has an IQ of 160.<br/><br/>To really evaluate this film you might have seen the original Asian movies that inspired Quentin Tarantino. This kind of filming was an art for itself, while ""Kill Bill"" is just a superficial gore movie with a lot of dead people, fight scenes and wanna-be cool dialogues.<br/><br/>Give those Asian films a chance and forget about this silly opera of violence from a director who has done a few nice movies in the past and lives from its reputation..."
"shhhspeaker","1","14","23","10 August 2006"," This film isn't worth the ratings it got.
","I personally am not a fan of god-dodding, where the filmmaker creates far-fetched situations in which the main character miraculously lives through various ordeals unscathed. This film is poor in how again and again, the main character escapes not based on her spirit but because she is special and favored by the filmmaker thus automatically given passage to the next scene of the movie because of a fluke or good luck.<br/><br/>I feel Quentin Tarantino cut a side character out of the story and centered the script on someone based off of favoritism. I can see the real story taking place elsewhere as I watch this film, it is squeezed out of the script, no longer the focus. I am missing the big picture to watch this character be turned into a hero because of the filmmaker's power to get her through her trials, not her."
"uclaxlhuang","1","15","25","12 May 2005"," It's a joke
","After I finishes this one, I am thinking: this movie is produced in Hollywood? And this movie is widely praised by the American audience? This is a joke! I see many bad movies. But rarely I can find something like this: conceptually stupid, action-wise naive, and even produced with a lot of hard work!!! It's not a comic-like action movie. It looks like this movie is produced when the director has never known how to make it. Avoid this. You will find nothing inside. No emotion, No action, No inspiration, No conversation. It's just somebody doing some scratch. (I really hate to say anything more about this junk. Just to condemn it and let you guys save sometime to get movies with more meanings or more actions or more entertainings. I hope this will fill up to 10 lines for my comments.)"
"patrick_dunne","Null","46","91","15 March 2006"," Calling it ""Style-over-substance"" would be a HUGE overstatement, for it's pretentious and horrid in many ways
","I hate this movie a lot. I have been going on about it for a while, so I think it's time to take my anger out by making a review. I think I may have offended some people, and I apologize. <br/><br/>So, here it goes: ""Kill Bill"" is a very bad movie. I assume that Quentin Tarintino immediately drew in fans with ""Pulp Fiction,"" because of its wit and it was high on the ""cool"" factor. I saw some of it, and I will say that it was impressive. But, it looks like Tartintino became lazy by making this and co-directing the crappy ""Sin City.""<br/><br/>The storyline of ""Kill Bill"" is about its name. Bill attacked a woman who we know as ""The Bride."" Her name is censored when mentioned. Now, ""The Bride"" wants revenge on Bill, and members of a gang called ""The Deadly Viper Assassin Squad."" So, she goes out and finds them and attacks them. The story ends there and it doesÂ… well, sort of.<br/><br/>The story is something that was thought up in a few minutes. The Bride wants to kill people, and she does. As simple as that. ""Kill Bill Volume One"" really is just shallow characters killing each other. First, she battles some woman. I have no clue what her name is though. Then, we find some history of The Bride. After, we find that The Bride was somehow knocked out. I forgot why. When she wakes up, we experience more brutal torture of people. Then, she gets a sword and kills lots of other people. The End.<br/><br/>I find this very similar to ""Sin City."" It's a gory, shallow and pretentious action film that was made to show off a visual style and action scenes. The only real difference is that ""Sin City"" had something close to a storyline. This one didn't.<br/><br/>Supposedly, this is Tarintino's homage to martial-arts films. So, that makes it a masterpiece? That makes it get onto the Top 250 Movies? Is that why it's rated so highly? It has plenty of references to other martial-arts films. For example, Uma Thurman wears a suit that looks similar to the suit worn by Bruce Lee in one of his previous films.<br/><br/>Well, ""The Ring"" has loads of homages to horror films, including ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""Silence of the Lambs,"" and ""Poltergeist."" Where's that on the Top 250 movies? Well, the homages seem as a cover-up for the story's' weakness. Why does a bodyguard fight in a skirt? I know people get attacked in a number of outfits, but since when does a bodyguard decide to fight in a schoolgirl outfit? The anime scene is near pointless, and doesn't even look like anime! It looks more like an attempt at drawing realistically, and ends up looking pretty ugly.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because of the action. Well, there are only about two or three fight scenes, and they are only a bit exciting. There are plenty of other movies, which have better action. For example, ""Ultraviolet"" (Another bad movie) had more action than ""Kill Bill"" and a number of good fight scenes with good camera angles that gave it some flair. If that had homages to other films, would that be on the Top 250? I must say, even the action in ""The Karate Kid"" seemed to have a certain wit to it.<br/><br/>All the action in ""Kill Bill"" is meaningless. It is meant to entertain. But, with loads of blood, what fun could it be? Its fun to watch The Bride slash her way through people, but after severed limbs appear, it loses it's fun. The violence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and (I think) the violence in ""The Wild Bunch"" had purpose. But this, like ""Sin City,"" is just sick, cruel violence.<br/><br/>With that, there are PLENTY of movies with good action such as ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"" ""Princess Monoke,"" ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""The Quick and the Dead."" All of these had better storyline that ""Kill Bill"", even if ""The Quick and the Dead"" seemed a little weak in that department.<br/><br/>Backing up to horror films, I see that this film plays out like a mix of ""Scream"" and ""Hellraiser: Bloodline."" One person repeatedly tortures victims (like Pinhead) with a blade. (Like ""Scream"") Sadly, it's not as thrilling as ""Scream."" It's as thrilling as ""Hellraiser: Bloodline."" The characters are thin. I'm not talking about thin, as in skinny, but lacking detail. Sure, ""The Bride"" gives a bit of inside info on them (The ""inside info"" is showing the character killing somebody else.) but the characters usually die after that.<br/><br/>The action seems too unrealistic. Our main character kills plenty of people, but how? She jumps in the air and lands on her sword (It's stuck into the stairs.) but how does she do that? There are some movies with unrealistic action sequences (""House of Flying Daggers,"" ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") but those take place in ancient China. This takes place in a modern day setting and doesn't feel like either one of those films.<br/><br/>That's why I hate the film. I can go on and on, but why should I have to? I suppose I hate it for all these reasons. Maybe the hype killed it. Or, it could be because Dan Grant's review influenced me to hate it. Either way, I don't like it.<br/><br/>Yet, there are some good points to this movie. The action can be fun for some. I don't think torture is necessary though. The music was excellent. I liked the ""Bang Bang"" and ""Twisted Nerve"" song. I suppose it does seem interesting at parts, like when it turns into anime (even if the scene seemed pointless) or black-and-white. (But, this was already used in MANY other movies.)<br/><br/>But, it still stinks. To me, this is about as bad as ""Ultraviolet""; it's shallow and uses style to cover up its crappiness.<br/><br/>2/10"
"stefano1488","1","195","433","8 November 2003"," The problem with Tarantino
","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>First of all, let me warn you. I've always detested Tarantino, so I didnt'go see this film free of prejudice.<br/><br/>That said, I can't think of a worse film I've seen lately, except ""The Matrix Reloaded"". The reason is that Tarantino shows too much violence, and that he doesn't show anything else. ""But that's the point!"" some will say. The point of what? Ok, lets' make a film and let's show a rape and say that that's the point. Does that mean that the film is good?<br/><br/>Tarantino has always been overrated (I disliked ""Pulp Fiction"" as well). The reason is that he manages to feel unconventional and artsy, so many will feel smart by saying that he's a genius, that his films are masterpieces and all that crap. The plain truth is that he's either a sadistic voyeur or a cunning man who's found a way to make pots of money by exploiting people's naivety. Or both.<br/><br/>Although I don't like gore or black humour, I sometimes appreciate it (eg some films with Vincent Price). The point is trivial, but worth making: black humour has to be, well, humorous. The problem with Tarantino is that he's nothing. A vacuum.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have said that if you don't understand what this film is about, you just won't get it; that it's a mockery and so on. The problem is that if one treats himself to shallow, uninspired, unoriginal, uninventive films, who are shot chiefly for the purpose of using some glitzy special effects and for solvin someone's money problems for the rest of his life, you may find such a film creative or inspired, instead of just the trick it is.<br/><br/>Tarantino is in quotations. He quotes all the time. But a film full of quotations and references is a trick that is worth doing once or twice. After that, it can't hide any more the outright lack of creativity that hides behind the references.<br/><br/>If you watch a gory b-movie (or any b-movie, for that matter), you may like it, even love it, but you'd never go so far as to claim it's a work of ""art"". Tarantino is ""hip"" (for the time being), so it's fashionable to call this lame director a genius.<br/><br/>But time will tell.<br/><br/>Remember David Lynch."
"Boba_Fett1138","9","61","126","10 January 2007"," A movie of visual splendor and a mixture of styles.
","This movie is a visual experience of different styles, all combined with also some trademark Tarantino elements.<br/><br/>The movie is obviously a case of style over substance. In essence the movie is just a basic revenge flick without too much depth or meaning. This however is exactly like how Tarantino intended it to be. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is simple, straightforward, completely over-the-top but above all beautifully shot and superbly directed. The movie its story comes totally secondary, as Tarantino used this movie as an experimental tool to mix several, mostly Asian cinema, styles together and blend it into one big visual experience of violence and unusual over-the-top looking sequences. His aim was style and with that this movie most certainly does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Always when looking at a Tarantino movie, it becomes obviously that he's a big movie buff and movie lover. Tarantino really shows his love for- and pays homage to Asian cinema and especially anime. Most notably of course in the animated segment (that is great by the way) but also in almost every action/fight sequence in the movie and its violence. It gives the movie its own unique style and an overall atmosphere of 'coolness'.<br/><br/>The violence is definitely brutal and straightforward, as gallons of blood are spilled in this movie. But all of the violence is done in such a, deliberately, over-the-top and fake looking way, that it becomes entertaining, rather than shocking or stomach turning. It even becomes poetically beautiful to watch at times. The action sequences are definitely the best parts of the movie and they are well choreographed and shot. When things get too graphic the movie simple conveniently switches to black & white or turns to other creative cinematic solutions.<br/><br/>The power of this movie is definitely in its visual style and overall style of directing. The movie uses different themes throughout the movie but yet the movie manages to create one big unique identity. The movie never feels incoherent or disjointed in its style or storytelling, though it all widely differs from each other at times. I think that this is mainly thanks to Tarantino's directing, who keeps the movie and different styles all on one and the same line. Visually the movie is also definitely helped by Robert Richardson fantastic cinematography, who should at least had been rewarded with an Oscar nomination for it.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with some big name actors, though not all play a significant part in the movie yet (see ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" for that). Uma Thurman is truly superb as the Bride and I can honestly say that this is her best role out of her career. She also was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination for it. Also really superb in her role was Lucy Liu. Again, also her best role yet.<br/><br/>Not of all the trademark Tarantino elements work out well in the movie I definitely missed the typical trademark Tarantino dialog in this movie and for also for most part the trademark non-linear storytelling felled pointless and didn't really served a purpose for the story. It therefor really isn't Tarantino's best but it's definitely his most experimental and most visually orientated, style-full, splendid movie.<br/><br/>Unusual, over-the-top but strangely intriguing, entertaining and overall brilliant. Yet another Tarantino must-see!<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

There's so much that should have been cut, apart from the end fight the movie lacks pace and feels stretched. Talk about Miramax cashing in! :(<br/><br/>Unfortunately unless you're in HK you will be watching a censored version which switches to B&W in the final fight as soon as the blood starts flowing.

The kids I was with didn't even enjoy the gratutious blood or the ""really cool"" ninja action. This type of movie (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon clone) is getting really old and I wish other moviegoers would start to agree. I really can't think of too much I liked about this movie other than one side character who was particularily interesting. However, she will not be enough reason to go to see part two (I have a feeling she'll make a comeback). Quentin Tarantino is just getting worse with every movie.

","RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION hit a chord with filmgoers.  An imaginative script and fresh storytelling were a breath of fresh air in the stale environment of contemporary filmmaking.  However, what many predicted has come to pass.  Tarantino has revealed his lack of depth and world view; what was thought to be a keen insight into universal truths has turned out to be just visual glibness.<br/><br/>It has been stated that KILL BILL is an homage to the martial arts genre. If it is, it is no more useful than an homage to oil-on-velvet paintings. The martial arts genre is about NOTHING other than exotic cinematic action pretending to be treatises on honor and revenge.  Tarantino has tried to say that this is important in the grand world view of things. If revenge is the theme, then it would have been better to copy the films of Kurosawa.<br/><br/>
While Tarantino obviously has a vast knowledge of films due to his years of watching videos, he lacks as a filmmaker a world education.  Hinted at in RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION and clarified by KILL BILL is the fact that Tarantino knows very little about the world, human life, human desires, and love.  He is the outsider looking in -- looking through distorted glass -- and trying to copy what he sees.  Trying to copy (and do one better) the martial arts genre is the perfect example of someone with a very narrow cinematic vocabulary who has run out of ""words.""<br/><br/>It was extremely disappointing to see a filmmaker squander a chance at making a quantum leap in storytelling.  Instead Tarantino has returned to his lonely room and engaged in cinematic masturbation."

Most critics agree it is his worst film by a country mile.<br/><br/>I am prepared that the whole thing should be redeemed by Kill Bill 2. But this on its own, Kill Bill 1 is rated so highly on IMDb that it makes the Top 250 above films such as Butch Cassidy, Life of Brian, Annie Hall to name just three. That is because there are a lot of complete idiots out there. <br/><br/>Hopefully this will go towards redressing the balance"
"clydestuff","2","8","12","23 October 2003"," Tarantino becomes P.T. Barnum
","****possible spoilers****<br/><br/>Depending on whom you talk to, Quentin Tarantino is either a great director paying homage to as many films and film genres he can dream up in his overextended forehead, or he is an unoriginal rip-off artist who's only claim to cinematic achievement is that he puts enough violent episodes in his films to please his blood-thirsty hard core fans and keep them forever loyal.  With Kill Bill, he takes things a step further by paying homage not only to grindhouse, kung-fu and Samurai films, but also P.T. Barnum.  In other words, Quent knows there's a sucker born every minute and most of them are his loyal fans.<br/><br/>I have seen four very bad films this year: It Runs In The Family, Bad Boys II, Basic and now Kill Bill.  In Kill Bill we find out that Quent is so in love with his own directing style that he ended up totally disregarding the kind of film he was supposed to be making and instead uses his idea to try and prove how artsy and cool he still is to his adoring fans.  What is saddest of all about the whole thing is he had a good idea here, but flubs it so badly trying to be super-cool that it ends up as one over-extended mass of carnage and bloodletting that seems to go on for eternity.<br/><br/>Tarantino claims this is his fourth film.  He proudly proclaims it in the opening titles.  What he does not proclaim proudly is that this is only the first half of his film as the words Volume I are once again almost hidden in the opening title (it appears very small as vol 1) just as it was done on the web site for the film in it the subsequent tv ads and theatrical trailers.  So in actuality this is Tarantino's third and a half film, but you won't see that title card.  I guess he's not as proud splitting the film as one would think and after viewing it, that's quite understandable but more about that later.<br/><br/>Tarantino again refuses to be bounded by any type of linear story telling. Normally, that would not be a problem with me but if any film cried out for straight-forward story telling this one did.  After the opening scene of Bill putting The Bride into a coma for four years and after the credits roll, we immediately go to his first chapter which is a confrontation between The Bride and Copperhead  (Vivica A Fox). After dispensing with Fox in front of Fox's daughter Uma departs in her vehicle and as she crosses off the Copperhead's name, we see she has already crossed off the name of O-ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).  So at the beginning of the film we already know she has done away with one of her adversaries so when that battle does appear late in the first half of this film, any tension that might have been gained is completely destroyed in the first 16 minutes of the first half of Kill Bill. So much for non-linear story telling.  Though he likes to spill blood, Tarantino obviously hates any kind of suspense (which might explain his recent put-down of Hitchcock).  It gets worse.<br/><br/>From there we flashback to the church where Bill shot The Bride and where his assasins created havoc on her wedding party.  After being found still alive by a sheriff and his deputies, we then get The Bride in the hospital lying in a coma.  At this time we also get Elle Driver alias California Mountain Snake alias Daryl Hannah in a split screen dressing as a nurse, filling a syringe with poison supposedly to finish The Bride off.  It is a mission we know beforehand won't succeed so when her cell phone rings and it's Bill telling her to call it off, the whole scene becomes incredibly pointless.  It is here because Tarantino wants again to show us his coolness, storytelling be damned.<br/><br/>Soon we get more pointless Tarantino cool.  After a silly bit in the hospital where The Bride wakes up from her coma and looking to be in as good of a condition as Ali Macgraw did on her deathbed in Love Story, so much so that she is able to immediately dispense with two silly perverts. Soon, she begins talking to her toes to get them to move.  Here we get what is suppose to be a cool anime sequence, telling us the background of O-Ren Ishii who is already dead because we saw the name crossed out on The Bride's notebook, even if we haven't seen it on the screen yet.  Since we know she is dead, and we are probably going to see how she was killed soon, the whole animated sequence (and not a very good one) becomes another pointless exercise in Tarantino's ""Look at me I'm cool"" disease.  It's no wonder this film ran three hours.  The rest of the first half of his film goes on and on in much the same vain - interminably so.  Even when we near the four month intermission point we get The Bride just beginning to list her targets on her notepad, so in essence when we reach the end, we are back near the beginning again.  More cool.<br/><br/>Then there is the big fight scene where before confronting 0-Ren (who we know is already dead), The Bride must dispense with about a hundred of her comrades including a teenage girl in a catholic type school uniform.  What we get is a lot of severed limbs where everyone must have five times as much blood as the human body normally carries so Tarantino can spray it around the room like a gardener watering the lawn.  A good portion of this fight is in black and white I suppose to spare us the horror of it all.  It doesn't matter, black and white or living color, the whole bit is cartoonish and more comical than intense. The fact that Tarantino proclaimed it would be too intense and we would be unable to watch his full film in one sitting because of it is as ludicrous as the scene itself.  It must be the P.T. Barnum in him working.  If there had been some interesting swordplay, it might have been redeemable, but because it is more important to Tarantino to have his blood joke, you actually see very little of the fighting mostly due to some of the worse editing ever seen in this type of film.  As if black and white weren't enough, shortly after we get the finish of the battle completely in shadows with the lights turned off.  More Tarantino cool. More pointlessness.<br/><br/>When The Bride's fight with the already dead Lucy Liu does occur, our only curiosity is how she dispenses with her.  The scene is beautifully photographed, but the battle itself is so quick and anticlimactic we can only stare at the screen and go HUH?  Some decent one on one swordplay would have been nice here but I guess that doesn't fit in with Tarantino's scheme of putting as much blood out there as possible.  So much for paying actual homage to Samurai films.<br/><br/>Tarantino could have done what he supposedly set out to do.  Between this half of the film and the second half we'll get in February, there may have been enough to make an hour and a half or two hour film homage to the genre he claims to love.  Unfortunately, his love of himself is becoming so overwhelming, his love of showing off his filmmaking coolness interferes too much with what this film could have been and should have been.  Will his faithful followers ever be convinced that this is an overextended, two part self congratulatory two part rip off? Probably not, but Tarantino knows that.  So did P.T. Barnum."

","Over the course of approx. 12 years, Tarantino has only done one thing: take other people's ideas, mash them together, and call it his own. This is no exception. In fact, it's the best example.<br/><br/>Literally everything in this amalgam was taken (without permission) from another source. Plot points, dialogue, costumes, locations, music, even characters themselves were stolen and placed in this film. Like the movie all you want to, but it won't change the fact that this is perhaps the most unoriginal movie anybody has ever made.<br/><br/>Some day (hopefully soon), Tarantino will steal from someone who doesn't want to be stolen from, and he will be sued for every penny in his unoriginal pockets. But as for the movie itself...what can I say about it that you can't see for yourself by watching other films? Nothing. Many many many people have caught on to what Tarantino has done over and over again since 1992, and many many many people really don't appreciate it.<br/><br/>Keep this in mind if you decide to subject yourself to this horrible excuse for a film: the person who supposedly wrote pulp fiction actually wrote this. This is what that person is capable of. Someone by the name of Roger Avary wrote a vast majority (if not almost all) of pulp fiction...and True Romance...and Natural Born Killers...and perhaps even Reservoir Dogs. But it doesn't end there. In part two of kill bill, Tarantino even steals some more from Avary! It's no wonder why they aren't working together any more...and it's painfully obvious that Tarantino's movies are suffering because of it.<br/><br/>So I have a challenge to anyone and everyone in the world: name one director, besides Tarantino, who has done nothing in their entire cinematic career except steal other people's work. Name one other director, living or dead, who has created nothing on their own. I'll bet my house that you can't."

","How did this make it into the top 250 list on the IMDb. It was a very disappointing film, and this comes from a Tarantino fan. Both reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are classics of the highest order and rightfully Tarantino was recognised as a good director for these films. Yet because of the reputation he gained from these two films, anything he makes is branded a classic? <br/><br/>Jackie Brown was OK, not great but entertaining. Kill Bill doesn't even match this. Its just a load of unrealistic cartoon violence, but is branded as excellent because Tarantino himself says it is (cos he gets off on this sort of thing). The plot is terrible compared to his earlier work. To me, Vol 1 is just Tarantino cashing in. The story of the Bride could be told with just Vol.2 as this is where most of the plot lies. Vol 1 is an excuse for all involved just to make more money. Vol.2 isn't much better, but with good performances from Michael Madsen and Daryll Hannah, its at least watchable. I hereby advise you to skip Vol.1 if you still intend to watch vol.2, as you wont miss anything important or remotely entertaining."

We share an intimate appraisal of Uma's potential as a comatose sex object. We partake in every painful fumble when Uma, her legs paralyzed and her nightgown drenched in blood, drags herself to safety.<br/><br/>And it goes on and on and on: she gets buried alive, beats her fists into a bloody pulp trying to escape, then, covered in dirt, staggers across the road: a horrible mess of a woman, a mindless zombie. Funny, to be sure. But also something else.<br/><br/>All throughout both films she gets shot, stabbed, slashed and thrown across rooms with such remarkable gusto, and she slams into walls and furniture with such satisfying thuds, that you start to wonder how the hell you're supposed to maintain an attitude of ironic detachment and cool appreciation of Tarantino's kitschy aesthetic.<br/><br/>Underneath the stunning visuals, the beautiful choreography, and clever references, is the rousing lure of sadism and brutality.

","It's a measure of how far you've come in the world when you can drive around in a flaming yellow truck with ""PUSSY WAGON"" in big letters and still have all Hollywood's A-list babes begging to be in your films. It's not a good sign of how far either the entertainment industry or society has come, but let it go. Fine-tuned professional assassin The Bride (Thurman) leaves her coven of knife-wielding Girl Scouts for the white picket fence but is murdered during her wedding by her erstwhile sisterhood, on the orders of their master, silkily manipulative neo-ninja Bill (Carradine, who can't be blamed because he sold out a long time ago). Trouble is, they didn't kill her dead enough. After a long, sexually abused coma (we're only just getting started, pilgrims) she recovers and embarks on a Revenge Quest, hunting down Charlie's Fallen Angels one by one, each encounter leading her closer to putting Chilly Bill on the backyard grill. Does she have more in mind for Bill than just an evening with sharp-edged kitchen appliances? Revenge is a dish best served liquefied, however, and if The Bride triumphs over her old girlfriends (I used to hang out with these trollops? she seems to be thinking), it won't happen without spilling more blood than the Exxon Valdez had crude. This film is too contrived even to be condemned as misogynistic, with the girls's unreal slicing/dicing cutesy machismo contrasting so crazily with their meek subservience to the sedentary Bill (Tarantino might have called him Dick, but that gag's been done) that, if you buy into it, you may be so confused as to need a remedial class in Gender Stereotyping. If so, try ""An Affair to Remember"" followed by ""Tarzan & His Mate."" That this film has nothing original is an understatement akin to saying that Enron was dishonest. No longer content to just ape the budget filmmakers of the past, Tarantino now embarks on a frenetic jamfest of the old cheapies. This includes, but is not limited to: TV, chopsockey, ninja-samurai, Spaghetti Western, anime, film noir, exploitation, sexploitation, blaxploitation and cereal commercials (""Silly Rabbit!""). I'll never eat Trix nor watch Speed Racer again without the dry heaves. I also won't easily take Thurman, Liu, Basinger or Fox seriously again (can you say ""Typecast?"" Good!), despite their demonstrated talent & considerable past accomplishments. No schoolgirls lick the spilled blood off each other, so Tarantino is evidently still too uptight for lesbian vampire flicks, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" notwithstanding. And he hasn't taken a swipe at Sesame Street yet. An artist must have standards, right? (I just hope a deadly Asian swordmaiden named Cookie Munster and her lovable but dumb boyfriend Biggy Byrde aren't in our cinematic future). He still hasn't redone it all (""Truck Turner"" featured sex slavery & a lynched cat) but what he's redone is impressive, if tasteless. Unfortunately, the old cheapies were only made to give a few fast thrills in exchange for a couple of fast bucks. What charm they had, such as Isaac Hayes's glowering presence, Lee Van Cleef's steely smugness, Michelle Yeoh's sexy ferocity & Bruce Lee's matchless, butt-kicking art, was incidental--someone would have done those scripts, if they hadn't. You could take them or leave them, but ""Kill Bill"" rubs into our faces a sense that we are being honored with an interpretation of a high art form. It just isn't there. Wanna watch ""Kill Bill?"" Get a party mix of Cap'n Crunch, Count Chocula and Lucky Charms and do shooters of Jolt Cola in Quik Strawberry mix. I Dare ya! I DOUBLE Dare ya!

Whilst I'm sure that these references must satisfy those members of the audience who recognise them, they wholly fail to make up for the misery suffered by those who don't. Neither Kill Bill film has anything else to redeem it. The dialogue is woeful throughout, retaining all the style but none of the substance of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. The performances are two-dimensional and completely un-involving, although much of the blame for that must fall on Tarantino for having penned such feeble characters. Because you don't care about anyone on screen, the violence appears aimless and gratuitous. But the worst thing about these films is that the ""Tarantino"" badge seems to be enough for some to excuse these terminal flaws, where any other director would be completely torn to pieces. Those of us who believe that film-making should be about involving an audience and telling a story can only hope that the aura of infallibility that surrounds the man is dissipated rapidly after these spineless and inept films. The tragedy is that they will probably only feed the hype. Whatever the fans say, style can never survive without substance; thankfully we can be sure that this meaningless rubbish will disappear into the mists of time, and the sooner the better."

"deovalente","2","10","16","28 February 2006"," I suppose I'm probably biased.
","Yes. Biased. Biased because I think Quentin Tarantino is probably one of the most overrated directors ever.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 1 is just the latest edition in a line of many pretentious Tarantino movies. He's been considered a visionary for not making movies like everybody else makes them--but that's because he doesn't seem to care that his movies need to be realistic, believable, or have characters you become attached to. It's just scene after scene of script that didn't take very much thinking to write.<br/><br/>This movie is an example of such. The story is ridiculous. Laughable, even. It's the kind of story you'd expect from the novel rack at an airport bookstore. The dialog is even more so. Scenes are shot in the most mind-numbingly annoying way possible. Split screens and back-and-forth college-student-film cuts make several appearances. Silly gimmicks like censoring The Bride's real name have been called genius, but truthfully it's just a way to keep your brain working so you forget that the story is absolutely simple. Stupid costumes, some of the worst ever seen in a movie. The gore is pointless and boring. Some people have called this the bloodiest movie of all time, and yet I don't see it. Sure, it's bloody, but it's a boring kind of bloody. The marathon of a fight scene late in the movie featuring The Bride singlehandedly slicing and dicing a hundred or so men in Lone Ranger masks left me yawning and even getting up to get another drink; no matter how much watery blood you spray, it's not going to improve such a badly choreographed fight scene.<br/><br/>Now I've clicked the ""Spoiler Alert"" box in case this counts as a spoiler, but how can it? This movie (and the sequel, obviously) gives away the ending in the title. Bill gets killed. Subtle? Hardly. If you can really know how this movie ends and be amazed anyway, it's time to read a book or two, preferably something by a respectable storywriter and not a hack.<br/><br/>I did not hate Tarantino before seeing this movie--as a matter of fact, I had a pretty so-so opinion of him. He made movies, most of which I hadn't seen. Upon seeing this film, I purposely went back and watched other Tarantino films to see if maybe he just dropped the ball on this one. He didn't. It's the same style as the rest.<br/><br/>If you want a movie that makes you think, skip this one. Rent a Star Trek movie. I'm not even a Star Trek fan, but some of the films featuring the original cast (Shatner, Nimoy, and those other people) are better-written than this movie."

I like film to convey points of plot and character and mood and attitude through imagery and action... that's what the medium excels at, no? To have these points conveyed through narration and bad dialogue is inexcusable to me. As for the vaunted action sequences... yes, they are well done, but I found myself wanting to go home and watch all of a Leone western, or a early-70's Japanese pop-Samurai film, or ""Battle Royale,"" or one of my favorite HK action flicks, rather than Tarantino's far-too-short pastiches of same. I so desperately want this film to bomb at the box office. If this travesty spawns imitators, I'm packing it in and bidding farewell to multiplex cinema. On a positive note, Uma was enjoyable in the lead and Lucy Liu made a fine villainess. It was great to see Sonny Chiba on the big screen, also."

","******Spoilers*****and a lot of them too****<br/><br/>Since I am not a brainwashed cult follower of Quentin I was able to actually see the movie before rating it as the best thing ever made.<br/><br/>
The first minutes were incredible, and I was having the time of my life. Opening scene in black and white bloodied Uma, then fade to black, melancholy music, fading out to perfection, suburbia (toys in yard, nice pretty house) then we have a funny as hell chick fight which is made all the better by a little kid that just stays there.. and says nothing. Basically the imagery is great and sets a mood. Then we have a flashback to the wedding, followed by a hospital scene giving some background of what just happened. And it ends. <br/><br/>The moment you see black mamba telling her big toe to move while the camera repeats this a few times, you have a problem. The first thing you realize in the frames after we finally stop zooming on the toes, is that well, this is nothing more than a Charlie's Angels rip. Concept and idea. Ok there is still time for salvation right? Not really. Because then comes an anime scene that has no purpose at all, and unless you are an anime fan, it will simply suck. Lots of animated blood, still motion drawings and all other things we have seen in countless anime toons on cartoon network come to life. You can safely skip it, not like something valuable will occur. Which is the problem with this whole movie. It has no coherence. You can watch it at any point and not miss a thing. But it gets worse. <br/><br/>Next on the murder list is the same girl we saw in the anime scene, and she is in Japan. So Black Mamba goes to Japan, and what follows for the other half of the movie is mindless kung fu that is bad, a lot of stupid time wasting moments of Japanese people speaking Japanese wise words, which are translated in annoying captions. Actually that would have been a nice touch, but they literally NEVER end. Japanese. Subtititles. More useless preaching. Wise men advice. Captions. Japanese. Captions. Repeat.<br/><br/>
Although it is basically badly executed kung fu, even it suffers from some pretty obvious faults. Booze drinking schoolgirl uniform wearing underage female guard? Come on. And just to mention the tie wearing, sword swinging guards (samurai?) that just keep on coming. Please its a parody. A pathetic attempt to mix the infamous Japanese gangs of the 80s and 90s with ancient kung fu and traditions. At least that's the best I could make of it.<br/><br/>
I am not going to guess what that movie was trying to be because it clearly had no point. It started great, it fell apart in about 2 minutes. Literally 2 minutes and that is even sadder. <br/><br/>Save your time, watch the first thirty minutes, then go rent a real kung fu flick to fill in the rest."
"ginger_sonny","Null","45","93","13 September 2004"," Uma Thurman will....Kill Bill
","Uma Thurman is the avenging angel in this long-awaited fourth film from Quentin Tarantino. Intense gory martial arts action <br/><br/>Crime boss O'Ren-Ishii (Liu) paces the gallery of the House Of Blue Leaves, watching her subordinates take on The Bride (Thurman), a samurai-sword wielding blonde dressed in a natty, blood-stained yellow tracksuit. As The Bride disembowels and decapitates a dozen yakuza flunkies, pausing only to rip out the eye of one assailant to uncork another plume of blood, one wonders: what does all this mean for feminism? <br/><br/>The first volume of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill sees women stalk one another as remorselessly as Sergio Leone's nameless gunfighters. Men hardly get a look in. The face of the titular Bill is concealed from us throughout. In place of machismo, we have a ferocious femininity - the snarl of a mother protecting her child. A different strain of aggression drives this action movie, maternal yet predatory. Tarantino riffs on this with his opening fight where the Bride and Vernita Green (Fox) break off from their knife duel when Green's daughter returns from school. <br/><br/>The Bride is after vengeance. After taking a beating at the hands of her former colleagues from the The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, the final bullet to her head is delivered by Bill, who also happens to be father of the unborn child. Waking from a four-year long coma, the Bride clutches at her empty womb and unleashes a feral howl. It is a searing moment from Thurman, who showed up to work on the film only two months after giving birth. What does this mean for feminism? Hard to say, except perhaps that hell hath no fury like a heavily pregnant woman gunned down on her wedding day. <br/><br/>A self-conscious interweaving of numerous exploitation genres - in this volume, the influence of Japanese samurai movies and the ultra violence of Takeshi Miike (Ichi The Killer) are particularly strong - unfortunately one also thinks of McG's Charlie's Angels films. Superficially, at least. What with all these kick-ass chicks and Lucy Liu strutting her stuff. In fact, Kill Bill is the anti-Charlie's Angels. It is a deliberate riposte to the cartoon kung fu, lukewarm Matrix leftovers, and shoddy CGI - what Tarantino dismisses as all that ""computer game bullshit"" - that Hollywood has been dallying with while the director was away. Where McG's franchise speeds you through its incompetence, Tarantino dawdles to shade in more characterisation, to fill in back story, to embellish every inch of the plot before marking it with a signature flourish. The director of the 90s is back and he might as well have signed the right hand corner of every frame.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, he is so brimming with ideas and ambition that his film had to cut in two to meet the needs of distributors. Miramax took this course of action rather than edit their one-time wunderkind. An unsympathetic studio might have trimmed the extended anime sequence about O'Ren-Ishii's troubled childhood, for example, although this is an intense treat depicting events almost too agonizing and heartbreaking to witness in live action.<br/><br/>Kill Bill arrives at a moment in mainstream movies - between the second and third Matrix films, before the final part of The Lord Of The Rings trilogy, ahead of another bloated Harry Potter installment - where Hollywood is willing to test the bladder strength and patience of its audience like never before. Whether it is the fashion for director's cuts or DVD deleted scenes, it is a contemporary truism that art is best served if the excised portions are restored. With this spirit in mind, the dividing of Tarantino's epic into two volumes may be seen as a victory for integrity. However, cynics may suggest that numerous installments mean punters shelling out more times for the same film, both in the cinemas and again for the various extended DVD editions. <br/><br/>Whichever way you want to slice it, this is only half a film. Though it contains many pleasures - and it's great to see such an influential director returning with such a stylistically exuberant work - it is missing the classic satisfying element of any story: an ending. <br/><br/>Verdict A blood-stained love letter to exploitation movies that seems to be missing a few pages."

","I'm a fan of QT and much admire his earlier films, but sorry sports fans, Kill Bill is a tedious piece of junk. That Tarantino planned at one point to release both ""volumes"" as one three-hour film is astonishing. After the first hundred severed limbs, I couldn't stop yawning. With its inexorable cartoon violence; the predictable BS posturing of virtually every major character; and the obvious trajectory of its threadbare plot, Bill is technically flawless, emotionally antiseptic, and dramatically dormant. Clearly, QT has spent himself.  To be fair, Reservoir Dogs was a masterpiece; Pulp Fiction, audacious and brilliant...tick tock tick tock... Then Jackie Brown, a nice adaptation, but hardly earth shaking.  And now comes Bill, which owes everything to cheesy, grade-C, 1970s Japanese fight-flicks.  Buckets of blood and meat-grinding mayhem do not of themselves make for scintillating cinema.  The trick that eludes Tarantino is how to keep the viewers' attention while he attempts a hybrid of Seven Samauri and the World Wrestling Federation.  The sensual aspects alone should have been enough to sustain interest, but no.  Ultimately, Bill becomes an exercise in fever-pitched tedium.  Perfecting the cinematic equivalent of crap is hardly an achievement, no matter how well-crafted the montages."

","What puzzles me is not the film itself, but the popularity such a piece of non-cinema has risen in this country and elsewhere. The very same plot was already very successfully approached in 1968, by Francois Truffaut, in his 'The Bride Wore Black'. The difference being that, at that time, there really was a story, there really was suspense, and whoever the characters, they all seemed human. In other words, they had FEELINGS. Tarantino seems so much hypnotized by style, that unless you're not a movie-freak, there is no way in which you can't keep on noticing references after references of a superficially exploited collection of stylish movements (mangas, comic strips, Samurai movies, pop culture, watered down atmospheres specific to such or such director, etc.)<br/><br/>This time, his only apparent goal is how to overwhelm the viewer under a shower of violence and ox-blood No storyline whatsoever, no purpose, no way to identify ourselves with any of the characters, except for Bill's, the only one who seems to have some sort of emotions, and who incidentally is a psychopath (any contradiction here?)<br/><br/>After viewing it, mostly in fast forward mode during those endless figures of sword combats, I asked myself what kind of irreconcilable trauma poor Quent must have suffered in his youth  And again, the targets of his spurs of most sadistic creativity are either women, gays, colored people, or figures of authority (I let you decide which belongs to which in his 3 previous movies). After having had to swallow the exhibitionist and sadistic stances of a New-Born Hollywood shark, here we are again, force-fed with hardly digestible matter and wondering what could be the next step Hard-core porn, real rapes, real mutilations (how much would an actor take to accept to have a limb actually severed in front of the camera?), feces, children's sacrifice??? Besides, the level of language - mostly sarcasms and insults  is in total contradiction with the argument of the movie that 'revenge is a dish that must be eaten cold', thus dispassionately. I really invite you to watch Truffaut's version and a real contribution to breaking taboos or at least, to allowing us to reflect on tricky matters such as vengeance.<br/><br/>Sadly, Tarantino only talks about Tarantino, and about his obvious failure in processing his personal loads of hostility towards the world or God only knows what else. Pathetic and, even more dangerously, totally deprived of any sense of humor. To be discarded Quentin, you are perverting the very purpose of the 7th Art Will that be your last film? In the meanwhile, you are fired Next, please!"

The movie seems to play as a spoof and I wished it was at times so that I could laugh along with the grotesque display of constant dismemberments, beheadings and occasional disembowelments I was watching.  However there is little comical about this film.  It decides to focus on things such as raping women in comas, a pre-teen girl killing a man while she's having sex with him, a little girl being dowsed in her mother's blood (and another little girl watching her mother die in a knife fight) as well as the good old 'sword chopping off the top of a head to expose brain' shot.  At least Tarantino didn't use the slowly falling apart body/head cliché.  A memorable laugh getter from the audience is from a women writhing in pain on the floor after her arm is severed.  She is seen in the background of numerous shots in a pool of her blood, much like Mr. Orange in `Reservoir Dogs'.  Nobody laughs at Mr. Orange's predicament because you feel for the character and the situation he's in, however the woman in `Kill Bill' got an awkward chuckle from the audience do to the nonsense that was being experienced.<br/><br/>The movie is chocked full of horrific images that have no purpose but to move the numbingly simplistic plot towards the next gory visual explosion.

","Quentin Tarantino has made some great movies, most of which are highly over rated. So this fits the bill perfectly, ho ho ho. Virtually every scene has the usual cheese soaked dialogue, the macho one liners, the stereotypical characters; including my favourite - the Japanese school girl assassin! Oh the sheer mundane, cheesy crap of it makes me want to hurl. I'm really not sure what Tarantino was on when he made this but it surely must have been hallucinogenic and must have caused brain damage. This movie sucked. The absolutely comic amount of severed limbs, heads and fountains of blood were like something out of a bad B movie horror from the mid 80s. Virtually every character has been lifted, no scratch that, STOLEN from anime movies.

First off - anime mixed in with real actors is not a new idea so that's one more idea that QT robbed. Then we get the oh so original 'black and white' moment where an entire fight scene, one which contained so many fountains of blood they should have been swimming at the end, suddenly losses colour then for no apparent reason comes back? I mean really Mr Tarantino what was the point? You used to make decent movies but frankly I think in this one you were just seeing how many dumb ideas you could put into a movie without people noticing. Do yourself a favour QT and go back to the drawing board. Mr Tarantino has proved himself far, far better than this and frankly it is a waste of a perfectly good budget to produce something this awful.<br/><br/>So why did I give it a 3 and not a 0? Well there were a few good moments, the plot was relatively interesting, the soundtrack went from great to annoying and, lets face it, you've got to give it a couple of points simply for the sheer amount of blood and violence for no reason other than the director had got a load of fake blood on the cheap.<br/><br/>If you like this movie you need your head examining since it is by far the worst movie I have seen all year."

"BrandtSponseller","6","23","44","18 May 2004"," Tarantino's Worst Film To Date
","Before you jump to any conclusions after reading the title of my review, let me clear a couple things up. One, I usually love Tarantino--his directing, writing, the films he's produced, etc.--and two, the reason I didn't like Kill Bill Volume 1 had nothing to do with not liking the fight scenes or violence/gore. I love that stuff and that's the only part of the film that I found even mildly entertaining.<br/><br/>Instead, the problem with Kill Bill Volume 1 is that it is extremely boring, almost completely lacks suspense, has awful pacing, and makes a number of self-indulgent stylistic missteps. <br/><br/>I say ""almost completely lacks suspense"" only because of the first, relatively short section, where Uma Thurman's character, a former ""hitperson"", fights with another of the same kind, played by Vivica A. Fox. Suspense arises here because we don't know who the characters are yet, we don't know anything about the plot, we don't know what their motives are, etc. There is a sense of venturing into the unknown, where anything could happen.<br/><br/>However, after this, Tarantino chooses to cling too tightly to his beloved device of non-sequential story construction, and the bulk of the film concerns Uma Thurman's attempt to take down a character whom we already know she has killed. That saps all of the tension from the rest of the film and makes it plod along as a fulfillment of something we're already aware of. It has all the drama of listening to your spouse tell _that_ story for the fiftieth time, this instantiation being filled with enough detail to take up an hour or two, and you're trying to read a book while they're telling it.<br/><br/>Yes, Tarantino references tens of other films and genres in a ""homage"" that geeky fanboys can have a party game with--the one who names the most receives a free graphic novel and a case of Hawaiian Punch. Who cares? That in itself doesn't make Kill Bill a good story any more than a pointless clipfest of those films would make a good story. There is a reason that DVD's consisting only of promotional trailers aren't usually bestsellers.<br/><br/>Yes, there are some interesting shots and intriguingly blocked scenes in Kill Bill. However, there aren't enough of them to make the film succeed if looked at merely as a series of images rather than a story.<br/><br/>And yes, as I mentioned, I thought the over-the-top violence/gore was entertaining. If looked at isolated from its context, Quentin almost outdoes Sam Raimi ala Evil Dead here. However, and this is a big however due to having to consider context, Raimi's gallons of blood worked much better-because they were in an engaging, suspenseful story. In Kill Bill, the violence was almost boring.<br/><br/>In an effort to be ""retro hip"", Tarantino includes a number of elements that blend with the film as seamlessly as President Bush in an Iraqi mosque. These are ubiquitous and varied, ranging from the stilted dialogue in the kitchen scene near the beginning (and this coming from someone who usually writes brilliant dialogue), to the strained inclusion of Sonny Chiba, to the ridiculous presence of a female Japanese band who can't sing or play their instruments--even though they're only trying to play I-IV-V ""rockabilly"" (and by the way, if this is what Tarantino think counts as quality music, what was he doing as a judge on American Idol?), to the almost obligatory occurrence of an anime scene. The latter is there just because Quentin and the fanboys think it's cool. For me, however, it underscores both the problem with most anime and with Kill Bill--yes, the subject matter, the violence, the attitude, etc. are interesting, but the animation, the storytelling, the pacing, and just about everything else sucks, and there are a number of inexplicable stylistic choices (such as the Caucasian-looking, big-eyed characters in anime). 'Forced' is probably the best way to describe the plethora of references and stylistic decisions in Kill Bill. Even the foot fetish stuff didn't work for me this time around, and I share the fetish with Tarantino. <br/><br/>I'm not usually one to recommend tempering self-indulgence, and I suppose it doesn't matter anyway, since at this point people are going to love Tarantino films just because they're Tarantino, although if this film were made by anyone else, it would have earned the reputation of the 1998 Jeremiah Chechik-directed The Avengers instead. But if this is a sign of the quality to come, if Quentin is going to make further films that amount to laundry lists of all the stuff he likes _just because he likes it_, like a mega-budget mix-tape for a new girlfriend, I'm not watching any longer."

Then, honestly see if you don't say Kill Bill is simply a poor copy of truly gritty cinema. Hell, QT even got Woo Ping, probably the best stunt choreographer of all time, thats why the fight scenes are so good, in essence he copied everything from the best of Asian cinema, except a good story. Liking Kill Bill is like liking frozen pizza, then one day going to Italy and tasting the real deal, big difference. I have seen all the movies I mentioned, and each surpasses Kill Bill in violence, story, choreography, or all three, people are heaping undue praise on QT. Real creativity is watching 'Hidden Fortress' then making 'Star Wars', but that was in a galaxy far,far, away. Hollywood nowadays is ""the asians have a movie called Ringu, I hear its scary"" ""well let's copy it for America"" ""Ringu 2?"" ""copy that too!"" ""Ju-on"" ""copy!!"", and the zombie moviegoers are none the wiser. Want to see an AMAZING movie? City Of God, its what QT wished he could have made.

","I'm a Tarantino fan. KB1 stinks. Empty dialogue, weak characters, weak plot, tedious fight scenes are the reasons. The yellow suit the Bride wears was ugly. The seemingly endless shot of her toes was boring. The fight scenes were bloody but without any ingenuity, just being faster than the opponent. Many many other Asian martial arts films are much more clever and fun even though they are subtitled such the Blind Swordsman series. The out of sequence flashback approach was confusing and unnecessary. The chapter title and narration slowed up the movie as well. This movie was not a satire, not a homage, not camp, and broke no new ground. Several repulsive ideas in the film including slaughtering a mother in front of her child, sex with a comatose woman, and (GoGo)stabbing a man for no particular reason.

"Cyaneyed","1","16","29","19 October 2003"," Not nearly enough blood.
","My initial reaction upon finding out about ""Kill Bill"" was largely disappointment (""aren't martial arts films just boring, repetitive fight scenes tied together with a silly story of heroes striving to uphold a sub-human 'code of honour'?""). but I hoped that somehow, Tarantino's wit, visual flair, and 'Escher-like' story construction would shine through.<br/><br/>Having seen the movie, I find that two out of those three aspects of Tarantino's genius survived, but unfortunately the story is utterly stupid (and for me, it doesn't cut it to say ""but it was supposed to be stupid""). OK, he puts it into the blender, so that the plot unfolds in a non-linear order, but this doesn't add a damn thing to ""Kill Bill"" because there's no complexity.  The non-linearity becomes little more than a ""Hey look at me, aren't I cool?"" gimmick.  [For instance, does it make a blind bit of difference that the deaths of (1) and (2) are shown in the wrong order? In fact, wouldn't it have made somewhat more sense for Uma to interchange (1) and (2), and Quentin to show them in the correct order?]<br/><br/>Kill Bill has its moments.  There's plenty of originality (notwithstanding the barrage of clever references to golden oldies that so inspired QT) and humour (mostly visual, but some funny lines and events, too) and some of the most exciting, spectacular fight sequences ever - for me, the sword vs mace duel was the best of them.  The way it's shot, you really feel the impacts, and get a strong sense of the way death, or at least horrific injury, is the immediate outcome of the slightest mistake - this is true for all the fights.<br/><br/>Sadly though, the whole film is pretty much like watching someone play a computer game - a nerdy kid who for a semester has spent all his lunch money on the latest arcade and now wants to impress his peers (and the girls) showing them he can beat it.  That's the bottom line.<br/><br/>This film sort-of defies any attempt at rating it in the usual sense, but I'll venture to suggest it deserves 5/10."

Only revenge and bloodlust can connect the chaos into something more congruous.<br/><br/>For example, do we need anime movies? in a film? do they add anything to he meaning and pleasure to watch?

Just like the vampires in ""From Dusk till Dawn"", there are things in Kill Bill that are not connected to anything shown before and do not add anything what is seen after. What the scenes give is only... blood, and the possibility for Uma to show what she had learned in the kung-fu school.<br/><br/>I think it is a total crap, unless seeing liters and liter of blood gives you any kind of satisfaction.

","There are two things that stand out about this movie.  One is that it is the epitome of gratuitus violence and is only for those that want to sacrifice story for gory special effects. The second important point is that the movie was deliberately chopped in half in order to cash in on those drooling gore seekers that are too ignorant to realize they are being had.

And essentially (in the view of this reviewer) not only created one of the best films of all time but essentially defined his own career by setting a bar so high that even his own future work could not equal it.<br/><br/>And there you have it.

","I'll admit being a die hard fan of Tarantino I had a somewhat blinkered view of what this film would be like. However, my obsession was not dissapointed.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what effect Tarantino has on his girl friday Uma Thurman, but there is something dramatically different in her performances in his films than in any others. Thurman in this film is enigmatic from start to finish!<br/><br/>The plot loosely is, although I am expecting more twists and turns in the second installment, that Uma Thurman is left for dead by her colleagues, a deadly group of assasins, working for somebody called Bill and Charlie's angels they aren't! Thurman is in a coma for four years, in which she supposedly looses her unborn child, and when she wakes up she is looking for revenge. She makes a list of these people and when she has killed them crosses them off her list.<br/><br/>From the start to the finish this film shocks. And yes extreme violence is not that shocking these days as it is old hat, however, Tarantino does something a little bit more. It will sound very disturbing, but it is the creativity of the violence which makes it memorable. Like for instance the scene in the hospital when the man is about to rape the comatosed Thurman. As an audience we know that Thurman, anticipating the mans actions, will not just lay there and think of England, and will react with some sort of violence. However, I didn't think that she would tear his tongue off with her teeth.<br/><br/>The film is Tarantino's usual hip and slick self. Whilst with all of his films there will be bitching about the violence. I think that the film in its self is so compelling and atmospheric, that the violence in a way blends in. Like with Resevoir Dogs, much was made about the scene of ear cutting. However, I wonder had Michael Marsden not been so compelling to watch as an actor and the song stuck in the middle with you wasn't playing in the background, would the scene have been so memorable.<br/><br/>Speaking of acting, although Thurman has been mentioned, the ensemble cast were all very good too. I am especially looking forward the showdown with Daryl Hannah's character and Uma's.<br/><br/>Although at first it took me a little while to adjust to not seeing Tarantino's trade mark hipper than hip gansters replaced by kung foo, I still could see Tarrantino all over this film, and although some may complain about the two part thing, it did what it set out to do, left me wanting more."
"mr.slut","1","31","63","21 October 2003"," Amazingly boring piece of crap
","Oh my! Tarantino really lost it this time. RESERVOIR DOGS was his only really good film in my book, PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN were enjoyable but rather derivative. Let's face it! If you know your b-movie history there is hardly anything original or challenging in an Tarantino movie. KILL BILL is even more annoying, as it is really boring and tame compared with the movies it rips of. Give me the original 70s Sonny Chiba films, anything by Chang Cheh or Lui Chia-Liang any day. Hell, even the Flying Guillotine. The SAMURAI FICTION sequence replacing the red background with simply a blue one was the most annoying one for me. I never believes Uma Thurman to be capable of the things she does in the movie. I won't bore you with all the plot holes this movie has. Unbelievably sloppy in any way. And the music (f*cking panflute music of Zamphir, get me the hell out of here!). This, my friends, is no labor of love, this is not even a good puzzle of hommages to other (more capable) filmmakers.

","It's a real shame that people are so easily led astray. Kill Bill was the movie equivalent of of a Sean Combs song. Nothing original, just ""samples"" that attempt to draw similar feelings that the viewers/listeners may have felt when they first saw/heard the subject matter. The real shame is that when I look back at the other Tarantino ""classics"" that I genuinely enjoyed before I find that by and large they suffer from a similar malady. The main difference is that the other three films at least have compelling dialog and some attempt at subtext. Kill Bill was the kind of mindless schlock that I can generally avoid since I stopped watching predictable action cartoons when I was 12. It was particularly sad to see the ham-fisted attempts to create interest in its characters. The way in which Tarantino practically clubs us over the head with the fact that we don't know Thurman's character's name, for instance, seems particularly amateurish when compared with David Fincher's handling of the same sort of device in Fight Club where, if it weren't for the scene where Helen Bonham Carter's character brings it up, you could watch the movie multiple times and probably not notice that you never learn the main character's name. My advice to movie viewers everywhere is that rather than watch a movie that is a remake or ""homage"" to another movie or genre of movies, just watch the originals. They are almost always better, anyway."

"extravaluejotter","1","26","52","9 January 2007"," Kill Geek
","I'm so glad that I didn't go to the cinema to see ""Kill Bill"". I mean, I should like Quentin Tarantino's films. I thought that ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Jackie Brown"" were superb and I sort of liked ""Pulp Fiction"". Tarantino hadn't done much for a while before ""Kill Bill"" so there was a high level of expectation before the film's release.<br/><br/>What put me off the cinema release was the ""Volume One"" tag. I didn't want to pay to sit through a film that I wasn't going to like and that only took me halfway through the story. Now that the film has made it to TV in the UK, I'm disappointed to tell you that my suspicions were correct.<br/><br/>Major problem: Kill Bill Filler - (1) The faux anime sequence that gives you the back story of Lucy Liu's character. Presumably the budget wouldn't stretch to having piece done by a real Japanese anime studio, so we get some American guy's version of what he thinks anime should look like. Wrong. Just to pile on the disappointment, it's predictable and pointless, a complete waste of screen time. (2) Tarantino also drags us back to the blood-drenched chapel too many times. OK, The Bride's been left for dead by a bunch of murderers, Quentin. We've got that. Can we move on please? (3) The Bride emerging from her coma, la la, drone drone, sexual perversion, violence, drag drag, shuffle shuffle, more violence, pimp my ride, drag drag, wiggle your toe, yawn, wake me up when it's over. I'm not sure how long all this filler guff goes on for but I knew that I'd been watching for ALMOST 2 HOURS OH GOD THE PAIN by the time the credits rolled.<br/><br/>The action sequences are impressively staged but are too ""stagey"" to be exciting. In particular, the showdown with the Crazy 88 gang plays out like the climax of a TV Batman episode. The bride deals with wave upon wave of sword-wielding goons before reaching the ""Boss Level"" and despatching Lucy Liu's character in a couple of minutes. After watching a Japanese schoolgirl and the entire Tokyo Branch of the Reservoir Dogs Fan Club line up to get slaughtered, I was expecting something more interesting and involving. <br/><br/>Tarantino's dialogue is well written and well observed, and he has a knack for creating fully-formed characters in short order. Unfortunately in ""Kill Bill"" he has eschewed the intelligent side of his film making skills in favour of crude splatter, pointless-endless violence and more cheap TV/film references than you can throw a katana at. This is what happens when you let a film geek loose with a big budget and carte-blanche. It's one of the few times that I've wished the Hollywood Suits had reined in a writer/director. ""Kill Bill""? More like ""Overkill, Bill"". You'll have to look elsewhere to see a good example of Quentin Tarantino's talent.<br/><br/>Finally, there's the issue of the supposedly Star Trek Klingon proverb used in the opening titles. (A) ""Revenge is a dish which is best served cold"" is used in ""Star Trek II"" by Khan, a genetically-engineered human renegade, not by a Klingon. (B) the phrase ""La vengeance est un plat qui se mange froid"" was originally coined by Pierre Ambroise Francois Choderios de LaClos in his classic novel, ""Les Liasons Dangereuses"". If you're going to use an over-quoted phrase, Quentin, at least acknowledge the correct author."

A lot of it is based on people reverentially pulling swords out of sheaths and then pushing them back in, and similar ripponese mummery.

She gets beat up, then she kills the second person, then she kills the first person then you wait for Kill Bill Vol. II to see the part of the story between when she gets beat up and when she kills the first person? The trailer for Kill Bill must have been made before they cut the film into two parts because it had more scenes for Kill Bill Vol. II than for Kill Bill.<br/><br/>

In Pulp Fiction I cared about the characters and the story; all that was of interest here is how would Tarantino spectacularly present the next decapitation or dismemberment.

What really concerned me was the messages that lay at the core of the film- I'll comment on a couple. <br/><br/>The entire storyline is a glorification of sadomasochistic violence by and against women, usually of an either totally or heavily implied sexual nature. The film is absolutely riddled with it. Bill even says as much in the opening scene, while 'executing' the bride. It's no coincidence that the Bride holds hostage and mutilates another woman instead of the 88 male Yakuzas. When the Bride fights other women, both are usually portrayed as gratuitously enjoying the violence. Most horrifically, this is repeatedly extended to children. Who thought that a sixteen year old murderess being decapitated was a pleasant image? Or the image of her stabbing a man to death with the crushingly bad line 'now i have penetrated you'? The film actually praised the violence inherent in the plot- especially the murder of the mother in front of her daughter. Thurmann's performance was as a piece of drama unspeakably poor, it's fairly clear that all the above was intended to appeal exclusively in a sexual way to a male audience. The film runs like a bad and extremely disturbing porn movie, if that's what QT intended, he should have been more clear about it, and not disguised it as a real film. <br/><br/>Almost as worrying in my mind is the portrayal of the Japanese culture that the film was intended to convey. Instead of focusing on the often stunningly beautiful, delicate and precise background setting- the true Japan- the film dredges up uninspiring wartime stereotypes. All the Japanese fall into one of two camps- a handful are portrayed in as near to a positive light as Kill Bill manages- like the Okinawan Sword smith or 'Charlie Brown'- but these are seen as weak willed cowards. The Sword maker is actually praised for giving up his renunciation of violence. By far the majority of the Japanese, however, are portrayed as sadistic, violent, bigoted, mindless, incompetent murderous thugs, with precious little differentiation between them. The most beautiful irony of all is that many of them are played as being racist!!!<br/><br/>By the way, I'm a practitioner of Kendo, Japanese fencing. Whatever they were doing had NOTHING to do with martial arts. A sad reflection on Hollywood's cultural concepts; and a tragic corruption in the anti-violent philosophy of Kendo and other martial arts, and an unforgivable betrayal of the Japanese who participated in the film.<br/><br/>Someone on IMDb commented that the film was comic.

Tarantino just makes a pathetic attempt at copying those films, trying to recover the aura of genious that he earned with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and later lost with all his other films. There's plenty of gimmicks in this one to spare:  amputated limbs and decapitations that quickly become hilarious, anime thrown in for no reason, a final battle in black and white, and Tarantino's trademark of non-linear storytelling... take away that, and quite frankly, you will be left with not much more."

(The second volume, which contains very little fighting, is terrific).<br/><br/>One reviewer on IMDb wrote that a good martial arts scene makes you wish it would keep going on. For instance, you could watch 3 hours of one continuous Jackie Chan fight scene and never get tired. I would add that another quality is that is stimulates the little, imaginative, childish nerve in all of us and makes us want to do martial arts. This movie had neither quality. The fight scenes were embarrassing--I was cringing, waiting for them to end. They looked ugly and absurd.<br/><br/>There was, however, some kind of strange, perverse beauty in how quickly the Bride could kill. Had Q.T. focused on that, he could have compressed this into about 20 minutes, and combined both movies. There was no real plot, and the dialogue was horrendous, so compression could only help.<br/><br/>Not only were the fight scenes choreographed badly, they were filmed badly as well. The battle with the crazy 88s: Too many people on the screen, poor camera work, and then Q.T. makes it even harder to see whats going on with stupid tricks, like going black and white.<br/><br/>An English professor of mine gave me some wise advice, saying ""A good artist knows what to leave out."" Too many things should have been left out because they had no point, and did not move the plot. For instance, the Bride sitting on airplanes and people driving places filmed in what I suppose was meant to be an ""artsy"" way added 20+ minutes to the film.

Plus I think the guy is totally tasteless - he's a professional, he should know better than to talk trash on high-profile films just to bring attention to himself. sad sad sad!"

","Boring. Predictable. Derivative. Clunky. Self-conscious. Overly stylized. The monologues were neither cute nor meaningful. It's as if Tarantino's only goal in life is to be ""cool"" and clever by paying homage to his favorite movies. He's a third-rate Jean-Luc Godard ripping off Sergio Leone with Sam Peckinpah bloodstains all over his hands. I never thought it possible he could come up with something worse than Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but he did. You have to hand it to him, though, he gives the masses what they want a la Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Peter Jackson and all the other PT Barnums of the motion picture industry."

","Having enjoyed Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown, I really looked forward to seeing this film. To say that I was disappointed with it is the understatement of the year.<br/><br/>The main reasons I loved Tarantino's previous efforts are the fast moving story-lines, the slick, witty dialogue and the feeling that you are seeing something stamped with the mark of a unique and talented film-maker. None of these appear to be present in Kill Bill. Instead, all we have is a slow-paced killing spree adorned with some of the most pretentious film-directorship I've ever seen.<br/><br/>There are so many arty, slow-motion, knife-wielding scenes that it is hard to stay awake through the boredom; the worst of which sees Thurman slaying about a hundred people in a never-ending scene that is so pretentious and self-indulgent as to defy belief.<br/><br/>If this was Tarantino's first high-budget effort it would have flopped spectacularly. He seems to be on one big ego trip and he has sacrificed everything; engaging characters; entertaining dialogue and compelling story-line, in order to achieve something that he hopes will appear cool. Fortunately for Quentin, there are probably enough people in the world who are shallow and insecure enough to pretend to like this film just because it's cool to like it. In that respect, these kind of people and this kind of film are meant for each other. I just hope I never encounter any more in my life."

","I never thought a Tarantino film could be boring.  He has proven me wrong. Having read about the subject matter of Kill Bill I had my reservations from the onset, but a friend rightly pointed out that unless viewed, a film has not been given a fair shake. Indeed.  After having fulfilled my ""duty"" I can say without blinking an eye that I will not watch Volume 2 of this massive, self-indulgent bore.  <br/><br/>I am neither squeamish nor a novice to Hong-Kong chop-sokey, Japanese martial arts films, the oeuvre of Kinji Fukasaku or any of the multitude of 70's genre films and B-offerings.  Maybe that is the reason I could hardly stay awake.  Obviously many critics will heap praise on Kill Bill and maybe even write books about how it carries a pop-culture angst drenched subtext, blabbering effusively about the genius of filmdom's premier geek.  If this is sufficient for them, so be it.<br/><br/>The moment I heard Herrmann's famously tormented theme from Twisted Nerve I knew trouble was coming.  If you take away the gore, the fighting, the ridiculously presented code of the warrior and the escalatingly embarrassing pop-culture references (""Trix is for kids"" - good grief, that's supposed to be clever and funny?) we are left with nothing more than a grinning Tarantino who knows very well that he has pulled yet another one over most everyone's eyes.<br/><br/>Steve Oedekirk's ""Kung Pow: Enter the Fist"" was a funnier and more cohesive experiment along the same lines, demonstrating how one may hit its targets while being way over the top without ever taking itself seriously.  And from the looks and feel of it I'd venture to say that Oedekirk actually understands his source material ten times better than Tarantino ever will. That spells trouble for a filmgeek whose only forte is recycling old genres and splicing together portions of his favourite films to the point where he actually resorts to directing entire sequences - and more than a few - to original scores written for other movies.<br/><br/>As much as I loved Pulp Fiction, I have to say that this emperor has no clothes.  Tarantino is a one-trick pony whose act has worn thin."

KILL BILL offers nothing that wasn't done better in Japanese film series like SLEEPY EYES OF DEATH, SON OF BLACK MASS, or LADY SNOWBLOOD.

If they could have been merged into one film it would be the perfect combination of mystery, mythology, and exposition.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman was nominated for a Golden Globe as ""The Bride,"" a woman who seeks revenge against the group of assassins, of whom she was once a member, who turned her wedding rehearsal into a bloodbath, killing everybody else in the wedding chapel and putting her into a coma for four years and having her awaken to an empty womb - she looked about eight months pregnant when Bill shot her. In volume one, although all five of the people involved in the massacre are on The Bride's hit list, she only kills two of them.The Bride goes after Vivica Fox's now-married housewife and mother, and Lucy Liu's Yakuza boss, which requires a trip to Japan. Tarantino pays homage to Japanese samurai films and Hong Kong martial arts films to make an entertaining story with excellent editing and soundtrack. A perfect start to what's to be expected in Vol. 2., which is where all of the backstories appear.<br/><br/>If you walk away from both parts one and two wondering if there is any symbolism in there, is what you thought you saw what you really saw, and what on earth does that last scene mean?...consider yourself in good company. And my only spoiler, why didn't Lucy Liu's character want to kill Bill as much as Uma Thurman's did? That is, if what you think you see implied in part one is indeed true.<br/><br/>This is Tarantino's best as far as I'm concerned.

Flash garbage is still garbage and this lot is not worth viewing even out of morbid curiosity as to how bad a once good director has become. For all his ability - brilliantly realised in Pulp Fiction and to a lesser extent Jackie Brown - Tarantino is evidently lacking in judgement and possessed of the ego that will blunder ahead straight into catastrophes like this. It's hard to say where this director can go now.

","I was looking forward to seeing ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1,"" as I had enjoyed ""Pulp Fiction"" and I had heard good things about the movie.  I heard it was extremely violent, but I've never really been one to be upset by blood flow. Now, having seen the movie, I can look back see that the violence was merely a cover for the lack of plot and the lack of just about everything else.<br/><br/>I'll start off by relating the good characteristics of this film (of which, however, there are very few).  The movie is extremely stylistic, and some of the well-choreographed violence is worth seeing.  The lighting and the black-and-white sequences are also well-used and well-placed, respectively. Some of the music, I felt, was also fitting, but it irks me that they took some of it from mastermind Ennio Morricone.<br/><br/>However, this film becomes almost a mockery of film in general.  Tarantino believes in sleight-of-hand, and he is very good at using it.  The fight scenes, are, as I said, very stylistic, and an unrealistic amount of blood spurts everywhere in different scenes.  Yet there is so much red and there are so many ridiculous situations, that the viewer tends to forget that there is very little plot to be found anywhere in the movie.  Also, good acting goes by the wayside, and I believe it an outrage that Thurman won or was nominated for any award for her performance.  The biggest disappointment, however, was the screenplay.  While ""Pulp Fiction"" contained violence, it did not distract anything from the brilliant and entertaining dialogue.  ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" does just the opposite.  The use of violence tries to distract from the screenplay, which is inept in the first place. The dialogue is minimal and childish. <br/><br/>All in all, Tarantino has failed.  I may see Vol. 2 to see if the movie redeems itself, but he'll have to correct many of his mistakes.  However, I have forgotten to mention till now that there is one ""chapter"" in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" that reminded me of Tarantino's talent: Chapter Four: The Man from Okinawa. This scene alone manages to redeem the movie, along with some good stylish segments.  I said above that Tarantino failed, but failure for him is an average movie by anyone else's standards.<br/><br/>Final Grade: C."

I couldn't believe how sloppy this film is, I noticed about 20 mistakes in the first 15 minutes alone.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are way to OTT and very very unrealistic. Uma Thurman seems to play some sort of superwoman with ever-lasting stamina. Her moves look silly and her facial expression doesn't seem to change throughout the whole thing. The fight with Gogo is freaky and full of mistakes. The blades come out the ball she is wielding at the touch of a button on the handle, but I don't see how that could happen since there were no wires going through the chains to make this mechanism possible. Also, since when did getting hit in the side of the head by a two-by-four, with nails in, make a person cry blood?

Certainly it is the only one which sticks in my mind with such a particular distaste.<br/><br/>Tarantino takes unique aspects of some great cult movies, cuts them up, and mashes them blindly and carelessly together into a pathetic ill-fitting jigsaw. All attempts at making these into amusing parodies of originals fail, and in my case, left me writhing in my seat fighting the urge not to run out of the cinema pulling out my hair, screaming. The movie takes itself far too seriously to achieve being a good satire.<br/><br/>Possibly the most annoying element of the movie, and the subsequent one, is Tarantino's onanistic worshiping of Uma. It sickens me to the gut the lengths he goes to in brainwashing the audience with his fetish. Keep it to yourself, Quentin.<br/><br/>Finally, I add, would people stop praising the man for being a genius. He is far from it. I enjoyed Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but these are not enough to make a man a genius. Hundreds of directors have made a 'couple' of good movies.

Intelligent plot and humor, very good acting, characters with depth, and I could go on, were all missing. The whole movie was a big cliché.

Avery's own Killing Zoe, circa 1994 is testament to his brilliance, while Tarantino's own Kill Bill is sadly telling.<br/><br/>As my 11 year old puts it, ""it's one of those movies that you see, you go 'wow' a couple of times, you go 'that's really stupid a bunch of times' and then you quickly forget about it after seeing it."""

I don't object to bloody scenes being shown in a film, provided that they serve some purpose in the plot, and they do not constitute the film's purpose instead (as it happens here).<br/><br/>In brief, I find Tarantino completely overrated; what's more, in this film he goes way too low even by his standards.

"Juni78ukr","4","8","13","30 September 2004"," A gory disappointment from Tarantino
","Note: I haven't seen vol.2 yet.<br/><br/>I'm definitely not an admirer of Tarantino's works but I'm always trying to see all major Hollywood movies and expected something better than that gory disaster. The story here is terribly weak and primitive, like an adaptation of a poor comic book with lots of plot holes and all connection with reality are entirely lost in Kill Bill. Assassin woman seeks revenge and almost everyone she meets gets killed. Nobody cares about characters; they are only decorations for Bride's long way of revenge. We see them, after a while they get killed and soon we forget about them. There is no point denying that Tarantino has his own style and he wants to amaze an audience but I think this time he went too far. Some scenes (like a woman, who couldn't move her toes after all things she has done) only make me laugh from their stupidity and absurdity. However that's not all. Maybe something is wrong with me but I found many parts of the movie too disgusting, even taking into account Tarantino's standards. I don't see in the movie any reasons for that or any author's philosophy or intention which makes any sense. Unfortunately the movie simply looks like one very long brutal bloody fight scene with short, silly and predictable dialog additions, which are mostly intended to excite young teens. These scenes are too stylized with nothing particularly original or extraordinary in them. In Japan Bride is fighting against dozens of opponents but only few of them are actually moving and fighting. The rest of them are waiting for something, perhaps for the short moment when they must appear in front of camera and after a short fight get killed. Until that short moment of glory they are nothing more than decoration. Such choreography could be enough for a cheap eastern action flick but not for a movie that pretends for much better. Hand-to hand fights are much better and sometimes are able to impress but there is also a strong feeling of surrealism and even of somewhat that looks like attractive from inside but inwardly shallow and empty. <br/><br/>As I already mentioned vol. 1 is an extremely brutal and gory movie. Somewhere in the middle of the movie I realized that there is nothing else in Kill Bill besides endless violence. I guess that the reason for splitting Kill Bill into two movies was that more than three hours of non-stop over the top violence would be too much even for his fans. If such a movie came from any other director I believe it got NC-17 rating but it's obvious that for Tarantino there are no rules or limits so there is nothing surprising that it had only R rating. Only for one of the most memorable sequences in the movie the anime sequence it deserves NC-17. Besides its ultra violent style the parents can find some moral problems with Kill Bill so I have to warn all parents that this ""acclaimed"" movie must stay away from your children as far as it possible. Despite the director's statements about awards for Uma Turman, who played the main character I didn't find anything exception about the acting in the movie. Actually too often there was no room for acting behind fight scenes and short dialog. <br/><br/>I was not only truly disappointed about wasting my time and money but also I got a negative experience which I will be glad to forget."

","Kill Bill is a fun movie to look at but I have to ultimately agree with those who said it lacks whatever I would personally call substance. I haven't seen the second part so perhaps that might mitigate it somewhat but still I think this film was disappointing on a lot of levels.<br/><br/>The story is a pretty basic revenge story  a bride (Uma Thurman) is shot and left for dead on her wedding day and she seeks revenge on criminal mastermind ""Bill"" (David Carradine, whose face is never seen)and his cohorts for the crime. The story is told in Tarantino's usual back-and-forth style, for no apparent reason in this case (just as the film switches from color to black and white in the finale and back again for no apparent reason. Maybe QT thought that would keep the scene from growing stale, but it does so regardless). The bulk of the story of this first installment deals with her chase after the unlikely Japanese mafia lord (lady?) O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). This character is so unlikely that we are treated to something like 20 minutes of footage to explain her origins. The animation is interesting but the scene where she slaughters a rival yakuza when he complains about her being part-Chinese feels forced would that scene even be in the movie if Liu had not been cast in the part? Probably the film's strongest area, as mentioned above, is the visuals. This film has the density of a graphic novel. Unfortunately even this aspect becomes forced, as for example in the finale when we have that 5 minutes or so of black and white footage, and then we have the Liu character fleeing into a frosty landscape garden, seemingly for no other reason than to provide a new and different setting for the climactic battle. At the very least though it's interesting to note that few action films conclude with a battle between two female warriors.<br/><br/>Another part of the film that feels dull is what seems like an entire reel devoted to the making of a sword, a part of the film that feels inserted to give the film a sense of spirituality. Much of this sequence is subtitled which adds to the sense that we are supposed to feel this is an ""important"" part of the film.<br/><br/>All my feelings about this film -- its effectiveness but at the same time its lack of originality and purpose -- could be summed up by the way they use Ennio Morricone's music in this film. First we have Daryl Hannah marching down a hospital hallway in a kind of nurse outfit with an eyepatch. She's supposed to be whistling this Morricone type tune, but it just does not look right. The effect is humorous where it's probably supposed to be frightening. Then at the film's climactic battle we're treated to the strains of Morricone's ""Death Rides a Horse."" It's an awesome song, awesome soundtrack.... only problem being it's ALREADY the soundtrack to a revenge film with John Philip Law. So when I first saw the film in the theater, I was distracted by memories of that film.<br/><br/>There is a lot here to appreciate, particularly the slick visuals. There's also a fairly effective combination of action and humor. I'm curious to see the second part, but I wasn't curious enough to actually see it in the theater after seeing this one. I'm disappointed overall.... I don't know if I should call myself a ""Tarantino fan"" but I have seen all his movies since ""Pulp Fiction"" in the theater and I enjoyed them. This one felt a bit flat, particularly because it was a step backward into a less story-oriented, more goofy and showy, style of film-making like what he was doing with ""PF"". All of the violence in ""PF"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" however had a feeling of brutality that made it feel real despite the offbeat humor in the films. But in ""Kill Bill"" we reach the point of excess where the action itself becomes ridiculous and pointless, particularly in the ludicrous finale where this barbie doll type woman kills something like 50 armed men at the same time. A good director like Tarantino should be able to come up with better and more original ideas than he has done here."

I'm not trying to be racist here, but I do feel that Japanese movies lack a sense of dramaticism or storyline that actually makes someone think. Rather, it's just endless bloodshed with a story that's out of the line. Well, Quentin Tarantino (one of my least favorite directors) is paying homage to that. Not so much to pay homage to.<br/><br/>I saw this movie through the DVD. I've seen the rave reviews it received and even trusted Ebert and Roeper's review, and I decided to see what all the craze was about. Once I pop it in, it begins with a noirish sense of black and white mood. As the film progresses, it combines Japanese anime and real filming, which I thought was pretty interesting and amazing at the same time. It was though-provoking and very classy, and I enjoyed that part. But then, it just got into endless violence and fake blood actions. One by one, Uma Thurman hacks away at the bad guys and they lose their limbs and body parts, screaming in the most comedic ways. Instead of feeling a sense of sadness for those who died, I actually laughed and pointed at the baddies. Story was pretty simple. It was just a story about a woman who wants revenge against those who betrayed her, in which she made an enemy's list. She goes on a rampage, slicing anyone in her path.<br/><br/>I kid you not, Uma Thurman surprisingly freaked me out when she played ""The Bride."" Who in the right mind would want to meet a woman who can slice you up in any second? She was clever and skilled, and she practically killed anyone in her way, even innocent bystanders. I actually felt scared by the seriousness of her character and was frightened by the actress herself. Very well in acting, I have to admit. All were professionally done.<br/><br/>Alright, the only parts in the movie that actually got my nerve was the simple corniness of the film. The bad-guys were honestly horrible actors and they just screamed in the most funniest ways. The cartoony feel was purposely made by QT in order to make it feel as if it was a comic book, but I didn't feel that premise going on. Instead I felt a movie with just the cheesiest amount of blood ever. I was obviously disgusted at how much this movie showed blood. It was simply a gorefest rather than a movie itself.<br/><br/>I believed this film did have its awesome moments, but all in all, it was just average, and I couldn't see the reason why it was so raved about. But once again, all in all, that's my opinion, not yours."

","Vanity projects are usually made by people who, after receiving a lot of praise and support for their work, want to make something that is personal to them and therefore don't really care what anyone thinks of it in the process (usually because they wrongly believe that people will still eat it up due to the artist behind the project rather than the art itself). Sadly, this often means that they are terrible in every sense of the word, due to a lack of quality control. Due to a poor storyline, no character development and a lot of sadistic violence, this film is no exception to this rule.<br/><br/>The story is that a woman only known as The Bride has been left in a coma after her old assassin posse knocked her unconscious and killed mostly everyone at her wedding day, including her husband to be and, potentially, her unborn daughter. After awakening from this coma, she seeks bloody revenge against them, killing them one by one. While the story is a simple revenge plot, it becomes overly convoluted as Tarintino adopts a non- linear structure to the film, but unlike his previous films that had a similar structure, some parts of the film lack context to the events on screen, and you feel very lost, as if there was a previous instalment to this that you missed.<br/><br/>The rest of the writing is equally inept. None of the characters are very developed, and it is hard to care about anyone because of it. There are also a lot of plot holes throughout the story as well, including how the police never bother showing up despite the violent murders that the Bride commits (I.e killing a doctor but never bothering to hide his body, killing a mother in front of her own daughter, the massacre in the Japanese restaurant at the end) or how Lucy Liu got to the head of the Yazuka (the Japanese mafia) despite having awful bodyguards and fighting skills that are adequate at best. The fact that there are many pointless scenes here as well don't help as they often slow down the story and bore you, mainly the animated scene.<br/><br/>Another major problem is how casually the film wallows in its sadistic violence. People are decapitated, eyes are pulled out, people see their families murdered and limps are often cut off. However the violence isn't displayed in an OTT manner, but rather in a more serious way with people screaming in agony and wriggling around like worms when their legs are chopped off. That isn't fun violence but rather deeply unpleasant and needless carnage. It strikes me as odd how the game Manhunt (released at a similar time) is yelled at for being too violent, but no-one bats an eye at this, despite it being perhaps worse, as unlike Manhunt it lacks any context and is just sadism for sadism's sake. Sadism also extends to other areas as well, like a doctor who rapes comatose patients and a guy getting his head slammed into a door for information. It's utterly grotesque and while not morally bankrupt like Natural Born Killers is per say, still makes you feel dirty after seeing it.<br/><br/>There are some good things here to though, mainly that of the production design. Sets are gorgeous and are beautifully shot, and the HD version I saw makes them feel more alive and colourful. The soundtrack by Wu-Tang Clan rapper RZA is great too, and compliments the Asain influences of the film very well. The acting is also quite good, with all actors giving much better performances than the film deserves.<br/><br/>Sadly however, those good things don't make a whole, as the film's flaws completely sink it, due to poor storytelling, characters and handling of violence, becoming sadistic for the sake of it. It is because of this that I would find it very hard to recommend Kill Bill to anyone, except die hard Tarantino fans and adolescents nitwits who don't know any better. Tarantino is a great filmmaker, and he can do so much better than this slock, but thanks to a complete lack of scrutiny and quality control, he wastes his talent on self indulgent vanity projects like this. Critics and audiences many continue to dump praise onto this based on the goodwill Tarantino earned through his early work, but the awfulness of work like this demonstrates that goodwill doesn't excuse dreadful dreck. Avoid at all costs."

"xjuggernaughtx","3","6","9","6 September 2005"," Not really worth watching for interesting reasons
","I don't really understand the point of this movie. You can say all you want about slick film-making style and post-modern commentary on exploitation films of the 70's, but it still doesn't disguise that this film has not one ounce of originality.<br/><br/>It doesn't comment on the movies it parodies in any significant way, it just sort of copies them in an exaggerated fashion. Imagine, if you will, taking Leatherface, from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, making him ten feet tall. Now imagine that every time he touches something with his chainsaw, gallons of blood spurt out. And instead of four or five kids, there are twenty. Kill Bill is kind of like this. It's action scenes aren't funny, or exciting, or insightful. They are just over the top. At no time did I ever think ""Wow, that was cool!"" Occasionally, we get an interesting plot deviation and this is where the movie usually picks up for a bit, but then, unfortunately, it never follows up and we get back into the revenge plot. This plot just leads from one lifeless action scene to the next.<br/><br/>Now, one thing I hate is a martial arts movie with poor martial arts. This isn't the worst that I have ever seen, but it's pretty uninspiring. I don't know what kind of background Uma Thurman has, but she generally looks lost in the fights. Instead of a exciting, kinetic experience, it looks as if you are watching the half speed rehearsals.<br/><br/>Even Tarantino's famed dialogue fails here. There are very good moments (mostly in Kill Bill 2), but mostly it falls flat because it is constrained by what he is trying to do. The revenge plot dialogue is just too cheesy, and once again, not in a good way. It just seems stilted and uninteresting. Eye-rollingly bad at points. Especially the ""Silly Rabbit"" line during Lucy Lui's fight scene.<br/><br/>One thing you can't argue with, however, is the technique. This film is a masterwork of lighting and camera work. Set design, costuming, and sound design are all top notch. Really good choice in color. This film is great to watch with the sound turned off just to study the picture.<br/><br/>I would suggest that people watch this movie at least once, just because it is in the popular culture. But don't expect Pulp Fiction. It's more like the Fourth Room, without Tim Roth."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** So now we know why the fourth film from Quentin Tarantino had to become the fourth and fifth films from Quentin Tarantino.  He said that a 3 hour grindhouse kung fu movie would be pretentious.  Well, yes, but only because what you've started with is pretentious to begin with!  In this first hour and a half, so little happens it's unbelievable.  I can't believe that he couldn't have got it down to a decent running time.<br/><br/>I'd have been willing to take Uma Thurman's escape from the hospital as read, but Quentin has to show us her wiggling her big toe for minutes on end.  We spend ages watching people get places - Uma's journey to track down O-Ren Ishii, for example, which takes AGES.  There's a scene with a Texan sheriff which does nothing.  We get a lengthy part-animated introduction to O-Ren Ishii, a character who we already know is going to be dead soon anyway.  The use of animation is inspired, I admit, but I just don't care about the story it shows.  What else?  Well, the whole Sonny Chiba sequence is superfluous.  Again, I'd have been quite happy for her just to get a sword from somewhere.  I don't need this man to argue about coffee. Although I did enjoy some of the dialogue (`I'm not bald, I just shaved my head.')<br/><br/>So, OK, he's written too much.  But, annoyingly, he's directed too much as well.  Quentin has always stood on a knife-edge when it comes to over-directing, but here he tumbles over it.  Every time the Bride sees someone she wants to kill, the Star Trek klaxon starts blaring, which is irritating.  Also, her name gets blurred every time someone says it, which is just silly.  David Carradine's hands give a great performance, which is slightly tiresome.  He tells the story out of order (as always) and you can sort of see why.  But just occasionally, it hinders rather than helps. Were we supposed to see O-Ren Ishii's name already crossed out on that list? And the Pussy Wagon gets a laugh, sure, but would have got a better one is we first saw it when Uma first sees it.  And as for the fight...<br/><br/>Oh, let's get to the big fight sequence now.  Hyped beyond belief, this is Uma Thurman battling 88 people, or something.  Could have been great. Isn't.  I still like it better than Matrix Reloaded's so-called burly brawl, because there's no annoying CGI here.  But after a while, I realised I'd zoned out.  It just wasn't doing it for me.  Partly because he decided to switch to black-and-white, which is just pointless.  And partly because...<br/><br/>Well, there's two issues here.  One is that I have never seen a so-called grindhouse kung fu movie.  I have no idea what tradition he is reprising. I only know who Sonny Chiba is through True Romance.  So this movie is not, can not be, targeted at me.<br/><br/>The other issue is about violence.  There's just too much of it.  And I don't often say that.  But it loses any effect after a while.  It becomes boring.  And it occasionally becomes distasteful.  When Gogo (?) gets whammed in the head with a plank of wood with a nail through it, her death is lovingly filmed.  He's savouring it.  Whether it's different because these are women isn't an argument I'm going to get into right now, frankly. But when it comes to violence, QT has always been master of implication (the ear-severing) and of the short, sharp shock (Marvin's death).  He almost entirely abandons these in Kill Bill for grand guignol lopping off of limbs.<br/><br/>It doesn't work.  His geysers of blood and chopped-off arms only remind me of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, while Lucy Liu's death...oh dear.  I found Ray Liotta's scenes at the end of Hannibal to be hilariously bad, and our sighting of O-Ren Ishii's brain at the end of this film pretty much tops even that.<br/><br/>Back to distastefulness.  The pregnant Bride is beaten up, shot and put into a coma for 4 years, waking to find her baby gone.  I think that's enough. But no, she has to have been raped continuously for 4 years too.  This is another superfluous sequence.  I could have stood it if it hadn't been treated almost as an amusing aside.  One rapist is killed by having his tongue bitten off in a comical way.  The other has his head banged in a door.  These people, especially Buck, are as sick and evil as the Viper Squad, if not more so, yet she hardly seems bothered about it.<br/><br/>So what keeps it from instant 1/10 status? Well, it's a Quentin Tarantino movie.  And he's still got it.  Not all the time, far from it.  But there are a fair few moments that remind me of glory days.  Actually, what with the excellent use of split-screen and cameras passing over the set walls, they remind me most of Brian De Palma circa Snake Eyes, but that's not a criticism.  The film starts promisingly with my favourite scene, Uma Thurman versus Vivica A Fox.  The gun in the cereal is a classic Tarantino moment. There are memorable motifs like the Pussy Wagon, and Uma's Bruce Lee-aping tracksuit.  Lucy Liu isn't far off from being a revelation, and it's nice to see Daryl Hannah resurrected in a role not a million miles away from her Bladerunner days.<br/><br/>So have I given up on Quentin Tarantino?  No.  Not quite.  I'll wait till his next film (sorry - his one but next film, I doubt I'll bother will Volume 2).  Because I think this is just something he's been needing to get out of his system.  He's always wanted to make this movie, and now he has. Well done.  If he doesn't now move on and make some movies I want to see, rather than movies Quentin Tarantino (or Clarence Worley) wants to see, then he and I will say bye-bye."

","Ok well i went to see this movie the day after it came out. im sorry to say it was one of the worst movies since the master of disguise. im sorry but the only thing worse then computer generated fight scenes are unrealistic ones. the fight seen in which she comes for Lucy Lui and had to battle her ""entourage"" made me want to walk out. it was one of the worst fight scenes i had seen since the matrix reloaded. now the blood i also found incredibly stupid. when u stab sumone u dont bleed like that nor is it cool to make sumone appear to bleed that way. Now the fight seen with Vivica was very good up until the part where she shot out of the cereal box. Uma was so dead it wasnt even funny, then she magically pulls a knife out of nowhere and kills her right as her daughter walks in. But through all of this i could have lived, but the part of the movie that made me want to throw my extra large bucket of popcorn at the screen was the scene in the ""pussy wagon"" in which she insisted on ""moving her big toe."" now i dont care who you are u cannot go from a coma to a fully functional body in a day much less a few hours. Now for my respect of Quentin I' going to lay off the idiotic idea of adding the rape scene in. All comments aside the fight scene with her and Lucy was one of my favorites ever. the head being chopped off was in no way to much. Quentin i feel ya on wanting to ""branch out"" but u went a little too extreme on this one."

","Kill Bill is about a woman seeking revenge against a group of assassins who violently murder everyone at her wedding, which she herself only just manages to survive. <br/><br/>That's it. <br/><br/>Beyond that simple sentence lie no finer nuances or greater subplots in this contextually simplistic yarn. We know next to nothing about 'The Bride' (with her real name beeped out for no apparent reason, because that would be just too much information), her own history, why her wedding party was targeted or who the mysterious 'Bill' is. <br/><br/>Now admittedly this is the opening of a two parter film, but even so, to completely strip away the context in which the Bride carries out her actions leaves the film and its central character cold and devoid of any real emotional attachment. It's a bit like finishing the Fellowship of the Ring with no idea why Frodo and Sam are heading for Mt. Doom, how they began their journey or who they even are - only that they've got a list of enemies they have to dispatch along the way.<br/><br/>At around an hour and 45 minutes, there's certainly no shortage of time in which this could have been achieved (or even the whole affair concluded in full). Instead Tarantino opts for long and drawn-out fighting scenes in which arms, legs and all manner of body parts are chopped off in quick succession. Whilst these scenes are staged with precision and considerable skill, there is no sense of urgency or any question as to what the final outcome will be; we know the Bride will walk away victorious, her 'revenge' partially accomplished, but that isn't enough to carry a film alone.<br/><br/>And so, we descend into a Tarantino-esque swamp of film references and homages, weaving a world which is completely unbelievable, but so self-serious it prevents you from enjoying it as a light-hearted adventure. After the film moves over to Japan, we enter a realm in which an army of crime minions lack guns and are defeated by a single individual, people carry swords openly on planes, and teenagers act as highly trained bodyguards to senior crime bosses. Whilst there's nothing wrong with creating this kind of fictitious universe, it is highly jarring after the environmental realism which characterises the American portion of the movie, and leaves you feeling like Tarantino is simply treating Japan as a semi-mythical fantasy land where he can indulge his love of mindless violence.<br/><br/>But when all the fighting is over, and the film draws to a close with a half-hearted attempt at a cliff-hanger, I felt as if I had travelled nowhere, felt nothing and ultimately seen nothing. The few precious moments in which blood isn't gushing out are spent in pointless and prolonged conversations about nothing, an interlude before the film can get back to more scenes of raw violence. I know this film is based around the theme of revenge, an irrational feeling if there ever was one, but that should be no excuse to create cardboard cut-out characters acting out a movie with no greater plot other than to kill each and every person who stands in your way."

As if seeing fountains of blood spurting out of people's bodies was a beautiful sight... Sigh, it seems to me that we are back to the roman times with people cheering as the martyrs were being fed to the lions.<br/><br/>So what of the cinematographic skills of Tarantino? Well, yes, I too detected some reuse of master's techniques. I heard the spaghetti western music and saw its very very close-up shots. I got the De Palma's split screen, and the Carrie scene all covered with blood. Even the big fight scene had been done before in one of the Zatoichi's movies. And there were a few others too, but really, what's the point of going on and on? On one hand, we have a pretty simple plot (I am not going to go over that here, others have done it very well) and on the other a director with a vision made up of the great masters ideas. OK, Tarantino does know how to direct a movie, and some of his use of the great masters influence is acceptable, but... here I thought it was just too much. Combined with an overly simple story and an excessive level of violence, his overuse of others grand ideas becomes just that, a succession of tricks.

(2001)- Shrek (2001)- Spy Kids (2001)- Swordfish (2001)- And may others (Even the deludental Lara Croft or Charlie's Angels are any way much better than Kill Bill Zeeman from Saint John wrote:""Tarantino is a genius... another masterpiece"" How this user can say that? The plot is as simple as a 3rd world movie and the duels seem slow and banal after what we saw in The Matrix or Crouching Tiger. I guess that all those people have been to the movie theatre very rarely in the last 5 years. This movie is just an empty stupid movie based on some blood splashing and some visual effects which make `Blade' a visual masterpiece in the confrontation. (Apologising for my bad english I suggest : `Don't let the advertising push you to waste your time and money'"

","The first half is OK, but chapters in Japan are purely awful. Judging from the high rating of this film, I must conclude that non-Japanese audience didn't find absurdity in Uma's and Lucy's Japanese or unrealistic sword fighting scenes. My 3-year-old nephew speaks much better Japanese than those two actresses. Their pronunciation was so bad that they sounded like mentally ill.<br/><br/>In Japan, TV is showing much more authentic sword fight scenes almost everyday.  Uma looks quite weak.  No authenticity in her.<br/><br/>All in all, worse than Pearl Harbor. There's nothing wrong with an American who doesn't know enough about Japanese culture or language.  But it's different when he makes a movie about it.  I'm sure American people will find it offensive when a foreign filmmaker who doesn't know much about western or cowboy makes a non-authentic western film."

","Spoilers Well, what can I say I would give this movie 4 out of 10 straight up. I thought the idea of uncompromising revenge was excellent BUT there are so many ridiculous scenes that were so overdone it just became a joke. For example the end scene between lucy liu and Uma was so stupid I laughed it was absurd. Tarantino was obviously trying to be artistic but it is as CLEAR AS DAY that he overdid it - wake up people - there are some very stupid people with no sense who gave this 10 out of 10 PLEASE!!!<br/><br/>In all the interviews and making of this film they went on about how brilliant the action scenes were and how amazing Uma was - come on people they were pathetic - the fight scenes were s**t - apart from the one with the blue background that was pretty cool the rest of them were - absolute crap. The very first scene was so silly I lost all respect for the film immediately.<br/><br/>BUT ABOVE ALL the single worst scene was the very end fight with lucy liu - not only was it not very good as a fight scene - the over the top silent staring that went on for so long was so overdone it became what can only be described as a joke. Here is a tip ladies and gentlemen - you know an action scene is good when at the end you feel ""ahh I wish that had been longer"" but at the end of the kill bill vol 1 final fight with Lucy Liu I couldn't help but feel thank god that painful crap is finished. <br/><br/>lol I just thought of another hilarious scene the one where Uma is on the plane writing her little revenge list that was the most corny stupid dumbass idea ever I actually burst out laughing when I saw that - that was just the final straw.<br/><br/>I bet the majority of people who gave this 10 out of 10 were silly little women who are blinded to how crap it is because they are so desperate to have a good movie with the lead badass as a woman - I bet if it was not a woman in the lead they would see it for what it is - very disappointing. And believe me this is coming from someone who is a fan of Tarantino.<br/><br/>Now for the use of black and white one word for you ladies and gents UNNECESSARY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When the colour came back it was not that bloody.<br/><br/>Although very cool the way the screen changed as she blinked - that was cool<br/><br/>However I will say that this film had some very very good scenes particularly those with Sonny Chiba in the bar where Uma goes to get her sword very funny - excellent! The scene with Uma slapping the young yakuza ass was also very very funny. I really enjoyed the anime scene as well (apart from the excessive blood was a little silly at times) but the absolute uncompromising revenge on Lucy's characters face as a child was amazing - very well set out. <br/><br/>In my humble opinion I would say this film would have been much better as an anime - as I said its only real saving grace was its funny scenes with Chiba. Why I seem to be the only one who can see these points mystifies me - there are some very stupid close-minded people with absolutely no taste living in a dream world who thought this film was brilliant. After all that I think I am being generous giving this movie 4 out of 10"

I'm going to try and to explain why I hate this film. I have not seen many 18's, not until i saw this. and I expected to be shocked, I wasn't. As much as Mr. Taratino, sorry can't spell, tried I just laughed. When Lucy Liu's character cut off that man's head and the blood shot out. everyone in the room laughed, EVERYONE, and why? Because it looked so fake. The dialogue was appalling, the plot was just an excuse to fill the room with fake blood and try and make the elderly die of fear. An example of the awful dialogue was the scene where Uma arranges a fight with the assassin, at the beginning. They agree to meet in a ball park. This is roughly what it was like Uma: Where? Woman: In the park I coach a team there? Uma: Weapon of choice? Woman: Knives Uma: They always said you were the best with knives. Woman: see you there. Suddenly they kill each other, that burst of action grabbed my attention but it was so crap that it didn't keep it. The woman's little girl walks in, if you are meant to feel sorry for her you don't, Uma: I didn't mean for you to find out. If you feel beaten up about it, come and kill me someday. Cue another a film. I just pray that kid does kill her. The dialogue sounded like a fan written script for a t.v series e.g star trek or something. And sounded like a computer game, weapon of choice? If only Uma could act, the only people I know who like this film are either film addicts who like every film or people who think they are cool for liking this film. That is why I think it deserves 1 out of 10. Hell it deserves 1 out of 100."

","I didn't enjoy this movie. First let me say that I watched it on video because it didn't seem like the type of film I would enjoy paying 15 bucks for (gotta love those New York City theaters). When I finally rented it, it took me three days to get through. Each day I would sit determinedly and try to appreciate Tarantino's work. Each day I would continue to try because I had friends, whose opinions I respected, who told me that it was ""even better than pulp fiction"" (and I loved pulp fiction). And each day I would find myself switching off the set, in some sort of knee-jerk reaction stemming from my own disgust. I'm not going to accuse Tarantino of plagiarism; I could care less (the greatest Artists throughout history have always borrowed). I'm not going to criticize the film for it's pace or filming (that was something I couldn't even gauge as I was distracted by my more guttural misgivings). I'm not even going to criticize it for it's rather shallow dialogue (people tell me that that is a style). All I want to know is why the excessive violence? Why do we revel in death (and not just in death but in horrible gory death involving geysers of blood and gore). I've always wondered why a film can be rated PG-13 and have scenes of rather graphic violence, but if there is even any reference to the sex act (the use of the word f*ck [I can't even use it here]) the film is rated R. Violence is a destructive act Sex is a creative one, why do we (Americans especially) find the former more offensive?<br/><br/>But of course, I've become sidetracked by my own sensibilities. Let me now make it abundantly clear that I have no problem with violence when it is used by a filmmaker (even in excess) to express a point. I loved Pulp fiction because the senseless violence was juxtaposed to the rather overly logical musings of it's characters, the fact that a deep discussion regarding divine intervention and miracles is immediately followed by, (without any segue way) ""I just shot Marvin in the face!"" I loved Apocalypse Now because the rather gruesome moments illustrated the sheer madness one encounters in an armed conflict: ""I love the smell of Napalm in the morning..."" But unless someone can tell me what point Tarantino was trying to make with the excessive violence of Kill Bill (and don't give me simple revenge, for that excessively meaningful rational I could just watch pro-wrestling) I, personally, refuse to classify this film (as so many have) as art. I would simply call it gratuitous, bloodlust-based entertainment no nobler than a public execution. And if you're into public execution than I apologize, but I doubt you and I will ever have a productive discussion of Aesthetic value."
"RIK-22","1","12","22","30 June 2004"," Pointless, meaningless, dull, boring, shock imagery, without the shock.
","As others have mentioned, it reflects the rather shallow pop culture we now live in.  Films used to have some kind of depth, some kind of meaning.  In this you couldn't care less about any of the characters.  Actually let's be honest there wasn't even a plot, just a mix of jumbled edits and formats to try and seem quirky and clever.  Surely this retro style of filmmaking has now gone out of style.  <br/><br/>Nothing in the film was subtle or clever.  Of course there were references to other movies, but so what, does that make the movie a good one.<br/><br/>Now even I can enjoy a brainless comedy/horror or action movie on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but this was so uninteresting, I simply couldn't get anything out of it.  <br/><br/>Someone on this list used the summary `An adrenaline-driven coaster-ride through gratingly bold and captivating martial-arts extravaganza.'  I can only assume that the roller coaster that this gentleman was referring to, went about 1 mile an hour and had bed on it to take a nap.  When you don't care who wins, when you know the main protagonist is going to kill everyone with ease, when you realise parts of the film are just plain silly.  Where is the interest, where is the adrenaline.<br/><br/>Strangely QT's best film, IMO, is True Romance, which he didn't direct. That had style, an unusual story, but most importantly characters you actually cared about.  All his other movies are just for the sake of it'. Let's blow someone's head off here; let's swear a lot here, some people will think it's clever.<br/><br/>Judging by the fact films like, XXX, Shaft, Swordfish and Kill Bill are successful.  I can only assume people just want special FX, martial arts and explosions.  Is that really what people enjoy?  <br/><br/>1/10.<br/><br/>Go and see Leon, clever, witty, sad, violent and brilliant.

I liked her a lot.  But seeing the cartoons, namely the Lucy Liu back story, was too much.  Too much time, too much music, too much blood. Can we say, mas-tur-bate, Quentin?  Too damn long.  I don't care if that's how the Japanese comics/cartoons are; it was too much.  And if I was supposed to view it all with a sense of humor, well, I find watching a little girl's parents' bloody death an unlaughable situation.

","Quentin, Quentin, Quentin<br/><br/>What are you doing, man?<br/><br/>Anyone who's been a victim of real, bloody violence knows that real, bloody violence isn't funny. In fact, it's not the least bit funny.<br/><br/>I doubt Quentin Tarantino has ever even been slapped across the face in anger. Because if he'd had, I bet he'd be a little more invested in the notion that real, bloody violence isn't funny and it isn't glamorous, and it isn't even all that interesting in and of itself.<br/><br/>That's why 'Kill Bill' is so confusing for me. All three of his previous films to date, have explored the bizarre ironies of real violence. The arbitrary and unexpected turns it can take -- especially when perpetrated by the slow-witted, selfish or over-zealous persons who so often find themselves in a position to harm someone. Cops shoot innocent housewives by accident, thugs forget to take their guns into the bathroom with them, and women sometimes evince a propensity for coping with violence that belies their appearance. Violence is not glamorous. Not at all. It's frightening and it'll most likely be over before you even have a chance to fight back.<br/><br/>There were flickers of this kind of theme in the beginning of 'Kill Bill,' Watching the scene in which two grown women battle with knives in a suburban living room only to pretend they weren't when the schoolgirl daughter enters -- that was pretty entertaining. As was yet another commentary on the appalling matter-of-factness with which the low-life standing next to you in the elevator goes about plying his trade. *** SPOILER! *** In the present feature, a hospital orderly pimps coma victims to trucker-types. Low-brow, but compelling. However these scenes ultimately felt tacked on to a different kind of film and served only to remind us who'd made the picture once it devolved into a latter day Matrix-meets-Hong-Kong-martial-arts-homage.<br/><br/>The heartless, filthy gruesomeness of 'Kill Bill' was what really turned my stomach, though. Heads, arms, and scalps are all glibly hacked off for our entertainment in biologically realistic torrents of jetting blood and guts. We get to watch arty anime versions of scenes in which toddlers cower as their parents are chopped to pieces. Fun. But finally, just boring. How long can anyone be engaged by watching characters get creamed right after we meet them? AS we meet them?<br/><br/>And no amount of fancy cinematography and stuntwork is going to compensate.<br/><br/>There's a reason those stupid Hong Kong martial arts movies showed up on channel 44 Saturday afternoons when we were 12, Quentin. THEY WERE STUPID!<br/><br/>C minus.<br/><br/>Two more quick things.<br/><br/>Hollywood puts too much violence in their movies. I know this. And I know that indie-types like Matt Groening and Quentin Tarantino think they're lampooning Hollywood when they wratchet up the violence to levels of total or near-total absurdity. Whether it's Itchy scalping Scratchy or *** SPOILER! *** Uma scalping Lucy, I get it. Ho ho. But, I've looked into the eyes of the generation pulling up the rear, and I can tell you now, they don't get it. They don't get the joke, guys. They're taking you seriously. They really are. They see us laughing and they think we really think it's funny that someone just got disemboweled. Maybe they'll think it's funny to dump us out the 3rd floor window of our retirement homes someday, too.<br/><br/>And finally, I counted TWO, yes two small children in the theatre where I watched this film. Two small children watched pretty ladies getting their arms chopped off and pregnant brides getting pummeled into submission.

"majikstl","2","11","20","18 February 2005"," Shrill swill, nil skill, will still fill ill Kill Bill ...
","((((SPOILERS)))) I am convinced that Quentin Tarantino, at some point in his charmed life, sold his soul to the devil. There is no other way to explain how someone with such limited talent, lack of vision, poor taste and apparent bloodlust can, not only find huge success in making movies, but earn an astonishing amount of critical praise as a genius. He turns out unmitigated junk like KILL BILL (Vol. 1 & 2), and the only possible, logical reason for it being embraced is that Satan has stepped in and worked the blackest of black magic. QT had better enjoy his success, because someday he may have to pay. <br/><br/>KILL BILL is a pop culture trash heap, celebrating cinema at it's worst. Tarantino regurgitates garbage, but because he can recreate trash with a degree of flare and an eye for the colorful visual, it is mistaken for art. KILL BILL lovingly weaves together elements of chop-socky epics, klutzy yet ponderous martial arts flicks, spaghetti westerns, third rate film noir, fourth rate horror films and other random bits of genre and exploitation films that most respectable critics would avoid like the plague and somehow this cluttered homage to junk cinema is seen as visionary. <br/><br/>What he is doing is nothing new; Spielberg and Lucas built their careers on reliving their childhood guilty pleasures with multimillion dollar budgets. And that is not to mention the glut of films that find their inspiration in the superficial world of comic books and TV series from the 1960s. Long gone are the days where classic literature, folk legends and mythology represent cultural touchstones for storytelling; now you'd be hard pressed to come across a Shakespearean quote, not when a reference to a Trix breakfast cereal commercial is deemed to be so much more insightful. <br/><br/>Playing verbal Trivial Pursuit with every other line of dialogue isn't necessarily a bad thing; it can add a touch of whimsy and a cultural context to a tale. But in Tarantino's exceedingly narrow view of the world, every thought, every quip is reduced to a pop culture reference. Yet, the overabundance of arcane trivia he shoehorns into his scripts doesn't have a punch. They're not there for social commentary or to even particularly define a character's social background, but to show off Tarantino's own knowledge of minutiae. No matter how skillful he is as a director (and I won't argue that he isn't a clever craftsman) or how blood soaked his scenes or obscenity laden his dialogue, Tarantino still comes off as the know-it-all class geek trying to prove how smart he is. The problem is that he is not dispensing knowledge, only parroting catchphrases and factoids. There is no original thought in a Tarantino film, just repackaged leftovers. <br/><br/>Not that his screenplays don't try to pretend to have depth. In KILL BILL, Tarantino supplies a batch of clichéd fortune cookie bromides, probably recycled from old movies just like his action scenes. These bits of canned wisdom come off as forced and phony as the pseudo-Biblical nonsense that Samuel L. Jackson babbles in PULP FICTION. Tarantino's fans, both in the audience and in the press, latch onto these superficial bits of pseudo-philosophy as they try to defend his films as being more than the lame, ugly, ultra-violent exploitations they are. This despite the obvious, that Tarantino glibly seems to approach his material with a hokey-jokey attitude. Tarantino gets it both ways: he gets to trivialize his violence by packaging it in glib humor, while his defenders try to justify the violence by claiming it is part of something with much deeper meaning. Either way, both avoid dealing with the reality that his films are extended wallows in sleazy, pointless, sadistic violence. <br/><br/>For the most part, KILL BILL is nothing more than just another slasher/serial killer flick. The only difference is that the stalking killer is supposed to have our sympathy. Uma Thurman's The Bride, a.k.a. Beatrice Kiddo, follows in the footsteps of Vincent Price in dozens of horror films as the wounded victim seeking vengeance for a past injustice. Thurman, alas, has none of the class of Price, just as KILL BILL has none of the wit, style or charm of his old AIP mini-epics. But if all one wants in a film is elaborate displays of over the top violence than Tarantino fills the bill, so to speak. Otherwise, eighty percent of the film is wasted celluloid. <br/><br/>It is not until the end that Tarantino gets to the point, the confrontation between Kiddo and Bill, her mentor, lover and adversary. We get a plot twist that actually gives a purpose to the rest of the film -- finally. The Bride and Bill have a confrontation like a perverse version of KRAMER VS. KRAMER and the complications that the film has vaguely hinted at become a genuinely compelling situation -- and something rare in Tarantino's limited world: real human interaction. But, having saturated his story with blood, gore and cynicism, it is hard to care. Tarantino wants us to have a warm and fuzzy feeling at the end, but having given us a heroine who, even before her campaign of revenge, was a cold-blooded, monstrous killer, why should we wish her a happily-ever-after ending. Rather than being ironic, the ending is depressing. <br/><br/>Sadder still than the dubious quality of Tarantino's shallow, overlong epic is that he has gained iconic status as the purveyor of sadistic chic and cold-blooded cool, an icon to be admired and imitated. The violence in his films are nothing compared to the violence he has inflicted on our pop culture."

Blood all over the place, flying heads, arms and legs - and if you read this, you already know the whole film.<br/><br/>There is no development of characters, no sense, no humour, no tension, no surprise, no special effect, no sex, no drugs and a bit of Japanese rock'n'roll. Don't expect a climax either. If I hadn't fallen asleep, I probably would have left the film in the middle - as I sleep much better in my own bed.<br/><br/>So safe your money for something original and entertaining. Don't watch this film. (1/10)"

","Tarantino needs to find something to say in his work instead of just spitting back the crap he digested as a kid.  How many times do we have to sit thru a scene in which a female child witnesses the brutal bloody murder of her parents?  Twice.  One in live-action, and one in animation.  Gee, thanks, Tarantino!  This film is empty and boring, with a good use of the old Green Hornet theme for a few minutes, some average action, bad acting, boring dialogue, silly time shuffling--it's so yesterday's news.

","I am a big of all kinds of action movies, but Kill Bill was the biggest disappointment. Why? Very simple:<br/><br/>1. The plot is one sentence: ""They almost killed me, so I'll kill them all"". As shallow as possible. Also the are some big plot holes.<br/><br/>2. There is nothing else but some long boring episodes (I guess to extend the movie so as to create Kill Bill vol. 2) and some super violent scenes (blood fountains, countless chopped heads, arms and legs). It is advised to watch this movie with closed eyes.<br/><br/>3. There is no Tarantino style left. No jokes, no philosophy, no anything, just blood and violence. R rating is what it deserves. Even fight scenes are not fascinating... Matrix, Equilibrium or even Jackie Chan's fight scenes give me much more satisfaction.<br/><br/>All right, the beginning was quite fine, but everything else... terrible.<br/><br/>I give 1 out of 10.

","A mirror of our time: no depth, no character development, weak script and self-complacency. Nothing more than a colorful video game with redundant action scenes: what's the use of the 88 fight if we already know Uma will kill them all? What's the use (and the sense) of all that limbs chopped (once we see one or two, that's enough I think)? Kill Bill is the essence of baroque cinema, what I call add-ism: add action, add color, add blood, add every possible camera angle, add anything you may like, this way you'll rest assured you've hit the target. People, today, don't want to think, they just want to watch action movies with a dumb expression on their face. It's not important the quality of what you see, what counts is to fill the frame with every possible object, movement or detail in a ""horror vacui"" triumph. Quentin has reached a point where he can shoot what he wants, edit the way he wants and put the music he wants that, one way or another, critics and people would find praise and new adjectives to glorify his (lost) talent. Yes, very good cinematography, but what a shallow and presumptuous movie! Think about it for a moment: consider the final scene with Uma (bad feet) and Lucy katana-fighting. ""Don't let me be misunderstood"" is the music. But, what would have been changed if we had put another song? Nothing. If Quentin would have chosen a Mariah Carey song (or White Christmas), people would have enjoyed it too. There is too much of everything in this movie (not to mention the stereotyped manga sequence) that if you add something, or move something in another place the final results would be exactly the same. A very huge cauldron where everybody can add something. You recognize a masterpiece when you feel that in an artwork nothing need to be added and nothing need to be changed in any way; it's a perfect accomplishment. Here, Quentin, I'm sorry because I loved all your three previous films, but you have lost your perfection in favor of anarchy and confusion. Nothing more than a mirror of our times, new baroque where people don't want to think but just want to be entertained, no matter how, but matters how much."

This is nothing more than a hyped-up one-dimensional trip down every type of cliché in comic book and kung fu movie history. There's nothing here that resembles any sort of humanistic vision, moreso it's only what is less evil than what else. It's fatalism at it's worst, with a nihilistic vision of humanity. It celebrates the rotton core of the criminal mind. It says that those who kill are the wonders of the world, to be admired and emulated. The rest of us folks who don't are bumbling, dim-witted buffoons. This is what can be expected from an individual who was mindlessly inundated with senseless psycho horror films, cheesy outlandish Kung Fu crud, simplistic comic book story lines, all of these saying that gore is good, might makes it right, and everything human can be explained in a one-dimensional characterization. Those who rave about how great this is, do so merely because it is an extremely slick presentation, completely realized pulp novel, and is just as empty-headed as all of those pulp novels that have long gone into trash incinerators and landfills where they belong. This is violence only for the sake of violence, without any of the nuance and subtlety of the great film storytellers, such as Hitchcock or Kurosawa, who knew that a small dose or a mere hint of violence was all that was necessary to augment a good story."

"mstomaso","5","8","14","8 February 2008"," Lots of Style, Little Substance
","In Kill Bill I, Quentin Tarantino continues his tradition of paying homage and simultaneously insulting every genre of film vaguely related to his projects. This time around, it's the Tarantino version of Fists of Fury or any of 1000 other martial arts films with lots of wire-work, people who become black-belts in a month or two because they are motivated by revenge (though they skip the part where they develop muscles) and cartoon-violence and gore.<br/><br/>Uma Thurmond plays a double-crossed and angry woman who was beaten to the point of death on her wedding day, along with her entire bridal party. Bill is her former employer and also the guy responsible. And her former work associates are the people she's out to kill.<br/><br/>Predictably, the characters are, at best, two dimensional, the violence is nicely filmed and almost never ridiculous-looking, and the gore is hilariously ridiculous and the script is as serious as the absurd predicaments it creates. A whole slew of ethnic stereotypes comprise the main characters, and Uma Thurmond's protagonist is a walking cliché about a woman scorned, Lucy Liu is a quintessential Asian- American, etc. Bill, of course, is lifted straight out of Charlie's Angels' Charlie - heard but never seen and yet all-powerful.<br/><br/>Despite their vacuousness and lack of any sort of depth, there is a certain post-modern catharsis in the silliness and elaborate and expensive production of Tarantino's essentially grade B- pulp films. If nothing else, they are entertaining in a blood-drenched but otherwise unchallenging way. Leave your brain somewhere else and enjoy."

His three previous movies ('Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', 'Jackie Brown') were the movies that have made me decide to watch this, because all three of them were clever, witty, and entertaining, but most of all, they were all great movies. I also must add 'True Romance' as it is one of my favorite movies of all time, though it wasn't directed by Tarantino. Anyway, though I do enjoy a martial arts movie here and there, this wasn't that entertaining. What happened to all of those shrewd lines he put into his other movies that make you laugh thinking that was witty? The whole point of this movie is revenge that takes a long time to accomplish, and it's not worth my time. All I can say is, this is the worst movie I've seen that was directed by Tarantino. I haven't seen Kill Bill Vol. 2 yet, and I will probably get around it eventually. I hear the story is much more emotional.

I had to endure through all the bull and in the end it was like i spent my time watching someone play a video game at some video game convention on a big-a55 screen.

In conclusion this is a lame movie, if you like violence don't watch this because it just trivializes violence.

Whilst I'm sure that these references must satisfy those members of the audience who recognise them, they wholly fail to make up for the misery suffered by those who don't. Neither Kill Bill film has anything else to redeem it. The dialogue is woeful throughout, retaining all the style but none of the substance of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. The performances are two-dimensional and completely un-involving, although much of the blame for that must fall on Tarantino for having penned such feeble characters. Because you don't care about anyone on screen, the violence appears aimless and gratuitous. But the worst thing about these films is that the ""Tarantino"" badge seems to be enough for some to excuse these terminal flaws, where any other director would be completely torn to pieces. Those of us who believe that film-making should be about involving an audience and telling a story can only hope that the aura of infallibility that surrounds the man is dissipated rapidly after these spineless and inept films. The tragedy is that they will probably only feed the hype.

Pulp Fiction is a violent movie. Killing Bill is a thousand times worse.<br/><br/>Thurman clearly enjoys her sadistic role in Killing Bill which leads me to think that she needs professional help. Tarantino should join her. I keep asking myself: What prompted these two people to invest so much of themselves in a movie that glorifies death by decapitation and the cutting off of limbs.<br/><br/>I won't go to another movie in which Uma Thurman appears or that Tarantino directs! <br/><br/>The public and the reviewers liked Killing Bill and its box office success is indicative of the ""herd mentality"" of American film goers. No matter how bad, how revolting, how repulsive or how disgusting a movie is, American film goers will flock to see it if the movie is properly marketed; they are totally undiscriminating.

"kingofallthatismallandan","1","7","12","26 October 2005"," Blood, doesn't make a movie.....but apparently, it does make money.
","I'll start off by saying that no, in general, I am not a Tarantino fan. I thought Pulp Fiction was a very good movie, I haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, and though From Dusk Till Dawn was worthless trash. Second of all, I'm reviewing both Vol. 1 & 2 here.<br/><br/>Kill Bill was a cinematic success exclusively because of the fact that movies are very rarely created for artistic or commentary purposes anymore - now, they are mostly just created for young teenage boys who want to see some heads chopped off with a couple sex scenes mixed in. Unfortunately for them, Kill Bill, doesn't have any of the latter, but it has oh-so-plenty of the former.<br/><br/>I don't care about violence in movies. I'm no self righteous conservative schmuck who thinks that all movies should supplement the family environment and any showing of blood should be met with a swift NC-17 rating. Violence is alright in movies, as long as there is something to go along with it. As long as there's a point to it. Sorry, but a clichéd and uninspired tale of bloody revenge to get back at your husband by chopping up a couple hundred Asian kids and plucking people's eyes out just doesn't cut it.<br/><br/>Much of the dialogue is overly simple and somewhat pointless. I think the star of the movie is Lucy Liu, as she has by far the most character and likability/hateability as Oren Ishii, who also happens to be the most well developed of the characters in the film, the only one with any backstory even provided. The scene in the conference room with Tanaka losing his head and her subsequent shouting and the final fight scene of Vol. 1 between The Bride and Oren are by far the best in the duology. It's just too bad that Lucy is only in the first movie. I would venture to say that the second movie isn't worth seeing just because she isn't in it. But...I'd be wrong, because there are many, many other reasons not to see it.<br/><br/>Further evidence that this movie was marketed exclusively for mostly immature teenagers is the character Pai Mei. Obviously based on the ""master"" characters from various anime shows, he was clearly tossed in there for kids to look at and say, ""Look. He chops wood with his hand. And ninja slaps women without regret. Therefore he is badass."" Unfortunately that doesn't work. How about the Five-Point-Heart-Exsplosion-Technique? How long winded and childish can you get for the name of a martial arts move? You've got to be kidding me with that one. How can you expect me to hear a character say ""Wow. You just used the Five-Point-Heart-Explosion-Technique on me."" and not burst into uncontrollable laughter? I think that scene almost got me kicked out of the theater. The ushers and the people around me didn't look to pleased at my laughing during what I *think* was supposed to be a dramatic scene. But failed to be so.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for the movie is fairly good. It consists of the usual Tarantino audio: obscure songs from previously unknown artists that doesn't seem to fit with the scene on your first view but you come to appreciate its cinematic value later. There's lots of Salsa music on there too, mostly from Santa Esmerelda, which definitely worked with the final fight scene between Oren and the Bride. The 5 6 7 8's should thank Tarantino that Vonage didn't laugh them off the stage like every movie audience did - I wonder how much they're getting from those commercials? <br/><br/>Were it not for the hype, rampant undeserved praise, and general overratedness, Kill Bill would simply be a decent movie. I mean, there aren't many movies out there with a deep, intuitive, affecting story anyways, so it's sometimes forgivable. But the millions of people saying ""Kill Bill is the best!"" and then when asked to answer the question of Why? respond with simply, ""Women cutting people up with swords! Why do you think, dinglehopper!?"" is what just gets to me. Cutting things up with swords is NOT a good movie! I'd rather just watch the Home Shopping Network and see the untrained salesmen accidentally impale themselves with a sword while trying to market it because they try to look fancy but don't actually know how to handle it! Now THAT is entertainment - Kill Bill is just junk.<br/><br/>I think Kill Bill and all its undeserved popularity is a grim sign for the movie industry - final, overwhelming confirmation that action sells over art.<br/><br/>It's not an unknown fact that the movies that are made for artistic meaning and offer some type of commentary on the status of human society or just what life really is are almost overwhelmingly neglected by the movie-going audience, and are seen mostly by critics and fans of the directors. And when the rare movie comes along that offers blood, gore, story, acting, and commentary that all combine into a piece of art, such as Saving Private Ryan, people watch it for the war scenes. ""Oh, that movie has some great war scenes, man! Limbs flying everywhere!"" ... ""Yes, but there's more to it than just...that. I would tell you to watch it again...but you still wouldn't get it."" It's the blood and gore people want to see, not the long, complicated story, great acting, and much more that comes with an excellent, top-100 movie. Apparently katana-wielding women in yellow jumpsuits is the fad nowadays. And just a couple years ago Pogs were the fad.<br/><br/>Go figure."

","'Kill Bill Vol. 1', Quentin Tarantino's fourth movie everybody is talkin' about because it's just _Quentin Tarantino_. Beside the hype around this man he didn't impress me with his movies, though he had some interesting ideas - until now.<br/><br/>'Kill Bill' made me slip back in my comfortable cinema chair thinking about the wasted time (111 minutes!) and money (5 EUR!) and stupidness of following the mainstream and all the hypes. Well, this aren't the normal thoughts of the audience and I want to tell you why I thought so about this movie.<br/><br/>I went to the cinema for two reasons: 1. A friend told me that Kill Bill is a good exploitation film like 'Braindead' - 2. Another one who knows me quite well and said that I will like this movie. So with joyfully anticipation the whole thing started but turned me off quite fast. Nothing happened. They shoot, they kill, they bleed, they jump, they beat... what's so special? Not even (IMHO) poor martial arts actors like Jackie Chan or Jet Li would appreciate such useless fighting sequences. And why did they pull swords in and out of the sheaths for minutes??? Some hidden meaning?<br/><br/>Is it really necessary to pack a conventional (American) revenge story (tooth for tooth, eye for eye) in such an over-the-top exaggerated movie with childish fightings (the comic-book showdown in the restaurant), useless blood flow (I like gore but you must know where you gave to use it), hollywood dialogues and sloppy cinematic elements (the anime retrospect of O-Ren Ishii).<br/><br/>This movie will appeal to people who have seen every 'Karate Tiger' movie, know the basic facts of Jean-Claude Van Damme's life and enjoy Dragon Ball Z on a daily basis.<br/><br/>Sorry people I have to give up but 'Kill Bill' was the worst film I saw since 'Scary Movie 2'."

B-movies should know their place, and no amount of ""good"" actors or lame choreography is going to make it any better.  This movie has opened my eyes to the juvenile mind set that Quentin Tarantino possesses.  An antisocial 4th grader who likes to draw stick figures of people getting their heads chopped off because it's ""funny"" would have made this movie.  To be frank, I was one of those 4th graders, like any normal adolescent fascinated with the concept of violence.  But you know what?  I grew up, and apparently Quentin Tarantino NEVER did.

Where does she get the money to fly all over the place from? How could she lift a man above her head when she was too weak to barely lift her sword? How can she recover for years of atrophied limbs in a mere 13 hours?  How can she casually be near the scene of so many crimes and not get caught?

","People get used to unreal movie elements, like broken glass that doesn't cut or a badly wounded hero who can still fight like a healthy man, etc., and they just ignore them to be able to enjoy the movie. So do I. But sometimes these unreal element get too many and too blatant to accept or just ignore them! This movie is a fine example to that! Starting with the protagonist waking up from years long coma by a damn mosquito bite!!! Then she carries her sword around openly as if it was some harmless toy, and nobody cares about it. She can even bring it up on a plane! And when it gets to a fight, everyone stand against her with mêlée weapons (mostly swords) as if it would be in the Middle Ages and not the 21st century. There isn't a single gun in the whole movie (except for a toy shotgun which fired popcorn at the protagonist, obviously not hurting her)! And these are just the most blatant bull****s, there are many more! The movie fails morally too: every single person in it are violent a**holes, the good guys are as bad (or even worse) as the bad guys. Actually, by the standards of the protagonist, slaughtering people for the smallest insult makes you good - as we see it by the introduction of the Yakuza leaders personal bodyguard: a 16 yo girl, who is ""mature"" and ""good"", because she gutted a guy who wanted to get her laid. And of course our heroine is really good by this standard, she mutilated horribly (or killed, I don't remember) 2 people right in the first minute after she regained consciousness. (Not to be confused with conscience, because she never regained that - assuming she had any to begin with!) Then she murders a mother in front of her little daughter, and in the end she chops off a few hundred limbs (and has fun doing it). Of course the police is never after her (maybe there is no police at all there), violence has no consequence in this move - not even this huge amount of violence."

","I guess what I hate most about this movie is it's silly attempt at passing for a movie to be taken seriously. I found many of the scenes to be visually repulsive but that wasn't what bothered me most. What bothered me most was the underlying message of those scenes. When someone was cut to pieces with a sword the focus was on how cool it looks when someone is cut to pieces ( as opposed to movies like Braveheart where the focus was on Scotlands struggle for independence). I felt genuinely offended by this. It is also clear that either Tarantino has absolutely no knowledge of human anatomy or the clumsily splattered bodies in the movie was some sort of deranged form of artistic expression. If the latter is true than Mr. Tarantino has no knowledge of how to create serious artistic movies. Or how to create any form of art deserving of respect. As it was in no way beautiful and served no purpose in telling the story and was generally very repulsive. It is Mr. Tarantinos vein attempt at passing himself of as a serious artist witch bothers me most. Also very offensive and disgusting was the music chosen to accompany the splatter scenes, beautiful classical music. This is an attempt to glorify the splatter scenes. Something witch should never be done in serious artwork. Disgusting bloody scenes are supposed to underline some story plot but not be gloried in themselves. That is the mark of bad art. If you want to see a serious movie that is artistically made see Kaldaljós ( Cold light) or Englar Alheimsins (Angels of the Universe). I am shocked at how high this movie is rated on this page as it is pure crap! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT SEE THIS GARBAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I have never seen Kill Bill 2, and don't ever plan to, unless someone tells me that there is an apology from the director for making such an awful film. The acting is atrocious, the effects even worse, and the mix of cartoon and film sucks.

","In general i'm not really a fan of Quentin Tarantino's. To me his films seem to have a kind of smirking self-consciousness, a smug ""cool"" cleverness to them that irritates me. However, to his credit, ""Reservoir Dogs"" and, to a lesser extent, ""Pulp Fiction"" did have a few moments of dialog that i actually thought were almost as clever as Tarantino obviously thought they were. But ""Kill Bill""? Not a clever line in sight. Quite the opposite, really. The film contained what had to be some of the dumbest dialog i have ever heard. The whole film was like a continuous stream of terrible one-liners and recycled kung-fu clichés. I know, i know, a lot of people found it entertaining, but personally i found it rather boring in it's own hyper-adrenaline way. I need a bit of substance in my films for me to find them engaging, and really, can you honestly say that ""Kill Bill"" had anything resembling substance? Did it even have a real plot that takes more than a sentence to explain? Or even an original, interesting idea? This movie is all flash, and flash alone doesn't get you anywhere in my book."
"tedg","Null","9","17","25 October 2003"," God Gets Cut
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>The title of the comment is from the ersatz master who makes a new sword for our avenger. This denotes what is wrong about this film, indeed why Tarantino is to film as Brittany Spears is to music.<br/><br/>Martial arts are about generational wisdom, about the rigidity of the masters all the way back empowering new freedom all the way forward. When a fight occurs, it is not the weapons that are in combat, not even the combatants: it is the respective masters who operate through time and space. Ang Lee understood this when he made his film, one that could reliably called an homage.<br/><br/>This is something else, wholly Americanized. Here we have a setup that is from cold war 60's culture, a themed assassination squad. The focus is on the individual. When Uma's character fights, it is in the Eastwood/Segal tradition. This is Yankee individualism filtered through episodic TeeVee and only then cloaked in B-movie style.<br/><br/>
For all this to work, we have to have a God. Can be the noir god of detached fate; can be the Hitchcock/dePalma god of the camera; can be the Lynch god of the filmmaker's angst; can be the Leone god of irony, or the Fellini god of parallel dreams, or Medem of animated orgasm, or Bergman of the Judge. Our man Q wants them all, and has to cut each of them to make room for the others. He is not clean and focused like Kurosawa, but jumbled like Rob Zombie.<br/><br/>`Once Upon a Time in Mexico' has identical aspirations, but Rodriguez steeps us in something he actually knows, leverages an actor that actually understands irony (not some second rater; remember Mrs Peel and Poison Ivy?), clearly identifies his god/ observer (Depp), and does it all himself: writing, directing, shooting, editing, composing. In comparison, Quentin is a novice and this is a dim conversation in a lonely corner of an effete Hollywood party.<br/><br/>As in all of life, there are two kinds of people in film. I'll call them engineers and scientists. Engineers work with known vocabularies and principles. They take insights of others and tinker about with different combinations to accomplish certain practical goals. There is an imagination of sorts, but it extends only so far as understanding the storehouse of components supplied by others. <br/><br/>The scientists go where no one else has ever gone, into the void and bring back new reality that they convince us to accept. Which of these you choose for your life in film could determine everything about you, because you live in your imagination. Compare `Ghost Dog' (or even `Pillow Book') to `Kill Bill.' Both are about themselves, cast in terms of what went before. One is subtle, even elusive in its truths. Possibly, it is only one of many stories it is about as the little girl within it reads. The other, `Bill' is already chewed for you. Brittany Spears. They even use the same musician as composer. One is subtle and rich, the other a jukebox.<br/><br/>Kurosawa is a scientist; Tarantino a shopkeeper, and that brings me to my final point. Quentin does have terrific storytelling skills. But look at how they are used. All of his attention goes to explaining what happened before, including the trademarked<br/><br/>timefolds. This is very well done and completely comprehendible. But good storytelling, the really good stuff, is about what happens NEXT. See any of that here?<br/><br/>Nope, just sugared breakfast cereal.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

","Uma Thurman was totally unconvincing as a martial artist in this movie, then again so was every non-Japanese person in the film. The fight scene between Uma and Vivica Fox was edited in such a rapid-fire manner to hide the fact that neither of them could fight worth beans. During the big scene with the 100 Agent Smiths... oops I mean the ""Crazy 88"" gang, she swung that sword around with all the finess of a major league ball player aiming for the fence. Only when her stunt double took over did we see some decent moves. I thought maybe Lucy Liu would put up a decent fight but that one was also disappointing. The only one with any sort of promise was the character of Gogo but she didn't last long enough to really get into it. So in Vol 2, she's going to kill Daryl Hannah, Michael Madson and David Carradine... hmmm, so those fight scenes are going to suck too. Overall I liked the movie but they could have at least put some time into training as the non-martial artists in the Matrix did."

I realize this is only the first part of two films, but I can honestly say there is no chance I will ever waste my time watching the second part.  Not only was the plot as unbelieveable as the 'Weapons of Mass Destruction' reasoning, but the acting was sub-par, the cinematography was nauseating, and I am disowning all of my friends who recommended this film.

","I very rarely take the time to write reviews on here unless I feel extremely strongly about a film, and in this case, I find it quite difficult to fathom how this garbage has any good reviews. I was honestly looking forward to seeing it for the first time after hearing about how many people enjoyed it, and knowing what a famous film it is. Reading the synopsis it sounded like a movie with a good storyline and a lot of potential. I, also, am normally one to love a bit of bloodshed in action, thriller, horror or sci-fi films but this movie was just totally ridiculous and over the top. About half the movie was in what I assume was Japanese with no subtitles, which really didn't make it any more difficult to figure out what was happening in regards to the storyline but it did make the film a whole lot more frustrating to watch, and with much of the dialogue in Japanese as well, it really stopped me as from engaging, feeling sorry for, or connecting with any of the characters. Good for you if you speak English and Japanese I suppose. The worst part though, was all the absurd violence. I was literally staring in disgust and shaking my head in disbelief. The whole movie contains graphic violence, all of it entirely ridiculous. There are people getting limbs hacked off left right and centre with fountains of blood spurting from the wounds, psychotic 17 year old girls who like killing things and a fight scene where around 200 people can't take down one whack-job woman. I can see the humour in unrealistic violence when it's done in a light- hearted sense, and I can also see the point of some more heavy violence to create a certain atmosphere, but in this movie what was meant to be a serious plot, was utter rubbish, with people losing more blood than what would even be insides someone's body to begin with. It was totally unnecessary, unbelievable and without the ability to draw any emotional reaction. Not only this, but half the movie was in animation, once again preventing any attachment or interest in any of the characters wellbeing. I understand possibly this movie was meant to be of the 'arthouse' genre, but even so it was disengaging, ridiculous, boring and downright stupid, like someone made it up as they went along and ran out of time before the end. The only half decent thing throughout the whole movie was the music, but if that's of any interest I suggest downloading the soundtrack, rather than wasting your time on this atrocity. I sat through the whole thing, hoping the ending would redeem the rest of the film, but was wrong. I'm kicking myself for electing to watch this stupid film instead or Sherlock Holmes. Bah!"

Kill Bill is a good example of a more general problem with his oeuvre.<br/><br/>There are some really nice aesthetic moments in this movie, but then there is a lot of extreme unpleasantness, such as the disturbing revelation that the Uma Thurman character, who has been comatose for four years, was being serially used as a prostitute by one of the male nurses (her pimp, unbeknownst to her) at the hospital. Very repulsive, and gratuitously so. Tarantino seems to like to come up with sickening scenarios just to prove that he can. I mean what role did the scene play in the larger story?<br/><br/>That's the problem, of course. The larger story is just a lot of violence carried out in revenge to other violence. Upon emerging from her coma, the Uma Thurman character goes on a mission to avenge her dead family, all of whom were killed at her wedding.<br/><br/>Tarantino has an idiosyncratic but consistent view of violence, which in a way is humanistic, as odd as that might sound. Everyone who does horrible things to people has been the victim of horrible things done to him or her. They feel fully justified in retaliating, but in the end everyone becomes morally equivalent, which is to say, in a word: repugnant."

I expected to see a lot of milking of seventies cinema, television and music and I think Tarantino milked the whole decade dry, or what was left of it after his earlier movies, in this first part of Kill Bill. The main reason I want to see part two is to see what could possibly be left to milk from the seventies to fill up the second part of the movie. As a fan of seventies cinema, television and music I feel irritated by the use of the Green Hornet theme music and other such milking, it feels cheap and too easy to me. But these irritations aside I loved Uma Thurman in this movie and it's great to see her carry a lead and hack away like she means it. Hack away FOR A WHILE, that is, not for a whole hour.

Unlike with CTHD, Tarantino was wise enough in his trailer not to show the sequences which defied all logic, physics, anatomy, and medical science - and of course he couldn't show the gore.<br/><br/>This film plays not only to a contemporary audience's ignorance, but also its desensitization to graphic violence. It's a gore fest from beginning to the end. It counts on the fact that a highly-stylized adrenalin rush can overcome any residual horror at the carnage depicted. The audience is further conditioned to accept gruesome deaths as something cool to watch. Anyone who watches this film and feels excited rather than disturbed could benefit from a but more introspection.<br/><br/>Tarantino is also obviously a more talented director than the makers of CTHD. The best part of the film is an Anime flashback sequence. That makes sense since the whole film is live action Anime. But then, the same criticisms can be leveled against Anime as this film.<br/><br/>That films like this can be as successful as they have, speaks volumes about our society."

","Seriously, I have no idea why Tarentino is thought of as a good director, none of his movies show any evidence to support his reputation from what I've seen.  As for this specific one...<br/><br/>What a mess (and not just talking about the excessive pointless violence). The scenes are played with next to no logical order or coherence.  Most of the action shots, as well choreagraphed as they are, have such sloppy camera work you practically get motion sickness.  The plot, such as it is, makes abosolutely no sense (well, The Bride is out for revenge, obviously, but why she was attacked in the first place was never explained).  The anime sequence was actually pretty well done, but was followed up with a long drawn out transition to the next sequence... which is what most of the movie felt like, incoherent, drawn out scenes with periods of rediculously violent sloppy action sequences to wake you up.  Maybe Volume 2 will redeem this first half, but I'm not holding my breath."

","This is a simple tale and a favorite theme of filmmakers: revenge. There is even a Kill Bill Vol. 2 which came out six months later, making the total time close to four hours.<br/><br/>All of it revolves around a character who is left for dead and her husband-to-be killed at their wedding. She goes after those responsible, mainly ""Bill,"" played by David Carradine.<br/><br/>Personally, I liked the second film much more because this one got carried away with the flying martial arts-type violence. Oh, yes, being a Tarantino film it's going to be stylish mayhem, but there is just too much of it.<br/><br/>As in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and subsequent films of that nature, there is a lot of swordplay and flying bodies, floating in the air, doing somersaults and other outrageous physically-impossible feats. That's okay if one doesn't overdo it, but, sadly that's the case here as ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman) literally fights and defeats about 100 guys in one long scene. The violence and lunacy of that scene got tiresome but I give Tarantino credit for one thing: he did that particular segment in black-and-white, which was very cool twist.<br/><br/>Also, there was too much Japanese spoken in this film with no subtitles, leaving all English-speaking viewers out in the cold as to what was being said. At least have the courtesy to provide subtitles if you 're going to have that much unexplained dialog.<br/><br/>Stick to Kill Bill Vol. II.

I've never had much reaction to her before, aside from Pulp Fiction. She's quite effective whether she's trying to move her big toe or slash another of the 88. I've got to buy the soundtrack.

Remarkably unique blend of various genres drawing from an abundant of influences constructing something very much his own. A bride (Uma Thurman) awakes from a long coma no longer carrying the baby before hand. Only revenge motivates her now to hunt down the assassination team that betrayed her, and once a part of.

The wirework is extremely shoddy (unless that's another deliberate homage of course), no one impresses with any move (not even Liu Chia Hui), Uma is clearly doubled a lot, and there is simply not a single 'wow'-moment martial arts-wise (fans of dismemberment will enjoy the scene, though). Why Yuen Wo-Ping was needed here beats me - any American choreographer who had watched enough early seventies samurai and kung fu films could have put these fights together. And how anyone can talk about an adrenaline-drenched ride when you get only two action set-pieces beats me - especially since the rest of the film has nothing to offer except 'look at how clever I am'-homage ripoffs and (admittedly) a fun soundtrack. When I read the ecstatic reviews this films has gotten I get the impression people are talking about the film they wanted to have seen rather than the film they saw. Moreover, the action quotient in part 2 will be even less than in part 1 - so here's a new theory on why the film was cut into two halves: it's just too damn boring to watch in one go!"

"hnt_dnl","10","7","14","31 March 2008"," Tarantino's best
","KILL BILL VOL1 is the crowning film in Quentin Tarantino's career. I almost hate to put the VOL1, because alone, this first film is a great accomplishment without having VOL2, although I can appreciate what part 2 was trying to do: add depth and character backstory to the plot. In VOL1, plot is unnecessary! I'll just refer to VOL1 as KILL BILL hereafter. The genius of KILL BILL is that you don't need plot or character development to appreciate its brilliance. It's not about these things. KILL BILL is purely stylistic, an homage to all those kick-ass-and-take-names martial arts grindhouse movies of the 70s with stars like Bruce Lee to led you through the carnage. What was the real substance or motivation in those movies? Not much substance and the motivation was revenge, just like in this one. And you don't need any backstory or extra dialogue (very little here) to know from the start that it is all about revenge.<br/><br/>The person perpetrating the revenge, our protagonist, is The Bride (played to absolute stunning, convincing, athletic perfection by Uma Thurman). This is Thurman's greatest accomplishment as an actress. She had to be believable as a martial artist (she is), to show agility and athleticism (she does), and make us believe that she is a total, 100%, lethal, bad-ass, killing machine (she does all that in spades!). This role could NOT have been easy! Thurman should have been nominated for Best Actress.<br/><br/>The Bride's singular goal is to eliminate those who have wronged her. The main perpetrator is 'Bill', who shoots this pregnant woman in the head before the film's credits even roll. (BIG TIME SPOILER ALERT!) The 'start' of the film is really the end of the film, when The Bride goes to a suburban home to see 'Jeannie Bell', aka Vernita Green (played wonderfully by Viveca Fox). We know Vernita is an old foe of The Bride's (we just don't know why, but there is a brief hint during this opening scene) b/c The Bride immediately attacks Vernita and they get into an all-out super-fight, complete with martial artistry, acrobatics, and knifeplay. It still is one of my favorite scenes in the film.<br/><br/>Now, flashback 4 years and 6 months earlier to the time occurring right after the pre-credits scene. A group of Texas Rangers, led by Earl McGraw (played by the well cast veteran actor Michael Parks) are at the church where the shooting of The Bride and her wedding party took place. They soon realize that she's alive and she is hospitalized. During hospitalization, she is briefly visited by a mysterious woman named Elle (played by Darryl Hannah in her only scene in this film, but she leaves a lasting impression) who wants to kill her, but she is stopped by 'Bill' (who we only hear on the phone, but don't see).<br/><br/>The Bride remains in coma for 4 years and upon learning that she has lost her baby, immediately wants revenge on the perpetrators, who are former colleagues of hers (including Elle and Vernita). Called the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, we are introduced to a third member of the team name O'Ren Ishii (played by Lucy Liu) via a cartoon that backstory's her life. Ironically, this cartoon is the only set of scenes with real emotion and character development, and I'm sure this was Tarantino's intention. It totally works.<br/><br/>The Bride travels to Okinawa, Japan to meet the world-famous swordsman/maker Hattori Hanzo (played by legendary martial arts actor Sonny Chiba in a beautiful performance). Hanzo, upon learning that The Bride is a wronged student of his former student Bill, who he now despises, agrees to make her his best sword so that she can exact her revenge. She travels to Tokyo to claim her first victim O'Ren.<br/><br/>The Tokyo scenes, in a popular nightclub, are the climax of the film and these sequences are jaw-droppingly suspenseful and exciting to watch. It begins with a long, uncut, tracking shot of The Bride waiting for O'Ren and her lackeys, then it finally cuts to O'Ren and her crew having a jovial time until they hear The Bride call O'Ren out, and the fight (and fun) begins! The Bride has to battle not only O'Ren's posse, but also her fighting force The Crazy 88s. In between these 2 fights, she battles the teenaged, psychopathic, slick Gogo Yubari (played by Chiaki Yurikama in an impressive film debut). This scene is another fave of mine. Thurman and Yurikama really show some impressive weapons play and acrobatics in this scene. Then there's the scene with the Crazy 88s, an all-out, take-no-prisoners bloodfest where The Bride stands tall in the end. Tarantino outdid himself with this scene b/c I can't ever remember an action scene thrilling and exciting me this much. EVER! <br/><br/>The Bride has her final battle with O'Ren. Lucy Liu is perfectly cast as O'Ren. Even though O'Ren is a young woman, she is very worldly and experienced b/c she was forced into it from a very young age, as we learned in the cartoon. This final battle scene is more elegant and classy (and much less bloody) than the earlier fight scenes. Just good old-fashioned swordplay.<br/><br/>KILL BILL is my favorite work of Tarantino's b/c I never get tired of it, like I eventually did of PULP FICTION, which has a few clunky characters and scenes upon further viewing. Tarantino's frenetic ""love-of-movies"" style really shines brightest in KILL BILL VOL. 1 with vignettes that separately are unique and memorable, but strung together form a singularly brilliant movie-watching experience. Tarantino's choice of music is also pitch perfect, with each scene having a different tune to match it's tone and mood. The diversity of music in the action-packed finale is an incredible integration of music in film! There's something to be said for 100% pure, unapologetic entertainment, and KILL BILL delivers! A must see for real MOVIE fans."
"kylopod","4","7","14","26 October 2005"," Not up to Tarantino's usual standards
","Roger Ebert once wrote that Quentin Tarantino could make a bad film but could never make a boring film. Well, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is a boring film. Above all, it's monotonous, because most of the film is just a lengthy series of fights lacking any context that would allow us to side with one character over another. Worst of all, the heroine is presented as some kind of Unstoppable Force whom no one stands a chance against, especially males. This premise reaches the height of absurdity when she takes on a few hundred fighters at the same time. Now, I'm no big fan of ""The Matrix"" or its sequels, but the scene where Neo battles a hoard of Agent Smiths at least makes sense within the rules the story has established. There is nothing to explain why Uma Thurman's character is so powerful. We're just forced to accept that she's this invincible killing machine, a premise that robs of the film of one of the crucial ingredients of suspense, which is that the main character faces a challenge.<br/><br/>Another crucial ingredient that's conspicuously absent is emotional investment in the characters. We're supposed to sympathize with Thurman because of how her cohorts betrayed her, but what difference does it make when she's as much of a cold, ruthless killer as they are? Okay, so she doesn't hurt children. Big deal. She is drawn way too thinly to give us any reason to root for her.<br/><br/>You can love or hate ""Pulp Fiction,"" but you cannot possibly accuse it of being predictable. And the characters, while amoral by our standards, have definite human qualities--one of the most telling scenes is when John Travolta says he's going to go home and have a heart attack. It's the type of thing an ordinary person would say in that situation, and it makes you forget that he's a hit-man. I can't figure out why anyone would think that brilliant film is in any way comparable to ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1,"" which is sorely lacking in the witty dialogue that Tarantino is famous for, and which has none of the richness and complexity of ""Pulp Fiction"" that invites repeat viewings and helps you overlook the fact that you aren't sure what the point of the story is.<br/><br/>I also think the violence in this film is excessive. That may seem a strange thing for a Tarantino fan to say. But don't confuse violence with shock: Tarantino is a master at manipulating audience reaction, even when he isn't showing things anywhere near as graphically as he could. A classic example is the needle-to-the-heart scene in ""Pulp Fiction."" We never see the actual impact, but we do feel it.<br/><br/>The stylized gore of ""Kill Bill"" is a lot less interesting, in my view. It's one thing to show Thurman chop a character's arm off. It's quite another to show a geyser of blood, making it look like the character's body is literally being drained--then, a while later, finding out that the character is not only still alive, but fully conscious and lucid. The rules of this film's universe are so arbitrary there's no point in even talking about suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>The sequel is a vastly superior film, filling in the character motivations, suspense, and humor that the first film so desperately needed. Tarantino could have condensed the events of the first film into fifteen minutes and made the entire story into one long film, which actually would not have been that long. Why did he make the first film as he did, probably turning off many of his former fans? At least he was trying something new rather than simply rehashing his old ideas, but this time the experiment was a failure."

The party consists of ten, including the bride's unborn child. However...they only manage to kill nine. After coming out of a coma of 4 years, the bride is on a hunt for revenge.

"Buddy-51","Null","7","14","5 December 2004"," cool, stylish, empty
","Quentin Tarentino's 'Kill Bill, Volume 1' is the perfect film for today's 'trendy chic' movie going audience. Casual in its violence, flashy in its visuals, and conspicuously lacking in content and theme, the film is a genuine triumph of style over substance and a testament to the art of 'cool.' Here is a film so self-consciously arch and emotionally detached that it plays more like a live action cartoon than a drama set in anything remotely resembling the real world (in fact, one section of the movie literally is a cartoon). The 'plot' is, essentially, one long drawn out revenge scene with Uma Thurmon as a young woman systematically seeking out and killing a band of assassins who left her, her unborn child, and her entire bridal party for dead on the day of her wedding. <br/><br/>Yet, what person in his right mind goes to a Tarentino film in search of a meaningful storyline? Indeed, the thing that counts in a Tarentino work is the director's obvious love for both movies and movie-making, a love which is visible in every frame he commits to film. 'Kill Bill' is Tarentino's affectionate homage to the martial arts epics in which characters defy the laws of physics and gravity as they perform their deadly kabuki-type ballet with knives and swords. In this pastiche of ninja melodrama and Japanese anime, at least half the film's running time is spent on elaborately staged swordfights and kickboxing sequences, all of which are filmed with the utmost brio and verve. The violence is, indeed, gory and graphic - with dismemberments galore and fountains of spurting blood - but so preposterously overblown that the violence eventually becomes abstract and thus doesn't offend us much while we're watching it. Thurmon doesn't have much of a chance to develop a character here, but the steel-eyed intensity combined with the strange sense of vulnerability that she brings to the role makes her fascination to watch nonetheless.<br/><br/>Yet, for all its cinematic joie de vivre and visual inventiveness, there's something a bit unsatisfying about 'Kill Bill Volume 1' after all is said and done. Perhaps it's the fact that the film feels so much like a clinical exercise in style that it lacks the power to really draw us into its world. We watch it with an air more of detached bemusement than of emotional involvement. Perhaps, too, the absence of anything much going on beneath the surface leaves us with little of substance to take home with us once we've left the theater. I suspect that this is the very effect Tarentino is going for here - that if we were made to care deeply about anything that was happening on the screen we would somehow be violating his code of 'coolness,' that we would be simply reacting to movies with the kind of programmed emotional responses the director is clearly militating against. The problem is that, while we can appreciate all that on an intellectual level, we are still left feeling relatively empty and unfulfilled by movie's end. Perhaps, the completion of the story in Volume 2 will help to rectify that condition."

First of all, there is barely any plot. A woman loses everthing and his shell-bent on revenge. Who-hoo. To a degree the nameless main character is pityable. But ultimately she is simply detestable. She was an assassin for a snake-themed assassin gang, code name black mamba.<br/><br/>In the opening scene, she is on screen bloodied up and then Bill shoots her in the head. Instead of killing her, she goes into a coma for four years and wakes up and just wants to kill everyone. I was in sheer disgust within the first fifteen minutes. She kills the mother of a four year old daughter in her house and then leaves non-challant and its just stupid. Since when is this kind of cold-blooded murder entertainment?<br/><br/>The film makes no attempt to be realistic, as blood is spewed from every wound. This is quite probably the most blood-filled movie ever made. The movie gets more and more pointless, skipping around time. The murder of the mother at the beginning happens after the end of the film chronologically. Showing copious amounts of blood the whole way.<br/><br/>There is and oddly out-of-place anime sequence detailin the history of Lucy Liu's ""ren Ishei"" The animation isn't very good, and it is only there because a nine year old girl was required for the scene and it was far too (needlesly) violent.<br/><br/>The movie only becomes dumber. Uma Thurman fights a room full of 200 people and surives, and the room is drenched in blood afterward. One of Oren's henchwomen disembowels a man merely for asking if she likes Ferraris.<br/><br/>The dialog is awful. Especially a stupid pointless scene in a restaurant where ""the bride"" gets her sword. The characters curse and swear pointlessly. It's all acted well enuff. There is a disgusting scene around the time the bride wakes up, where a nurse rapes and prostitutes The bride while comatose. ""Buck"" thankfully gets what he deserves from the bride, but it's hard to root for her.<br/><br/>I'll also point out that if she was in a coma for four years, her muscles would be atrophied and unusable, but that is convieniently ignored. Basically, it sucks. A two out of Ten"

","This has got to be the bloodiest movie I have ever seen. The special effects of the blood spurting out and the body parts lying all over is something that I have just never seen before in a movie. There is also nice martial art action if you like that. So good for ""Special Effects"" & the choreographer.<br/><br/>But the plot is almost non-existent. One wonders what screenwriters who write movies like this do with their time. Most of the time in the movie is alloted to choreographers doing martial arts and special effects squirting blood and spreading body parts around.<br/><br/>There are no plot twists or intrigue or mystery in this film. The only thing that could be construed as mystery is why all the killing started in the first place, but that question never gets answered in this movie. But there is obviously a sequel because she doesn't finish all her killing. There's more to come. More blood squirting & body parts to be scattered around I suppose.<br/><br/>I guess I'm just another one of those ""simpletons"" that just didn't get it. I was looking for some plot development where the screenwriter would have to earn his fee. But here I guess Tarantino, being director as well as writer (along with Thurman - notice she had never written for the screen before) was more interested in displaying his directorial capabilities (???) than as a screenwriter. It just hit me - Tarantino was already being paid as the director, so why should he spend much time writing - that would just double his workload for what would probably be the same fee.<br/><br/>From a more serious viewpoint, it is a sorry indication of how far downhill society has gone when people are so highly entertained (rating of 8.3 at this writing) with such low emotion. I was actually laughing at the blood squirting, but I would rather be laughing at a true comedy. Perhaps the blood squirting was meant to be satirical in some weird perverted way. Romans were entertained by feeding Christians to the lions. Through the nineteenth century public executions were considered entertainment. This movie, ""Kill Bill"" is a throwback to those sadistic emotions and I would that society were headed in the other direction.<br/><br/>I give it a 2/10 for the martial arts & special effects because those are not features that attract me to a movie. Lack of plot & lack of concern for real entertainment take it to a 1/10."

Sure, the squirting blood was funny in Monty Python, but as with everything in comedy, it's only funny the first time, and then it just gets lame and pretentious.  Tarantino tries to make a homage to martial arts, anime and all sorts of B flick movies, but one gets the feeling that he never understood the soul of those movies.  Martial arts movies are fun to watch because there isn't too much blood, some anime are great because they have good storylines and B movies are fun just because they have over the top dialogue and silly stories. While I have never seen other Tarantino movies, this one doesn't motivate me to run towards my nearest Blockbuster.  As someone else said, this is only a ""juvenile fantasy"" unworthy of the films that it pays homage to. Tarantino's ""style"" is an endless amount of bloodwash and gore, mixed with stolen shots. It is B movies rehashed, but even a homage needs some hint of originality. Unfortunately, Kill Bill sadly lacks in that aspect.  The worst part of all of this is that our society is so inured and cynical that we can somehow find this entertaining.  What a sad commentary on American pop culture."

","It is depressing to see, looking at the ratings profile of the online voters, how little people seem to appreciate well made films. This movie appropriates every but of grindhouse, martial arts, spaghetti western and comics tropes that Tarantino finds cool. It's cool for cool's sake. He seems to think the audience will sit around and get their jollies off placing which movie every cool moment comes from.<br/><br/>Harmless fun? I don't see how it's either, and that's a pretty good take on his films in general. Those things that he finds cool were interesting because of the CONTEXT in which they happened. The story, the actors, the sets, the direction all came together to create something that was special. You can't just cut and paste it into something that has none of the original elements and think it works. Or that it isn't insulting to the original creators. They worked long and hard to accomplish that and he thinks his cut and paste is homage. It's a huge, freakin' insult.<br/><br/>It's depressing that so many obviously think as he hopes they will. But what's with his, ""I've opted out of understanding the laws of physics?"" Are people so mindless that they just don't care? Same criticism as above, martial arts films became what they were because of people that worked long and hard at their art. A trampoline and some pulleys works just as well for you? How dead behind the eyes do you have to be to enjoy this? He does that in every movie he makes. A gunshot will send up a wall of liquor bottles, forget that in a convenience store most of all of it would be 80 proof and that doesn't burn with a torch held to it, let alone a single bullet. Is it that people are too stupid to know better? Does he know better?<br/><br/>So, I would submit that if you find it cool to be cool for cool's sake as he is doing here, that you should think seriously about the title of this review. Your cool icons wouldn't ever have existed in a world dominated by people that would enjoy this movie. Do you want more of that in the world, or less? If you breed, there will certainly be less of it.<br/><br/>Another Tarantino black mass for the brain damage and soccer addled."

Uma Thurman is a horrible actress. And in her leading role, she is in a coma for several years, and then wakes up to kick some baddies, and is completely invincible. The ironic thing is; the fight scenes are terrible. The movements are so stock and regular for a martial arts movie - and the blood looks silly.

There were some serious parts, some facetious ones and some fantasy ones, which just did not work. Any one style would have, but three did not. It was, at times, samurai, gangster and drama movie, and again, any one of the three would have been fine - but only one.<br/><br/>The constant change of styles was bad enough, but even many individual scenes were poorly done, independently of anything else. In combination, they meant that the movie, which actually started out moderately well, deteriorated into a series of scenes that worked badly on their own and terribly in combination.<br/><br/>I know that everyone loves this film.

Hollywood is infamous for copying everything foreign, and trying to recycle it into an English version adapted for the American audience.<br/><br/>This is exactly what Tarantino does with his incessant plagiarism. Kill Bill is just a copy and paste of an oriental movie (cant remember the name). This ""director"" loves all the bizarre B-movies from abroad. To me duplication simply defines a complete lack of talent, a lazy attempt to play director. And indeed, I have never been impressed with anything that comes out of Tarantino.<br/><br/>Quentin's work is mindless and unintelligent in my view.

Welles and Ford never got that type of billing and Hitchcock didn't earn it until his fiftieth film. Not QT, he's a phenom. I however must respectfully disagree.<br/><br/>Bill is very colorful and surreal most of the time which dilutes its effect, kills the realism and turns the characters into solemn cartoon characters. Tarantino's dialogue is his typical profanity laced paragraphs that nuanced slightly could be interchanged with all his other profanity laced scripts of threat and bravado. His visuals go from tedious posing to nostalgic kung fu chaos seasoned in buckets of blood. They have the sophistication of a disturbed 9 year old who has troubles staying within the lines of his coloring book. In addition to Thurman's Eastwood sex change he evokes the style and pacing of the lumbering work of Sergio Leone from start to finish. As a comic book Kill Bill 1 would be a page turner.

We had every gimmick thrown at us. Cartoon sequences, black and white sequences, slow motion sequences but nothing could make this film interesting.

","The trademarks of Quentin Tarantino's movies are well known: smart dialogue; self-awareness of popular culture (from the banal to the arcane); cinematographic innovation; ultra-violence; and a pervading air of cool. After the runaway success of his first two movies, his third film 'Jackie Brown' traded some excess of these qualities for a bit of conventional characterisation: I liked the result, although hardcore fans were disappointed. But for his fourth film, Tarantino has moved in the opposite direction. 'Kill Bill', a homage to Asian martial-arts films, sees Tarantino at his most stylised, and is as stupid as its name. The wafer thin-plot sees a female assassin out to kill those who wronged her; and little happens except for an improbable sequence of slayings. The sad thing is that there are many little touches that delight in this movie, Tarantino has not lost his mastery of the art of film-making (at least, not in the detail); but devoid of any rational context, it adds up only to showing off with blood. While Uma Thurman, in the lead role, is wooden, failing to convey either human emotion or cartoon menace. What's really unforgivable, however, is that instead of dazzling us with a quick punch, Tarantino made a film so long that, in spite of its essential vacuity, it had to be split into two movies to make it a commercial proposition. And I'm really not sure I'll be bothering with volume two."

Actually it is not a sequel. Tarantino just split the film in 2 because it would have been extremely long.<br/><br/>Sorry for the people who likes this movie, but to me it sucked. It has no plot at all. It is just a woman who came from a 5 years period coma miraculously and wants to take revenge and kill every former partner of her mafia brotherhood. All you can see in this movie is blood, blood and blood, violence, brutality (even in front of little children) and some ridiculous scenes. Also there is about 15 min. of anime for no reason, that I watched unwillingly. I love anime but if I rent a movie with real actors I want to see real actors, not stupid cartoons! And the anime scene is just the 1000-times-seen scene of ""You are a kid hidden under the bed scared to death while your parents are being killed in the same room"".<br/><br/>When I told my sister ""This movie sucked"" she asked me ""but had you read about Tarantino?"" Come on! A movie is something you just watch, you must not need to read about the director, or the movie or anything. The movie must be enjoyable itself! My sister also said ""With the martial art scenes Tarantino wanted to tribute Bruce Lee because he loves him""... Sorry, Tarantino, but you did not make any Bruce Lee tribute at all.

I felt that exactly the opposite was true.<br/><br/>While Pulp Fiction still has the ability to elicit feelings of appreciation for its fresh, new approaches after many viewings, Kill Bill left me with the impression that I had already seen more of it than I would have liked to.<br/><br/>There are some plot holes that are weakly patched, and some scenes that were apparently intended to be eye-popping bloodbaths of combat with Samurai swords. There is even a Japanese Anime portion inserted unexpectedly into the movie, which is interesting in its own right, but seems to draw the viewer out of the film rather than more deeply into its plot.<br/><br/>At one point, possibly as an apology for the blatant (almost funny in its exaggeration) bloodbath, Tarantino switches from color to a black and white format. While the switch to b/w, as well as the change to Anime, might be considered examples of Tarantino's brilliant, renegade movie-making style, here they come off as weak props, manipulating the viewer's commitment in an effort to keep us watching a little longer.<br/><br/>I did stay with the film to the end. I also followed it with a viewing of Kill Bill 2. My impression did not change much over the course of the entire viewing.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is an attempt to make a Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western, with the fragile-looking Uma Thurman as the macho protagonist. Uma does look striking in her leathers, and carries off the performance with style. But she is not convincing as a fighter, no matter how strong and sharp her steel blade might be. The believability factor is stretched so thin at one point, Uma takes on a large group of trained fighters all at once, and of course, whips them like so many playthings. They spew a lot of blood, and die spectacularly. So what.<br/><br/>I will probably enjoy Pulp Fiction many more times. I won't be watching any more Kill Bill."

The only advantage he has over the original era seems to be a better quality of film stock.<br/><br/>Plenty of reviews praise the ""originality"" of this movie. The people writing those reviews are nitwits. This is arguably the most derivative piece of hackwork I've ever seen.

And if Tarantino, or other pseudo-intellectuals, want to dignify this con-job with the name of ""homage,"" it doesn't change the facts. There's a reason that schlock-fests like this went out in the 1980's -- audiences outgrew them. Well, apparently a new crop of teenage boys need the lesson taught again. Too bad.<br/><br/>The entire plot is predicated on a revenge for a crime we get no background on. the victims and the perpetrators are essentially nameless, free of anything more than comic-book level characterizations.

"PAolo-10","Null","5","9","25 November 2004"," Kill Quentin
","It's not by chance that the credits give this the honor of being the '4Th Tarantino Film', 4 being the number associated in some parts of Asia with death. But it's not the abundance of gory executions the ominous number should be referred to, but rather the final demise of any creativity that this bold icon of shoddy plagiarism represents.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is the ultimate exploitation movie, and reflects all too well the complete lack of ideas of this era of Hollywood globalization that which until now we thought was best portrayed by the Matrix trilogy. Kill Bill takes the omnivorous homogenizing machine one step further the 'tribute' into 'cut and paste' land. At its worst, the movie is a repetitive cartoon.<br/><br/>At its best, this is a clever pastiche of spectacular scenes all of which give the viewer an uncomfortable feeling of 'déjà vu'. But indeed, that's what many film viewers like to pay for anyway, as the 'tell all' movie trailers of late seem to indicate. No surprises, lavish special effects. The problem is that Tarantino never gets even close to the spontaneity of the many low-budget flicks he tries to imitate. Sure, it's possible that the protectionist US movie and cartoon market has saved many viewers from experiencing the original versions of Quentin's 'tributes'. And the product is definitely sleek and polished, but who wouldn't have achieve such shine with the power of the then almighty dollar? <br/><br/>Like Stone in 'Natural Born Killers' Tarantino switches back and forth between 'real' and cartoon reality. Unlike Stone's stylish MTV era animation, here we have only apparently more appropriate anime-style gore-fests. The graphic style is reminiscent of early seventies anime, but the action is all 'Okuto No Ken'. The use of sharp, overexposed black and white for the grisliest scenes is excellent, but wait, where did I see that?<br/><br/>The Japanese scenes are pathetic at best. They really look like the product of a fanboy, who oh-so-desperately tries to recreate the texture of his wet dreams, failing miserably at giving it a life of its own. The icon for this effort is Lucy Liu's casting as O-Ishii 'cottonmouth', as clumsy on the set as she is desperately trying to utter Japanese that doesn't sound completely inadequate to any minimally proficient viewer. Here the director loses a great opportunity to dub the less-than-capable actress with a Japanese voice actor, maybe with intentionally poor lip-sync. Now, that would have been clever, and would have also spared my ears. The 'best of worst' performance is however the 'table speech' at the Yakuza conference (I suspect the only research done for Kill Bill was adding Black Rain to the movies-to-copy pile). Thankfully Liu delivers the speech in English. Too bad she is lousy at that, and, in any case, we heard that stuff from Honey Bunny, in a better movie. Ironically Tarantino is at his best when staying away from Asian-themed schlock and indulging instead in sharply exposing the Ugly American. The Texas scenes are memorable, as the ugliness of the hospital comatose rape word. Unfortunately even that's where self indulgence and self referencing abound. The Pussy Wagon reminds nostalgic viewers of Zed's chopper, and the hospital ward his dungeon. Unfortunately, in show business you can pull that kind of trick once: the second time, sorry, you are repeating yourself, albeit stylishly. <br/><br/>I resisted watching this embarrassing excuse for movie until both DVD editions where in the cheap movie rack. Now I wish I waited a little longer."

In my (bold and arrogant) opinion Tarantino has taken just too much out of this film to see it as a reference. Some examples: fight in the snow, dividing the film in chapters, the kill list, the cartoon (images in Lady Snowblood, anime in Kill Bill), the extreme education both the Lady and the Bride had to suffer (and while we're comparing: after seeing ""Lady Snowblood"", Beatrix's education looked like kindergarten), the big fight in an establishment (okay, the opponents weren't masked, but the next scene was set at a masked ball)... I'm sure I left out a few. As I was watching ""Lady Snowblood"", my respect for ""Kill Bill 1"" dropped by the minute. There are way too many comparable scenes for it to be a homage: the nicest I can be is say it's a remake. Oh, and I know that ""Lady"" and ""Bill"" aren't the only revenge films out there, but isn't it a coincidence that so many references are out there?<br/><br/>Which brings us to Meiko Kaji, the actress who starred as ""Lady Snowblood"" and ""Female Convict Scorpion"" (of which the song ""Urami Bushi"" can be enjoyed on Bill's soundtrack). It would be unfair to compare Lady Snowblood to The Bride, but life isn't fair, so here we go. While Uma Thurman does her best, a Meiko Kaji she ain't. Kaji had it in her to combine the looks of Venus and Medusa, which is pretty rare. By contrast, Uma Thurman's character resembles the Lady as much as Uma's version resembled the real Emma Peel.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, I liked ""Kill Bill vol 2"" better. I know that the dialogues are pretty weak at times (a real problem for Tarantino, by the way), but it's the first time I could see this director do more than make references to films he liked. ""Kill Bill 2"" is made as an Italian western (Ennio Morricone has vowed to kill anyone who'll still call these films 'spaghetti westerns') and you sort of feel this as you watch the film. The other Tarantinos felt like juxtapositions of references, but in ""Kill Bill 2"" there's a story, a coathanger, that guides you through the film. If now Tarantino learns how to write interesting dialogues, he actually might be able to make an excellent film. As long as he learns that copying references only works as long as people haven't seen the real deal.<br/><br/>Now it just feels like you've watched ""Psycho"", the Gus van Sant version."

","Kill Bill is just another piece of over-hyped fanfare with no real merits. Like many of QT's other products, there is a shock-value installed through violence which does nothing but make the film gratuitously brutal.  If you remove all graphic scenes from KB you are left with a sadly inept script, bad acting and a ""funky"" if not cacophonous soundtrack (sound like Reservoir Dogs?).   Luckily for us, QT knows Americans can remember violence much longer than great writing so he can reap his rewards.  I'm not even going to compare this film to the thousands of Asian KungFu knockoffs.  Everyone knows a Hollywood-produced movie will succeed if it's the first time an American audience ""discovers"" it (The Matrix, Jackie Chan flicks, etc -- none of which are consdiered novel by HK cinema standards)..<br/><br/>Why can't QT make a picture with the qualities of other acclaimed directors like Kubrick, whether it's visual (2001), dialogue-driven (Paths of Glory) or both (A Clockwork Orange)?  Leave the violence behind and jump on a more creditable bandwagon..."

","I enjoyed ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" so I thought Tarantino's latest flick would be something that I could enjoy on a sunday night.<br/><br/> Maybe the theater I saw the movie at had something to do with my negative reaction to it. The theater was full of faux hip movie goers who laughed at every cross film reference, blood spewing limb severing and any lines that even bordered on being witty.<br/><br/> This was supposed to be a homage, of sorts, to Tarantino flicks. I guess an amalgamation of B movies can be called a homage, I call it lazy and uninspiring.  There's the battle of blue leaves which is reminiscent of the 100 agent Smiths in the Matrix Reloaded.<br/><br/> They are all wearing masks like Bruce Lee in the Green Hornet.<br/><br/> Now, why anyone is supposed to think a reference to the Green Hornet is brilliant or even a sly reference is beyond me. Donning Bruce Lee's ""Game of death"" suit may have been inspired by nostalgia, but beyond that, it doesn't add anything to the movie.<br/><br/> Plus, the action scenes in the movie are old hat. I've seen these moves before in the Matrix, Blade, Crouching Tigert and even Charlie's Angels. Uma flying through the air to land on a balcony?<br/><br/> Seen that in CTHD. Uma utterint witticisms while kung fuing multiple attackers? Seen that in Charlies Angels. Uma wielding a sword in blurring movements? Seen that in Blade 2. Animation blended with human portrayals of violence? I've already saw that in a movie called Natural Born Killers.<br/><br/> The fight between Uma an Lucy Liu is not exactly groundbreaking either. Two people fighting in the snow? How does this become one of the great scenes in cinema history?<br/><br/> I left the theater feeling like I had wasted my money.  I didn't share the gushing emotions of the would be hipsters that left the theater, gushing about how ""cool"" and ""mind blowing"" this flick was.  The next time it's decided that audiences are expected to hail a below average flick as brilliant..someone be sure and let me in on it.<br/><br/> Because it's obvious that I missed the memo on this one."

The battles are fun, captivating, and (sometimes) as artistic as anything in ""Hidden Dragon..."" or Jackie Chan's best, but there isn't really anything to sustain the tension between scenes.<br/><br/>""Bill"" is just a cliched bad guy, shown only in below-the-neck profiles, rubbing his scabbard. And QT fails to draw the other gang members with any more detail. There's a long narrative scene about O-Ren Ishii's (Lucy Liu's) rise to power--but it's just a narrative, as dull and dry as listening to someone read from the Congressional Record --and with as little to do with the rest of the film, too.<br/><br/>And that's the next problem: there are five or ten different directorial styles in the film and there's nothing tying them together. It plays like a series of movie shorts on the same topic (violence in gangster/samurai films) narrated by the same person. I'm convinced the only reason the O-Ren scene remains in the movie was that QT wanted to try his hand at anime. It doesn't appear to have its own place in the movie.<br/><br/>Like Wagner's Operas, ""Kill Bill"" has some great moments and lousy half-hours. Unlike Wagner, I'm not inclined to return after the intermission to see ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2."""

"Hey_Sweden","9","6","12","17 February 2012"," Escapism of the highest order.
","Described by writer / director Quentin Tarantino as ""a 'duck press' of the grindhouse cinema he'd absorbed over 35 years of his life"", ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" serves as an exhilarating, wild, genuinely visionary epic tale of a character concocted by himself and Uma Thurman. Uma plays ""The Bride"" (whenever her real name is uttered, it's bleeped out, to help accentuate her ""Man with No Name"" quality). The Bride had tried to quit the organization for which she worked, and get married, but boss & lover Bill (David Carradine) sent his lethal international hit squad to eliminate her and everybody at her wedding party. We follow this character as she determinedly hunts down each and every person who did her wrong, and dishes out some thoroughly enjoyable revenge. Tarantino funnels the various martial arts pictures, spaghetti Westerns, and anime that he's admired into one distinct and potent stew, made in a great comic book style, executed with panache and divided into various chapters in a ""Pulp Fiction"" manner, moving back and forth in time, and the pieces are never, ever hard to put together. This is fun and exciting story telling that never shies away from the red stuff, with KNB delivering splatter so unabashedly over the top that it's endlessly amusing. Tarantino's use of soundtrack music is extremely eclectic; what original music there is, is composed by The RZA, but tracks from a rich variety of composers & artists - Bernard Herrmann, Charles Bernstein, Frank Mills, Quincy Jones, Isaac Hayes, Luis Bacalov, Zamfir, Tomoyasu Hotei, Riz Ortolani,and Ennio Morricone make for an excellent listen and a soaring accompaniment to the action, which culminates in a breathless, amazing job of swordplay as The Bride takes on scores of henchmen. The cast is just a pleasure to watch, with Uma an utter delight; it's also fun to see Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Liu as her intended victims. In fact, the whole cast, also featuring Julie Dreyfus, Michael Parks (once again playing Earl McGraw), Chiaki Kuriyama of ""Battle Royale"" fame, and Michael Bowen as sleazy creep Buck (as in ""I'm Buck, and I'm here to..."") is a blast. Michael Madsen briefly sets up his role for Volume 2, and Carradine is only present as a voice at this point; Tarantino having originally envisioned this as one long movie that got broken up into two parts for theatrical release. It's a particular treat to see martial arts legend Shinichi ""Sonny"" Chiba as the old sword maker who takes a liking to The Bride and is sympathetic to her mission. Even at an hour and 51 minutes, the pacing here never flags, and the movie is just plain fun, with a delightful contribution by musical act The 5, 6, 7, 8's who perform covers as well as their own songs. Right from beginning to end, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" kicks a whole lot of ass. Nine out of 10."
"kgdakotafan","10","6","12","1 October 2009"," Kill Bill-my take
","I was extremely excited to see this movie, because I am starting to get into Quentin Tarantino. I was pleasantly satisfied with this film. From what I understand (although the only other Tarantino movie I've seen is Reservoir Dogs), this movie isn't like his other movies because his other movies capture real life violence, and as Quentin says, ""This is the kind of movie characters in his other movies would go to see."" This is because the characters in his other movies are very violent, and they would want to see movies that are violent in a comic book way (Tarantino is excellent at dramatic sampling, and one of the great things he does in this movie was add an interesting black and white cartoon sequence for Lucy Liu's character). This movie is also divided into sections which also adds to the comic book feel.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where you are constantly being reminded that it's a movie with its comic book feel, whereas with a film like Resorvoir Dogs there is less genre and cinematic sampling and the audience gets the feeling they are watching real life being portrayed on screen. <br/><br/>I can't capture my enthrallment with this film. I felt Beatrix ""The Bride"" Kiddo's (Uma Thurman) hate throughout. The sound effects and music were very oriental and captured the cinematic and classic 70's Asian feel. One can definitely tell that Quentin is a film geek. There is so much influence in this film: Spaghetti Western, 70's Kung Fu TV show, and some Brian Depalma thrown into the mix. Quentin even says that he takes the best parts from movies he loves; therefore showing the average movie-goer why he has always loved it so much."

The story is about a woman who seeks revenge from his old group of assassinates who killed her friends and child on her wedding day. And revenge gets a new meaning from this slasher movie. I must admit that who are not onto blood and gore should not this movie at all because it contains some very gruesome scenes of body parts flying and blood spurting like fountain. As for the performances, Uma Thurman is my favourite since i saw Pulp Fiction, she is the soul of the movie. You cannot imagine anyone except Uma for this character of the bride. Lucy Liu was terrific and better than ever in this flick though i liked her in Charlie's Angels also. Vivicia A Fox was very Good same goes for Daryl Hannah.

","Warning!!! Spoilers!!!<br/><br/>As the title reads, it truly tells the whole guidelines of the film. This film is a cross mix between Segio Leone's spaghetti westerns and Akira Kurosawa's old samurai films, and Matrix visual effects are added. Uhm...interesting. Well, here's what I have to say. This is truly one of the best action flicks that I have witnessed. This film may be filled with excessive blood and gore, that is quite unrealistic, but it is a impressive piece of work. This is the first Quentin Tarantino film I have seen, and i love it! <br/><br/>The film starts off black-and-white, with a blood soaked bride who begs not to be killed, but is shot in the head anyway. Four years pass, and she's in a hospital, awaking after a gunshot wound to the head. (This film is totally out of order, like Pulp Fiction but this is how it should be in order). She gathers herself together to realize what has happened and escapes the hospital. Meanwhile, after escaping th hospital, and now fully gathered herself together,r she has a quest of vengeance to kill a list of people who have slaughtered her wedding. One by one, she picks them off with her special fencing and karate abilities, making unbelievable action sequences, comical, and intense. The story unfolds from hear on, her quest of revenge, only armed with a sword that speaks for her violent temper! <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is a fabulous director. he knows his humor, his drama, and blood-soaking action/violence, and unexpected twists. Truly, Quentin Tarantino is one of the best directors ever! Uma Thurman is totally an outstanding actress! My overall rating, a definite 10 out of 10!"
"Johnny0581","10","6","12","8 March 2005"," Kill Bill vol 1.....Tarantino's back!
","Tarantino's first movie of the new millennium is nothing short of a classic masterpiece, like all of his movies of course! This one in particular is filled to the brim with tributes to old Kung-fu chop-socky films, Japanese movies, and anime, and of course the usual pop-culture references, a staple to every Tarantino film.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a rather disturbing look at the main character known as The Bride played by the fabulous Uma Thurman, and the title character, who we do not see but hear his voice on this volume, Bill. Later we figure out the story is all about a woman who wants nothing but revenge on the people responsible for beating the living crap out of her on her wedding day while she was pregnant, killing everyone who was there that day, putting a bullet in her head and leaving her comatose for four years. The responsible ones, besides Bill are the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The squad members in order of appearance are Vernita Green, played by the gorgeous Vivica A. Fox, Oren Ishii, played by Lucy Liu, Elle Driver, played by Daryll Hannah and Budd, played by Michael Madsen. The Brides quest for revenge takes her all the way to the other side of the world in search of one of the members, later on returning to America and continuing her vendetta against the remainder of the squad. Yes, as you've all heard there's lots of blood and gore on this one, especially the scenes in Japan, but the movie has many laughs, some of them involving a scene of The Bride in Japan with a bartender/sword maker played by the Japanese movie legend Sonny Chiba. There's also excellent music to top it off, borrowed music of course but that makes the movie even more fun to watch as is usual in all of Tarantino's movies. There's also a very well made, and bloody anime scene in which it describes one of the member's origins.<br/><br/>I know there will be some people that will probably trash this movie for his excessive gore and violent content, but as far as i'm concerned, this is still a masterpiece, maybe not another Pulp Fiction but worthy of being in your collection if you're a fan of Tarantino's work."

"Turfseer","5","4","7","15 June 2009"," Triumph of style over substance
","There is no doubt that Quentin Tarrantino is an extremely talented director in terms of editing, cinematography and the overall look of a film. Just take the extraordinary scene in Kill Bill, amazingly choreographed, where Uma Thurman dispatches over a hundred swordsman in a matter of minutes. It's simply incredible! What's more Tarrantino as one of the masters of film history, takes his knowledge of film genres and improves on each one of them. He mixes all kinds of styles including Kung Fu, Japanese Samurai and Anime, Italian Spaghetti Westerns and the Black Exploitation films of the 70s and comes up with his own inventive hybrid.<br/><br/>Despite the sheer inventiveness of Kill Bill, Vol. 1, it's really an exercise in style over substance. Tarrantino is more interested in creating an homage to these various genres as opposed to a parody. And I think that's the problem. Notice there are virtually no laughs in Kill Bill (unless you consider all the exaggerated decapitations and limbs being chopped off to be funny). Tarrantino actually takes delight in these Grade C gorefests of yesteryear and attempts to elevate these pictures to high art. Instead of trying to emulate a great master like Ingmar Bergman, Tarrantino chooses to revel in the mindless violence of Samurai swordsman and Kung Fu fighters. Most of it is harmless stuff, the kind of mindless action scenes that most adolescents will take delight in. But occasionally Tarrantino crosses the line into the netherworld of bad taste. I'm thinking of that wholly inappropriate scene toward the beginning of the picture when Uma Thurman kills one of her rivals with a young child watching.<br/><br/>It's quite clear from the outset that character motivation is virtually ignored in Kill Bill, Vol. 1. As Uma Thurman's 'Bride' dispatches members and underlings of the 'Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', we come to learn that she has taken revenge on the associates of ""Bill"" after he betrays her at her own wedding. We never learn the circumstances as to why the Bride is betrayed. Occasionally Tarrantino serves up a few surprises such as when the orderly allows 'customers' to rape the comatose Uma or Matsumoto's pedophilia (the crime lord who Lucy Liu does in). But overall there are few surprises in 'Volume 1'; we move from one revenge killing to another--all the frenzied killing scenes tend to bleed (no pun intended) into one another.<br/><br/>Vol. 2 supposedly provides the back story but what we're left with in Volume 1 are comic book characters who we simply cannot care about. Everyone is fearless as they try to do one another in. In Tarrantino's comic book world, the guardians of morality are powerless—that's why law enforcement only makes the briefest of appearances at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>When The Bride travels to Okinawa and meets her mentor, Hattori Hanzo, I found that all the pious pronouncements about the spirituality of the Samurai to be pretentious and out of place in a film that places the highest value on dismemberment for its own sake. What's more, all the serious pseudo-spirituality slows the pacing of the film down considerably.<br/><br/>Tarrantino represents the embodiment of the American cinema today. He's exciting, technically savvy with a healthy respect for the history of film. But at the same time, his films only offer up a superficial and seductive examination of evil in the world today. If Tarrantino was a comedian, he best could be likened to the Three Stooges—his adroitly choreographed gorefests are akin to the Stooges' pie-in-the-face slapstick routines. Tarrantino is the perennial adolescent continually caught with his hand in the cookie jar. Kill Bill, Vol. 1 is nice to look at but is much easier on the eyes than on the mind."
"rawise2","1","4","7","27 June 2007"," This movie utterly fails on every level
","First of all, I am not a fan of Tarantino's style. He's a One Trick Pony. His style utterly wrecks many stories. Occasionally his trick is successful, such as in Four Rooms and Jackie Brown. I know this isn't a review of those movies, but I have to say this: Tarantino's ""style"" fit exactly with Four Rooms, making the movie worth watching when the character development and writing was mediocre to poor in some cases. In Brown, his style may have added positive appeal to the movie, I'm not sure. Brown had great acting, story, actors, characters disregarding the Tarantino style. But the Kill Bill flicks had none of these things. With no acting and phenomenally bad writing, coupled with Tarantino's way-over-the-top kamikaze, slash-and-burn cinematography, Kill Bill literally S____. Kill Bill's richly undeserved popularity is an example of what spending millions on pre-release hype can get you in a society made up of herd animals (Just as in the history of Hitler and the Holocaust). Also, see the next presidential election (may the biggest spender win).

When Tarantino did his ""start in the middle, jump to the start, then skip to the end"" trick in ""Pulp Fiction"", it was refreshing. It was new. It was different. In a film with a simple plot like PF, it worked.<br/><br/>In ""Kill Bill"", the same technique is just downright annoying. I found myself thinking ""Oh...right. If it worked once, it must work every time, right?"" So far, Tarantino has a 50% hit rate as far as I'm concerned. PF was terrific. ""Jackie Brown"" was terrific. ""Reservoir Dogs"" was a load of guff, and ""Kill Bill"" has just joined RD.<br/><br/>I am neither queasy, nor disturbed by cinematic violence. But the fight in the restaurant was simply absurd. Someone might like to point out to Quentin that having gallons of blood spray up like a garden hose just looks like...well...a red garden hose spray. It's not graphic. It's not disturbing. It's not even remotely interesting. The entire fight scene in the restaurant would have been mildly interesting if two things had been done: 1) A technical adviser with some medical training to point out to Tarantino that traumatic severing of limbs results in very little bleeding since arteries go into spasm, and...<br/><br/>2) A decent fight choreographer could have been hired. You know...someone who doesn't fall for the tired old cliché of the bad guys attacking the good guy one at a time, while the rest circle around looking threatening.<br/><br/>The only decent fight scene in the movie was the last one between Uma's character and O-ren. THAT was a good fight scene, and focused on the psychological side of kendo-style combat.<br/><br/>Of course, it was marred by the fact that we already knew O-ren lost the battle because her name was shown crossed off the list in the opening five minutes of the film.<br/><br/>It is this last fight scene that allows me to give this film a 2 out of 10.<br/><br/>I don't expect ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" or ""Hero"" from Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>But when ""Mortal Kombat"" has better fight choreography - and ""Evangelion"" has more believable imagery - there's something seriously wrong."
"HotHead","3","4","7","19 April 2005"," Am I missing something here?
","I understand, from general movie scuttlebutt, that Tarantino never went to film school, but rather learned everything he thinks he needs to know about making movies from watching movies while working as a clerk in a video rental store. I was reminded of this, OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, as I watched the first hour of KILL BILL VOL. I. It was like uber deja vu - every single scene in this movie looked like another scene from another movie.<br/><br/>You know those small-time bands that turn their wanna-be mania into a career and pretend to be other, popular bands, calling their acts ""tributes?"" I think something like that is going on with The Q Man. He rocked with PULP FICTION - no doubt about that - but seems to have used up all the original thoughts he ever had about movie-making and can now only ""pay tribute"" to other directors. In other words, copy them.<br/><br/>I found this movie unbearably boring. I'd rented both volumes from NetFlix, and if I'd wanted to WATCH a Jackie Chan movie, I would have ORDERED a Jackie Chan movie. I watched the first hour of the first one and then sent them both back. Yecch. A waste of time and money."

","The world was told it was great. The world believes it is great. What a total waste of film. The only redeeming quality of this film was the well choreographed fight scenes. So, the two points I gave it actually go to the choreographer. There are times graphic images are called for and times they can be artistically portrayed. Art (in my humble opinion) is the practice of expression leaving much to interpretation thereby provoking and inspiring the audience to be involved. This film was not art. It was a lecture. Nothing left to the imagination. Every last detail explicitly laid out to the point of complete boredom. A flat declaration that there is no faith in the interpretive capabilities of the audience. And the places that the audience is left to use their imagination are more in the area of making sense of the huge holes in the film. Only one of which being where we are expected to believe that after 4 years of atrophy in a coma Uma's still capable taking a 300 pound walrus of a man (she killed him by attacking his tongue?) Taking on another man and then wheel-chairing herself outta there? Come on."

Its a big dumb film.<br/><br/>Now I did enjoy Tarantinos previous films, but this is just a big self-indulgent mess.

"Finntroll","5","4","7","5 June 2004"," Massively overrated.
","Quentin Tarantino is one of our time's most gifted directors/scriptwriters and obviously also one of the most childish. Kill Bill vol. 1 is not as much a movie as it is a mishmash of older, cooler martial-arts and samurai movies from the 70's. The story is simple and can be summarized in one word: revenge. in fact the whole movie can be summarized in one word: copy.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman plays the woman who's craving revenge, and a pretty bloody one too. The first scenes are actually crap really. Some of the worst dialog in a Tarantino movie ever is spoken and a dull fight takes place. The good thing is that the movie doesn't get worse from here, but it doesn't improve much either. <br/><br/>The only thing that I'll remember for some time is the gruesome anime sequence, otherwise the movie is just scene after scene that's been stolen somewhere, been made to look a bit prettier but actually also to work much worse. Uma Thurman is just not very good at handling a sword, and the surreal atmosphere is more strange than anything else. I know that Tarantino really loves samurai movies but he could have made a real movie instead of making two, inferior commercials about them!<br/><br/>All in all this is one of the most overrated movies ever, and I think it's more that people want to stay loyal to Tarantino than anything else.<br/><br/>5/10"
"cruikshankster","Null","4","7","16 May 2004"," One of the only two movies I have ever walked out of.
","Let me preface my comments with the following qualification: I have very high standards when it comes to movies and Quentin Tarantino has consistently failed to meet them.<br/><br/>This film was no exception and is, in my opinion, his worst ever. Pulp Fiction had the novelty factor going for it. Now that the genre is established, one has to fall back on plot and entertainment value.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol 1 has neither plot nor entertainment value. I'm sure this was some attempt on the part of Tarantino to salute a classic genre which is equally low quality but manages to under-achieve on a fraction of the budget: B-grade kung-fu films.<br/><br/>When you're in college and you're broadening your horizons, watching B-grade kung-fu movies is a requisite activity. After you leave college however, you realize that your trappings of irony such as listening to They Might Be Giants and watching B movies is just that - trappings of irony.<br/><br/>Tarantino would have done well to leave his trappings in college but thanks to Hollywood's propensity for beating then fellating a dead horse, we have all had this insufferable piece of feces inflicted upon us.<br/><br/>Interesting cinematic genre blending and special effects do little to add to a film that has no plot and blood that sprays out of people's necks and arms like it's being pumped by a hose. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed Army of Darkness, this film is for you my friend. For those of us with taste, don't waste your time."
"captain-54","4","4","7","9 May 2004"," Well, this was pretty bad...
","I saw this last night and am glad I only rented it. I think Tarantino is a hack and a thief. Don't get me wrong, I liked resevoir dogs and the first half of that vampire movie, but 'Pulp Fiction' and this were crap to me.<br/><br/>Now, I know, I know, there are legion who think this man is a genius for taking anime to its next level and making us pay twice for it, and there may be something to that. For my part, I can only see Quentin salivating over scene after scene where two hotties battle each other in high naughty school girl film attire. The violence was punctuated by scenes more unnecessary than any segue from a modern Stephen King novel. To me this movie looks like someone loaned $140,000,000.00 and forty hot woman to a bunch of anime geeks with oxicream still on their noses and they shot this crap."

I have seen many action flicks that have gratuitous violence but at least the hero has some redeeming qualities that makes them likable. The hero an assassin is just as evil as the other assassins she is hunting down. This movie is no better than watching an ultra violent video game. Entertaining if you are the one fiddling around with the paddles making the character move on the screen but not if you are watching it. watching 5 minutes of the worst Jackie chan flick is more interesting than watching 1 minute of kill bill.

Maybe if I'd never seen a movie before, or wasn't distracted by Tarantino referencing himself. Plenty of good ideas, but strung out through a pretty boring story about characters I couldn't care less for. There's plenty of action, but eventually it becomes too much, and anything interesting that might be happening in the combat sequences is swallowed up by the ridiculous length of the scenes. It could have used some very heavy editing, but Tarantino's name carries too much weight, and (like Lucas's episode's one and two) nobody seems to have been able to convince him to make the cuts. It's still hip to love the Q.T., though. Eh. I'd like my money back, sir."

I still don't get all the blood spewing like a fire hydrant. Even in the cheesy karate flicks this is supposedly paying homage to, the special effects weren't that exaggerated. I guess I'll see volume II just so I know how it ends, even though it is painfully obvious.

"gonzofilms","Null","4","7","16 April 2004"," Overkill Bill
","Warning: Spoilers!<br/><br/>
Kill Bill plays out like a music video of violence, that for one, should not be taken seriously.  The gore, which ramps up to its climatic ending with Lucy Liu, has all the makings of a black humor.  And unlike 'Reservoir Dogs' which was a movie about pure arrogance and brutality, Tarantino wants you to laugh over the unreality of the violence which is unabashedly over the top. Endless subplots of rising to the top by exacting revenge on the bottom feeders fits the motif of your everyday revenge movie.  He charaterizes his victims' deaths in almost comic-book fashion.   When blood is shown, and plenty of it is displayed, it unnaturally flows out of the victim's bodies like office sprinkler systems.  Again, symbolic of a black humor.<br/><br/>The acting in my mind was subpar, but only due to the lack of dialogue. In one aspect, the lack of conversation keeps the movie's theme pure to its form.  In another, it reduces the movie to little more than mere visuals. The barefooted all-girl Japanese band was interesting, however the music was bad, almost to the insanely bad.<br/><br/>When a director gets notariaty, it is common for critics to compare all continuing work to whatever was his or her best film.  For Quentin, this is unfair because his 2nd film, Pulp Fiction, may be one of the best films of the last 10 years.  Unfortunately, Kill Bill, falls very short of his true gem.<br/><br/>If there are any redeeming qualities to this film, it would have to be the wonderful camera perspectives Quentin creates.  The split screen cinematography, the japanese anime (although a little bit on the long side), and the satirical representation of the samurai by having the martial arts injected with 70's music, a la ""CHIPs"" is interesting and unique.  The final fight scenes, especially the one where the some 200 plus 3-piece suited Samurai take on Uma, is a deliberate attempt by Quentin to get you to say, ""Oh S**t, this is unbelievable!""  Well, I must admit, even though it struck me as a copycat of the Matrix battle between Neo and the army of Mr. Smith's, I did enjoy the absurd battle.<br/><br/>It is in the absurdities that Mr. Tarantino excels at his craft.  And yet, Tarantino's devotion to the ""shock and schlock"" has started to unfold a familiar pattern.  Has he become predicatble in his unpredictability? Perhaps.  Eventually, he will have to change this formula, because otherwise he will have to outdo himself after every film within his thus far, limited genre, and that's usually a recipe for directorial disaster.  However, for now Tarantino seems to have a good command of the box office.<br/><br/>
The movie delivers on the mindless action that the title would suggest. So, if you are a Tarantino fan, you will not be disappointed.  But if you are a fan of a good movie, or a fan of diversity, you will be somewhat disappointed, for Tarantino fails (though just barely) on both marks.<br/><br/>Grade:  C+"
"ratfree","Null","4","7","13 April 2004"," What A Piece Of Crap!
","I saw this movie when it was in theatres and wondered why on earth anyone would spend money and put out such an effort to make such a piece of crap. A friend recently told me it was in the IMDB top 250 and I was surprised. Now that I've looked and I've seen that is so high in the list, I have to say it one more time - What a piece of crap!<br/><br/>I have previously greatly enjoyed QT movies.  Pulp Fiction is certainly one of my favourite movies.  It was an infusion of several different simultaneous plots into an entertaining, solid and complete movie.  I can't say any of these things about Kill Bill V1.  It is a vengeance movie with nothing more than a lot of fighting, a lot of blood and no reason to give a damn about anyone in the movie.  I could care less about the characters portrayed by Uma, Lucy or Vivica.  Yes, they're all hot, but that's not enough for a whole movie.<br/><br/>Unless someone offers to buy all my popcorn, drinks, a hot dog, some licorice, a box of Milk Duds AND pay for the ticket, I won't be seeing part 2 in the theatre.  If they do buy all that stuff at least I'll be so full I'll likely fall asleep."

","*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" is an arty revenge flick. Style over substance is putting it mildly. ""Kill Bill"" is no substance and all style. It hurts me to say that because this flick has all the movie elements that I would normally find quite enjoyable. A girl in a school uniform attacking with a mace and chain? Sounds great! So what's my problem? Tarantino may be a fervent admirer of exploitation movies but he doesn't have the guts to go all the way and actually make one.<br/><br/>This movie was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. This movie was made for an audience of one: Quentin Tarantino.  He is the absolute master in constantly reminding the audience that they are watching a movie. A Tarantino movie. The violence in ""Kill Bill"" is plentiful and bloody but it's presented in a stylish way that drains away the impact. In other words, you know that the violence is fake. See, it's all movie-violence! None of the blood and guts has anything to do with real life! See severed heads fly off while blood spurts out of the bad guy's necks like a Monty Python skit! You've got action scenes that switch from color to black and white, an anime sequence and Samurai Uma fighting bad guys in front of a blue screen. These and other Tarantino show-off touches dilute the violence and turn ""Kill Bill"" into a toothless, bloody comedy.<br/><br/>I'd go 5/10 on ""Kill Bill"". It did have a girl attacking with a mace and chain. I have to like it on some level. But Tarantino cannot play an action scene straight. Everything has to be done for laughs. Soon Vol. 2 of ""Kill Bill"" will be unleashed. Oh goody. So many questions left unanswered in Vol. 1. Like, where's the rest of the movie?"
"Hoodoo-3","Null","4","7","16 October 2003"," Awful!!!
","I have been a fan of Quentin Tarantino since I first saw Reservoir Dogs.  I've been a martial arts fan for over 25 years.  This movie had both, but it stunk.  You can always expect there to be a few cheesy moments in every Tarantino film.  Usually it works.  This time, it didn't.  The cheese ruined this film.  The main characters all had ridiculous nicknames.  No one in this film just bled---if someone was cut, they gushed blood like a geyser or like The Black Knight in Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  Lastly the soundtrack and sound effects were irritating and way too loud, though this might have partly been due to a hearing impaired projector operator in my local theater.      Kill Bill had a couple of things going for it, however...  The action in the fight scenes were brilliantly choreographed.  If you're going to see this movie just for the action, go ahead.  You might enjoy it if you can get past all the cartoon violence.  The other thing worth watching in this film was martial arts film veteran Sonny Chiba.  He only spent 5 to 10 minutes on the screen (if that), but he was very enjoyable to watch.  Like Christian Slater claimed in True Romance, he's the finest actor in martial arts films today!  Unfortunately though, we didn't get to see him in action. When they talked about splitting Kill Bill into 2 separate movies, I was upset that I'd have to wait several months to see how it ends.  I'm not so worried about that now.  I'll wait till Kill Bill: Volume 2 comes on cable.  The only way I'll go see it at the movie theater is if Tarantino re-shoots the ending to have Sonny Chiba team up with Uma Thurman's character against Bill (David Carradine)."
"stefano_fait","Null","4","7","11 October 2003"," you can't be serious
","Tarantino's latest movie is pure crap. Should we blame the relentless Americanization of culture or simply Tarantino's burn-out? Martial arts are neither martial nor arts anymore. Just a big, boring, and sickening Rambo-like Grand Guignol. Ironically, when American directors realised that bullets killed too fast they resorted to ju-jitsu, karate, and Japanese swords and strung out the killing thing. The sheer silliness of yakuza hitmen using a katana instead of guns or of a Chinese-American woman as their ""godfather"" do not seem to bother Tarantino. What really matters is chopping off as many heads and limbs as possible and disembowel a fair amount of people. The underlying philosophy of martial arts is completely lost but the Schwarzeneggerian nature of modern politics is finely exposed: shameless, gratuitous violence and blood-shed. I am ashamed of those 20 people or so who applauded while I am glad nobody else in the theatre followed their example. Outrageous is that Tarantino claimed he took inspiration from Sergio Leone, a remarkable Italian director who by now must be spinning in his grave with shame and embarrassment. But after all, you know, it was ironic! I'm actually still laughing.<br/><br/>ahahahahahahahahahahahahah<br/><br/>Strawberries in the Supermarket by Emir Kusturica, that's irony."

","I'm a big fan of Tarantino's movies, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were masterpieces and Jackie Brown to a lesser extent was still an enjoyable flick.  So it was with great disappointment that I was presented with his latest offering in the form of Kill Bill.  After all the hype it was always going to be difficult for this movie to live up to expectations, but in the end, it didn't come close.<br/><br/>The single, most accurate word to describe Kill Bill would be ""pointless"". Whereas Pulp Fiction was interesting on more than just a visual and stylistic level, Kill Bill does not venture past being a violent movie for violence's sake.  It is style above substance, and violence without a point to it.  The characters are drastically underdeveloped (don't take this to mean that the acting is bad, as it is not) and the audience is not really led to identify with the characters in any way.<br/><br/>The movie, whilst being visually splendid, relies far too heavily on the fact that it is a ""Tarantino Film"" to gain the critics applause, rather than concentrating on developing an interesting and compelling story (as was best achieved in Pulp Fiction.) Of course you will not find a ""critic"" who will stand up and expose the film for what it really is - a senseless portrayal of violence - for fear of not understanding Tarantino's ""underlying message"" or what have you.  On that front all I have to say is that after several years of studying film, the only point of relevance Kill Bill makes is in exposing the level to which society has become accustomed to violence. The audience in the cinema laughed out loud at the sight of people getting their limbs severed and screaming in agony...yes, hilarious.<br/><br/>Another point I would make is that the inclusion of a tacky Pokemon-esque sequence does not make Tarantino an artistic genius.  It is pure self-indulgent pretentiousness that tries to further the myth that if you ""don't get it"" you're somehow not intelligent enough to enjoy Tarantino's genius. Pure rubbish. It is quite simply a gimmick employed by someone who obviously considers himself to be an ""artiste"".<br/><br/>Of course having read this (and if you've got this far, I thank you!) it may be argued that I simply don't ""get"" this type of film.  To that I would say that violence in context is one thing and I can accept that as valid, but violence as an entire movie is quite another.  This is where Kill Bill and the rest of Tarantino's films differ.<br/><br/>Let me clarify - there is nothing wrong with this film.  It will be enjoyed by those who want to see mindless violence, and that's fair enough. But it is not a masterpiece by any means, and the Tarantino label cannot change that.  4/10, purely for its visual aspects (which it rips off from Crouching Tiger) and some inventive cinematography."

Michael Madsen is in the film for about 30 seconds, minute maximum which is a pity as he is a great actor. Instead we have ten minutes of irrelevant animation, at least 30 minutes where everybody is speaking Japanese and during a fight scene it goes black and white for about five minutes. You would think that Tarantino was just out of film school to be trying all these amateurish tricks. The editor who cut together the online trailer is a genius because he made it look like a good film, when it is far from it. The music, incidentally is also the worst I have ever heard on any film and was probably the only thing preventing me from falling asleep.

","OK, we all should know by now that Quentin Tarantino has a special affinity for blowing people's minds. In ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", he goes all out (and continued it in ""Vol. 2""). Featuring Uma Thurman as a woman out to get the people who tried to kill her, this is definitely not a movie for the squeamish. Especially with that scene in the restaurant.<br/><br/>Why make such a movie? DON'T ASK STUPID QUESTIONS!!!!!!! The point here is to have everything come together to form one giant mass of ass-kicking. And you'd better believe that everyone does just that, in a perfect homage to almost every martial arts movie in history. This is what movies with giant casts should be. Fantastic."

","This movie is a stupid and boring sequence of  rubbish. It made me annoyed and angry at its director. It contains nothing more than a strange aesthetic presentation of violence. It has no story at all. It has no meaning at all.<br/><br/>Tarantino probably has watched several ten thousand of movies in his life. I guess that in ""Kill Bill"" absolutely every single shot, every single picture is some kind of quotation from another movie, kung fu, spaghetti western, gangster stuff, Japanese trash, anime or whatever. All that stuff which is boring and intolerable.<br/><br/>
This movie is not intended for audiences, but just for himself. It's not ""personal"", it's an Tarantino-ego-movie. Nothing more.<br/><br/>He could make this movie, realize his worst ego trip for the one and only reason that he has made enough money with Pulp Fiction. Otherwise this wouldn't have been possible.<br/><br/>I can't tell how disappointed I am. If you are a great Tarantino fan, do not even think of watching this dreadful nonsense!"

","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:<br/><br/>So what do I say in my review? How wonderful, how great this movie is? Well, many Know that. It is, after all, in the top 100 films of all time. I have a hard time doing reviews on movies like this that are almost to perfect. Whatever can one say? Tarentino's Kill Bill(BOTH volumes) are fully deserving of being called instant classics. There are few movies that mesmerize this much. And really, mesmerize is the perfect word to describe the effect of the Kill Bill movies. They are simply extraordinary. But there was one thing I didn't like in volume one that was not so prevelent in two.<br/><br/>That's the violence. I enjoyed both movies but I did give Volume two a ten and this a nine. The reason is the violence. It was a bit much in the first volume. Many people I know, still have yet to see either of the Kill Bill movies because of this reason and I myself was a bit wary at first. One is a lot worse in this regard then two and even though I think the movie is fantastic in it's photography, writing, performances etc, the brutality was tough to take. I really can see how someone could NOT like this.<br/><br/>I actually prefer two a bit because of the highly charged dialog driven atmosphere. I will concede however, that it really doesn't matter which version one personally prefers-their both stunningly great movies.<br/><br/>The gore in volume one is, many times, almost cartoonish but there are still parts where one wants to say ""enough already"". It is just to much(OK it's Tarentino but still....).<br/><br/>Of coarse, many would argue that was necessary for the overall story. That is my one major gripe about volume one, otherwise I'd say it was perfect. When I say I liked two better, it wins by a smidgen anyway, and for mainly that reason, and another reason is because everything comes together in the second one. I am actually glad they were released as two separate pictures.<br/><br/>My favorite character(other then the bride)? I just don't know. I liked all of them. O'wren Ishi was an intense person to watch, Mountain Snake was so evil (kudos to Hanna, who'd have ever thought we'd see the innocent little mermaid in a role like this?) And there was something about that twisted little assistant Gogo that was (here's that word again) mesmerizing, she kind of stole the show in some ways.<br/><br/>My favorite scene may have been the fight between Liu and Thurman. Although that scene was mighty intense, it was spellbinding the way it was carried out, all that intensity against the cool, lovely wintry setting.<br/><br/>To me, the Kill Bill movies are almost to good, in that one really does not want them to end. I really would, as would some of my friends, like to see a prequel(with the SAME cast please). I'd like to know see how they all met, their various relationships with each other, what made them assassins( we do not know except for Lui). I'd like to see the love story between Bill and The Bride, I'd like to see friendships being built, each person's story. I'd like to see it all! The story of Kill Bill is to good to leave alone. Although follow ups are almost always bad, this IS Tarenteno. Hey, you never know...."
"Mulholland-95","10","5","10","9 February 2017"," The best revenge story
","The fourth movie of Quentin Tarantino has an excellent story and elements very attractive.<br/><br/>The beginning has strong scene because Bill shoots to The Bride while she tells his about her baby. The sentence: ""The revenge is a dish best served cold"", tells us the subject of revenge along of movie. The revenge is an important subject because it is an inseparable element of the humankind, from the beginnings of human history the revenge has been present in many stories.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is good because the director uses the appropriate music in the adequate moment during all movie, especially in the chapter five when we can hear funny and action music. In my opinion, the most characteristic music is the whistling and the songs of group 5.6.7.8's.<br/><br/>The Japanese culture is present in all movie: its language, its ideology, the samurai swords (katanas) and the anime animation. Really, Tarantino make one tribute to the Japanese movies with his film.<br/><br/>Despite her rancor and her angry, the bride always faces her enemies without traps and stratagems, that is to say, she fights with honor and bravery in all moment.<br/><br/>The main antagonist, in this part, is O-Ren Ishii because we see her life, from the parent's death until her own death, so we can understand the personality of O-Ren.<br/><br/>Like in others Tarantino's movies, there is huge use of blood in fight scenes, especially during the sword fights, in my opinion, this is an element strong and attractive.<br/><br/>The movie can divide in the five parts: - The chapter one (2): The bride fights against Vernita Green. - The chapter two (The blood-splattered bride): The bride stays in coma for four years, when she wakes up she begins her revenge. - The chapter three (The origin of O-Ren): The most novel part of this film, the bride tells us the most important events in the life of O-Ren Ishii, in anime animation. - The chapter four (The man from Okinawa): The bride goes to Okinawa for visit Hattori Hanzo and he gives one samurai sword. - The chapter five (Showdown at the house of blue leaves): The best part of film, the bride fights against the bodyguards, the Crazy 88s and O-Ren Ishii, using her sword.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one best movies of all time for many reasons and is a film that all people should watch."

"baumer","1","5","10","1 October 2012"," Horrible in every way
","Kill Bill is a fraud. Terrible, terrible movie! SPOILERS<br/><br/>Spoilers within this post. Enter at your own risk!<br/><br/>I just got back from the noon showing of Kill Bill in which the theatre was half full (for a noon showing, that is huge. The theatre is one of the bigger ones at the Queensway in Toronto, so it will do well this weekend). What I witnessed in that 100 minutes in the theatre can only be described as Tarantino's flipping of the bird to all of us as he looks in the mirror and congratulates himself on being the smartest man in the world. Straight up, Kill Bill is one of the biggest disappointments I have seen in my life. After masterpieces like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and other greats like True Romance, you would think that Kill Bill would live up to those lofty expectations bestowed upon it by virtue and name recognition alone. But not only has Tarantino told us all to **** off, he he has done it while laughing in our faces.<br/><br/>Kill Bill has all of Tarantino's quirky and weird trademarks in it. And it contains strange techniques that at first you think is simply an homage to a film genre. But in reality, what QT did here was get too cute and at the expense of artistic integrity. What we are left with is more Matrix style garbage, a 10 minute anime introduction to Lucy Lui's character, black and white photography for no reason and the bleeping out of the bride's name just because he can. All of this is looked at as being brilliant by the critics and those in similar circles because Tarantino has a free pass right now. His films have enamoured critics for 10 years now and this one is no different even though it is a shadow of the opulence that we are used to from him. To sum it up, this film is all style and has no substance. The style is there, but for what purpose? Why does he choose to do the things that he does? Is it just because he can? Or is it because he thinks he is so much more clever than the rest of us? You guys thought Matrix Reloaded was pretentious, this film might as well be the Architect meets Socrates meets Locke, meets Rouseau meets Japanese smart guy meets Marx. That is how it comes across. Pretentious doesn't even begin to describe it. There is even a blatant rip off of the burly brawl in this film right down to beings jumping up a flight of steps to come and meet the heroine.<br/><br/>I knew I was in trouble five minutes into the film when it just didn't feel right. You know how in Pulp you just knew you were in for something special? You just felt it with the dialogue, the acting, the soundtrack and everything that encompassed the film. Well Kill Bill has the opposite feel to it. None of that magic is present and it is just a bunch of people getting sliced and diced and maimed. There is no snappy dialogue and that is what QT is good at. Tarantino is a lyrical genius and he abandons that here and goes Wachowski Brothers on us and it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>I despised this film with every fibre of my body. Shame on you QT. Shame on you for starting to believe everything that was said about you.<br/><br/>1/10"
"derekcharles","10","5","10","19 February 2011"," A seemingly miraculous feat of technical and conceptual innovation.
","If there was one thing we knew about QT prior to Kill Bill it was that he was a perfectionist. If there was another, it was that he was a master of dialogue and character-driven film-making where his visual flourishes were expertly but subtly woven into the background of his films. Thus, when he decided to make his next feature a full-blown action film QT was not only entering new territory but was determined to show us that his mastery of the visual side to film-making was just as sharp as his mastery of the verbal side.<br/><br/>One might have argued that he was already accomplished in this respect. After all, there were moments of technical mastery such as the tracking shots in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. He gave us an extraordinary example of how split-screen technology can be used to move a story forward in Jackie Brown. His use of the camera in frenetic scenes such as the 'Mr. Pink getaway' scene was as raw and effective as the best action directors and his limited interference with the camera in the majority of his dialogue-driven scenes were indicative of a very disciplined mind reminiscent of the greats such as Hitchcock, Kurosawa, Allen, and of course Kubrick. However, QT believed (and with some justification) that action films are, from a technical point of view, the most difficult films to make well. And if he was to prove his worth as a director he would have to make it is an action director.<br/><br/>To say that QT was successful in his desire to cut it as an action director is an understatement of ""gargantuan"" proportions as Kill Bill is an action film that goes beyond any that came before it or have emerged since. Not content to toil in one of the many action sub-genres, QT bridges at least 4 genres from Spaghetti Western to Japanese Anime, seamlessly interweaving the different styles and pushing the boundaries of their conventions to the point that the viewer finds his/herself witnessing a broader yet unique and singular genre of QT's own creation. With each passing scene, QT squeezes, twists, and stretches traditional conventions to find new ways to lure the viewer into his frenetic world of pure vengeance.<br/><br/>And this is precisely what makes KB such an extraordinary film-going experience. It is the profoundly imaginative manner in which he conceives of and executes the action scenes that is the most jaw-dropping aspect to this film. This film is built on a seemingly endless series of conceptual flourishes that usurp and assimilate traditional samurai, Kung-Fu, anime, and western genre conventions onto his unique and broader platform. Take for example the moment when the bride plucks the eye out of one her assailants, signaling the film's switch from colour to black and white. The act which becomes more significant to the story in Vol. 2, is a conceptual bridge to the traditional samurai sword-play film convention of filming bloody scenes in black and white so as to avoid censorship. It is with this convention that QT heralds the imminence of blood-shed, and if the eye-plucking is anything to go by, a lot of it.<br/><br/>Of course, one mustn't limit one's review of KB to its technical innovation. It is after all a QT film and like all his films its fueled by his typical razor-sharp dialogue and dazzlingly original characters. This is of course yet another factor that raises it above your typical actioneer in that the time is taken to give each of the main characters a back-story and mutually contradicting layers. Naturally, QT's peerless casting plays a part here as he chooses actor after actors who inhabit these layered characters in ways that retrospectively speaking it would seem only they could.<br/><br/>The gang of assassins on whom the Bride is wreaking her revenge are played by an unlikely ensemble of actors who each exude a unique brand of cool which is expertly tailored for a film of this nature. Populating the background of this story are an array of characters which together with the actors who play them (e.g., Gordon Lui, Michael Parks , Sonny Chiba, David Carradine) represent a knowing and sometimes audacious nod to the genres that KB is exploring.<br/><br/>Central to the film's casting of course is Uma Thurman as both volumes of the film rest on her shoulders. Most important here I believe is that Thurman never once stops being a woman. I have found that one of the most consistently irritating features of heroine-centred films is the tendency for the woman to act like a typical male, specifically, macho hero. Nowhere in the course of this film is there a trace of this in her performance. Instead, we are given a rather interesting portrayal of a woman clinging to her revenge mission as though there was nothing else to live for. Throughout the film, she demonstrates an authentic anger, composure, emotion, and cunning that is distinctly feminine.<br/><br/>However, the real star of this film is QT. Ultimately, KB is a reflection of an intuition for film-making that goes beyond special. As the film progressed, I found myself repeatedly re-evaluating a director who I had already considered one of the greats and each time elevating his position in that hierarchy. I almost regretted that KB was 'nothing more' than an action film as films of that genre are often looked down on in acts of ignorant film-snobbery. However, like QT argues, great action films are not easy to make. They involve the choreography of words, sound, and physical movement into a unified whole. KB is a testament to this ideal and as a result it is a memorising piece of film-making that in terms of technical and conceptual innovation is matched only by 2001: A Space Odyssey and Citizen Kane. Seriously!"

","Okay, first off, I love Quentin Tarantino. One mention of the man and I light up like a Christmas tree...but I loathed this movie. Maybe it's because I grew up on roughly the same movies as Quentin, knew what to expect when he was busy name-dropping influences and got disappointed when the movie didn't deliver, maybe it's because Yuen Woo Ping's choreography here was way below par for the great man that he is...I don't know.<br/><br/>However, my best bet is that my final decision that Kill Bill 1 was godawful happened after that arm came off and ridiculous comic-book blood flew forth from the wound. I've seen my fair share of limb severances, and that was the weakest. It was all I could do not to roll off the sofa in fits of derisive laughter. Somewhere along the line, somebody forgot to mention how completely unconvincing Kill Bill is. I can suspend my disbelief in Halloween Resurrection and that movie was pretty creaky too but it was a hell of a lot more fun than Kill Bill.<br/><br/>So it's not for lack of effort, or even lack of style that Kill Bill fails. It's just the fact that the moment anyone dies it happens in such a stupid cartoon fashion that you're jolted all the way back to your sofa and you realise you need the toilet, you've got to be at work the next morning and you've been watching this damn thing for an hour and a half. For a movie in which being violent seems to be the entire point(god knows there's damn little substance anywhere else in this first two hour chunk) you'd think they could have got it right.<br/><br/>Take the violence out (which anyone who likes violent movies may as well as they will have seen five times this movie a gazillion times before) and you realise A: Uma Thurman's character is intentionally glacial and wooden, which is all well and good but makes her impossible to really root for, B: There is nigh-on no script or dialogue to speak of in this first part, and C: Most sections don't synch well with each other, giving the movie a 'Look at this! Now look at that!' feel that just hacked me off.<br/><br/>So...I'd like to see Part 2 just to find out how it all plays out, but first I've got to go and get the Ajax and a pan scourer to wash the foul taste of this part out of my mouth. I state again: Tarantino is an amazing director but everyone makes mistakes. This is his first."

"Ronin47","10","5","10","19 October 2003"," In a nutshell, the best movie I've seen in 5 years (****)
","The day I saw ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was the first time I've ever seriously contemplated staying at the theater and seeing it again right afterwards. That's because it is literally so stuffed with cool stuff that it was hard to mentally process it all. I remember that at one point near the end, I was literally trembling with anticipation of what was about to happen.<br/><br/>
Quentin Tarantino (writer and director of 3 great movies, ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Jackie Brown"", and ""Reservoir Dogs"") returns after a 6 year absence and if you need any proof that he's still got the magic touch, this is it.<br/><br/>
Unlike his other films, which were all witty, tough-talking crime dramas, ""Kill Bill"" is a martial arts movie. The ultimate martial arts movie.<br/><br/>
Uma Thurman plays The Bride (her real name is kept a mystery, and is humorously bleeped whenever anyone says it), a former assassin who is beaten and shot and left for dead on her wedding day by her old crew. She wakes up out of a coma 4 years later, escapes from the hospital and sets out on a mission of revenge against them, and especially against their leader, and her former lover, Bill (David Carradine). <br/><br/>That story is pretty old, but a good martial arts movie doesn't need any more. <br/><br/>I simply can't describe how good this movie is. I haven't been this involved in a movie, from scene-to-scene, moment-to-moment since, well, ""Pulp Fiction"". The two films are very different, but both have the same shifting time-line structure, bad-ass attitude and utterly brilliant soundtrack.<br/><br/>
Speaking of that soundtrack, I don't think I've ever seen a movie with so many moments that are a PERFECT match between picture and sound.<br/><br/>
The performances are, across the board, perfect. Everyone (including Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu and Daryl Hannah as her enemies) is completely convincing, but obviously, this is Uma's show. Her character is one of the best in the history of kick-ass, vengeance-seeking good guys. Every smile, cold stare, punch, kick, and tear running down her face you feel all the way down to your soul. <br/><br/>Yes sir, QT's still got the touch. <br/><br/>Not only is it the best of the year, it's the most invigorating, soul-stirring, heartbreaking, exciting, awe-inspiring FUN time I've had in a theater in many a moon. <br/><br/>As most people know, ""Kill Bill"" was originally intended to be one movie, but was nearly four hours long and was cut into two ""volumes"". This was the right decision, because 4 hours of this and my head might have exploded. Plus, believe me when I say that where it ends truly leaves you chomping at the bit for ""Vol. 2""."

Soon I bought the QT collection and now I have seen the movie two more times, and I will soon watch it again. Then you might wonder what's so special about it, perhaps even after you've seen it? Well for me it's the special feeling of Hong-Kong nostalgia mixed with perhaps the best soundtrack I've ever heard (the ending sequence with the pan flute music beats everything made up to date), hell I even bought the soundtracks of both movies, and I have never bought a soundtrack before. Be careful though if you don't like blood very much because there is A LOT. Yes I think that just because it's a hyped Tarantino movie it makes it even better I admit that, it gives it like an aura making it even better.

There were moments where my stomach turned, but I like that sort of reaction in some films. I did find the anime portion of the film, telling the story of Oshi's parents' murders, slightly unnerving but, my interpretation of that because perhaps having real child of that age put in that position would really freak that child out...but that's just me.

KIll Bill vol.1 is probably after Takeshi Kitano's 'Zatoichi'the best violent swordplay film ever made! The choreography of this film done by the magic Yeun Woo-Ping( i believe he did the Matrix movies and Jet Li movies) is some of the best ever done in an action film. The story you can tell has Tarantino's signature all over it from the characters to the dialogue to the hot soundtrack! I have to say my favourite thing about Kill Bill though is definitely the characters right from the Bride to the man from Okinawa. It was also good to see Darryl Hannah in a bad role for once as the crazy Elle Driver. My favourite scene is in fact not the end showdown but the beginning fight the bride has with Jeannie Bell a.k.a Copperhead which is brilliant and hilarious especially when she tries to shoot her through the cereal box and the bride gives her one right in the chest in front of her daughter. Maybe a lot would agree it's not as good as Dogs or Pulp Fiction but i loved it right from the start to the end of vol.2"
"MovieAddict2016","8","7","16","11 March 2004"," Fast, brutal, and stylish. Quentin's back.
","Quentin Tarantino's fourth feature film, ""Kill Bill,"" is a rollicking rampage of revenge. Fast, brutal, and stylish, the film reunites some of QT's favorite elements from well-known Asian martial arts films with an American twist. But have no fear, people of Japan--Quentin pays true respect to the classics of the genre, and the individuals who made them. He takes what most audiences are unfamiliar with and presents the varying shreds of material as a splendid mainstream whole (even down to segments of anime).<br/><br/>
Sure, we have had to wait for another installment because of fat cat Harvey Weinstein, who was after the big bucks when he suggested the film be split into two separate ""volumes,"" but I think I actually prefer ""Kill Bill"" as two pieces. It just builds up the public appreciation for the film and provides us with a good catcher, and a hanging end. The matinee serials that ""Indiana Jones"" paid homage to used to do the same thing--I see no true problem with it. (Although I don't feel that having to pay for extra tickets to see the rest of the movie is a move made without marketing behind it.)<br/><br/>It's been a long six years since ""Jackie Brown,"" and for Quentin, it's all been spent on trying to make this movie get made. His breakthrough was with 1992's ""Reservoir Dogs,"" one of the greatest films of all time, and his 1994 modern-day masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction"" truly named him one of the best directors of this generation. (He has proved he can also act, too, in some of these films.)<br/><br/>""Jackie Brown,"" a very good movie (but admittedly not a great one), disappointed many of Quentin's fans, and so he has spent all of this time since that feature film trying to bring ""Kill Bill"" to the screen (an idea that originated during filming of ""Pulp Fiction,"" when he created the film's tagline almost ten years ahead of schedule).<br/><br/>What he does with ""Kill Bill"" separates him from being another one-hit-wonder director. ""Kill Bill"" isn't as realistic or perhaps even as meaningful as his other films, but it's a masterpiece in its own right, filled with excessive bloody violence and revenge fantasies that come true. We all wish for a bit of revenge now and again. Some of us get it, and some of us don't.<br/><br/>The Bride (Uma Thurman) decides that she wants to get even with the people who tried to assassinate her four years ago, and she'll stop at nothing until she does. The Bride (whose real name we never firmly grasp) was massacred by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (Michael Madsen, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah) at the altar four years ago. Bill (David Carradine) was behind it all (""You find me sadistic, don't you?""). But four years pass and The Bride wakes up from a long, deep comatose. Some of her first thoughts?<br/><br/>""They killed nine people. They should have killed ten.""<br/><br/>There's not much you can say about a movie like ""Kill Bill"" without giving away important plot points or funny moments. Much of the film relies upon Uma Thurman to keep it afloat, and she impressed me very much with this movie. Some of her one-liners and deadpan expressions will go down in cinema history as some of the best--and funniest. (""Your name's Buck, and you're here to--"")<br/><br/>Tarantino has stuffed ""Kill Bill"" full of martial arts references. Tarantino (who used to work at a video store before he directed ""Reservoir Dogs"") is a huge fan of movies, and he's admitted to watching (on average) two or three a day. He's a film buff's director, a guy who actually knows something about film. Even The Bride's outfit she wears throughout much of the movie is that in Bruce Lee's final movie.<br/><br/>It's a disgrace that those Hobbits received Oscars over ""Kill Bill,"" a much more exciting, involving, and relatable movie. I'm sorry, but although I found ""The Lord of the Rings"" well made, it was also a large knock-off of other films from the genre, and I think Jackson tried to bring too much depth to a story that simply has very little. I can't relate to Hobbits and wizards on magical quests. We can all relate to revenge. And I'm going to get a lot of nasty letters for saying that.<br/><br/>But Tarantino has delivered a truly original film, and one that should have been nominated for (among others) Best Original Screenplay, Best Picture, Best Actress, and Best Director. I'm sorry, but it's true, because this is a finer and more original film than any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" installment, despite how much of an impact they have had.<br/><br/>This shouldn't turn into a rant, which is why I am going to end my review by saying that ""Kill Bill"" is a film unlike anything I have ever seen. Yep, it's pretty strange, but it's also pretty fun and extremely well made. Quentin hasn't disappointed. After leaving the theater, I couldn't wait to see ""Volume 2,"" and I'm already counting the weeks until its release.<br/><br/>5/5.<br/><br/>Top Ten of 2003: #2<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

Where QT has always used violence and mayhem to make statements about people and culture, here he has made a film about violence for the sake of violence.  I have a pretty strong stomach, but the sight of a small child's mother being brutally murdered before her eyes was too much for me. Especially when the murderer is the character we are supposed to be rooting for.  The child's reaction was played for grins, not for pathos.  Shortly thereafter another child's parents are brutally murdered in such close proximity that the child is doused with their blood.  This child seeks revenge, which leads to the single most offensive line I have heard spoken in a film:  ""Fortunately for her, [bad guy] was a pedophile.""<br/><br/>Unfortunately for us, Tarantino has lost his way."

This movie as you can tell from how many times I've said it, is pretty awesome and good. The reason why is because you feel for Uma Thurman's character. After getting so much taken away, you want to see her get back up and fight. That's the entire movie basically. An Action packed revenge epic. The reason why I say epic is because it feels big. Her journey takes her to a lot of places. Other things I really enjoyed was how the movie was told to us, and also the overall style. The ""feature presentation"" was a nice touch to the opening. The whole theme with samurai and anime inspired aspects was really cool to see play out. Overall this movie has a real action vibe to it. The only problems I have is that the movie can be a little weird with execution. Some things just didn't fit and seem right. I still however, really loved this movie. 9/10."

I knew that she will kill them all, that she will be super powerful although I don't know why (in a sarcastic/rhetoric way). For those who say that the sword is her source of powerful, I can say she managed even without it. In addition, she have the ""auto-healing"" option. She can be cut deeply, but just give her a few seconds, she will be stronger. Even the fights are boring. I extremely enjoy fights (Check ""Kingsman""),I have no problem with violence and blood. Still, I even skipped the most parts of the final ""fights"". ( I skip very rarely ) I almost get attached to all characters except her. No story whatsoever. And why would she assume that her kid isn't alive? she didn't even asked. I wasn't surprised by the last information in the movie. Someone killed in a hospital, 13 hours later, no one found out. Few months later, no one said where is the patient ( and check the country entrances and exits ) and no one bothered about Buck's car. Oh yeah, his car is invisible, just an ordinary one! A katana cut be another is rather I don't know! ( I have a katana, well I used to, when confiscated by the customs service )."
"brianberta","3","3","5","13 December 2015"," Contains a poor plot line, no character development, numerous plot holes, overly-sadistic violence, and an underwhelming and unimpressive final fight
","This could've been an amazing revenge movie, but it is ultimately brought down by numerous flaws such as plot holes, no character development, and a ton of overly-sadistic violence.<br/><br/>This story is about a woman known as The Bride who was knocked out at her wedding where most of the people who attended it, including her husband and, supposedly, her daughter were killed. After waking up from a 4-year long coma, she seeks revenge on everyone who betrayed her and attempts to murder them all one by one.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino likes to make his plot lines out of order. Usually, this is a good thing because it leaves a lot of room for re-watching his movies. In fact, that is one of the things which made Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs so good. However, it doesn't work for this movie because some of the scenes in it make no sense at all and they don't seem to fit anywhere in the plot line of the movie. It made me think that I somehow missed an earlier movie. An example of these scenes include the scene when she fights a mother and kills her in front of her daughter.<br/><br/>There is also no character development in the movie. This movie's final act requires for you to care about the characters in the film and the connection I was supposed to have just wasn't there for me. I didn't feel this because the characters aren't very developed in the film. Because of this, it was hard for me to care about any of the characters in the film, and I could care less for which ones lived and which ones died. Character development matters in films where the main character is facing death. Take this sentence and tell it to everyone who has ever thought of directing a movie before.<br/><br/>Also, there are numerous plot holes. By far, the biggest one is how the police are never called in the film. Examples of scenes in the film where the police should've been called include her killing a doctor and not even attempting to hide his body, killing a mother in front of her own child, and the massacre at the Japanese restaurant at the end. Since the film is grounded in present day, the police should have been called more often. Another plot hole in the film is how O-Ren Ishii got to the head of the Japanese Mafia despite having awful bodyguards and adequate fighting skills at best.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino likes putting sadistic violence into his movies. However, he takes it way too far here. People are decapitated, eyeballs are ripped out, young girls see their mothers murdered, and people have their limbs cut off. Some people said that the violence is presented in an over-the-top way, but I didn't see that at all. In this movie, the violence is presented in a more serious way with people screaming in agony and people wriggling around on the ground like a worm after their body parts are chopped off. This isn't fun violence. The violence here is appalling, deeply unpleasant, and viscerally disturbing. The sadism in this movie lacks any context and the movie is just being sadistic for the sake of sadism. Sadism also extends to other areas in the movie besides bloody violence such as how a doctor raped The Bride when she was in a coma, how the same doctor allowed other patients to rape her as well, and a guy getting his head slammed in a door for information until he dies. It's utterly grotesque and it makes you feel sickened after watching it.<br/><br/>Also, the fight scene at the end between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii felt very underwhelming, unimpressive, and slow-moving. I felt more suspense in the Crazy 88 fight and previous fights than that one. The problem with it is that it had long instances of them pausing and staring at each other and a couple very short scenes of them fighting each other. Because of this, it felt unnecessarily slow-moving. Also, the few instances of them fighting were unimpressive to say the least. Since that's the final fight, you'll expect that she'll have the most trouble killing her. However, I'll argue that the elite Crazy 88 and Gogo Yubari were more difficult for her to fight since they did more damage to her.<br/><br/>I will admit that there are some good parts to this film. Mainly that of the production design and cinematography. Sets are beautifully shot and gorgeous to look at. The film also has pretty great acting which is much better than what the film deserves. Also, the final few minutes are a pretty good ending and setup for the next film and the fight between The Bride and Gogo Yubari is actually pretty good.<br/><br/>However, these few and minor positive points don't overshadow the numerous flaws in the movie because it has a poor plot line, lack of character development, plot holes, sadistic violence, and a disappointing final fight. Unfortunately, because of this, I can't really recommend Kill Bill to anyone except die hard Tarantino fans and action movie and violence fanatics. Tarantino is a great filmmaker who has made many great movies in his career, but he unfortunately wasted his time and money on a self-indulgent vanity project like this one."
"mdenvee","1","3","5","17 July 2013"," KILL BILL Vol 1.. in fact kill both films.. please.
","Yet another example of creative film making which had the potential to be fantastic but ended up miserable. Kill Bill Vol 1 (and Vol 2 for that matter) is an ponderous, pretentious, overlong, disappointing revenge drama which clearly and easily could have been saved via the normal efforts of a decent story or objective movie editor who was NOT Mr. Tarantino or influenced by him. I believe Tarantino, like Lucas and many other notables, do their best work when they do not have too much control over the story and pacing. KB has many fine points- an original plot, great casting, music, great camera work. But, fails completely in the script, pacing, and yes the action sequences, which are vital to the creation of a good movie especially of this genre. The scripts were all too 'contrived', boring, irrelevant and unnatural for the characters- too brooding and deeply philosophical, which was as distracting as it was annoying. And Tarantino seems to have this arrogant assumption that we love his pretentious dialogues (and inner monologues) as much as he does. The character development was insufficient- primarily Uma's who is supposed to be such a deadly assassin yet there is little or no back story which validates this. It would have been invaluable to have included some earlier scenes with Uma as the warrior/assassin she proves ONCE (and only once) in the ridiculous Crazy 88 fight sequence- but that is a sequence which is unconvincing because watching her slice up 88 stupid bodyguards is boring. So, instead of having one of the slowest-paced movies I have ever watched, simply speed things up a little (such as that painfully slow animated O-Ren sequence and in other areas) and add in some assassin background on Uma. I enjoyed the fight scene of O-Rens personal bodyguard in Vol 1 and the all-too-short training scene in Vol 2 with the Kung Fu master, but that was not really showing Uma as this assassin, nor unbeatable swordmaster. In fact, probably my biggest pet peeve of the both KBs is the odd fact that neither film shows any real sword fighting or special combat scenes among the ""master"" assassins. There is plenty of ""talk"" throughout both films about sword fighting, etc, but ALL the scenes (except that long, repetitive, implausible fight scene with the 88s) involved quick sequences, usually in tight quarters. THINK ABOUT IT- all the people on her list were killed quickly and without any real martial arts!!! O-Ren, Elle, Green, and Bill all were killed by Kiddo (Uma) quickly and with hardly any sword play! Yes, there was a very brief sword fight with O-Ren... but with all the build-up of O-Ren's ability, I would have expected their sword fight to be 3x longer at least and more exciting- instead of spending 30 minutes watching Uma fighting 100s of stupid bodyguard ninjas, and all attacking her one at a time! This made no sense and for me, ruined the movie, since I would have expected all the villains on Uma's list to be killed in true martial arts combat scenes with SWORDS- since they spend both movies talking endlessly about Hattori Hanzo swords! In addition to O-Ren being killed easily with only a few swings of Uma's sword, Green is killed boringly inside her house (despite ""talking"" about scheduling a knife fight), Elle is killed AGAIN inside a small cramp house without even one swing of either of their Hanzo amazing swords- yawn, yawn. All the fights were more of a street brawl or cat fight than a kung fu battle. Why not go outside for a real fight?? And Budd was killed by Elle (not even by Uma- again boring!). Bill, the ultimate villain, is killed in seconds by Uma with a cool, but all too quick heart explosion trick... after the audience sits through yet another excruciatingly slow pontificating dialogue between them. In both films, there is nothing to validate how deadly and masterful a fighter Bill is!! Geez. All in all, KB is a film which had great potential, but a misguided director and writers/editors who gave the audience no real kung fu or sword fight scenes among the main characters and thus left us with never really seeing any impressive swordplay or hand to hand kung fu. Instead, we have a boring, unsatisfying film. A shame."
"jinghiz53","3","3","5","17 March 2011"," KILL BILL 1 - such a bore.
","KILL BILL 1 is very boring, not up to the usual Tarantino standards. Characterisation one dimensional, especially giving me no reason to care whether the Uma Thurman character lives or dies. Lets face it, she was a member of criminal assassin organisation, so once this was revealed all sympathy for her went clean out the window. Over 50% of the movie is endless fight action which is very tedious. I mean once you've seen a limb or head being hacked off, you've seen them all. This is the prime content of the movie. No story. No characters. No interesting or amusing dialogue. What a yawn. And what a rip-off for movie-goers to spread such thin content over several films!!! Thank god I never paid cinema prices to watch KILL BILL 1 (bought secondhand DVDs in an Oxfam charity shop for a couple of quid), I would have felt cheated to come to the end of the movie and find it hasn't finished. The story Tarantino came up with could easily be told in one film. The material is simply not strong enough to stretch over two or three films. I wasn't convinced Uma Thurman was the best woman for the part. Her performance was mediocre. It is such a drag when stars depend entirely on their looks to give flesh to a role. The positive side to the movie is the cinematography, the staging and the soundtrack, which are all excellent. I appreciated the innovation of using anime cartoon for telling some of the back story, which showed Tarantino's genius for creative originality. I also liked the cross references between Samurai and Western, particularly Spaghetti movies, using Ennio Morricone type music. I especially loved the use of the scary theme tune from the Hailey Mills and Hywell Bennett 1970s psycho chiller ""Twisted Nerve"", which I immediately recognised.<br/><br/>Overall, if I had not bought KILL BILL, one and two as a job lot, I wouldn't be motivated to watch episode two of KB, after watching episode 1. I simply wouldn't care enough as to what happens next. But since I already have Kill Bill 2 in my possession, I might as well watch it, even if the only pleasure I get from it is hopefully more interesting cinematography, and entertaining music soundtrack."

","Firstly, i like action thrillers and martial art films. However, this film is garbage. I don't know how anyone can like this film.<br/><br/>There are various reasons why this film was awful: A) The violence was over the top, disgusting and it actually disgusted me. I could tell it was fake as well. Now, the storyline. That was pathetic, as i felt that the bride could have been killed by Daryl Hannah's character early on the film. I did not agree y bill(David carradine)said to Daryl's character to not to kill her. I just didn't agree with that.<br/><br/>B) even when she woke up, the attackers and bill weren't even prosecuted. The gang have murdered people and attempted to murder her. This is just unbelievable.<br/><br/>C) The direction was terrible. Tarantino made a mess with this film and rushed it. I think he just made for money. it was his worst film that he has made.<br/><br/>Finally, i NEVER have turned off a movie before this one, however, i turned this horrendous film off before it finished. Thats how bad it was, it was trash. I would give this film a 0/10 rating."

The ""hommage"" to Asian martial arts films was amusing for a few minutes, but then Quentin proved his usual inept self and slathered the whole thing in Sergio Leone-style spaghetti western music.<br/><br/>I did find parts of the film(s)amusing, but over all it was just too much of the same thing, over and over.<br/><br/>I don't see this film as groundbreaking in any way.

I didn't mind the switching of styles (anime, monochrome, Hong Kong kung fu movie etc.).<br/><br/>I did mind, however, that it was all style and no substance. At no point did I care in the slightest what happened to this woman because I knew nothing about her. And that lack of emotional investment fatally marred the movie for me, to the extent that I didn't bother to see Volume 2 when it came out (although I did see it later....) Plus it really annoyed me (really really really) that she should wheel her atrophied legs from her room to the hospital parking lot, spend long enough lying in the back of the truck for there to be a detailed flashback (I think the caption was ""12 hours later"") and, in those 12 hours, not only did no-one come looking for the missing patient with the 2 dead bodies in her room, but the wheelchair she left outside the truck vanished. Tarantino's strength is supposed to be his writing, and this distracting detail was the result of lazy, lazy scriptwriting.<br/><br/>But Volume 2? Aha..."

","It's a trashy movie done for entertainment. Well, if you find wasting the time of your life entertaining - you are welcome to the universe of the mighty Quentino Tarantino. Big-name actors, outstanding fight sequences, and impressive storytelling - it all cries out ""We are going for gold!"" Some western characters are trying to show off as if they were Bruce Lees, Sonny Chibas or Jackie Chans. One matter makes me real uneasy: this piece dealing with second-hand trifle things, which we saw before in other movies, occupies a place of honour on IMDb top 250 list. And note that poor wire stunt on the railing (when the Japanese guy flew horizontally around the main heroine during combat) - that looked so amateurish and goofy. And if you notice that the snowfall is fake and consists of torn paper... Better watch ""Smeshariki"" or ""Luntik"" instead. Japanese actors should be ashamed to take part in this western action flick of the ""glorious master"".<br/><br/>What about very original and entertaining ""Police Story"", ""Once Upon a Time in China"", ""City Hunter"", ""Armour of God"", and quite a number of other genuine titles? They are outsiders. Hopefully, the situation will change and the real classics will finally oust the box-office modern ""McDonald's"" gems from the top list.<br/><br/>And if you recall such titles as ""Snow Blood"" and ""Battle Royal"" this ""Kill Bill"" will really shrink to something like a wet and dirty toilet paper roll.<br/><br/>It has zero value, though it tries so hard to be so special, - 1 point out of 10.

","""Quentin Tarantino's Fourth Film"", what an egomaniac. And it shows in this movie, where he's more concerned with showing us how cleverly he understands all the genres he loves to parody than he is with creating anything new and substantial. I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this, having just seen it on TNT.<br/><br/>There are some good parts here and there, like the fight with Vivica Fox. And you can't really hate a movie which lionizes the triumph of the human will over adverse circumstances. And the fight choreography is good, even though overall fight execution is only so-so.<br/><br/>This is why I gave the movie a 4/10 instead of a 2/10. But for the most part this film sports a kind of self-conscious cheesiness I find unbearable and nearly unwatchable. And then there's that whole thing with O-Ren.

","I loved Pulp Fiction and Resouvier Dogs. I hated Kill Bill so much that I have absolutely no intention of ever seeing Kill Bill 2. What KB says to me is that Quentin had only a couple of good story lines in him, and he's already done them. Now he's still got to put food on the plate and tell his friends that he's got a job, and so he continues to make movies, but the difference is that he's got no decent ideas left. ""I've always wanted to do a strictly revenge movie"". Yeah, I've always had a bunch of empty movie ideas in my head too, but no one is prepared to back me like they are with Tarantino. So what is the problem with KB? Pulp and Dogs were fabulous from the opening scenes. The dialogue, music, characters and everything else was terrific, and the films continued that way all the way through. Kill Bill starts with none of that, and the opening scene really tells the whole story. A blonde woman that I have no reason to give a stuff about (we have no idea who she is at the start, since there has been no character build up), walks up to a door that is opened by another woman that I have no reason to give a stuff about (for the same reasons), and then we are accosted by the cheesiest dramatic music and camera play I've ever seen, and the director screams at me in my chair ""THIS IS AN EXCITING MOMENT, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE EXCITED ABOUT THE APPROACHING CONFRONTATION"". Um, why? I don't care about either of these women. We don't know who they are, so who gives a rats bum if the whole building blows up and we cut to some different actors for the rest of the flick? Unfortunately the rest of the flick did nothing to save this sad beginning, and I found myself not caring about this blonde woman for an hour and a half. Do you really mean to tell me that I have to wait till the end of Kill Bill 2 to find out whether Bill was justified in what he did to this woman, or whether she's been hard done by? Get stuffed, I've got better things to do, and far better films to watch. Oh yeah, I did enjoy the Japanese cartoon section. In fact, I found it to be down right hilarious. I felt like I was watching one of those TV skit shows that rip off other shows and movies, and I laughed so hard that I had tears streaming down my face. After that the rest of the movie continued to waste my time. If Quentin wants to take my money again one day in the future, I hope he puts in a little work and effort next time to make it worth my while."

If this film was made by Golden Harvest in Hong Kong it would never have seen the light of day in western theatres.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the standard of martial arts in the first fight scene when our heroine bride fights to the death against Vernita Green.  But the whole film lost the plot for me after that scene with its chopping backwards and forwards.  And the main fight scene in the nightclub when the bride takes on over 100 screaming samurai welding gangsters beckons belief.<br/><br/>I understand this is a tribute to martial art films of the 70's and should in no way be taken seriously but it is possible to have believable martial arts and still have a solid story.

Don't believe the undue hype surrounding this movie.<br/><br/>""Why? It has many good aspects"", you may say. ""Tarantino, Yuen Wo Ping choreography, Uma...""<br/><br/>Well, it may have these aspects, and the fight choreography is excellent, but a film does actually require things like 'plot', 'character', and 'script'. This movie is sadly lacking in all three. Yes, there may be a whole heap of 'cool' references, OTT fight action and extreme violence, but without a grounding; a film without a framework.<br/><br/>Does anybody care about this 'Bride' character? Not really. After all, we all know there is a follow-up movie.<br/><br/>""Ah,"" You again may say, ""willing suspension of disbelief is required"". But how can you 'believe' in a film, which makes no attempt to justify it's own 'reality'? In the 'Matrix' films for example, the characters were capable of such incredible kung-fu, because they had disconnected from the artificial 'real' world we live in, and were able to 'bend' reality.<br/><br/>Can Uma Thurman do this? Apparently she is able to defeat forty men, perform impossible acrobatics and be virtually indestructable. How? You tell me.<br/><br/>Tarantinos' obsession with base topics ( Rape, Murder, contract killings...even peodophillia in the 'Anime' section of the movie ), are also on show. There is just no contrast in this film. No light and dark. SPOILER*** When Uma kills one of her rivals in front of her young daughter, there seems to be little reaction: a total lack of humanity pervades the movie....<br/><br/>""Comic Book stylings""  would be your exasperated reply. Yet even comic-book tales have pathos and emotion. Superman doesn't cold-bloodedly kill Lex Luthor, then rape Lois Lane, does he?!<br/><br/>Sure Tarantino is talented at what he does; all his directorial flair conjures up great camera angles and clever editing. But 'Kill Bill' as a great movie? I don't think so...."
"proud_highway","2","3","5","2 February 2004"," left me wondering...
","how a talented director with a huge budget, a capable crew, and an obvious appreciation for classic martial arts films could make such an incredibly awkward and uninteresting adaptation of them... a stylish, uneven pastiche of hong kong b-movies, japanese samurai traditions, and other incongruous cinematic parts.  *obligatory spoiler warning*  to be clear, i do ""get"" this movie... even though ""kill bill: volume 1"" is obviously intended for a niche audience.  i was not disgusted by the flamboyantly violent scenes of spurting fake blood and severed limbs, and the continuous references to action films of the 60s and 70s were not lost on me.  the thin revenge plot, stale characters, and stilted dialog are at least excusable, since the low-budget kung fu films that tarantino apparently tried to emulate were rarely more polished.<br/><br/>for all its colorful sets and costumes, some creative camera angles, and a unique soundtrack... ""kill bill: volume 1"" will probably seem relatively boring to anyone who does not have a creepy little shrine dedicated to tarantino in their closet.<br/><br/>the uninspired casting, editing (or lack thereof), and stunningly dull fight choreography are painfully obvious throughout.  uma thurman is miscast as the vengeful unnamed assassin... she butchered her japanese lines (why was she given so many of them?) and looked ridiculous when she fought, swinging a katana like a fly-swatter with one hand.  with the exception of one brief scene featuring a chain-wielding psychotic schoolgirl, the action sequences are repetitive... various body parts are chopped off, blood spurts out like a fountain... maybe i am just too old and jaded to find that amusing or entertaining for more than five minutes.  the non-sequential storyline serves no apparent purpose (it does, however, manage to drain any suspense from the final scene) and the pacing was slow... a tedious sonny chiba cameo set in okinawa, a pointlessly gross rape subplot at the hospital, a seemingly endless example of tarantino's strange obsession with thurman's feet... thank you, quentin, for subjecting me to that.<br/><br/>half of a needlessly long, over-hyped martial arts movie... (2/10)"
"premiumcream","2","3","5","9 December 2003"," A Failure...
","So Tarantino wanted to pay an homage to Kung-Fu films and Hong Kong action cinema.  Well he tried...and failed.  For a ""kung-fu"" film it sure is missing quite a bit of Kung-Fu...in fact it doesn't have any kung-fu.  The only martial arts in this movie is a poor display of Japanese swordsmanship. And that's being generous.  It's actually a white chick holding a samurai sword, swinging it wildly occasionally while being surrounded by talented actor/martial artists like Sonny Chiba and Gordon Lui.  Tarantino completely wasted the talents of Yuen Woo Ping by putting an uncoordinated sloth in the title roll. And yes IT IS a kung-fu film, every interview Tarantino does he calls it a Kung-fu flick.  So based on this, he completely and utterly failed in crafting an engaging and creative martial arts genre film.<br/><br/>Not only that but Tarantino took a complete and inaccurate dump all over Yakuza society.  And no, ""Wiggle your big toe"" is not the least bit funny. No, a few cheesy fountains of blood does not make this film totally violent. If you gorehounds out there want cheesy gore go watch ""Versus"" or ""Ichi - The Killer"" and then get back to me.<br/><br/>By the way, the character of Go Go was completely bitten from Chiaki Kuriyama's character in Battle Royale...in fact he rips off an entire scene from that film...good job Tarantino..."
"SecondOpinion","2","3","5","8 December 2003"," Boring - and it aint pretty either
","What can I say. I'm no Tarentino fan, that's becoming more obvious for every movie. But this one contains all the parts I usually dislike in a Tarentino flick. It's not completely rotten, but at best it was uninspiring and downright boring. The 70's ninja-flick heritage was there along with the exaggerated sound effects, but that's hardly original. The rest of the storytelling was a strange mix of the usual Tarentino-like ""reshuffled chronology"" accompanied by pretty bad music (which was a dissapointment, I expected better, but I guess it's very much a matter of taste) and that familiar cartoon style which you either love or hate. (Last seen in Animatrix) The big fight in black & white was a dissapointment. It was remarkably unremarkable. Uma Thurman's performance was also varying in quality (from very good to rather theatrically silly), but I suspect that Tarentino's sometimes over-ambitious dialogue makes it feel unnatural.<br/><br/>All in all, it had it's (few) moments but in the end it was just the disappointment I expected."
"el_nickster","3","3","5","1 December 2003"," True stinkbomb.
","What a bore.  This film is nothing but a cheap rip-off of Hong Kong martial arts films and Japanese samurai movies.  I love kung fu movies, which is why ""Kill Bill"" was such a disappointment.  Instead of making a film with great fighters and great fight scene, the director used hum-drum Hollywood actors with no stage-fighting ability, and then used quick takes and cuts to compensate.<br/><br/>Save your $9 and go rent ""Once Upon a Time in China"" if you want to see great fighting."

But it isn't - that is if you dont care for whack and smack with ""cool"" anime and ""samurai sword hype"". Im not a tarantino fan, nor do I dislike his movies, but this sure did make me want to walk out on it. Ok - beautiful in a sense, utter bs plot, characters are well bs...even the assassin squad name made me want to toss it. Action scenes are repetitious, as is all the violence. IMHO rides on quentins name, period. Hear the sheep flock.<br/><br/>Recommended for anime/manga buffs, martial arts buffs. Thats about it, cant recommend it to others, perhaps for film students as it does have some nice scenes.<br/><br/>3 out of 10."

","What a disappointing movie experience. 2 hours wasted. I had a bad feeling when i found out this is a kung-fu movie. I don't like kung-fu movies, but with QT at the helm, i couldn't say no to this movie. Well, i blew it. This movie sucked. And when the blood started spraying I laughed out loud, it was Sam Peckinpahs' Tea Garden Party skit from Monty Python all over again. Seems i'm in the minority when it comes to this farce, but i felt ripped off."
"daemori_chonsa","4","3","5","19 October 2003"," If Tarantino's name wasn't attached . . .
","This is a movie filled with two-dimensional characters and a plot out of a late night movie starring Shannon Tweed.<br/><br/>Let's be honest. If Tarantino's name wasn't attached to this project it would go nowhere. Sure, the fight sequences are incredible, especially in the Japanese garden, but where the hell is the script?<br/><br/>
One of Tarantino's trademarks has been his dialogue. In fact, it was his skills in this regard that got him patch-up work in movies like Crimson Tide, another sub-par movie save Tarantino's little Silver Surfer diatribe. So where is it in Kill Bill? Someone should remind Mr. Tarantino that he should get back to making characters, heroes or anti-heroes, worth caring about.<br/><br/>A strong recommendation for this movie to those who do not feel characters and plot are necessary in a movie.<br/><br/>4/10"

","You may think that I'm just a Tarantino rookie, and I am, but I did go into the movie expecting a whole lot of graphic violence. Well, I did see a whole lot of graphic violence, but I didn't see the amazing plot I had been promised.<br/><br/>Revenge is nice and all, but there was no story whatsoever. The movie was tied together by the violence. It was one violent scene after another after another.<br/><br/>The movie was not without merit. It had excellent choreography in the fight scenes. The acting wasn't so bad. And there was excellently placed comic relief just when it was needed. So it was well directed.<br/><br/>I just don't think you can put revolting plot items, weak plot items and graphically violent plot items together and call it a five-star movie."

"knatCh","Null","3","5","17 October 2003"," overrated garbage...
","Ok, so i just came back from watching Kill Bill and i must say i feel fooled by the great voting this movie has been given. Im a bigtime tarantinofan and i also like fightmovies... Shouldnt this film be perfect for me? Apparantly NO. This movie was a joke, while watching this i got a the feeling i recognized this type of movie, i had seen it before, after a while i remembered... Hot Shots! This movie reminds of the Hot Shots movies with everything exagurated. Most of the fightingscenes was just ridicoulus, this actress cant fight. She can act, but she cant fight like shes supposed to in this movie. Maybe the IMDB team should add comedy as genre too cuz i was laughing my a** of at many parts.. Offcourse.. i was only laughing at times when the movie was supposed to be serious. Heres a list of the good and the bad things about this movie.<br/><br/>Bad:<br/><br/>1) Bad fight scenes, though funny.<br/><br/>2) Bad acting. (To bad for Tarantino atleast)<br/><br/>3) Stupid plot.<br/><br/>4) Stupid characters with eyepatches and Startrekoutfits.<br/><br/>5) Boring, i was actually on my way out of the theater 2 times.<br/><br/>6) Unbeleavably bad title. ""Kill Bill"" sounds like an indian cheef.<br/><br/>Good:<br/><br/>1) Tarantino made it.<br/><br/>2) Good soundtrack.<br/><br/>3) Nice way of telling the story, with chapters like a book.<br/><br/>The overall feeling i have regarding the rates of this movie is that people have been waiting so long for the genious tarantino to make a new movie that whatever he would give us they will rate high. Maybe they feel that this movie has to be good, that its them who is the problem and not the movie in itself. Voting high and writing about how much of a masterpiece this movie is might make you people feel smart, but in my eyes you just prove the oposite.<br/><br/>Personal rating: 5/10 (would have been 3 or less out of 10 but since its a work from Tarantino i gave it a little higher.)"
"snake77","3","3","5","18 October 2003"," Kill it now and bring on something better
","Quentin Tarantino, like Robert Rodriguez and Kevin Smith, was an outsider indie filmmaker who burst into Hollywood like some breath of fresh air in the early 90's.  I'll never forget the thrill seeing Reservoir Dogs, El Mariachi or Clerks for the first time -  you almost ached for these guys to make more movies.<br/><br/>All the more painful, then, to see what each has become.  The latest example is Kill Bill Vol 1.  This mess of a film has buckets of blood, seventies camp galore, and intricately choreographed hong-kong style fight scenes. What it doesn't have is any soul or smarts.  Hipster Hollywood has absorbed Tarantino whole, and he's become yet another slave to irony, style and camp. Gone is his incredible dialogue and amazing timing, replaced by severed limbs, bad animation, and long, dumb speeches.<br/><br/>I understand this was supposed to be some kind of cartoonish homage to a bygone era of cheesy filmmaking, but it just totally lacked originality.  I didn't enjoy a single minute of Kill Bill, though I'm sure it's going to make lots of money.  Meanwhile I'll be watching for the next Tarantino."
"PeaBody-4","3","3","5","14 October 2003"," A Disappointing, Pointless Mess
","Wow, what a disappointment! This is what Tarantino has been working on all this time?!?!<br/><br/>I was completely underwhelmed by this violent, pointless tripe. Seemingly, I would be the ideal target audience for this flick -- I have loved every other Tarantino flick, and am a hardcore devotee of Asian action flicks. Maybe it's because I've seen so many MUCH better examples of HK and Japan-based actioners, but this just doesn't hold up to the films its supposedly an homage to.<br/><br/>The film plays almost like someone trying to do a mock-Tarantino film. The dialogue is stilted and overly ornate, but none of the actors seem able to deliver it with the panache of S.L. Jackson or Pam Grier. The opening scene between Uma Thurman and Vivica Fox is especially poor. Not only does their banter fall completely flat, but having Uma murder Vivica in full view of her daughter before we've been given ANY reason to root for her keeps you from ever really caring whether Uma gets her revenge or not. The scene seems to want to try to get laughs at points, but ends on such a down note that it hangs over the rest of the flick. And what was the point of that tacked-on rape scene in the hospital? The whole start of the flick leaves a bad taste in your mouth.<br/><br/>The flick is also filled with cliched 'Tarantino' touches, from the disjointed time frame to the supposedly funny Pussy Wagon that Uma drives around in. But underneath all the glibness and blood, there's none of the humanity and humor that made his previous characters come to life. Even though Jules, Vince Vega, Ordell and the rest were violent lowlifes, we sort of connected with and almost rooted for them because we got to really know them through Quentin's sparkling dialogue scenes. There's none of that here. It's all of the violence (actually quite a bit more) with none of the imagination or originality that set Tarantino apart in the first place.<br/><br/>There is some good stuff here, don't get me wrong. The climactic battle between Uma and an army of sword-wielding yakuza is nicely done and stylish, and Uma's scenes with Sonny Chiba as the legendary swordmaker Honda are fun. But there's just so much brutality and pain that it overwhelms the somewhat limited good aspects of the film. 'Kill Bill' is a total triumph of style over substance, and it is utterly devoid of 90% of what made Tarantino stand out from his imitators in the first place. If this didn't have his name and reputation attached to it, it would be buried in the trash-heap of failed action flicks by next weekend.<br/><br/>Go see 'So Close' or 'Fulltime Killer' instead, and see what Quentin wishes he could be doing right now....."

","Ok, let's get straight to the point. This movie was not worth the money my husband paid for us to see it. I am ready to give credit where credit is due. I love the different styles that are used in the film. But the blood got to be excessive after the first five minutes. I watched the film with an open mind but found myself wondering how long was it really going to last. Please go see the movie during a matinee, have a friend sneak you in, or wait to rent it!!

","Is it possible for people to pull their to heads out of Quentin Tarantino's butt just long enough to realize that this movie was nothing more than a bad, boring, poorly executed jerk off? I loved Reservoir Dogs and truly enjoyed Pulp Fiction, but this movie is just bad. For all this screaming about it being the most violent american movie ever made, there was a serious shortage of violence.  and what there was, was too silly to be considered violent.  Jesus, has anyone seen Goodfellas or anything by Scorcese?  I went to see a super violent action film.  I got neither. The big fight at the end went on too long that it became a victim of itself and then had a seriously anti-climactic climax.<br/><br/>As soon as it starts we sit through one boring scene that is completely useless into the next.  the opening fight, though people tout it as being cool, is one badly acted waste of time that looks like they were making up the dialogue as they went along.  From there on we get a heaping dose of what QT at his worst. Pointless scenes, (the rapist hospital workers.  and what the hell was up with the cops at the wedding chapel?) boring scenes, (Daryl Hannah almost killing Uma but then NOT doing it!) lame characters (Who cares about any of them!  And why does Lucy Lu get so much attention?  what about the rest of the assassins?) and some bad, very bad anime (UGH!)<br/><br/>One saving grace was GoGo.<br/><br/>Please folks, when someone that is touted as the golden boy of ""Cool"" filmmaking decides to make a movie like this, some one needs to pull their heads out of his ass and tell him it is a bad idea.  Otherwise how will he ever learn.  Avoid this actionless action film!"

"ClaudeJ","2","3","5","13 October 2003"," a cult movie for the masses
","Despite the fact that the movie was really entertaining, it's another rip-off by QT. Personally, I don't mind that QT borrow material from a bunch of other flick, but the reason why I don't mind is because I know most of what belongs to other movies. While ordinary people who goes to theater don't have such knowledge. The worst rip off in history was Reservoir Dogs, go watch City On Fire you'll understand. And when QT made is next films he showed more respect. But most of the people don't know these things, I agree that this is Tarantino style, but I just think that he get too much credit for showing material already being used, and he had a 55 million budget. I'm saying this because when I was in line, the guy in front of me said that he already saw it twice and he said that QT was a creative genius, that he never saw a movie like this one, bla bla bla. Anyway, I guess  it's just a cult movie for the masses."
"propter_hoc","2","3","5","12 October 2003"," Did I miss something or...
","was this just a stupid martial arts flick?  Isn't QT supposed to make, i don't know, IMPORTANT movies that have, say, interesting characters and witty dialogue?  While I admired the style of the movie, and the fight scenes were great, I really didn't sense a great deal of originality in it.<br/><br/>
To any people that are leaning on the fence on this one, I say, don't go. I know the professional reviewers are saying it is great but, and I will always maintain this, had this film not been ""Quentin Tarantino's 4th movie"" it would be passed by as just another kung fu flick.  There is nothing memorable here; picture the Matrix without a story.<br/><br/>If you love martial arts movies (which are not my forte), than I assume you will like this movie.  However, if you are looking for a movie that will make you think, skip this one."

","Don't kill me, while watching this I thought of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. They are quite similar but reversed, and I'm not just saying this because they both have Lucy Lui. They both have intentionally bad scripts, beautiful women who report to a man, three who are still with him, and one rebel, no sense of reality, and both are bad. There are two main differences though. Charlie's Angels has a convoluted plot, Kill Bill doesn't have a plot, and There was enough blood, and gore in Kill Bill to fill the Pacific.<br/><br/>Only a culture which has nothing bad going on in it can make a movie with so much gore, and call it ironic, and funny. We do not have any need to face violence on a day to day basis, so we can watch this and call it entertainment. And that is what I find the most sickening. I'll say it right now, I'm not one for blood, and gore, so automatically this wasn't a movie for me. But in addition to being bloody, it is also BORING. There is just enough of a plot so that one can argue there is a reason for all the gore, but really that's just an excuse. <br/><br/>I thankfully was wearing a cap with a brim so I could tip the brim down so that it covered most of the screen but I could still read the subtitles. This was extremely helpful in my ability to get through the movie. I must thank Tarentino though. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING IT OUT IN TWO VOLUMES BECAUSE THAT MEANT I DIDN'T HAVE TO WALK OUT WHICH DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF IT HAD BEEN IN ONE MOVIE.<br/><br/>This movie isn't all bad though. It is beautifully filmed, very stylized with some really breathtaking shots. The screenplay is very funny, and the first scene is very good when Uma Thurman fights with Vivian A Fox. Lucy Lui give a very good performance, too. But I left the movie theatre completely traumatized. I do not suggest this movie.<br/><br/>3 stars"
"childrenwithknives","Null","9","23","15 December 2003"," A poetic splatterfest
","As being one among many that waited quite impatiently for the release of 'Kill Bill Vol.1' being in less than well tempered expectation, hearing what buzz I could lend my ear to about what was to be of this film, When all was said and done I found this film both refreshing and disapointing at the same time. It seems that Tarantino has been plagued with heavy expectations from audiences ever since 'Pulp Fiction'. Just as most fans of 'Pulp Fiction', I keep hoping that somehow Quinten Tarantino could top that masterful achievement. But I have come to the conclusion that Tarantino found the right chemistry, actors, and ideas that put 'Pulp Fiction' in the category that many other films have been placed in. That rare film that becomes a classic against all original odds. 'The Godfather' would be a prime example of this. Francis Ford Coppola had little experience, he was in constant danger of being fired from the project, Al Pacino was bitterly hated by Paramount executives early on, Danny Thomas wanted to buy Paramount pictures so he could play himself as Don Vito Corleone, Studio executives constantly butted heads with Coppola on just about every detail, Time was rushed every day of the shoot back in 1971, and the budget was very tight. Nobody including Coppola himself ever expected that he would pull it off with anything less than b-film results. All is history now and 'The Godfather' has served as a blue print for countless projects that were to follow. Yet even more amazingly Coppola pulled it off again and did an even more impressive job with his handling of 'The Godfather pt. II'. The interesting point of this is that situations, examples like Coppola's two Godfather films and the success there of is seldom achieved. Of course who can argue with the success of other classic achievements as well like the films that George Lucas, Stanley Kubrick, and Steven Spielberg. That being said it is becoming tougher and tougher for rising new directors to cut a true place in the history of film now days. Then along comes Quinten Tarantino. A director who has made the unconventional-conventional. Just as Kubrick did with 'A clockwork orange' and '2001: A space odyssey', Tarantino achieved this with his first two outings. However in Kubrick's case as an example, most of his films have been percieved as classics and rightfuly so. Since the first two Godfather films and possibly 'Apocalypse now', Coppola hasn't made anything that has managed to reach those lofty hieghts since. These films are perfect examples of pure directorial magic. Once a director makes a strong impact in hollywood with an exceptional film, the gloves are off and the true challenge begins. That is to say-""can this guy top his opus?"". Perhaps 'Pulp Fiction' may remain tarantino's opus, perhaps not. But until then we have the refreshing talents of a cutting edge director to debate and marvel over. That being said...<br/><br/> I held my excited expectations for 'kill Bill vol.1' to a minimum as best I could hoping for a real masterpiece and a true winner of a film. I bought my ticket and kept my fingers and toes crossed. As the film opened it seemed that my expectations might just get met. The opening credit sequence was absolutely wonderful! And from there on there was allot more magic. But the bottum line is that it was for the most part not the sort of magic that makes a movie a legend. what I saw was refreshing, exciting, and beautifuly executed. But yet there just seemed to be something missing. I pondered this for a minute at at time even as I watched the film further. I noticed alot that wasn't there. Allot less humor, less interesting characters, and over all allot less of what made 'Pulp Fiction' a classic. I left the theatre both fulfilled and dissapointed at the same time. Once I dedicated myself to expect both less and more from Tarantino and excepted the film on it's own terms, I went to see it again and really loved it. If you look at it as a whole the entire movie is a homage to everything from sleaze cinema to martial arts b-films, yet it never wavers in originality. I was particularly impressed with the animation sequence, it caught me totally be surprise, and let's be honest, how often do we see films anymore that can achieve the element of surprise with any real success? I think Tarantino deserves at least a peanut butter cup for that .Looking at it in one way I might feel compelled to suggest that perhaps 'Kill Bill vol 1' deserves four stars, on the other hand the whole affair still seems less impressive than a true classic. In my opinion critics should see this movie more than once before rendering any judgement. I would have originally have felt compelled to give this movie 2 1/2 stars, but the way I see it now anything less than three of them little twinklers would be a harsh example of poor criticism.<br/><br/> See the movie twice and then throw your stones if need be."

","Before I start my review I have to say that I personally don't mind gory films if they are well executed and if it has a point or a story. But this movie is full of gore, and gore without any point, in fact I felt like watching 1 hour of pointless gore. Random characters using sword to kill everyone in the movie, geysers of blood created by the smallest wound, and an immortal protagonist.<br/><br/>Now going to the plot itself (if there's any), it's just pointless, we spend 20-30 minutes watching a girl getting her favorite weapon: a sword. Then other 20 minutes watching the story of an evil Japanese girl who beat her when she was pregnant. And guess what does the director shows us during this development of the character? Gore, we see how they kill their parents, in quite an awful way (oh! and plenty of geysers of blood btw). And with what point? Why should we care about this Japanese gal? Because she hurt the protagonist?

","Prior to the Kill Bill movies being released Quentin Tarantino was known as a guy great at making modern gangster movies but this movie shows clearly him having a good grasp on other genres.<br/><br/>In Kill Bill Tarantino is able to step into more genre type of movies and does it with a splash. Bringing together some of the best martial arts fight scenes outside of Hong Kong movies. A strong female lead who empowers women to be more then just a cute little thing on the arms of their men.<br/><br/>Lucy Liu does a great job as one of the fellow assassins who eventually becomes the most powerful crime lord of the yakuza in Japan.<br/><br/>Tarantino borrows a lot of stuff straight out of Bruce Lee movies to pay homage to him and other movies of that nature."
"igotsdax","4","4","8","3 May 2004"," Review (no spoilers)
","Kill Bill: Vol 1, Quentin Tarantino's fourth film, tells the story of a female assassin known only as the Bride (Uma Thurman) who is attacked on her wedding day.  She survives the attack but lives in a coma for the next four years at which point she wakes up and begins her plot for revenge.<br/><br/>The film demonstrates a total lack of originality.  It both parodies and plays homage to old samurai movies, yakuza, Japanese anime, chop-socky kung fu flicks, blaxploitation films, and spaghetti Westerns.  The references are numerous and begin with the opening credit sequence, a tribute to the Shaw Brothers martial-arts films of the 1970s.  The film spends so much time resembling these other genres that it fails to create its own identity.<br/><br/>Tarantino, as he did with Pulp Fiction, plays around with the order of the narrative giving it a non-linear form.  Unlike in Pulp Fiction, however, the reordering of events does little for the film.  It plays like a gimmick; it is there simply as his signature mark.  It contributes nothing to the film's artistry.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is revealed very early on making the ensuing battle scenes, which are incredibly gory and drag on endlessly, rather pointless. Nothing is saved for the climax.  The narrative, linear or not, must work toward the uncovering of some level of meaning or understanding about the films core themes.  This film doesnt have any themes.  Kill Bill is one big ass-kissing job by Quentin Tarantino to the film genres that have entertained him for so long.<br/><br/>Tarantino fans will be disappointed as the film lacks the Tarantinoesque dialogue they have come to enjoy.  The plot is thin and what back-story we are given pertains to all characters except the main character played by Uma Thurman.  The audience, therefore, cannot empathize with her and join her in battle.  The film will catch the attention of guts and gore fans, though one scene was filmed in black and white to tone down the severity of the gore enabling the film to retain an R rating.<br/><br/>If you enjoy action and only action then this film is for you.  Substance seekers stay away.  In the words of Tarantino himself: ""...we've all seen this before...you know the story goin' in...it's easy to follow."""
"moonspinner55","7","4","8","8 May 2004"," The Tarantino Experience: all flash and crass sass
","A juggernaut of technical wizardry, this Quentin Tarantino film (product?) is winking and nodding but not especially human. A die-hard of the neo-Western (where Japanese samurai flicks meet the new-fangled Old West) and TV action thrillers, Tarantino is the master of quick, canny scenes of carnage. It gets awfully bloody, but not in the NC-17 way. No, Tarantino is much too cute, and his imitativeness isn't exploitative or schlocky (as much as he might like it to be). He gives showy roles to many fine actors, and Uma Thurman seems to inspire him to new heights. But he also gets easily sidetracked and becomes self-enamored of scenes that don't play, plod along or get too cheeky (as with the opening bit featuring Vivaca A. Fox, which is good but not quite as solid as the rest of the film). ""Vol. 2"" is more story-heavy, and gives the actors better room to emote, but also features lots of outlandishness, sometimes just for the sake of a cheap, quick laugh. The trickery, comic mayhem, wild ambushes and female ass-kicking don't amount to much in retrospect. Both volumes include some lovely moments, successfully lowball comedy, and they refuse to let up, but do they honestly turn the audience on? I felt exhausted instead of keyed-up. ""Vol. 1"" **1/2 from **** ... ""Vol. 2"" *** from ****"

After the movie ended I wondered why none sense, no plot action movies like these are so popular and what does it say about our society and culture.

","Good lord was I disappointed with this movie. I had been waiting for months to see it and absolutely abhorred it almost from the first five minutes on. All style, no substance, filled with ridiculous, glitzy gimmicks and detours which ring as some of the most self-indulgent I have ever seen in film. Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were great films, but Quentin Tarantino was so high on himself making this picture it makes me sick. And once you get through all the gimmicks it's really a very boring movie. I probably would have fallen asleep if it weren't for the fantastic amounts of gore. The cliffhanger at the end was pretty cool, I'll give it that. At least good enough to make we come back and see Volume II. But this movie was terrible. I know i'm in the minority on this one, but it was just utter crap. Crap! CRAP!!!!!!! CRAP CRAP CRAP!!!!!!!!! Peace.<br/><br/>1/10"
"VisionThing","4","4","8","23 October 2003"," 90 minutes too long
","The fights are truly excellent (if you happen to dig near-realistic, ultra-violent, gore-packed screen fighting with some tasteful stylistic effects), as are the parts directly preceding the fights and the whole beginning of the movie. All in all, about 20-25 minutes.<br/><br/>The rest of the 111 minutes consists of some lousy humor and a lot of dragging scenes as a result of awesomely bad scripting, naturally iced with Tarantino's trademarks, chapters and non-linear timeline (this time actually adding very little to the film besides the nice beginning). Animation episode is a very nice touch, but terribly realized (unimaginatively clichéd & ugly art).<br/><br/>Most of the casting is quite satisfactory, with few excellent choices and a highly average lead. Although Uma Thurman handles the action parts very well, she just lacks the edge and presence to be anywhere near believable in her ample bravado, thus underlining the B-movie feeling of this film in an unfavorable way -- a truly charismatic lead might have been able to make the (purposefully) corny lines both hilarious and impressive, but her efforts fall flat.<br/><br/>If you want to see ultra-violent fighting and enough blood to engulf Tokyo, watch Shogun Assassin or any other movie Tarantino (tastefully) has taken his inspiration from. The plentiful mediocre and plain bad aspects of this film easily counter and knock out the worthy fighting moments (although you might want to check them out on some medium that allows you to skip right to the beef)."

"bob the moo","Null","6","14","19 October 2003"," Very effective style but Volume II better bring something in the way of substance
","Four years after she was savagely beaten and shot in the head on her wedding day by her fellow members of Bill's Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, The Bride awakes from her coma, swearing revenge on those who killed her baby and tried to kill her.  She compiles a list and sets out after the first person on her list, Tokyo crime boss O-Ren Ishii.<br/><br/>On the wave of to-be-expected hype comes Tarantino's latest film, and what a very mixed bag it is indeed.  The decision to split it into two parts is probably for the best for audiences who may not be able to cope with this for three hours plus, but it may also weaken the film in a way that I can't be sure of until I see Volume II. I enjoyed the film  and let me stress that for I know many seem to treat Tarantino's films as a `you're either for us or agin us' issue  but I have some issues with it.<br/><br/>In terms of style, it is faultless. Whether it be the camera gliding over the tops of rooms or using black and white and animation to interesting effect.  In fact the opening of the film is so powerful that I actually jumped in my seat as The Bride's opening line was cut short.  However the emphasis on style has lost sight of any meaningful substance.  I hope that Volume II will bring this to the table and not just do more of the same  if it doesn't then this is a weak film, if it does then it should work as a whole.  I found it ironic that the only part of the film that became emotionally involving was the animated back story of O-Ren Ishii  ironic that the cartoon section should hold more substance than the main film. While I realise that we will discover much more in Volume II I still found it hard to keep with a film that was only interested in giving me visual stimulation.<br/><br/>Speaking of visual stimuli  the fight scenes are clever and impressive. The total lack of CGI is refreshing and the wire work looks natural and never goes totally OTT.  My favourite scene is in the blacked out room in the House of Blue Leaves  a scene that lacks the gore but is visually uncluttered and stylish.  The gore does get a bit tiresome and some of it was meant to be shocking but little of it is (unless this is your first movie!).  One thing that bothered me in the cinema was some viewers feeling they had to laugh during the fight  as if Tarantino can only do violence if it is darkly funny in some way?!<br/><br/>The list of homage's etc come thick and fast.  At times it works well (Sonny Chiba's comic relief chapter) but at other points it is so heavy and self aware that it is almost a spoof of the genre rather than a part of it.  The opening title cards before the film are quite clever but when Tarantino gives up his own style in favour of aping others then it is a bit much. Likewise the Rza's score is mixed in the same way.  At times his music is perfect  keeping the mood without losing his own style  at others the music is almost a lift from other films and it feels like a spoof.<br/><br/>The cast are good despite not having much to work with in terms of characterisation or dialogue.  Thurman is strong and holds the attention, Liu is impressive but her character is at her most interesting when in anime form.  Carradine manages to be larger than life despite us only seeing his hands.  Chiba is a nice comic touch at the start of his scene and Chiaki Kuriyama is cool (despite herself being a walking reference).  Fox, Madsen and Hannah have little to do but will hopefully have more in Volume II.<br/><br/>Overall I did quite enjoy the film but I was left a little cold by a mix of lack of substance and total visual onslaught.  It has clever moments and it never let my interest wane but I really would have liked a bit of heart to go along with the vast amount of guts (and limbs) it had.  Will I be there for Volume II?  A fantastic last line from Bill himself ensures that I will be."

I think the movie is really empowering to woman as well as revenge and how it's done in such a tasteful way. I also love that the movie is action packed and gives you an adrenaline rush straight from the beginning of the movie.

Block the brain and you'll see the golden rain. Sad face of the talented director who made such epics as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but nothing valuable after that. Money and pretty sick ego became his priority. In this film he is convinced that he is at least equal to Sergio Leone so he introduced Jackie Chan to Clint Eastwood, which requires IQ of 40 or lower to love this poor and shallow filming.

","Ok, let's just start-off with my saying that I am not a huge Tarantino fan. At all.  ""Pulp Fiction"" is interesting for me because of the WAY he tells that story (oh, and Sam Jackson...he's the man), and I actually liked ""Jackie Brown"" more than ""Pulp Fiction"".  I had no desire whatsoever to see ""Kill Bill"".  At all.  It was much worse than I expected.  Here's the basic premise: Uma's family is murdered on her wedding day, and she miraculously survives a bullet to the brain, then she makes a hit-list and goes after those who tortured her and left her for dead.  That's it.  So, to say there's a lot of killing in this movie is a severe understatement.  Oh, and if you have a phobia for blood or dismemberment, do yourself a favor and keep away from this movie.  Very far away.  I can't understand why anyone would actually LIKE this movie; sure, there are some cool stunts and choreography with the fights, but even that dulls after five minutes, honestly.  For me, it was simply excessively violent for the sake of being excessively violent and possessed no redeeming qualities.  At all."

","I just seen it yesterday. What can I say? Just WHOOPS!<br/><br/>Not what I expected. The movie kept me watching but I was not happy with the experience. It's just NOT Tarantino anymore. Exhausted.<br/><br/>Looking to the film in a very short note I can say 2 things:<br/><br/>* The only good thing in this movie was UMA THURMAN, who was Looking cool, nice; acting nice and fighting real. and Lucy Liu - who was also a killer beauty in her own way. *  yet it looks like Quentin totally exhausted himself lopoking to this serious piece of crap. Saying that he overdone Wachowski is plain stupid. Matrix has a UNIQUE plot (except Part 3 well) and there are NO such moview at all. More about plot later. Eye Candy also much more nice in the Matrix thank in KIll Bill. And while I say that I am still a huge Tarantino lover - it's just not ol' good Tarantino!<br/><br/>
Pardon me Tarantino lovers ( I am too one of them) but this film is an empty hole.<br/><br/>
I don't know  - I heard that many people loved this film and said it's Tarantino's best, but to me it's just not right. From ALL points of view.<br/><br/>
1) Being a TARANTINO film. It almost lost 'TARANTISM'. There almost no humor in it, no dark humor. almost. = but people vs me may say - come one it's different genre it's an action film. It also lost twists - if we take a look of say RESERVOIR DOGS - also a bloody shotout film - it has so many angles to it so many interpretations. Here- nothing. Dialogues - same - WHERE THE HELL IS TARANTINO???? Almost EVERY line of EVERY Tarantino film can be pronaunced over and over again and kept in the memory. What here? ""Kill motherf***ers???"" Or what?<br/><br/>
2) OK It's an action film, but what we see is just a lot of fights, lot of blood that's it. There is no plot. Almost. You may repeat it's a kung fu film and action film....<br/><br/>
3)The plot is FLAT to the bone. She just out on revenge and have to kill everybody. The film , even an action film and kung fu film should have a smarter plot in order to keep the smarter audience happy. Of cource all people who just want to see aslasher film without any meaning - go for it, but it's not me. Let see - I have seen several Jet Li movies or even if we say MATRIX. Actually I should take them separately. Matrix HAS A PLOT (except maybe last)- and what a plot!!! WhoA! Most Jackie Chan movie have good plot. Van Damme movie are a bit dumb but still have a plot (I liked DOUBLE TEAM).<br/><br/>
4) The ART of action. The whole brutal sequences are completely flat, dull, and NOT nice. If we take back to Jet Lee movies, movies like CROUNCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, THE HERO etc - the whole samurai action looks like AN ART. Here we see stupid fight with EQUALLY stupid blood fontaining from bodies at a most stupid volume and speed. Finally if we really want to take a serious NICE kung fu/samurai action - take Akira Kurosava. What a masterpiceces. Here we watch stupid and even though it was chareographed by ""MATRIX"" kung fu master - all scenes look stupid to me.<br/><br/>
5) Finally Quentin tries to get to his role of finding artistic ways of capturing this whole s***. But to me it's just doesn't make sense, and doesn't get the effect. The whole transitions of REAL CINEMA, JAPANIMATION, BW CAMERA - to me they don't make this movie better in any way.<br/><br/>
So my score is 3/10: One point for keeping me awake sort of. One point for being an like-an-average action movie. One point for being still a Tarantino film.<br/><br/>Otherwise it would be 1/10.<br/><br/>So mach ado about nothing...."

Face it, people--it's a poorly assembled collection of trite, recycled elements, and not even done all that well.  THE MATRIX (the original film, mind you, not its ho-hum sequels) set a new standard in action films, and this film flops.<br/><br/>The character development is nonexistent, there's only the narrowest shred of a plot, and the characters themselves are uninspiring caricatures of themselves. The dialogues is stilted and oh-so-awfully delivered that it's painful to watch. On top of all of that, I can't find this ""style"" that everyone keeps harping about--what's so stylish about the random insertion of an anime segment (that looks, by the way, about as classy as a high school kid's doodle in the back of his math notebook), a black and white segment, or the ""silhouette"" fighting segment that is about as subtle as a tracheotomy?  I found myself particularly annoyed by the plethora of hideous titles that continuously punctuate the film, all of which look like they were generated using secondhand chracter generators manufactured in the late 1970's.  (Just as an aside, I don't think the same font was used twice.  Classy, I tell you.)<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that Tarantino doesn't have the juice he needs to make this piece of detritus exciting in any other way.  Unfortunately he fails entirely--his trite, supposedly ""stylish"" effects come across as pompous and tedious.<br/><br/>Those who praise this film--fine, they're entitled to their own opinions, but in all likelihood they are the same people who thought 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS was ""high cinema.""<br/><br/>Normally I make fun of movies that turn out to be bad, but this made me wish that I was having my teeth pulled.  I sure hope that it was intended to be a parody, but the worst part is that I can't tell either way.  Its farcical elements are blatant and plentiful; for instance, the countless Monty Python-esque sprays of ""blood"" do nothing but prompt the audience as to when to laugh hysterically.  My gut feeling, though, tells me that Tarantino sees this as ""the real thing.""  How sad for us all.<br/><br/>Skip this film.  It's a waste.

","Although cleverly styled, and filled with some fantastic performances and direction, Kill Bill Vol. 1 suffers most from trying to find its tone through its clever, although complex storyline. Quentin Tarantino has no doubt made another very impressive film, and one that will be surely admired. However, Vol. 1 of this series of films is by far the weaker half. The film struggles with finding which tone to take, balancing many ideas, but never sticking to one, and it is because of this that the film can sometimes feel a bit frustrating or hard to follow. That being said, there is plenty of impressive moments in the film to catch your eye. The action sequences are fantastic, although a little drawn out. Uma Thurman shines as her character the Bride, and truly brings the much needed lifeforce to this revenge driven story. The writing can be a bit messy, but is very interesting concept wise, and very intriguing to follow. In the end, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is an impressive accomplishment, bogged down by a few hard moments.
My Rating: 9.25/10"

","This movie was a bloody, violent mess... and I loved it! Uma Thurman plays an absolute badass that you love to root for and, under the direction of Quentin Tarantino, gives a stellar performance.
If you've ever seen a Tarantino movie, you just about know what you're getting: violence, killer dialogue, beautiful cinematography, astounding score... feet shots. And this movie gives it all in abundance.
This was a really exciting movie. I found myself on the edge of my seat, eyes fixated on the screen, distractions coming up left and right around me and on my phone, but my eyes refusing to look away from the screen for fear of missing something.
There's not a second of screen time wasted in this film. Tarantino gets right to the point, telling his story without gimmick and leaving the audience genuinely wanting more (lucky, at the time of my watching, Volume 2 is also available for immediate watching so the ending doesn't leave too much of a cliffhanger for me).
Some of the creative choices behind this movie are unique and also add to the charm of the film. The decision to strip certain scenes of their color or to portray certain scenes using anime were extremely interesting and added a certain extra kick to the films that is uniquely Tarantino.
This was a fantastic bloodbath of a revenge story that delivered just the right amount of everything it needed to be a true cinematic success. Quentin Tarantino once again proves himself incapable of producing a ""bad"" movie."

","The term 'style over substance' is often used in a derogatory manner, and I understand why. On paper, substance sounds better than style; films that are substantive stick with you and play out in your mind for days, weeks, or sometimes even years to come. On a basic level, and to use a food metaphor: the typical consensus might be that the substance of a film should be the cake, while the style should be the icing.<br/><br/>With Kill Bill Vol. 1, I believe Tarantino wanted to take this concept of style over substance and tear it to shreds, making it an obsolete, dumb, lazy criticism. If you ask me, he was successful. He gets away with making a film that is largely about being stylish and entertaining as all hell for two main reasons. The first is that he makes this simply Vol. 1 in the overall story, with a greater focus on character and emotion placed within the equally fantastic Vol. 2. This is not to say that Vol. 2 lacks style, nor that Vol. 1 is devoid of substance; moreso that I believe they have two very different purposes, but by some miracle fit perfectly together in telling the same story, while also proving to be incredibly satisfying films for very different reasons. Of course if Vol. 2 was not a satisfying conclusion, or if it was similarly focused on style over substance, perhaps it would make Vol.1 a weaker film in the process. Thankfully, this is not the case. Any concerns a viewer may have with a lack of story across the 4 hours of Kill Bill as a whole will have their worries shattered by the incredible dialogue, emotional payoffs, and fantastic flashbacks of the second volume.<br/><br/>The second way he gets away with a film so shamelessly fixated on being a stylish thrill ride is that the sense of style is just so good. It's beyond rare to get a film with this level of craft, with such a tight and obvious sense of control by the person behind the camera, let alone have it also be so exciting, entertaining, violent, and overwhelmingly beautiful. The use of music is unparalleled, even with just about all the music being composed for other films, or being pre-existing songs recorded way before the film was made. I think there's a real skill with picking music that works for and heightens certain scenes, and while soundtrack creators don't get nearly as much credit as composers do, I feel like films that use pre-existing music as well as Kill Bill Vol. 1 provide a good argument for why there should be a ""Best Non-Original Soundtrack"" Academy Award. To list all the songs that are used perfectly would double the length of this review, as it's basically every single song in the film. I get goosebumps at multiple points every single time I rewatch Kill Bill Vol. 1, and the music is one of the main reasons for that.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 1 is also noticeable for having one of the most memorable action sequences in recent cinema history, towards the film's climax. It's also worth mentioning the amazing build-up, as well as the quiet, understated, and strangely moving one-on-one fight in the snow that happens right after it. And the way that after this, the film hooks you into absolutely needing to see the second part with one of my favourite cliff-hangers ever is undeniably brilliant.<br/><br/>It's hard to say much else because most of Kill Bill Vol. 1's greatness has already been mentioned by thousands of reviewers before me, and also because words can't do a whole lot of justice to the look, style, pacing, action, and music that makes this film so excellent, and so endlessly rewatchable. Kill Bill as a whole is my favourite revenge film/story of all time, and I don't know how any future filmmaker would be able to work such magic with the simple premise of ""these people wronged me, so these people need to die."" Of course things become a little more complex when it comes to the less action-packed but densely written and far more suspenseful and emotionally intense Vol. 2, but you without a doubt need both to understand what Tarantino was going for here.<br/><br/>It's hard to settle on a favourite Tarantino movie, but this one's up there, regardless of whether you count it as one film or count this one and Vol.2 as the same film. If you haven't seen either in the 15+ years since its release, what are you doing? Pure cinematic experiences don't get much better than Kill Bill Vol. 1, in my opinion. This is a film that might not be perfect, but feels perfect while you watch it; packed with so much detail, style, and things to appreciate and get swept up in. There aren't enough good things I can say about it, and hope that in time it continues to age well, and is eventually considered one of the greatest films of all time."

","There are a ton of reviews about this movie, so I won't go into detail about why I enjoyed it, other than being a fan of martial arts and samurai cinema, I enjoyed the homage.
The weak points of this film - the misuse of the word 'entropy', which should have been 'atrophy', which told me that Tarantino didn't have much proof-reading in his script; musical cues that don't quite fit the scenes; musical cues that cut off suddenly; the dialogue was weak, thank goodness that there was action scenes to make up for that; the Crazy 88s fight sequence, it should not have been in B&W (at least, not for the Blu Ray release), and it was painfully obvious that a muscular stunt man was subbing in for Uma for much of it; bleeping out the name of the Bride. What was the point of that?
The good, or should I say, best parts were: Sonny Chiba's cameo; Go Go Yubari and her fight scene with The Bride.
Overall, not one of Tarantino's best films, but Vol 1 certainly surpassed Vol 2 by a long shot."

","It's really scary that this film is actually in the top 100 on imdb. It leads be to believe that most posters here are 15 year-old adolescent boys. I'll readily admit that I have never liked Tarantino. He is the ultimate plagiarist who takes credit for ""innovations"" that directors like Kurosawa, Godard, Peckinpah, and Leone were doing forty years earlier. I'm not a cinematic prude by a long shot but what is with all the deification of cruddy pop culture in his movies? I fail to see the cleverness in referencing a Trix commercial. While I don't begrudge others the right to like this movie, I must admit I get a little annoyed at hearing the word genius applied to a film that is as frivolous as this one. I thought Tarantino was suppose to be some kind of poster boy for the independent film movement but this film is as one dimensional as any flick starring Steven Segal. People really need to question themselves about the kinds of films they watch. Is Kill Bill really necessary? Like a Big Mac and Fries, I'm sure it feels good going down but in the long run it leaves you empty inside. At 40 years of age Tarantino has never bothered to grow up. He's nothing but an overgrown fanboy making some of the most expensive fan fiction of all time. If you were to list all the ""references"" to other films found in this cinematic junkpile it would probably equal the actual length of the script itself. This movie was not created, it was compiled. The script was probably written with a Xerox machine. This is nothing new, Spielberg and Lucas have indulged in this kind of filmmaking for years and the Coen brothers are guilty of it too- movies about other movies. They are the great regurgitators offering nothing new to the world of cinema except their knowledge of B-movie cliches. Wake up people. Demand more, from the movies you see. In the meantime, how about reserving the top 100 for films that truly deserve to be there like Renoir's Rules of the Game or Cassavetes' Woman Under the Influence."

","OK, I know Quentin Tarantino makes deliberately extreme movies. I know he wants his works to be trash, very hard. I know he wants to be miles and miles away from classic Hollywood products. But I don't understand why so many people consider him a genius.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm one of the few persons (!) who doesn't like his style, nevertheless I think his movies (and this one above all) are terrifying. I don't consider funny seeing flying heads and blood everywhere, every scene is extremely violent and disgusting. Many people say that the harder Tarantino pushes each detail, the more comical he is. For me most of the audience don't understand he delivers caricatures! The problem is that he gets instead the opposite effect, like a praise and an excitement for violence, really gratuitous. In this film the story -very weak- is overwhelmed by flashiness.<br/><br/>It's a difficult topic (on one side I don't want to sound like a moralist, on the other one I want to tell my opinion). Films like ""Taxi driver"" or ""Clockwork orange"" are very violent too, but they are strong tales with strong stories. I don't say violence in these movies is more acceptable, but it's functional to the plot.<br/><br/>Furthermore, why telling Tarantino is a master? He always quotes Bruce Lee, he quotes (or copy) ideas from John Woo and Sergio Leone, he recreates sets and situations already seen in B movies. He goes on paying tributes... Why doesn't he himself invent something?"

Thrown together are some of the most sick and brutally violent images I've seen wherein the purpose was simply to shock and entertain. I was mislead into thinking this would be an homage of sorts to the old kung-fu films of the 70's or something of that nature but all I witnessed was one needless chopping of appendage after another. Blood spewed almost out of the screen onto my lap and I felt sick to my stomach, not simply because the images were disgusting to me, but that this brutality had not one single purpose to the entire story. Not a single reason for this kind of violence to strengthen the plot or enhance motivation, structure, or character development. This film is made for people who simply love seeing people tortured, mutilated, or just plain sliced into bloody pieces, for no apparent reason at all."

","I know.  Every time we get a Tarantino film we get those who love it and those who don't.  Those who praise it as a hallmark of cinematic stylistics, and those who think it's a pretentious piece of poop.  Well, guess what, up until this film, I wasn't part of the latter group. But Mr. Tarantino went and screwed himself up.  Written as a homage to the samurai films of the 60's, Kill Bill lacked substance, which was not the case in Pulp Fiction or Resevoir Dogs.  This movie was totally lacking plot, and Tarantino thought he could make up for it by shoving in a feminist edge and story line, couple it with, admittedly, excellent direction (the shot set-ups and colourization were awesome) and he expects to get praise.  Well he did.  Tarantino went out there, continuing on his trend of rethinking the film genres.  First it was gangster films (Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction), and then it was blaxploitation.  Why does he resurrect these dead film genres and skewer their traditions?  To get attention.  Once all the commentary has been said, he can go in and make it seem like he's brilliant.  The guy's a great director, but he's a lousy writer.  This film took a terrible, wafer-thin plot, mixed it with a storyline that most critics would be afraid to disapprove of, and threw in some great mise-en-scene.  And for this, he's one of the greats?  No, sorry.  The greats made their own classics.   They didn't pick on genres already gone by in a pointless fashion. But, he'll continue to do this, and people will continue to praise it... or not."

The originality, creativity and black humor that was easily seen in 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp fiction' is complete lost in Tarantino's current manifestation. Kill Bill is completely devoid of plot, character development and dialogue - the line ""my name's Buck and I'm here to f_ _k!"" would have to be the epitome of the film.<br/><br/>Its stunted stunt scenes and gratuitously violent overtones, drip veritable mozzarella, as gallons of splattering blood gush from one amputation to the next - I'm amazed that the main characters didn't chomp on the severed appendages! - I haven't seen this many lost limbs since 'night of the living dead'.<br/><br/>At any rate, his split screen camera tricks, colour to black'n'white imagery and homage to several obvious blockbusters do nothing to fatten this already rice-paper thin movie. My advice: ""is to stay in"": save your hard earned cash on some take-away sushi and watch the re-runs of any Kung-Fu 70's action sitcom - you'll get less gore, more realistic martial arts and better oriental nibbles that aren't as processed as this cheesy loser."
"butterfinger","Null","1","1","24 December 2003"," Kill Bill Vol. 1: An Exploitation Film or An Exploitation of Exploitation Films
","Tarantino wants his audience to be so in love with technique of the film without getting the audience to react to it. It poses as a B-movie, but it isn't a b-movie. B-movie's have kinetic flair and high wire gusto. This film is simply a pile Shaw brothers references (among others). In Reservoir Dogs, when Mr. Blonde sliced the cop's ear off to pop tunes, we were affected by it. Tarantino wasn't just saying, ""Look at me! Look what I can do!"" He was actually showing us what he could do. This film hints at something better than it is without showing us this ""something"". Also: it is a cartoon. Tarantino's previous films looked at the characters with an ironically detached style making it amusing. Crime movies would always show us thugs getting their heads blown off without any imagination. With Pulp Fiction, Tarantino was curious: he wondered ""How do the gangsters get rid of the corpses? Do they hire someone? What if their wife comes home and finds the corpse?"" With these thoughts, Tarantino struck upon brilliance, cheerfully playing with gangster cliches. Now Tarantino is trapped in these cliches, delivering characters and scenarios of the same artistic quality of the filmmakers he was originally parodorizing."
"ChoiceCuts","Null","1","1","16 December 2003"," Missed!
","This is actually a bit sad: movie genius Quentin Tarantino has delivered a movie without any original elements. Almost everything here has been done before. There's really nothing in it that I will remember for a long time; no torture-scenes including razors and ears, no cripples. This is a tribute to old samurai films such as those about Lone Wolf, no wonder it feels unoriginal.<br/><br/>-SPOILER ALERT!- Sure it includes plenty of gore; a guy gets his intestines spilled all over the floor in a cafÃ©, a girl gets her arm cut off, limbs don't really seem to follow natural laws in this film and they fly as if they had wings and blood literaly gushes out of severed arms, legs, throats, whatever.<br/><br/>Many critics call this the most violent movie ever. I have no idea why. If they, for example would take a look at some Italian or Japanese underground movies, than I think they would change their minds. And the violence in this movie is anyway so supernatural that you can't take it serious. But the gore is also a problem with this movie. It's neither shocking nor very funny, it is, however, very stylish but it's not that entertaining that Tarantino had to make a movie about it.<br/><br/>This movie also has a couple of other problems; the dialogue for example, is not very smart, not at all in fact, especially not for being written by Tarantino. Take for example the opening scene, which includes a pretty horrible quarrel. Uma Thurman isn't very convincing as the avenger and her passion for katanas is just ridicolous.<br/><br/>It does however include some good parts: Lucy Liu is very good and the music is great fun. The movie also has a lot of clever references to old samurai-films.<br/><br/>All in all this feels like a missed opportunity. While it has got it's good sides it often feels like lots of old flicks cut into one, and isn't exactly a recipe for a masterpiece. Tarantino should go back to making more original and realistic films, such as the excellent ""Reservoir Dogs"" and use his own imagination instead of stealing others.<br/><br/>6/10"

"scr1ve","Null","1","1","5 November 2003"," Serious criticism
","(First of all, did you feel uncomfortable during or after this film and were not entirely sure why?  Lets see if I can help.)<br/><br/>I have to say that I haven't been as close to walking out on a film since my one and only actual mid-film departure during Joel Shumacher's '8mm'.  The exact point was just after our 'heroine' has stabbed a mother to death in front of her poor child.  Its not the act of putting that on film that riles me as much as how QT deals with it.  Having Uma Thurman's make-uped face twist round and sexily stuff some heinous twaddly retort in my face about the woman 'having it coming to her' just rips the will to live in this world right out of my little humanistic heart. Having lost a mother as a child myself, I would never dream of cartooning this moment of trauma, of utter nightmare in such a frivolous manner.  It is symptomatic of a large moral blindspot that continues to plague the more mainstream, bigger budget kill fests of late.  This film is simply a flick made by a guy who has not just seen a lot of kung fu films, but adores and respects them far too much.<br/><br/>With regards to all the other violence in the film- I accept that this film was to all intents and purposes a cartoon.  Its respect for life was cartoonish.  So why the issue?  Because this was shot on film and was presented as a live action feature.  This makes me uncomfortable as the medium of film is intrinsically realistic.  Films photographic-ness lends a realism that makes us suture into events as though they were real.  What do I say to people who say 'Chill out man, its only a film?'   Well, you can bet that there is a small percentage of people out there that don't have the mental capacity to understand the complexities of what they are witnessing when they witness a filmic massacre. To them, and perhaps underneath to a larger majority, the film panders to the same base human desires that make people want to distribute sick photos of deformities and accidents and the like over the internet, or slow down to gaze at a fresh car crash.  Its an ugly, un-constructive human trait.<br/><br/>But it is not the violence itself that I object to, as I hinted at above, it's the handling of the violence- the treatment of human tragedy.  This film, as well as many others has a complete and utter disrespect for it.  Most mainstream films are simply representations of life, and amongst those representations, ideas are formed and tossed out for the audience to catch.  Having a film full of throw away tragedy is consistently tossing ignorant ideas at an audience to the point where you become de-sensitised.  It's this, and the context, that makes the violence palatable.  If the scene I described above happened at the end of a Ken Loach film, it would be highly disturbing, because instead of being surrounded by drivel, the event would be surrounded by events and ideas that give life the respect it deserves.<br/><br/>Micheal Haneke's Funny Games is a worthy antidote to this rubbish.  The cheapening of life in films has to stop."

","It's definitely true that you can create original, beautiful, and clever combinations and call them art. Filmmakers, above any other artform, seem most comfortable with this sort of cultural cross-pollenation and re-contextualizing. Certainly, with previous films Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown (in an order of sequential creation and declining originality that cannot be called a coincidence) QT, as a film's filmmaker, assembled his work from the works of others in a combination of hipness and homage that appeased both cinema fans and your average filmgoer. However, the slope turned out to be way slippier than anyone would have guessed. His latest work fails as a cohesive mixed bag- it fails fans of the director and if anything, belittles them. It's among the worst films I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It's true that I'm not a fan of the Kung Fu/Samurai/Whatever genre, but I don't have any particular aversion to blood and gore. Or for that matter, maligned characters. This is a very polarizing film- trash culture masquerading as important american Art- therefore it's only natural the film's supporters seek to discredit negative reviews of the film by implying that they don't understand the films' inspirations or they they have little propensity for blood, therefore, aren't qualified to accurately judge the film. No, it's not the gore- of which, I'll add, I've seen way more horrific examples of in many better films. As for ignorance of Kung Fu cinema, negative on that too, having a taste for other things doesn't make me unqualified to judge a film when it really needed to stretch out and use the parameters of a genre to create something original, not merely rape its cliches. Quentin's main contemporary Jim Jarmusch has always had to shoulder a kind of responsibility that comes with having your original ideas tactlessly lifted and turned into international blockbusters. I was shrugging and mumbling about 'Ghost Dog' from the second I left the Kill Bill theatre. Jim Jarmusch accomplished alot with that movie- he took slices (pun intended) at the Martial Arts genre and rewrote it to accomodate an outsider interacting in the traditional Kung Fu/Samurai manner with other outsiders, while keeping the concepts of duty and honor very intact. Above all, the characters were interesting and likeable, and felt like real people. Kill Bill is more of a counterfeit (from the 70s standard issue Shaw-Scope and 'Feature Presentation' intros on) than anything approaching great cinema, or even passable filmmaking.<br/><br/>I didn't even feel like I was watching great cinematography, but it certainly didn't get in the way. The final fight scene, anti-climactic as it was, looked very nice in the softly falling snow. But as anyone who ever took a 35mm camera to the beach knows, it's impossible to mess up certain shots in certain settings. Furthermore, in another recent film, far less disappointing, Sofia Coppola knew that her movie in/about Japan would practically write itself. The dialogue from completely unconvincing A-List actors was awful, and even though most reviews (I'm talking major media) have referenced this, they usually push it aside to exclaim that well, it didn't really matter, this was all about the action. False. If that was truly the case, there'd be no dialogue. Hell, it got away without having a plot. The soundtrack was certainly below Tarantino's par- the old trick where you play a brutally appropriated, yet far from appropriate rock track (Nobody But Me.. originally by the Isley Bros, here in the Human Beinz version, the lamest lift off the Nuggets box set since Rushmore) contrasting with intense physical violence was clever once, 10 years ago in Reservoir Dogs (Stuck in the Middle With You). The gall of Quentin to use even other soundtracks (Truck Turner by Isaac Hayes, and then a definite forgery of Goblin's Suspiria score) is embarassing.<br/><br/>No doubt fans of the Matrix (the films share the same martial arts choreographer) and Buffy the Vampire Slayer (the film and tv series share the same moronic, plotless fightin' babes concept) will be overjoyed- here's an approachable- well-known actors and a wide release, yet contrivedly marginal (seemingly ultra-violent, hipster director, RZA/mixtape-feeling soundtrack) film that will stimulate your dumbest internal desire for watching people fight, yet make you feel like you're taking in 'good'/'high'/'learned' art/culture.  It's even hard to believe that hard-core Kung Fu and Anime fans aren't calling Foul at this hopelessly Anglo-Saxon imitation. It's just a shame that people with any taste whatsoever aren't so easily fooled."

"vampiresan","Null","1","1","2 November 2003"," Kill Bill No Thrill
","I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarrantino. I loved Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and even found a place in my heart for his hit and miss Jackie Brown, but KILL BILL Vol  1 was a total disappointment.<br/><br/>Where Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs never shied away from violence and blood, both films contained a hidden cheekiness and clever sense of humour that created a black comedy even when bullets were flying.<br/><br/>Kill Bill attempts this but somewhere along the way Tarrantino has lost his sense of humour.<br/><br/>The violence was over the top and an obvious homage to kung fu killer flicks. But this one just missed the mark. Uma Thurman's BRIDE did a terrific job of convincing us that her character could well be a force to be reckoned with. But the over the top aspect of the film really negated rather than added to the actual strength of her character, making her seem more cartoonish than courageous.<br/><br/>The hospital rape aspects were quite disgusting. I wonder why every time there is a strong female protagonist in the film she has to be raped at some point? Clearly Tarrantino was trying to shed his mysoginist reputation by having a large female cast here, but he has fallen into the same old stereotypes male film makers always make - the women have to be beautiful, have to be raped/beaten or somehow defeated by a male in the story, have to lose a child or protect a child to account for their strength and finally have to be ultimately controlled by a male (Bill in this case.)<br/><br/>Added to this was the Volume 1 aspect. The current trend to create serial movies is annoying at best. But when a movie such as this one wastes so much time having fight scenes rather than moving the narrative along, it really becomes frustrating. Kill Bill VOL 1 could have been told in an hour and we could have seen the conclusion of the film in one sitting. Instead a cheap marketing ploy was used and then time filled with senseless violence.<br/><br/>It's a cheat and despite some memorable scenes and great female performances, Kill Bill failed to ultimately impress."

","What's the difference between an homage and a rip-off?  Judging by Quentin's latest effort, not much.  The spurting blood was by-the-book Japanimation, and several scenes/effects looked like they were lifted directly from some old kung fu classics (splitting a bad guy in half with a single stroke-been watching Duel to the Death, eh Quentin?).  The only distinction between this film and a highlight reel of genuine anime/kung fu movies is the presence of some recognizable Hollywood `talent' and the absence of an all-Asian cast. Anyways, do your self a favor and watch some real martial arts movies on cable or rent Quentin Tarantino's Second Film instead.  Of course, if you've never seen any kung fu or anime pictures, then this may seem new and exciting to you (as it did to my date...who was a girl!).  Ha!

Its like one huge walking parody... sadly its not. It is its own monster! I tried to really like it I viewed it twice! By the second time I already dubbed this film an unwatchable to the sheer lack amount of seriousness it.

I Wish at time I had this gift of watching shitty films and liking them but I don't and sadly I see them for what they truly are a disgrace to cinema!

","I'm sorry I started with such a tag-line but that's what this movie is all about.<br/><br/>So the premise goes like this - The Bride (Uma Thurman) is all bloodied up and lying on the ground at the altar of her wedding, surrounded by armed assassins of a squad, of which she herself was earlier a member of, and who just wiped out anyone and everyone at the wedding. They then shoot her, in what appears to be a death-blow but then she instead slips into a coma and wakes up years later to avenge the execution of her husband, baby - she was carrying during the massacre; and everyone at her wedding. Then begins the journey of 'The Bride' - name not mentioned anywhere in the first movie - who sets out to take revenge!<br/><br/>Uma Thurman does a great job as a sexy expert assassin out on the loose. She sparkles with her charisma and style, that it makes her bloody revenge look beautiful and fashionable. Lucy Liu as the wicked O-Ren Shii, the head of Tokyo underworld and the bride's first revenge targets, is still-faced like a mannequin but that suits her role of a mind-controlled assassin.<br/><br/>In a revenge-flick like this the action sequences have to be flawless and yes they were. There is also a flashback of one of the characters in anime, which serves as a nice assortment in a 110-min long medley of brutal massacres. The action, the stunts, get better in every scene. The Japanese Samurais defy gravity and jump around as if they are weightless.. <br/><br/>You have to be a brave-heart to watch the entire film without having a nauseating headache. There is so much 'Red' in the movie that it puts Spain's La Tomatina festival to shame. Every time a limb is lopped off (and believe me it happens a lot), there is blood just spurting out like a fountain and the killer is spray-tanned in blood. You have one scene where the massacre is so bloody that the entire action sequence is shown in black and white (However, in the Japanese version this scene is in colour).<br/><br/>This film is not without its goofs and flubs like any other Quentin Tarantino film but I didn't mind because its entertaining and fast- paced. There was not a single second in the film during which I wanted to keep my eyes off the screen. It is a must watch for all the action junkies and more so for people like me, who love films like Resident Evil, Underworld, Aeon Flux et cetera etc. and who love to watch the leading ladies wield guns and swords like they are Barbie dolls..."

","Kill Bill: Volume One (2003) was the first part of a three and a half hour film. Instead of putting out a three and a half hour grind house picture, the directed split it in half and got two movies out of the production. Quentin Tarentino knew better than to try and direct the action scenes himself so he hired Yuen Woo-Ping to direct the action. When you combine The Bride Wore Black, From Bombay to Nagoya and Lady Snow Blood you get one of the most interesting films of 2003.<br/><br/>The movie is about a woman simply known as the Bride (Uma Thurman). She was a member of an elite team of assassins known as the DiVAS (Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox). All of it's members had code names of poisonous snakes. Well, she wanted to leave but it ain't so easy to leave the business. After being in a coma for nearly five years, The Bride plots her revenge to get the rest of the Vipers and their ring leader Bill (David Carradine).

"Derek237","8","4","9","27 January 2005"," A very good movie, a very shameless release
","I guess you can leave it up to Quentin Tarantino and the good people at Mirimax to make a franchise out of one movie. Unlike films such as The Lord Of The Rings and The Matrix, the cutting in half of Kill Bill was an after thought. Tarantino believed that people wouldn't be able to handle a 3-and-a-half hour Kill Bill film, which is ridiculous because, bringing up Lord Of The Rings again, I know that many people went to see screenings of all 3 LOTR films back-to-back. Now that's one long movie, go ahead and do the math, and that just shows how devoted fans can be. And now, Tarantino has ripped off his loyal fans, charging two separate prices for one film. And don't get me started with the whole bare bones DVDs with the intent of releasing special editions in the future ""multiple bites of the apple"" issue. Just shameless.<br/><br/>But, you have to suck it up. It's a pain, yes, but underneath it all we do have a quality movie here. After waiting more than half a decade since Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino has come back to films with a vengeance. This time around he borrows from and references so many movies that it's nearly impossible to keep track of them all. For me, at least, since I'm not exactly a huge fan of the martial arts genre. But that's okay, because Tarantino interprets it all in a way that is pretty clever and enjoyable. In a way it's the merging of American and Japanese styles of film-making. There's martial arts and anime, but there's also some jive talk, so ya know, it's a good mix. And I have to say that it undoubtedly features one of the best action sequences of the last decade.<br/><br/>The cast (or human props if you prefer) is well thought out and of good variety. Uma Thurman, the star, is obviously the stand-out. She's a little bit scary and a little bit sexy, she just kicks butt. She does absolutely everything necessary in what she calls her ""role of a lifetime"" and surely needs to be regarded from now on as one of the best female action characters in cinema.<br/><br/>It sucks having to pay twice the amount of money for one movie, but as far as this particular half goes, it is really enjoyable. There's no doubt in my mind that vol.2 is the superior half, but this is a fun film loaded with action, gore, and all the things you could ever want from a Quentin Tarantino film.<br/><br/>My rating: 8.5/10"
"pwoods1","Null","4","9","19 May 2004"," Tarantino is an auteur!
","Kill Bill Vol 1 is, like all Tarantino's flicks (deliberate use of the word flix), self-consciously postmodern and referential/reverential. He knows his trade and those who miss the inherent humour in this film miss the point entirely. It seems, on the surface, an uneasy marriage (!) between classical Greek tragedy and Japanese Kabuki - perhaps even Noh - theatre. And there's the rub. The violence is stylised (as usual with this director's genre) to the extent that it becomes a bloody ballet. When Uma Thurman drags her character's body into the ""Pussy Wagon"" her feet become the centre of attention - a dancer's fixation - and, at this point, I have to say they are UGLY feet! Regardless, they are a dancer's feet; at once well-travelled and well-used/abused. This particular scene also indicates the strength of character which will carry the protagonist through the rest of the dance, and dance it is. Revenge places Thurman's character squarely into the role of Nemesis. This nameless virago is, however, compassionate toward the innocent - telling the child of someone she has just killed that eventually she will understand and if necessary come after the killer - is, in a twisted sense, a very moral stance. In a reference to ""revenger tragedies"" only the bad are slaughtered. In the extended fight sequence they are even masked: a reference to non-entities (extras) in prior extravaganzas? THEY DON'T MATTER and here, I feel is a major point being made by Tarantino: faceless minions deserve an anonymous death. Those who kill to order deserve to die without acknowledgment. However, this film, like other Tarantino tributes to the aforementioned Greek and Japanese theatres should be enjoyed. After all, the jetting blood is very ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail""-ish. But even Tarantino draws the line at a hopping torso threatening violence. Hmmm..."

His work in ""KillBill"" is somewhat intense and entertaining, but as time goes I can't help finding weak spots on ""KillBill"". I think people are trying to find a reason to admire it. Quentin is a movie lover, and this movie is his ultimate homage to his movie library of favorites. Yet I found somehow deviated of what his sense of homage is. ¿Is his tribute to Old Westerns Spaghettis and Oriental Films just a pastiche of unnecessary blood, mistaken for art, and his intended ""cool"" characters lose flame as they blade swords into rambling, yet somehow interesting fights? ¿Have we granted permission to Quentin to do as he pleases with the camera? The Power we gave to Quentin led him to believe he could enjoy the Midas Touch. His handling on the filmical elements are wonderful, yet the movie lacks a message and a clear concept more than a mixed tribute. His passion overwhelmed him and audience accepts it as a work of art by a master mind. I'll grant you the latter.

QT obviously set out to make a spoof of the martial arts movies of Asia, and did a good job. I really was entertained, and use of the exaggerated spurting of blood when a head or limb was cut off reminded me that the film is not to be taken seriously. Plus, the scene where ""The Bride"" single-swordedly defeated a trained army of perhaps 30 or so martial arts experts was pure ""camp.""<br/><br/>Thurman was a great choice to play ""The Bride"".

The whole story, which is secondary to the ""look"" of the picture, is Bill having left ""The Bride"" for dead at her wedding, and after recovery in a hospital, escapes and sets off the kill all those on her list.

","Fairly often, I find myself pressured to justify my dislike of Quentin Tarantino movies. I've taken to saying that I simply don't care about stories that involve ""killers killing killers."" That's Tarantino's obsession - gangsters vs. vampires, hit men vs. other hit men, and here, a vengeful ex-assassin vs. her entire old gang. Every character involved is - forgive the George W. Bushism - ""evil,"" and so I have no one to latch on to, no one to root for. Uma Thurman's Bride is really only *slightly* less repulsive than her opponents. And actually, since David Carradine is a better actor than Thurman, I'm tempted to root for Bill!<br/><br/>I'm glad that Tarantino has found an outlet for his...ah...""vision"" in movies, because I shudder to think what else he could be doing right now. I can admire his stuff only to a point, because it carries such a deeply disturbing (and disturbed) taint. The animated segment of ""Kill Bill"" comes across as particularly gratuitous, and seems to serve no real purpose except to build up a villain who amounts to nothing much.<br/><br/>I've noticed that, over the past few years, certain film-makers and writers seem determined to ""elevate"" the childish genres they loved in their youths to new levels of sophistication: sci-fi, horror, super hero comics, fantasy, and now martial arts movies. So we get ""Lord of the Rings"" adaptations that cost eight gazillion dollars, great directors like Ang Lee and Bryan Singer devoting their talents to silly popcorn flicks, and here, an arty-farty version of all those grainy-looking Hong Kong action yarns that are available on $5 DVDs. You know what? Sometimes schlock is just schlock; I didn't really need to see a ""literate"" kung fu potboiler. Good photography can only elevate poor material so far.<br/><br/>In fairness, I saw the closing scenes of ""Kill Bill, Vol. II,"" and thought they were great. But they contained little violence and were clearly more original than anything seen in Volume I. Perhaps there is one good movie waiting to be discovered in the midst of two mediocre ones..."

","Well i finally got round to watching Kill Bill,and on the whole i have to say i was disappointed.From Tarantino,who's movies stand out as being fresh and inspiring,i felt let down on several points.I guess firstly,there was no pace to the film,nothing to want me to keep watching except maybe the hope that it was going to improve as it went on,which it did,a little,but not enough for me to feel any emotion or intensity.Secondly,the dialogue.QT's previous films had dialogue that kept you listening,no matter how trivial the subject,there was always humour,and a little something that made it memorable,i felt here the dialogue was more like idle chit chat that really went no where. BUT....i did enjoy the fight scene with Daryl Hannah,so hey it wasn't all bad.Overall,an average film that i was really hoping to get more from,maybe i'll watch it again and enjoy it?...we'll see."
"RachelLone","3","3","6","7 July 2004"," Too many loopholes
","Despite the trend of violence depicted in this film which serves entertainment value, 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is a pathetic joke. There is no comparison between this and Quentin Tarantino's previous work 'The Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. This flick is utterly hollow.<br/><br/>The story is about a heavily pregnant bride and assassin (Uma Thurman) who is severely tortured by her fellow assassins and gunned down by her boss and the child's father Bill (David Carradine). She survives the massacre (all the wedding guests are killed), falls into a coma and wakes up four years later (the assassination squad originally decides to murder her while she is in a coma, but the mission is later aborted because Bill wants to maintain their reputation) and begins her bloody revenge- killing her one-time co-workers, one by one. <br/><br/>Here are some of the numerous loopholes in the film:<br/><br/>The bride awakes from her coma, looks at her body in disbelief and murmurs 'four years...four years!'. How on earth is she aware that it has been four years since she falls into a coma?<br/><br/>She lies on the floor, behind the medical staff member who has been repeatedly raping her while she is in a coma and pulls out a knife and attacks the man. How on earth does she still have a knife with her when she has been hospitalised for four years? She is supposed to have nothing on her. <br/><br/>She leaves the hospital in her patient's gown with the car of the attacked man while she is in a coma, and later she arrives at the neighbourhood where Vivica A. Fox's character lives with normal clothes. How does she get them? She then travels light (EXTREMELY light, with only a bag) and buys a single ticket to Okinawa. Where does she get the money? After four years of being isolated from the outside world, is her bank account still valid? Could she really have the money for a plane ticket to Okinawa and another one to Tokyo?<br/><br/>There are scenes in which she is on the aeroplane with her sword. Is it ever possible that she is ALLOWED to carry a sword onto a plane?<br/><br/>You may find the action bit dazzling, but this is what I call 'pulp fiction'. You may find this movie experimental, but I find it a failed attempt of Tarantino's. The flashbacks is nothing new. I don't see any original, creative or profound meaning in this film."
"mrswhite072895","4","3","6","30 May 2004"," Ostentatious homage to the 1970s kung fu movies
","Kill Bill, Vol. 1, at its heart, is really a simple tale of a wanna-be murder gone wrong and the revenge that courses through the intended victim. However, in Quentin Tarantino's hands, Kill Bill is an overblown blood fest.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman plays 'The Bride,' who is also known as 'Black Mambo.' She was a part of an elite killing squad with 4 other adept assassins played by Vivica A. Fox, Darryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, and Lucy Liu. These five killers are headed up by Bill, whose face we never see in the movie. For some unexplained reason, Bill and his four killers set out to murder a very pregnant Black Mambo on her wedding day. They torture and kill Black Mambo and her unborn childso they think. Black Mambo/The Bride awakens from a four year coma with revenge killing on her mind. <br/><br/>The movie switches back from the distant past, to the recent past, and to the present at lightening speed without making much of a cohesive plot. The flick is filled with Quentin Tarantino -esque pop culture references and pseudo-philosophical speeches from his characters. The only thing lacking in the dialogue is his normal excessive usage of the word n***ger.<br/><br/>Kill Bill, Vol. 1, is an ostentatious homage to the 1950s Japanese samurai, the 1970s kung fu, and the late 80s/early 90s Hong Kong action movies. I even suspect that Lucy Liu's character's name, O-Ren Ishii is a homage to the rap group N.W.A. (O standing for the first letter in Ice Cube's real name, Oshay. Ren for the deejay of N.W.A., and 'ishi' sounds a lot like 'Eazy-E.') I give the movie four stars out of ten for the plot twist at the end, the excellent swordplay, and the Wu-Tang Clan's RZA's spot-on original scores."

","It is expected that this film would be violent, but the plot was not as good as Pulp Fiction or other films by the same director. Uma Thurman did a good job in her role, but the action was a bit over the top. There was certainly a strong Kung Fu influence on this movie and many of the fight sequences reminded me of old Bruce Lee movies except blood covered every scene. If you love blood & guts and love to see blood & guts in every scene then this film is for you. If you thought there would be a great storyline then you might be disappointed. Doubt I will watch Kill Bill vol 2 since it is apparent from the first volume what will happen in the sequel. I will have to admit Lucy Lu was fabulous in her role."

"Cheesedemon28","Null","3","6","23 April 2004"," Mr. Tarantino, your achilles' heel is showing...
","Before I start my actual review of Kill Bill Vol.1, I have to tell you a little bit about my history with Tarantino.<br/><br/>The first one I saw was Reservoir Dogs. A lot of people say it's packed with references to other movies, but I can only think of two or three off the top of my head. Reservoir Dogs is also my favorite Tarantino movie. Pulp Fiction is obviously packed with loads of film references. That worked though, and I liked it. Jackie Brown came next, which was mostly just a tribute to blaxploitation movies. I liked that too, but less than the others.<br/><br/>But now, with the first installment of Kill Bill, Tarantino's weakness is starting to show: he can't write anything original. I mean, some people take influence from other scenes in films; for instance, the famous mirror scene in Welles' Lady From Shanghai was first seen in Chaplin's The Circus. Obviously, they are not the same scene, although they both take place in a hall of mirrors area. Kill Bill shamelessly lifts other scenes from movies. The most obvious and blatant ""reference"" is seen when the Bride gets in to the ""Pussy Wagon"" and starts saying, ""Wiggle your big toe."" Where did that come from? Why, John Ford's On the Wings of Eagles, of course. Then there's the butchered Morricone spaghetti-western music, a line lifted directly from a Leone movie(""...he should have killed ten.""), and many other scenes and things lifted from different grindhouse/Japanese action movies. I'm just sick of it. I want to see Tarantino writing his OWN material and stop ""paying homage"" to other movies.<br/><br/>Ahh, but there are other flaws in the film. A very boring and linear plot doesn't help. Uma Thurman's not a great actress, and many of the characters are very boring. Bill is the only character I really want to see more of in Part 2, considering his mystery. And that he's played by David Carradine.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the action scenes are splendid! They're quite well choreographed, and very exciting. The battle with the Crazy 88s stands out. I was also pleased by the anime sequence(although honk-tastic).<br/><br/>Well, I hope Pt.2 is better... because I was dissapointed.<br/><br/>4/10"
"lock-n-loll","4","3","6","19 October 2003"," Uninspiring mess with abscence of Quentin's writing skills
","Quentin Tarantino (QT) has a big interest for asian cinema. His debut film `Reservoir Dogs' was influenced by Ringo Lam's `City on Fire', Bruce Willis wields a samurai sword in the award winning `Pulp Fiction', and Patricia Arquette watches `A Better Tomorrow 2' and `Street Fighter' in QT's script to `True Romance'. With `Kill Bill' (KB), QT's fourth feature film, he sets all eyes on the asian school of filmmaking. In KB, QT sums up all things in he likes about chop socky films from the 70/80s, and adds a small dose of spaghetti westerns and blaxploitation themes as well. Boy, has he watched many films during his life time! Perhaps too many, I'm afraid.<br/><br/>KB is about the female killer (played by Uma Thurman) waking up from a 4-year coma after she was betrayed by her associates. Her task is to take revenge on them, The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and - especially - kill their leading mystery man Bill (hence the title). The simple revenge story leaves much to be desired from a man of QT's calibre, since this he surely knows how to write stories and scripts. But if we leave the main story aside and interpret it as homage to the typical action film genre (where revenge often is a classic motif) KB needs to rely on QT's fantastic dialoguewriting. But also this leaves me empty. There are no classic and memorable lines like Samuel L Jackson's `Royale with cheese'-monologue or nifty stories like the ones told in `Reservoir Dogs'. His way of storytelling was so superior that it spawned a zillion QT wannabes, most successful probably being Guy Ritchie's gangster films made by and for pint heaving lads. The coolness that once was QT's trademark is gone, well at least most of it. Because in the middle of this somewhat empty film are some highlights. I'll now present the pros and cons of this movie:<br/><br/>[ + ]<br/><br/>* Uma Thurman is a good cast, her fine, soft appearance contradicting the typical roughness and hard-edged sterotype of an avenger. Here we have a real femme fatale in action. Although the character is as thin as paper, she does a good job portraying this anonymous Bride With No Name (her name is bleeped out for some reason, hopefully revealed in KB Vol.2). The use of female characters is also welcome since worldwide action cinema needs female heroes to ascend from Cheng Pei Pei in `Come Drink With Me', through blaxploitation films from the 70s and all the way to Carrie-Anne Moss of the `Matrix' fame. Also take note that apart from two killings in the film, all of the bodycounts in KB is put up on the women's account. Judging on the brutal finale, that's about a 90 - 2 lead for the gals.<br/><br/>
* This film is oozing with style. The camera work is top notch at times. There are split screens, kung fu-close ups, reversed timeline, an animated section, unrealistic stylizations of violence and homages to films galore, which.<br/><br/>
[ - ]<br/><br/>* .at the same time makes the movie rather shallow. Yes, I have also seen `The Lone Wolf and Cub' series. Yes, I know Sonny Chiba was a bad ass in `Street Fighter'. Yes, I get the Shaw Brothers references. Yes, I've seen a lot of anime. In other words: I've witnessed many films which in their original form was stylized and worked perfectly by its independent self. What KB does, is that it takes (steals, borrows or any verb of your choice) all those neat, little details or trademarks from those films and goes over the top, to a point where you grow tired of the so obvious references that you yearn for something original instead of a homage. The most relevant film in KB's case is `Lone Wolf and Cub' or `Lightning Swords of Death' or `Shogun Assassin' or whichever version you prefer. The spectacular but somewhat overlong finale of KB echoes the massive slaughterhouse endings of several Hong Kong action movies and has Uma Thurman - dressed in Bruce Lee's yellow track suit from `Game of Death' (`ho ho ho, another neat reference' I hear the 13-year-old, pimple faced action nerd chuckle) - battling off The Crazy 88, basically a bunch of mad Japanese killers hired to protect Lucy Lui's character, in a manner reminiscent of the `Lone Wolf and Cub' series. In those movies violence was extreme, blood spurted like water from a fire extinguishing hose and limbs were easily dismembered by razor sharp swords. KB is not original in that sense. QT just want to do a film that looks like those cult genre movies he (and therefore indirectly also his fans) has been watching himself for years. Too bad it just falls flat like his friend Robert Rodriguez' `From Dusk till Dawn' - another shot at doing a crossover genre film with a high quality cast.<br/><br/>* Another trademark of QT is his choice of music in his films. But, really, haven't we grown tired of this cool, hip surf/rock n roll/funk music in his productions? Even the usage of an edited, short version of The Human Beinz' classic garage song `Nobody But Me' seem extremely misplaced in the context of a ferocious sword battle. And The RZA's original music is at times uneven too. Take for instance the climax battle between Lui and Thurman where the<br/><br/>old Wu Tang Clansman uses a spaghetti western style song (another homage, off course) to minimal effect. That scene would profit from no music at all.<br/><br/>
* The violence in KB is extreme by western standards. This is explicitly marked out for the viewers when the huge sword battle suddenly turns black and white as an eyeball is ripped out of its socket, Sonny Chiba style. This may not only tone down the colors of gore on screen but also have a certain style effect. In asia however, the scene is in full color. Obviously, the asian audience have got the stomach for that sort of thing. Sometimes the violence is comical, sometimes it's stylized. And sometimes it's downright dumb, and we don't really need that stupidity.<br/><br/>The intent of KB surely has to be to pay a tribute to an inspiring movie scene that in the last couple of years has influenced the Hollywood way of making action films. I bet QT wants you to buy/rent the real deal after seeing KB. It's a shame though that the real deal is much better than KB and it's quite a mystery that a master screenwriter like QT doesn't have the talent to fill a movie with a decent script. And originality. What KB is at the moment is more like `a late night pizza kinda movie'. And is that really what we wanted or expected from QT? Is this the same person that won a Palme d'Or some years ago?<br/><br/>Rating: 4 / 10"

I loved the character Go go Yubari, to see again Tarantino brand's Red Apple Cigarettes and the great actresses like Vivica A. Fox,Daryl Hannah,Lucy Liu among others who works in this movie.<br/><br/>The plot: We see a Bride, who wants her revenge with her ex partners from Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, since they all tried to kill her,her husband and her baby. Bill never really shows his face in this movie, and The Bride's name is never told, because we need to see her only as a killer,since her story is not told yet.<br/><br/>Interesting fact: The members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are all named for snakes: Sidewinder, Black Mamba, Cottonmouth, Copperhead, and California Mountain (King) snake. Black Mamba is the most poisonous one!;)<br/><br/>aka ""Kill Bill-volume 1"" - Brazil"
"biyemo","3","4","10","23 October 2003"," A waste of energy
","Kill Bill is a disappointment. I first notice this film when Uma Thurman appeared in a magazine dressed yellow & black, Bruce Lee wear a similar sport suit in one of his film.  I am not a fan of 70s Japanese/HongKong action film, but I thought making a movie either making fun of or paying homage to such a genre will be interesting. However, Kill Bill accomplish neither of them.<br/><br/>The movie is even a bigger failure when viewed standalone, because it has no plot, the dialogue dry and all the characters got was only a nickname. This movie might work if the actors believe in what they do, but they don't. Vivica Fox, Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu all seems lost in their roles. And I don't blame them.<br/><br/>The fight between Uma and Lucy in the Japanese Garden is beautiful shot but that alone won't save the movie.  There is some raw energy shown as expected in a Tarantino film. However raw energy without direction is really a waste of energy.  I am sure Tarantino enjoy making this movie, because it is a fun movie to make. Too bad the movie isn't funny."

Here we can see how Uma Thurman replaces the cult role Meiko Kaji(Yuki Kashima (Shurayuki-hime) had as the avenger, without any feeling or remorse, Uma's role figure is a wandering slaughter machine, waving and kicking her opponents down without backing off, even if there is like 88 of them or just two. Gogo Yubari herself is only a symbol for the westerns own childish erotic imagination of Japanese school girls in uniforms in general. <br/><br/>Those who says that this movie is a smart, intelligent master piece which belongs to the cult movies through the time, they haven't seen Lady Snowblood nor understood what Quentin Tarantino really did with this film, copied, and destroyed an already existing legend. <br/><br/>I like Pupl Fiction, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation and From Dusk To Dawn but this one i wish could fall down into the deepest black hole in the universe. <br/><br/>thank you."

As usual, for a Tarantino film, the soundtrack is perfect and the dialogue very witty. Tarantino does not spare the viewers from bloody scenes such as the one where The Bride fights off O-Ren-Ishii's Crazy 88. The film shifts from spaghetti western style in the opening sequence to oriental style in the last half of the movie. Tarantino goes as far as to show typical Japanese cartoons to illustrate O-Ren-Ishii's life as a child. This mixture is blended together perfectly by flawless acting.

","A woman - with a past in a cartoon style assignation squad - is left for dead on her wedding day and vows the path of bloody revenge.<br/><br/>The thing that hard-line critics and hard-line lovers of this movie both agree on is there is no real story here and - more bizarrely - little of the Ping-Pong dialogue that the director (Quentin Tarantino) made his name with. Maybe the fact that the movie was sliced in half is part of the problem - until I actually see Part II I will have to reserve judgement.<br/><br/>To date QT has made one great movie (Pulp Fiction); a very good movie (Reservoir Dogs); and a very average movie (Jackie Brown.) You can see the direction this paragraph is going already - because this is below average. Hong Kong Fuey was made on the cheap for an initial audience that didn't have the education or the appetite for much thinking - why celebrate it on a big budget? What is that all about? It is like filming a hardcore porn film with the budget of the movie Titanic!<br/><br/>(There is a movie called ""I Spit On Your Grave"" that was about an abused woman taking revenge on her abusers. Chicago Times'es Roger Ebert thought it was the worst movie he had ever seen (it is dreadful true). This has pretty much the same plot, but has more killing, blood and sadism - but he gives it top marks. Confused? I certainly am!)<br/><br/>Lead Uma Thurman - here called only The Bride - confuses me as an actress and a person (married/divorced/married/children/divorced all before 30) and is a little strange looking with her model legs ending with massive policeman's feet. Yes she can act a bit, but like Lauren Bacall (who she most resembles) if the script is bad so is she and vice versa.<br/><br/>UT is the best thing in this, although I don't believe her for one second.When you carry a fully grown guy on the end of a sword (as if!) wouldn't it buckle your knees a bit darling? <br/><br/>Tarantino is in love with her in the classic Hitchcock mode and fashion. He knows he is too ugly and dorky to get in to her pants through natural means so he uses the casting couch and excuse-to-be-with approach. Well done, but it is all a big lie and we both know it. Given her fast turn over record on men there isn't much future in it either.<br/><br/>QT fails because he is tasteless and doesn't have a natural censor to call upon. More is often less. He oversteps the mark and loses control on most films he makes and here he gets plain silly. There is no other word for it. We linger on a woman squirting blood from a severed arm - but we linger for no reason other than to give the audience a cheap thrill and the less said about the ""comedy"" rape the better.<br/><br/>There is a lot of sword fighting and severed limbs in this movie - so much so that you are sick to death of it before our semi-climax (we only get to the half way point, remember!), which is more of the same only bigger.<br/><br/>Like having a three course meal made up of the same dishes over and over again.<br/><br/>Tarantino is smart in knowing how to fit music to scenes (often obscure pop) and how this lets us linger for little reason on people doing nothing much more than walking down a corridor. He is a good introducer and while avoiding some clichés he celebrates others. Hong Kong cinema can do no wrong in his eyes.<br/><br/>To his credit he has not repeated himself in any of his efforts but this is an experiment gone wrong and the high marks and good reviews shows that more people are closet sadists than I would have imagined. Maybe that is too harsh a term, it is more like the scene in the school playground when the school bully is beating the living crap out of someone and everyone is circling round thinking it is great and urging them on because it isn't them on the receiving end. Tarantino makes you one of those people - and I don't like it."

","I have read some of the previous comments concerning people's expectations for this movie. It seems like the majority, at least of the ones I read, felt this movie was a let-down. The following are the main points I read, and some rebuttals, when appropriate.<br/><br/>1. I was expecting more from Tarantino after having waited so long for a new film.<br/><br/>Given a few generations, a good man becomes a god. The same goes for expectations for movies. You see a movie you really like, you live a few years, and then the same writer/director comes out with a new movie and you are disappointed. I haven't seen a movie this well done in a long time. When I comapare it to most of the films of today, I am relieved to see such smart work.<br/><br/>2. The plot is stupid.<br/><br/>It has been hypothesized that there are only about 7 plots in the world. You have to figure, if you are going to do a movie, you have to accept that much of what you will do has already been done. What Tarantino has done here is write a plot that works, and then worked in the ingenuity. Betrayal, revenge, murder, yeah, yeah, blah, blah. A summary of the movie simply doesn't do any justice. I will explain why later.<br/><br/>3. Tarantino took a bunch of stuff from a bunch of old Kungfu movies and threw it all together into one movie.<br/><br/>This is similar to #2. I think it's important to be aware here that this was his intent, and has always been his signature. Tarantino was probably raised on television, and his memory for what he saw is insane. He took his favorite elements of those movies and used them to make a collage. And it works.<br/><br/>Now, for my critique of the film. If I were to take any single element of this film and rate it without the context of the rest, I might find this movie typical. However, the combination of camera movement, retro nuances, score, framing, storyline, introduction and outcome, and overall organization of events, this film is top notch. The creativity displayed in each scene, the hidden references and allusions, everything is so well packed, if you keep your eyes open, you will be impressed. Just don't take the kids."

","I read so many good comments about ""Kill Bill"" so I decided that I have to see it before the next movie comes out.<br/><br/>So today I saw it and at the end of the movie I asked myself ""that's it?"". All the movie was her killing 2 people with uninspired fights.<br/><br/>And some scenes were so boring, like the slow start, why does it have to start without seeing anything but credits? Who wants to see a black background with white text credits for minutes at the beginning of a movie? I hate starts that show you nothing with some weird music, don't waste my time on white text.<br/><br/>Also, if she wants to kill someone, why all the hassle of fighting with your hands? She could have killed those 2 women using a pistol and end it in 2 seconds.<br/><br/>And that big fight with those 50 ninjas, that's simply unreasonable, it was enough if they all jumped at her in all directions to end her, her back was to them endless times and they didn't storm, stupid.<br/><br/>Stupid movie.<br/><br/>1/10"

","Was there a cooler film in 2003 than Kill Bill?  I don't think there was. Kill Bill has all the elements of what a good time at the movies is all about.  The way a director stays fresh and interesting is to continue to broaden his/her horizons, not rehash the same thing they've done three times before.  Let me point out some of Kill Bill's strong points and then some weak ones in my eyes:  While this picture may not have captured the exact ""way of the samurai"", it did show what revenge is capable of.  I would like to remind people that no one waits for the other person to attack anymore, there's no such thing as a fair fight, so honor is right out of the window, and The Bride had all the motivation in the world for what happened to her. So, her fight at the House of Blue Leaves, was justifiably violent and unmerciful.  Sword fights aren't tennis matches.  They can be permanently fatal.  All the actors established a character very well, and how great was the anime sequence?  Kill Bill is not trying to be anything, it's trying to remind people of a type of film that has been forgotten.  It's a love affair of Tarantino's( just like Uma is to him)  and it shows.  There are plot holes in the first, such as her sitting in the Pussy Wagon for 13 hours while no police, or medical staff from the hospital check the dead man's car when they see his keys missing.  And I would also say the catchy dialouge Tarantino was known for is fading, as it wasn't too strong in this film. But, there are some things I would like to be explained in the 2nd film and I wait in anticipation for them.  This is what going to the theaters is all about."
"phiggins","Null","3","7","8 April 2004"," Worth waiting for
","SPOILERS!! Kill Bill is the fourth film by Quentin Tarantino.  In case you were unaware of this vital fact, the opening credits include the legend, `The fourth film by Quentin Tarantino'.  This is a trend that needs to be nipped in the bud right now.  The heart sinks at the thought of reading, `The thirty-ninth film by Steven Spielberg' or `The twentieth film by Ron Howard' or (especially) `The second film by Stephen Fry'. Kill Bill (Quentin Tarantino's fourth full-length feature film) is only half a film. Its full title is Kill Bill vol. 1.  At least it's not Kill Bill: Episode One: Attack of the Kung Fu Fighting Babes: The Special Edition. Tarantino, after hectoring from his producers, `decided' to split his epic action movie into two parts, thus enabling his beloved fans to appreciate fully the fruits of his artistic genius without having to nip to the toilet halfway through.  They probably did us all a favour: One three-hour movie consisting of nothing but fighting and sassy dialogue?  Hard work.  Two ninety-minute movies consisting of nothing but fighting and sassy dialogue? A walk in the park.  Two walks in the park. Tarantino, after the `mature' (i.e. `dull') Jackie Brown (The third film by Quentin Tarantino) has decided to play to his strengths here.  So we get lots of violence and great music and wide-screen close-ups and brilliant action, but not so many celebrity cameos or people sitting around talking and smoking dope.  Despite all the critical praise that was heaped on him for Jackie Brown, it's clear that that film saw him working on auto-pilot, cruising along happily enough with all his showbiz chums.  It's not a film that anyone needs to see more than once.  Unlike Reservoir Dogs (The first film by Quentin Tarantino) which demands repeat viewings, and works its magic on you like a drug.  That film remains his finest moment, no matter what the Academy or anyone else said about Pulp Fiction (The second film by Quentin Tarantino).   True, it was Pulp Fiction that cemented the man's reputation as a purveyor of brilliantly-made, hysterical B-movies, but Reservoir Dogs is more than just a lurid heist thriller. It would have been interesting to see Tarantino develop in the noir directions it hinted at rather than giving in to his basic instincts, stepping on the gas, shaking the ketchup bottle, and piling up the pop-culture references until we're all blue in the face.  And, while Jackie Brown was praised for its `maturity', at least one viewer found it interminably and unforgivably lacklustre.<br/><br/>So we can be forgiven for approaching Kill Bill vol. 1 with some trepidation. Early signs are not good: in-joke references to old movies (`Our feature presentation', `Shaw Scope') fail to raise a smile.  As the man himself might say, `har-di-f**kin-har'. And then. Uma Thurman draws a square in the air with her finger and the square doesn't appear on screen, thus immediately banishing all memories of that hideous moment in Pulp Fiction, when it does. Indeed, for all its wild and crazy action this is a surprisingly traditional and old-fashioned film.  There are no computer-generated effects.  There are none of the ludicrous and clichéd fights that we have become so used to over recent years.  What we get instead is blood, sweat and tears.  People fight and get injured and exhausted and some of them (quite a lot of them, actually) even die.  Blood spurts all over the place.  But there also startlingly beautiful moments of silence amid the carnage, such as the snow-bound night-time shot of Uma and Lucy facing off in the garden, as a water clock tips over and clicks back into place.  Like a peasant in a Bruegel painting, it takes centre stage while momentous events happen in the background. But never mind all that - what about the plot?  What actually happens in this movie? Well.Uma has been treated badly (beaten up, shot in the head, that sort of thing) but somehow is still alive.  Waking from her coma she swears revenge. She gets a guy to make her a sword, and then she goes to kill people. Not necessarily in that order.  Along the way there are: a truly great cartoon flashback, colour-coded subtitles (why don't more films do this?), Daryl Hannah whistling and wearing an eye-patch, and Lucy Liu getting scalped. Again, not necessarily in that order. And that's about it.  Yes, I think we can honestly say that Quentin has made going to the cinema fun again.  It's just a shame he had to split his film into two, thus turning it into a `saga', and thus grouping it with all those other horrible, portentous, humourless, endless sagas currently polluting the culture.  Let the geeks have their Rings and Potter and Matrix Retarded. The rest of us can wallow in the guilty pleasure of a wide-screen extravaganza that shows Mr. Tarantino at the very top of his game.  Of course only a lunatic would want all movies to be like this one; a bit of depth and subtlety is always welcome now and then.  But, in a time when so much Hollywood mainstream product is artistically and imaginatively redundant, it comes as a very pleasant surprise to find we need Quentin Tarantino more than ever."

","In Texas, on the day of her wedding, the pregnant bride (Uma Thurman) is shot in the head by her former boss Bill. His squad of international assassins slaughters all the persons present in the church. The reasons are not explained in the story, but The Bride actually did not die and stays in coma for four years. When she wakes-up, she looks for payback and prepares a list of persons that must die. The first one to be killed is O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and then Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox).  The story, a salad of Steven Segal's `Hard to Kill', `Karate Kid', Ang Lee´s `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and many other films, has so many blood as `Freddy Vs. Jason', but is a great entertainment, with lots of action and black humor. The screenplay is very original and violent, a trademark of Quentin Tarentino. The story is presented in a non-chronological way, and the reasons of the massacre have not been presented yet. In Brazil, only last week `Kill Bill Vol. 1' was released in the movie theaters.

","Spoiler Alert! Sorry, wrong movie. Anyway, after watching Kill Bill Volume I, Quentin Tarantino's latest smashing entrance into the otherwise relatively boring modern cineplexes, I've decided on a new paint job for my truck. And by that, of course, I mean I don't own a car OR a truck, but if I did I would certainly paint it every hideous color imaginable, including a phrase on the tailgate which would quickly and efficiently negate even the slightest possibility of ever obtaining exactly that which it describes.<br/><br/>
The Shaggin' Wagon, as I'll refer to it for the benefit of all of you under-17 IMDb readers, is one of the first of almost two full hours of similarly hilarious images, words, scenes, characters, etc, brought to us by Quentin Tarantino, one of the most effectively humorous yet characteristically violent filmmakers working today. Tarantino has a surprisingly deep understanding of the gravity of violence but he combines that with the equal depth of his understanding of his audience. Hence, the violence in the movie is nothing like violence in real life (I'll explain this theoretical connection in a minute). People know this, especially his audience, which renders his films so effective.<br/><br/>Tarantino's understanding of his audience is one of the things that has allowed him to develop such a dedicated following, which I think transcends cult-status by its sheer size, if nothing else. Kill Bill has the curious distinction of being brutally and pretty much endlessly violent, and yet you can't really say that it's too violent, given that so much of the violence is so cartoonish (sometimes literally). I've heard that there was something like 100 gallons of fake blood used to make the movie. I can't remember if this refers to the total amount of blood used during filming or only that which ended up in the final cut, but animated blood, of which there are substantial amounts, are surely not included.<br/><br/>And either way, despite the massive amounts of violence in the movie, Tarantino's unique style of direction, his various cinematic experiments (such as flipping from color to black and white and back again, playing with lighting and color as in the fight scene on an entirely blue background where only the fighters' silhouettes were visible, and of course, the music), and probably mostly of all, his sense of humor tower above the film from beginning to end. One of my favorite tricks that he pulls with the music is in the fight scene between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii. It takes place in an exquisite Japanese garden, and just as the fighting begins the flamenco music kicks in, strikingly out of place but strangely effective. Tarantino's influence is so prevalent throughout the whole movie that not only can you sense his presence in just about every scene in the movie, you can almost see the look on his face.<br/><br/>It's important to keep in mind, however, that despite knowing how effective an unexpected mixture of violence and humor can be, Tarantino also realizes how effective real violence can be, and he knows how to make his violence effective, disturbing, even stomach-turning (see Reservoir Dogs). The part of the movie where The Bride wakes up in the hospital, for example, and realizes that she has lost her baby, is not funny at all. This is not meant to be amusing or funny, this is the scene where The Bride develops a large part of the rage that drives her for the rest of the film. If it was made a joke (and I can't really see how ever Tarantino could have made something like that even slightly amusing) the rest of the movie would have fallen flat.<br/><br/>The movie itself, when you think about it, is really little more than a set-up of deception and subsequent revenge. It's a pretty unusual set-up, in that the seeker of the revenge has a distinct advantage of the element of surprise, given that the people sought out for revenge shot her or saw her shot in the head, and so haven't even the slightest inclination that she might be alive, but the movie boils down to a decidedly simple and linear revenge plot. Tarantino knows this, too. You might have noticed that, first of all, The Bride carried with her a list in a little notebook of the people she means to kill (which reminded me, in a slightly different way, of the list that Steve Buscemi's character kept in his small part in Billy Madison), but also that, in keeping with his style, Tarantino plays with the chronology of his plot. He's known for this, but a movie that boils down to something as simple as this one does really can't do with a plot told in chronological order.<br/><br/>In her previous life (the one that contained something other than blinding rage and absolute determination for revenge), The Bride was a member of what is curiously called The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, the exact activities of which will not be clearly explained until Part II. Her code name was Black Mamba (although at one point I wondered why it wasn't Yellow-Haired Warrior), and her real name evidently entails something so secretive that it would be bleeped out when spoken in the movie.<br/><br/>
Like most of Tarantino's movies, Kill Bill plays like a compilation of all of the things that he loves about a huge array of different kinds of movies, not the least of which, in this case, are martial arts movies and classic 70s exploitation films. The extensive homage to martial arts films plays no small part in the preceding storyline that results in The Bride being an expert with a sword. The weapons are, in fact, one of the more interesting parts of the movie, especially in a scene late in the film where she fights the teenage bodyguard of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), who fights her with a medieval mace and chain. I thought this was one of the best scenes in the movie, where this young girl - by using everything from her feet to her hands to her very neck to propel that mace at The Bride - proves that she is just about as good with that mace as The Bride is with the sword, if not better.<br/><br/>Keep your eye out for sneaky cinematic tricks that Tarantino pulls in his movies. Not necessarily things like animating a sequence that involves a little girl witnessing his parents' murders and then a pedophilia scene involving that same girl at the age of 11 (both of which would have earned the film an even harsher rating than the well-deserved R), but things like the fact that the outfit that The Bride wears is identical to the outfit that Bruce Lee wore in his last film. Or even better, Roger Ebert points out that that tune that Hannah was whistling as she walked through the halls of the hospital to provide her own bit of nursing to The Bride while she's stuck in a coma is the theme from the 1968 film Twisted Nerve. Clearly Tarantino once again placing an homage to an old favorite in one of his movies, but Ebert curiously notes that it is not meant to simply pay an homage, but to suggest that there are leaks between parallel universes in which movies reside. Pretty clever idea, if not entirely founded. On the other hand, Ebert also suggested that after Hattori Hanso made The Bride her sword (breaking an almost 30 year old pact he had made to never again create an instrument of death) his statement `This my finest sword. If in your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut' was not exactly his most modest hour, so he could also be completely off about the movie universes thing. Hanso was not bragging about how badass his sword was. He feared that God would be cut by Hanso's breaking his word. I was surprised Roger missed that one. God doesn't strike me as the kind of person to worry about getting cut by an angry woman with a sword. That's stuff for mere mortals to concern themselves with."

"TheMovieDiorama","8","2","4","18 August 2019"," Kill Bill Vol. 1 slashes its way through sword wielding extras in Tarantino's trademark style.
","His ode to Japanese cinema, merging Western tropes with Eastern aesthetics. Blending stylised filters, utilising excessive spraying blood and embedding the art of Japanese animation. Tarantino directs the absolute heck out of this revenge thriller, temporarily acquiring the souls of Kurosawa and Miike to combine epic samurai showdowns with modern limb-slicing gore. Not to mention turning Thurman into the ""Thurminator"". Despite not being the greatest film in his illustrious filmography, it's definitely his most technically proficient. After being left for dead by a group of assassins, a bride seeks revenge by eliminating two of the five members after acquiring a legendary Hattori Hanzo katana.<br/><br/>Tarantino, for me, can come across as pretentious at the best of times. Divulging into his own self-indulgence more times than Jackson appears in his films. Don't get me wrong, he's no Malick, but it's a turn off rather than a turn on. Fortunately, his intent focus on the directorial flair as opposed to the ambitiously ostentatious dialogue found in the majority of his earlier films meant that Kill Bill was able to overcome his wearisome wit.<br/><br/>Immediately it kicks off with Thurman decimating a sub-urban house with nothing more than a few kicks, knife slashes and a cup of coffee. Tarantino setting the bar high with pleasing choreography, proving his versatility as a genre director. The ornate top-down tracking shots to showcase the set designs. The ingenious use of profoundly heightened volume of stock sound effects found in classic Japanese arts, especially the profound swinging of a sword. Swoosh woosh! Or the impalement of a blade through the chest, as if it came directly from 'Dragonball Z'. It's abrupt. It's harsh. It's Tarantino in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Then the narrative switches back and forth between the present time, the aftermath of the wedding and even further in the past with character backstory, presented in absolute stunning anime. The erratic narrative jumps do skew the momentum on multiple occasions. Although many will initially reject Ishii's backstory style, it compliments Tarantino's creative exploration into Asian cinema perfectly and even allows more bloodshed to spill off the screen. Limbs flying in every direction, heads imploding from bullets and Japanese steel piercing the hearts of innocents. A perfect chapter.<br/><br/>Chapter Four (atleast I think it was) dips the pacing with an overextended sequence at a sushi bar which unfortunately doesn't particularly highlight Thurman's acting range. But Tarantino brings it back into sixth gear with the inevitable Chapter Five that every viewer will claim to be their favourite segment of the volumes. And it's true. The showdown against the Crazy 88 is one of the greatest sequences in cinematic history. Commencing with a glorious one take walkthrough of the interior before issuing Thurman with an endless wave of subordinates to slash through. Beautiful. The perfect blend of two continental cinemas.<br/><br/>My only gripe is Tarantino's excessive over-stylisation choices to which he chose to shroud the onslaught in a monochromatic filter. It's better in colour, believe me. Atleast it concludes sensationally with a gorgeous duel with Ishii in a snow-filled garden, leaving the viewer to eagerly anticipate the sequel. Praise must be given, yet again, to the soundtrack. As with all of his films, the blend of songs and an original score is sublime. Actually, it's perfect. Complimenting every scene audaciously with excellence, particularly the slow-motion entrances.<br/><br/>And that's pretty much how one could describe this film. Excellent. It's not his best, but to allow Thurman, Hannah and even Liu to shine in a gory sword-wielding extravaganza, well it's something special. Authentically Western with the exuberance of Japanese cinema. An outstanding love letter by a craftsman at the peak of his power."

"BandSAboutMovies","10","2","4","23 March 2019"," A remix of so many sources
","I had a discussion this week about whether or not an excessive amount of tributes and homages within a film makes for a great movie or one worthy of derision. It all depends on how well remixed the source material is. When it comes to the two Kill Bill movies, the multiple references are so dense that there's almost an art to how they come together. And the places they're gathered from are so disparate and non-mainstream, the fact that they've coalesced into a Hollywood blockbuster is pretty amazing.<br/><br/>A woman in a wedding dress - who we come to know as the Bride and Black Mamba - lies wounded and possibly dying in a chapel in El Paso, Texas. She's been attacked and left for dead by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. With what may be her final breath, she tells Bill, their leader, that she's pregnant with his child. He responds by shooting her in the head.<br/><br/>The film jumps forward four years and the Bride (Uma Thurman, who helped conceive this movie with writer/director Quentin Tarantino) has hunted down one of the Vipers: Copperhead/Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), who has now become a homemaker. Our heroine tries to give her target a break and offers to meet her to battle somewhere that her family isn't in the crossfire. She responds by trying to shoot and kill the Bride, who dispatches her easily with a knife to the heart.<br/><br/>We go back now those four long years to when the Bride was in a coma. California Mountain Snake/Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah, perfection in this movie) whistles her way through the hallways of a hospital, dressed as a nurse with a matching eyepatch, ready to kill the Bride with a lethal injection. However, Bill decides to cancel the kill order as he finds it dishonorable.<br/><br/>The Bride wakes up, realizes she's no longer with child and begins her mission of revenge by killing the hospital worker who's been raping her while she was in a coma. She takes his truck and begins the long journey toward learning how to walk and fight again.<br/><br/>The first Viper who is on her kill list is Cottonmouth/O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) who has risen to become the leader of a huge clan of Tokyo Yakuza. As a child, O-Ren's parents were murdered and she spent her early years getting her own revenge.<br/><br/>The Bride seeks to have a sword made by Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba!), who has vowed to never forge a sword again. But after he learns that she wants revenge on his former student Bill, he makes one for her.<br/><br/>Tracking O-Ren to the House of Blue Leaves, the Bride - we don't learn her name until the next movie, but you can see it on her plane ticket to Tokyo - wipes out O-Ren's gang, the Crazy 88's and her bodyguard, schoolgirl with a spiked yo-yo Gogo Yubari.<br/><br/>She then kills O-Ren and tortures her assistant Sofie Fatale to discover where Bill is. The film ends with Bill speaking to Sofie and asking if the Bride knows that their daughter is alive.<br/><br/>This film was Tarantino's attempt to move from the talky fare he was known for and into the action cinema that he loves. The House of Blue Leaves battle took six weeks longer than expected, but that's because it's packed with traditional special effects and stuntwork instead of the CGI we're now used to.<br/><br/>Obviously, Kill Bill is inspired by grindhouse cinema, drawing inspiration from the Shaw Brothers, Sergio Leone and Lucio Fulci amongst many others. We've gone in-depth to breakdown the actual films that it takes inspiration from in this article. Trust us - there are so many, sometimes multiple references within one shot!<br/><br/>According to Uma Thurman, Tarantino asked her to watch three movies to prepare: The Killer, Coffy and A Fistful of Dollars.<br/><br/>Originally intended as one movie, the four-hour runtime was considered too long for filmgoers, so this was split in two separate movies. It's pretty astounding that after all the death and destruction in this film, The Bride only has one kill left in the sequel.<br/><br/>Kill Bill reminds me of the Beastie Boys' Paul's Botique. There are hundreds of samples all over that album, which make it a much richer experience if you know where they all come from. But if you don't, you can still dance to it."

"Floated2","4","2","4","29 June 2017"," Stylish and high profile but a little over-hyped
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is considered by many to be a very violet film and is arguable considered by Quentin Tarantino to be his fourth film (previously stated within the film's opening credits). Tarantino makes it well known that this film is his as he does in all of his films, where he makes it known that he is more important himself than his actual films or the actors acting in his films. Obviously self-righteous but as a high level profile as himself, one is able to do that. <br/><br/>Kill Bill's plot appears to be relatively plot-free. The film plays as one long homage to Asian martial arts films, and the plot serves only to provide excuses for the action set pieces, which are undeniably as they are horrific. The problem isn't the film is too violet is that the characters are not likable, and everything occurring is quite predictable. The action sequences are shot well, but the film tries hard being more than that. Within the story centers a character known as The Bride (Uma Thurman), who is working down her kill list in order to avenge the death of her unborn baby. The group she is fighting goes by the name of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The movie is broken up into chapters very similar throughout, using names such as ""The Blood Splattered Bride."" The highlight of the movie sees near towards the middle of the ending where it hyperboles within a long hyperviolent type anime episode in the middle but then ultimately picking back up when it switches back to live action as the bride single-highhandedly battles and defeats O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu) and her numerous warriors. These last few fight sequences involving the Bride defeating these ninja warriors is very unrealistic and hard to take serious, as she is one woman completely destroying and fighting off far many trained assassins. <br/><br/>As a revenge movie, the film makes it hard for us to root for the Bride as she isn't a great character in any needs and very unlikable. Not too interesting either, perhaps considered by many to be miscast by Uma Thurman, and I am in agreement within this statement. Having been compared to the Matrix (1999), the Matrix is a far better film in about every area, though just not near as violet. Overall, Volume 1 is slightly overrated and over-hyped as a film but considering it is from Pulp Fiction director Quentin Tarantino, this isn't surprising."

Pretty exaggerated in a lot of aspects.<br/><br/>Kill Bill follows the story of ""The Bride"", an ex-assassin that tried to leave the ""killing lifestyle"" after knowing that she was pregnant but instead got betrayed by her old assassination squad, the Deadly Viper, leaving her in a coma for 4 years, she now must seek revenge. <br/><br/>This is the type of movie that just FELLS GOOD to watch. My dad used to go to the movies to watch Bruce Lee and now i go to the movies to watch Kill Bill. I don't go the movies that often but when i do my goal is not come out from the theater deeply inspired, crying or almost falling asleep. When i go to the movies i want to have fun watching something well designed, a small piece of art. And that's exactly what Kill Bill delivers. The great visuals, a soundtrack that perfectly fits the film, the crazy fights and the creativity in creating the characters and their story just make this film so entertaining to watch. Yes, is not a super sentimental or meaningful film but it's not supposed to be.<br/><br/>You might be thinking ""But man it just looks like a movie with chicks kicking each other ass..."" and I'll quote myself ""No, it's chicks kicking each other ass with style."""

","Kill Bill is a film full of excesses. The fight in Tokyo is too long, the script is disastrous, the characters are flat...This movie has many mistakes, although I must say the production has very correct things like the villains. The brief actuation of Elle Driver is uncanny, Gogo Yubari is the perfect enemy, Oren is marvelously wicked and Sophie Fatale is brilliant. Also the Bride is fantastic meanwhile she is carrying through her revenge. The music merit the Oscar and the argument produces attraction. Perhaps Kill Bill isn't Django or Pulp Fiction, but we can feel Tarantino's hand in this film. My favorite character so far is Elle Driver. I love the evil gaze of Elle Driver! Quentin Tarantino chose very well the actors for the movie, is wonder. But definitely the mark is 6,0."

","This is the first movie I have given one star on IMDb. I'm sorry - I'm sure it's my fault for not liking this movie (I must be missing something), but in my poor limited mind this movie seems gratuitously hateful, mean-spirited, inhumane and glorifying evil deeds. I have seen the first two parts (because friends of mine dragged me to see them) and I have to say that this is just the kind of film that made me not so anxious to go to the movie theatre anymore. This is the kind of genre that not only sickens me and shows me everything that is wrong with the world but also makes me worry that it will inspire sick minds to emulate the same kind of wantonness this movie revels in. In fact, I suspect it already has. I fear that some weak and disturbed minds might not get the ""joke"" in the Kill Bill films (IF they have one; those that like them seem to think they're funny on some level or satires but I don't see anything funny about gruesome scenes and depraved murders) - and these people might go out and repeat what they've seen in them. It's funny - if you recall the furor Warren Beatty's Bonnie And Clyde inspired, for supposedly encouraging and celebrating violence - it's strange that the Kill Bill films didn't also draw the ire of the critics. Quentin Tarantino knows how to make a film, that's for sure - but not the kind of films that I feel should be allowed to be shown. It's films like the Kill Bill films that makes me think the movie industry should exercise more taste and control over what gets released - are there no standards anymore? With movies like these, why wonder why there is so much violence today? (But that makes me seem old-fashioned and an advocate of censorship - not a popular idea in this culture where we worry about the growing violence in our society yet don't ever open our eyes to the likely causes.)"

","Every time someone explains how good Kill Bill was, i remember what happened when i told a Chinese colleague how much i liked Crouching Tiger, hidden Dragon (2000). What was exciting for me was for him just another wuxia film merging kung-fu with a love story.<br/><br/>True to himself, Tarantino merged kung-fu motives with crime thriller and, to certain extent, western. Love story was relevant only for viewers who believe that love must hurt and in Kill Bill that is rather literal.<br/><br/>The result is a watchable movie that is mostly interesting. As it is the case in most of Tarantino work, this was not the one i'd like to see again. It is not the violence that turns me off, but a lack of message and the hype that surrounds it."

","In quite stereotypical Tarantino fashion, the director of 'Pulp Fiction' converged together a critically acclaimed revenge movie in which Uma Thurman would play a Bride on the rampage! To me, 'Kill Bill' never quite lived up to the hype but I certainly wouldn't discard it nonetheless.<br/><br/>Thurman's Bride is battered and bruised by her previous boyfriends (David Carradine) mobsters and thugs in - what was - an act of jealousy. In an act of revenge, Thurman regains her strength to kill each of Bill's (Carradine) assassins before finally taking her revenge on the man in question. This first film revolves around her attempts to murder the dangerous O - Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). <br/><br/>The violence that is present throughout never really appealed to me to much. Not only is it over the top but also quite unrealistic. <br/><br/>The story is paper thin and there are no real twists or turns in this gruesome tale. However, having also seen volume two, I can say that the plot there was much stronger despite a slower pacing.<br/><br/>Still, Thurman's acting is fantastic while all other cast members are also faultless in their roles.<br/><br/>I can't call it award worthy - even though it was - however I definitely wouldn't give it the brush off on a Friday night."

That was just ridiculous.<br/><br/>And when she comes to kill O-Ren Ishii and she kills a whole army of men just like that. That was so ridiculous and unrealistic and even more annoying with all the blood coming out of them like a fountain. Really? + all the chopped of limbs and annoying cartoon in the middle of it. I see how men would love this movie, but as a girl I don't get it. Why would they put a woman in the lead, when it's a movie made for men?<br/><br/>I was just hoping it would end soon cause I was so bored. I never saw how it ended and I really don't care. Big disappointment."
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","2","4","12 March 2008"," A dizzying collage of styles, textures and visual references
","Whereas Reservoir Dogs (1991) and Pulp Fiction (1994) took elements from the French New Wave and American independent cinema of the 1970's to create bold, iconic, character driven films rife with clever dialog, uncompromising violence and subtle allusions to a myriad of varied, textured film references, Kill Bill: Volumes 1 & 2 (2003-2004) take the idea of referencing even further, giving us blatant and literal references that cross from one genre to the next with a complete disregard for whether or not the audience is familiar with the kind of work being quoted. This technique is pushed even further in the subsequent Death Proof (2007), which really does require an audience to be familiar with its subject in order to get the most out of the style, set-up and intent. Here, all pretensions to the cinema of the French New Wave are dropped, as well as the more adult-orientated flavour of the previous Jackie Brown (1997), which was perhaps more in keeping with the aging spirit of the blacksploitation sub-genre of films from which it drew a superficial influence.<br/><br/>Instead, Kill Bill (2003) finds director Quentin Tarantino shifting his focus to Asian cinema and referencing sources as disparate as Kung-Fu (1972), Lone Wolf and Cub (1972), Lady Snowblood (1973), The Street Fighter (1974), Shogun Assassin (1980) and Ichi the Killer (2001), as well as taking direct influence from the Shaw Brothers studio productions of the 1960's and filmmakers like Kinji Fukasaku and Seijun Suzuki. Alongside these visual and thematic reference points we also have a continual reliance on juxtaposing ideas and iconography taken from spaghetti westerns, blacksploitation pictures, Chinese ""wuxia"" and kung fu movies, Japanese Manga and Anime, hip-hop, American exploitation and revenge cinema, and François Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black (1968). These influences are all combined, sometimes obviously and sometimes with more subtlety, but all used with flair, imagination and intelligence to create the right kind of cinematic environment for this purposely elaborate, over-the-top, comic-book-style tale of roaring rampage and revenge to play out against.<br/><br/>The opening shot is fantastic; rife with cinematic allusions to Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars (1964) and Seijun Suzuki's Tokyo Drifter (1965), with the use of black and white cinematography and the image of the iconic ""Bride"" laid out on her back, bloody and bruised, pleading for her life with an off-screen Bill who is about to put a bullet in her head. From here we cut to the title and the near-iconic use of Nancy Sinatra's version of the Sony Bono track 'Bang, Bang', which is every bit as bold, amusing, cool and ironic as the use of opening music in other Tarantino works. From here we cut back and forth in a non-linear progression to track the return and subsequent revenge of ""The Bride"" against the gang of devious former comrades who betrayed her.<br/><br/>As the film is split into two halves (for commercial reasons, as opposed to artistic; but regardless, tying in with the literary use of voice-over, chapter-heading, an unreliable narrator, etc) there will always be the question of how to critique it. Do we view them as two separate films that should each deliver on the characteristics that we think cinema should pertain to, or do we view this as one long film; a continuation of a single character and theme over the course of two very different though ultimately linked feature films? If we take the former approach, then Volume 1 (2003) is the easiest film to appreciate on an immediate level, concerning itself more with scenes of balletic, visually rich and heavily choreographed action; relegating much of Tarantino's usual interplay of character and dialog to the background and allowing the visuals to completely envelope us. In this sense Tarantino is drawing on the B-cinema pop-art explosion of Suzuki, most notable in the sequence where ""The Bride"" takes on the Crazy-88's amidst a barrage ostentatious camera movements, lighting changes, black and white inter-cutting and bouncing Go-Go music from the 5, 6, 7, 8's.<br/><br/>There are also elements of over the top martial arts choreography juxtaposed against scenes of more brutal, harder-hitting violence, obvious miniature work that almost points to the original Godzilla films, retro use of rear-screen projection, allusions to films as disparate as Twisted Nerve (1968), Hitchcock, Brian De Palma's elaborate use of split-screen, the production design from Gate of Flesh (1964) and Sex and Fury (1974), the casting of Chiaki Kuriyama (perhaps familiar to most audience from her appearances in Fukasaku's Battle Royale) and Bruce Lee's Game of Death (1978). Though these elements are impressive, particularly when coupled with the scenes of over-the-top violence (which nods to the exaggerated bloodshed of Anime and of films like the aforementioned Shogun Assassin and Ichi the Killer) and the technical virtuosity of Tarantino and cinematographer Robert Richardson, the effect can seem hollow; especially when we cross-reference this to the much more reserved, dialog-driven Volume 2 (2004).<br/><br/>With this in mind, it would seem more appropriate to view the films as one single film; taking into account both the bursts of colour and energy presented in Volume 1 and the slower, more character-driven approach of Volume 2 to really get the most out of the incredible journey that this larger than life character undertakes. It also allows us to better appreciate the extraordinary performance from Uma Thurman in the central role, who here gives one of the best performances of her career; instilling ""The Bride"" with a sense of honour and purpose that makes her violence and bloodshed all the more understandable. Kill Bill: Volume 1 doesn't quite scale the dizzying heights of Tarantino's first three films; lacking the intuitive style, unique dialog and intricate plotting - but it does represent a new phase of his career; one that pushes cinematic reference even further to create a visual tapestry of self-aware cinema that appeals to learned cineastes preoccupied with technique, as well as offering a bold story, memorable characters and a great sense of entertainment."
"fedor8","Null","2","4","7 February 2007"," Retarded but entertaining.
","First of all, I am utterly bored with action movies. They are idiotic, repetitive and dull. So for someone to make a sort of homage  admittedly mixed with parody  to this genre says a lot about the person's intelligence. Tarantino, that ol' idiot savant, has great talent with the camera, and certainly can come up with an original scene or two. However: he is a moron. There isn't an iota of intellectuality in him or his movies. Not that this is at all essential in movies, because were it so, there would be about 5 good movies in the last 100 years. So to expect him to make an intelligent movie: this will never, ever happen. That he is fascinated by Asian actioners says a lot about his retardation. He has always been this childish nerd who made very good films and always will be. But while I like all his previous films, it has to be said that they are entertaining but cretinous. ""Kill Bill"" is his fourth and most cretinous film to date (as a director). It's also his weakest, perhaps. Rarely boring, I admit, but the action, though stylized, is still just people breaking each other's bones: not so fascinating; it's been done a zillion times. The teenage audiences would disagree, but then again, teens today have never been dumber (rap, fashion, and cell phones being the height of artistry and/or importance in their empty little lives).<br/><br/>The positive things about the movie are the music, which is so far the best of all his movies (I particularly hated some of it in ""Pulp Fiction""; God knows why people love that awful soundtrack), the visual quality and the style, and the fact that it does maintain interest.<br/><br/>One of the problems I have with it is that I don't quite understand why Tarantino made a film that has comic-book Bugs-Bunny violence in it  and yet tries to make us take the main character and her mission of revenge too seriously. This simply can't work: you either make an all-out silly movie, or you make it in a serious vein, in which case you need action scenes that don't look like they came straight out of a Road Runner cartoon. But this only goes to show what a moron Tarantino is. Lucky for him that 90% of the public are about as dumb as he is, so not many are really bothered by this.<br/><br/>Another problem is the cast: the worst so far. I have no idea why, but apart from his first movie, ""Reservoir Dogs"", he has always chosen sub-par actors for his movies  with some notable exceptions. In PF he chose Travolta, Arquette, De Medeiros, Thurman Mediocrities. In BB he actually wasted his time casting Bridget Fonda and Keaton, the little twerp playing the cop. This time around, he practically employs a uniformly forgettable cast: Thurman, Carradine, Darryl Hannah Why? Two reasons: 1) It seems Tarantino definitely has a nepotism complex: he loves using sons and daughters of other actors, which maybe makes him feel closer to and hence part of Hollywood mythology and/or royalty; I know, this would be a pathetic and moronic way of thinking but, hey, it's Tarantino we're talking about; after all, when a moron like David Arquette shows up on the scene people talk about ""Hollywood Royalty"" (people without half a brain-cell, obviously). 2) Tarantino has revived Travolta's career and brought some other forgotten stars from the 70s (his favourite decade) into temporary spotlight. He must think that he has this power to re-juvenate the career of ANY actor that he wants; perhaps he feels that his movies are so good that any cast will be great in them. Where are the Keitels, Buscemis, Roths, Jacksons, and other good ones he used before? He doesn't have a single high-quality actor in this  in a film with plenty of (colourful - if clichéd) characters. His love for Thurman (and I mean genuine, sexual love) blinds him to the fact that she is a mediocre actress. It's a credit to him that she has been always best in his movies  but that's HER best, not worth much. Every non-Tarantino movie I'd seen her in she was mediocre or even amateurish. Typical model-turned-actress. And his private obsession with her goes so far as to film her disgusting, over-sized feet in one scene. Yuck! Does he actually think her feet are sexy? She's about 185 cm, that damn giraffe! The only potentially sexy thing about her would be her boobs  provided they're real.<br/><br/>If you're interested in my ""Hollywood Nepotism List"", with over 300 pictures/entries, contact me by e-mail."

","There is no dialog like the one in pulp fiction or reservoir dogs. There is lots of Quentin trademarks, but it's done so badly that it looks like a knock off. The soundtrack is okay  but it's just not cool. The actors have probably been instructed to play in cartoon 2D style to stay in the genre of martial art movies from the seventies  but is comes of boring. I think of natural born killers as a good script and a bad director, this film comes of as a bad idea and a director that is destroying his life with narcotics. Do fans of martial arts movie like this movie? I think this comes of as a pretentious martial art movie, and it leaves a bad stigma to the whole movie."
"kjaworski","4","2","4","5 November 2005"," he's done better
","I might have more regard for the movie if I didn't think Tarantino accomplished more, and was just simply deeper, in his other films.<br/><br/>Tarantino the artist, in my opinion, was just a better overall communicator and creator in each of his other films. I really don't think ""Kill Bill"" succeeds on any level as much as the others, and I'm very surprised to see so many critics that are so seduced by Tarantino's technical skill in the film (which, indisputably, is substantial) that they simply fail to see it.<br/><br/>In other words, it plays to me like one of your less-liked episodes from your favorite TV show. Just not as strong.<br/><br/>For example, to me, the 'funny' moments weren't funny in Kill Bill, except for when the main character 'emerges' and heads across the street in Vol. 2 (I don't want to give anything away). I thought that was brilliantly funny...<br/><br/>But the guy who won't get the tea, the 'want some coffee?' thing, other moments meant to be funny just didn't work; certainly not in the way that they did in ""Reservoir Dogs"": 'You're gonna be okaaaaaay!', ""Pulp Fiction"": 'Royale with cheese! ha ha'', or ""Jackie Brown"": 'Killer had a 45. THEY want a 45.' From a TECHNICAL standpoint, many of the action sequences are fast and well-crafted and etc. There's much more that has to make ANY artistic creation resonate and work, though.<br/><br/>There are so many things that happen in the movie that aren't realistic from a character or plot standpoint. And, no, I'm not even talking about the violence. I don't want to give away details for people who haven't seen the movies, but there are so many times when characters showed NO REACTION to something quite surprising happening in the story. They just fought out their well-choreographed, well-shot, well-edited fight scene that was scheduled for that day, and it feels like it.<br/><br/>I wouldn't have a problem with the violence if it didn't feel like it just came form someone who likes to see violence in movies. If more of it had true, dramatic motivation for being in there (like, say, HIS OTHER MOVIES), I'd be more understanding. But, so much of the time, this just isn't the case.<br/><br/>The example that comes most readily to mind is when Thurman's trying to will her toes to move and her flashback somehow comes around to the Anime sections involving the heartbreakingly disgusting and tragic murders of Lucy Liu's characters' parents. From a character standpoint, his is a MAJOR cheat. Thurman's character is in no position to know this. Obviously, she DOESN'T know it, but it was a convenient place to put in background about Lucy Liu's character. The scene itself, to me, doesn't play with any AUTHENTIC dramatic weight. It's just ""Hey, major anime bloodbath! Awesome! Let's just make it as horrendous as possible"" stuff.<br/><br/>It feels like, much of the time, Tarantino ratcheted up the ""Shock-O-Meter"" which is much easier, and less respectable, than reaching for deeper and more artistically valuable details and plot developments.<br/><br/>Some people enjoy this kind of thing. For someone who likes movies for their storytelling, creative and dramatic potentials, it's nothing short of revolting and upsetting.<br/><br/>I thought Thurman was amazing, and I thought the Crazy 88s demise and the aftermath was pretty funny.<br/><br/>I thought the very opening was The No. 1 Most Gripping Introduction I'd ever seen in a film. Ever.<br/><br/>But I don't think the rest of the film lives up to it."

These are the cinematic equivalents of quantum theory and the Sidney Opera House, Kill Bill is the cinematic equivalent of a fashion show of polished and posing airheads--only with lots of blood. <br/><br/>Don't waste your money unless that sounds appealing.

"msrchuk","6","2","4","12 May 2005"," A triumph of hype over substance
","It took me a long time to get around to Kill Bill; partly because I'm not a huge fan of martial arts movies, and partly because I find QT's elevation to movie-god status a little premature. There is a lot to like in this film. The photography is excellent, the cast is strong, and the story is quirky. However, Tarantino has got carried away with his homage to Asian movies and Japanese comics. The plot is just too silly, and it's quite unbelievable that none of the 88's pull a gun on the Bride. Stuff the swordplay - bodyguards should kill to protect without worrying about honour. QT is also clearly fixated on blood. He started with pools of it in Reservoir Dogs; now we're treated to huge fountains and lakes. It reminded me immediately of the Black Knight sequence in the Holy Grail or the other Python sketch: Anyone for Tennis? How can Sophie survive after losing so much blood so quickly? The cast: Uma Thurman looks as fabulous as ever and delivers lines and moves with aplomb, and I really enjoyed Lucy Liu as an evil gang boss. Daryl Hannah doesn't feature enough in Vol.1 to judge, nor Carradine. Vivica Fox is effective in her brief segment, although who in the hell would stop a fight to the death and drink a coffee because a kid comes home? Anyway she didn't write the script so can't blame her for that. Best moment: the fight between the Bride and O-Ren Ishii in the snow, with the bamboo water holder tipping metronomically in the background. I will watch Vol. 2 because I'm interested to find out the rest of the story, plus QT films are always worth at least one viewing, but I certainly won't bother to see either part twice. This is definitely not his best work. By the way, is it just me, or is it pretentious to put in the titles ""Quentin Tarantino's 4th Film""? I would love to see him apply his undoubted talents to more serious and substantial screenplays. Maybe he could have a go at an historical epic to start off with?"
"mileshoward","5","2","4","1 April 2005"," Style to Kill For, but No Substance....
","There will be many people who will hate me for what I am about to say, but here goes. I went into Kill Bill Volume 1 excited. Quentin Tarantino has made some amazing films. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction still blow me away today. Now, after watching this new movie from QT, I left the theater feeling undeniably disappointed.<br/><br/>First of all, Kill Bill is arguably one of the most stylish movies to be released in 2003. I mean seriously. The film has imagery to die for. The fight sequences are spectacularly choreographed, exciting, and ludicrously violent (an homage to kung-fu films). The set decoration is awesome (loved the House of Blue Leaves), Uma's tracksuit is killer (also an homage, this time to Bruce Lee), and the cinematography is gleefully kinetic. The soundtrack also brings down the house, and is one I would consider adding to my CD collection.<br/><br/>That being said, Kill Bill is beautiful. Yet, there is the age-old truth that looks only go so far...<br/><br/>What many people seem to dislike Kill Bill for is the absurdity of the gory violence, for they feel it takes away from the seriousness of the film. It has been said many times, by Tarantino himself, that Kill Bill is an homage to the grindhouse films of the 70s, and the magnitude of the violence is intentional. In other words, it fits the style of the film. And again, the style is really something. But after awhile, the awe and shock of the yellow tracksuits and severed limbs begins to wear off, and it becomes apparent that beneath all the excess of the film, there is not a core, as in Pulp Fiction, but a hollow void. Uma Thurman's character is passionately vengeful and she makes the best of what she is given, but besides being wronged by Bill and the Deadly Vipers, there is barely any depth to her. The film moves far too quickly to feel a genuine attachment to The Bride. Yes, she is put through hell, and therefore we feel sorry for her. Yet, our relationship with her never quite reaches a level beyond that. And because of the latter, Kill Bill felt very empty to me in the end. I can see why it is rated so highly though. Because it's easy to win over an audience with style, which is what Kill Bill is all about. This is only my opinion. Others may disagree with me. Sure the film is an homage to past movies, but that doesn't give it greatness. Nor does style. The most revered and expertly crafted movies have all offered something similar; a story with emotional depth and complexity that goes beyond the standard Hollywood fare. It saddens me to see that Quentin Tarantino has sunken to a lower standard. After all, he is praised for his script- writing from previous films. I remember when I saw the first trailer for Kill Bill. A subtitle read ""Miramax Presents.......The Fourth Film by Quentin Tarantino"". I rest my case."
"phmurphy","5","2","4","13 August 2004"," Not Impressed
","I just saw Kill Bill vol. 1 for the first time and i am not impressed. To me it wasn't Tarantinos best work at all. I thought that a lot of the dialogue was weak and not nearly as quick, creative, and original as we are used to most Tarantino scripts and dialogues being. For instance, watch this movie and then watch Dogs, Pulp and True Romance(which he wrote) and listen to how much better the dialogue is in those films as opposed to Kill Bill. The fighting of course was great and the music was what really held the film together. Quentin stayed true to his eye of matching music to the scene very well. I'm not saying that it was a bad movie, but i just wasn't impressed. I haven't seen Vol. 2 yet but i hope that Michael Madsen has some more lines and face time in it because some of the things that flew out of his mouth in Reservoir Dogs were great and he is a true Tarantino actor. I hope that for Quentins next movie, he goes back to those wild ideas that he had in Pulp and Dogs, instead of this kung fu s**t. Overall, i give this movie a 6/10."
"ajb073","5","2","4","24 June 2004"," I don't think I get it
","I have come to the conclusion, after reading numerous reviews and comments on Kill Bill that you either love it or you can't stand it.  I still haven't decided where I stand yet.  At first I was leaning towards the ""what the hell is the point of this movie"" side.  However now that I have watched it, I recognize why it is regarded so well by many and have developed some respect for it.  But I still don't like it yet. <br/><br/>     If this film was not directed by the admiral to many, Quentin Tarantino, it would most likely not demand the same respect and praise from viewers.  However, Quentin makes it clear to all that he is the director and that this is 4th film by posting this is in the credits several times and on the cover of the film. I was a little confused while I was watching Kill Bill.  The action sequences seemed to be like something out of a PG-13 Jackie Chan movie but body parts and limbs were actually being cut off in the action scenes, unlike the PG-13 Jackie Chan movies or their equivalents.  Does this brutality make Kill Bill a masterpiece because unlike the other martial arts films limbs are being dismembered with what seems like a never ending supply of red liquid representing blood?      I don't know the answer to that question.  I give this film a 5 out of 10.  I respect the originality and unique universe created by Kill Bill, but I don't fully understand it and why others praise so much.  I give it a middle of the road 5 because I disagree with those who dis the film as having pointless brutal action scenes and little merit.  But I also do not share the passion and obsession that some people have with the film."

However, for anyone that has seen a real martial arts movie with some truth to it (Kiss of the Dragon, Enter the Dragon, Bruce Lee Story, Green Hornet, Tai Chi Master..""

"scolopendra6","Null","2","4","29 April 2004"," It's an homage, apparently, but..
","..is it good?<br/><br/>I'd say it deserves a fair rating. Nothing that would traumatize you too much, but not something you couldn't live without seeing. Like someone else said it seems that Tarantino has a weakness for references to other films, and here it is very apparent; one needn't be that much of a Kurosawa or '70s HK film fan to see the references. If ""Bill"" didn't have the homage as its skeleton it would've been more interesting. Even Tarantino's own films are referenced here.<br/><br/>And the characters? I found the villains more interesting..Uma Thurman cannot carry a movie on her own, plainly. No charisma. Her character, if anything is straightforward; she's out to kill some people. We never find out exactly why her wedding was hit, though it has to be said that it was by the most impractical group of assasins in movie history, their follies appearing especially at the big fight scene towards the end. I mean, all those well-dressed thugs must've been able to afford an Uzi or something! Swords? In the 21st century? Maybe in the period ""Yojimbo"" was set in, it would make sense. I don't think anyone without the assistance of speed is talented enough to fight off nearly 100 people with a sword.<br/><br/>
Anyway, the villains were a lot cooler than Uma..I actually felt sad when she killed that Oren chick. I mean, she was so cool! and her little entourage, too...they were characters you don't want to mess with, but in some quiet way adore..<br/><br/>Overall production-wise it's very cool and trendy. Storywise; blah. Maybe I'm in a minority but I like stories! ""Pulp Fiction"" was a good story and it had weird witty dialogue..there wasn't any here, unfortuneately."

","Before I went to the cinema and watch it, I didnt expect much, but I was more than sure that it would have many thrills and good action scenes. In the first few minutes I was watching with great interest; some good fight scenes, some anachronisms and hope that these good actors will pull something good out of this! Later on I realized that Tarantino wished to make a manga style movie (not only from the actual manga cartoon that were added in the movie), which I didnt mind at all, cause I really enjoy cartoon or comic feeling in a movie. What I watched afterwards though had nothing to do with mangas or anything similar, but more like a cheap imitation of them! TOO many idiotic dialogues plus fight scenes with extreme duration (and totally simplistic) made it a VERY low quality film comparing to what I originally expect, which wasnt too much anyway! My opinion: Avoid! My grade: 3/10!"

"JohnCalhoun","Null","2","4","18 October 2003"," An extremely flawed film
","WARNING: HEAVY SPOILERS<br/><br/>Let me begin by stating the positive aspects of the film. The gore, the cinematography, the anime sequence, and the Tarantinoesque style make Kill Bill Vol. 1 an enjoyable experience<br/><br/>However, the dialogue is utterly laughably (not in the good tongue-in-cheek way it was intended): ""Even Steven"" ""I'm Buck and I come to f***"" ""Silly Rabbit Trix are for Kids""...Are these supposed to be great quotes? This pales in comparison to the dialogue Tarantino is known for. This especially sad because kung fu dialogue can be so deliciously cheesy, yet here it's just sad.<br/><br/>Lucy Liu is not a good actress. Her monologue after decapitating the Japanese racialist in her clan was a cheap attempt at understatement and situational irony. Lucy Liu is also crosseyed. So why are there so many closeups of her face?<br/><br/>Uma Thurman did not do any notable kung fu moves. the wire wasn't very well done because you can tell exactly when the wire begins to influence movement. This resembles the bad wirework of The Tuxedo. I cringed at every time Uma Thurman tried to sound tough.<br/><br/>The ""Move your Big Toe"" was pointless. It seemed to last forever. It is also a huge plothole that she would have been able to camp out in the car of Buck who she just killed for that long without being discovered by the police. That's ridiculously implausible and reeks of lazy writing. Staring at Uma Thurman's crooked and badly manicured toes for 10 minutes is also beyond excessive. This should have been cut.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is packed with plot holes. Uma Thurman driving the P*ssy Wagon, the car of a man she just slaughtered without being discovered by the police is one example. Yeah right. You know, HARDWORKING writers would have organized the script in a manner where such obvious holes would have been avoided. Sorry, but Tarantino telling the public ahead of time that Kill Bill takes place ""in a parallel universe where police doesn't exist"" is a cheap tactic. You might as well start giving excuses for plot holes in other movies. And don't start telling me that it's a Kung Fu parody and is not supposed to be taken seriously because if it were just another kung fu parody, then it wouldn't be getting 4 out of 4s on so many film forums. Kill Bill isn't Kung Pow. It doesn't deserve these sort of plot holes nor will it get away with the screenwriter's cheap Entertainment Tonight-crap press releases.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 1 suffers from a lack of exposition: okay what do we know about the Bride? She was beaten up pretty badly and killed. That's all we know. This makes it impossible to cheer her on as she dismembers her former colleagues. Tarantino also insists on making the baddies as ""cool"" and idiosyncratically appealing as possible. So we are left watching the movie saying ""cool there's so much blood and guts"" but we don't get the rush of empathic energy that we got with movies like Payback and Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>
Tarantino's tired nonlinear screenplay is a major flaw. At first I thought that Uma kills Vivica A. Fox first. Today my friend informed me that the Fox-slaying takes place after Uma's scalping of Lucy Liu as indicated by her stupidly superfluous notepad (*sigh*). If her notepad had not been there to inform us of Tarantino's oh so brilliant storytelling style we would have NEVER KNOWN that her murder of Vivica A. Fox takes place after her trip to Japan. In fact it makes more sense to have had her kill Fox first. Why go to Japan and deal with the Yakuza right after being released when you can just go to Fox's house in the United States. Uma goes to Japan and comes back and is STILL DRIVING THE P*SSY WAGON? give me a break. This nonlinear style serves no purpose at all other than to give an excuse for Tarantino's obsession with keeping the Bride's history out of the first half of the Kill Bill movies.<br/><br/>The Black and White shift during the Crazy 88 fight scene was not needed. Is there any point to this, or is Quentin just trying to make his film look more artsy (something it definitely IS NOT)? The film's major asset is the gore, therefore it is unreasonable to cut down on almost 50% of the film's potential gore.<br/><br/>There is no mention of the Bride's possible venereal diseases after being raped repeatedly by various urchins while she was in a coma. for all we know she could be HIV +. This would have made us SYMPATHIZE and cheer for Uma's character. It would have also made the film realistic and proven to be a huge step in the portrayal of the HIV in film.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is plagued by culture confusion syndrome. Sorry but anyone who knows anything about the histories and cultures of China and Japan knows that they have almost nothing to do with each other culturally. Tarantino's blending of the samurai film with the kung fu film seems very racist (unintentionally) and ignorant. I guess since they both have slant eyes than they must both be sort of similar right? Wrong! This was really offensive. The Yakuza would NEVER nominate a Chinese-blood as a leader. They (and the entire country of Japan) are known for being racialists.<br/><br/>The time of the split seemed like the middle of a long metrage. This is not a good time for a split. I felt cheated. I have to pay twice to see one film? I'm sure we could have cut many of the scenes but Tarantino was probably too persistent. Weinstein made the wise financial decision that the film would flop if released as a 3 hour film but would make much more than expected if split released TWICE. I can't blame him. Filmmaking is a business and they want their money, but this is setting a precedent for all potentially long films. The moment of the split was not wisely chosen. Perhaps no moment would have been suitable as the splitting point because the film was not initially conceived as a two-volume feature. It reeks of cash-grabbing consumer-duping though. The marketing campaign for Kill Bill proved to be extremely disgusting as well. Only two other people in the theater knew that it was only half a movie. Kill Bill Vol. 1 was advertised as Kill Bill. It's so nice when those filmmakers trick consumers out of their money isn't it?<br/><br/><br/><br/>
Bottom line: Kill Bill Vol. 1 would have been NOTHING without the gore. The gore made the film and will establish its legacy. I had a good time despite the negatives therefore I would give Kill Bill a fresh. Tarantino has run out of ideas and is getting indolent with screenwriting, therefore he is relying on spoofing films to create his films. He peaked too early with Pulp Fiction and he does not have much to prove anymore. He's just another guy trying to add more to his pile of dough. See Kill Bill if you like cartoonish violence and pizazz. Avoid it if you don't."

I know it's a two parter and its an homage to all those shaw brothers movies but can we get a little more on the character ""The Bride"".  I mean what is the point of all this?  Why should I give a **** about the Uma Thurman character?  I really feel that is what a lot of movies lack now a days.  I feel like movies are more eye candy than substance and just rush to the great action scenes without allowing the audience time to attach to a character.  I mean, I felt a little sympathetic with the Lucy Liu character because of that little anime on her character's background. I kind of wished there was something like that for the Bride. I mean for the first 10 minutes she gets shot in the head and then shes knife fighting with Vernita Green.  Yeah we know she's on the war path for revenge but give me a chance to know the character...that way the fighting scenes would be ""more"" than just fighting scenes.<br/><br/>My favorite moment which some of you might find kind of weird is the transition between the anime to the bride when she says ""But first thing first....wiggle your big toe"".

"fsjodin","4","2","4","11 October 2003"," Caricature does not equal character
","*** Spoilers within *** The sense that seeing Kill Bill left me with is that Quentin Tarantino is really trying. He is trying hard, wanting to bring us back to where we were after having seen Pulp Fiction for the first time. He does not succeed.<br/><br/>
Successful comic books (and this is what Kill Bill aspires to be) have something at the core and that is characters that no matter how over the top, or unbelievable or both, succeed in producing either a sense of sympathy (for the heroes) or disdain (for the villains) or as is the case in the best comic books, for an example Punisher, sympathy for a main character that is really no better than the villains.<br/><br/>The problem with Kill Bill is that QT never manages to develop the characters from being more than stylized caricatures. So we are supposed to feel sorry for 'The Bride'? She conjures nothing more than indifference and perhaps a bit of boredom. And Lucy Liu as the main villain? QT seems more interested in having her in either extreme closeups or viewed in swirling camera angles surrounded by falling snow where we can really get a good view of her rather than at least minimally develop her character.<br/><br/>
Besides the flawed or rather inexistent character development, another aspect of the movie that really bothered me was the pacing. In many of the scenes and especially in the last showdown between Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu the fighting characters will inexplicably pause and look at eachother for what seem to be an eternity before, after exchanging a few words, go at it again. I don't know if these pauses were put in there to build the 'mood' or add 'suspense' or simply to let us admire Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu posing in Ninja positions. This technique coupled with the constant breaks to the 'Chapter X' cut scenes leaves the movie feeling choppy and fragmented.<br/><br/>
So what is good about the movie? Uma Thurman does a great job with what she has to work with. The styling is slick but far from enough to save the movie.<br/><br/>You know how it is when you go to see a movie that has looked pretty darn good in the trailer and afterwards you wish they would have made it a short, about the length of the trailer because it contained was pretty much all the movie had to offer. Kill Bill is not quite that bad but it is not that much better either.<br/><br/>Lucy Liu, who I admire otherwise, was surprisingly unconvincing as the villain. I have always thought of Lucy to have an edge to her but in Kill Bill she comes across about as lethal as a pre-school teacher, even when chopping off people's heads, and how they managed to accomplish that I can't for my life figure out.<br/><br/>In conclusion, QT has gotten to the point where he wants to be Quentin Tarantino so bad he is overdoing it. Kill Bill has the style and some of the techniques that made Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs so effective but it has nothing, nada, zipp, zilch of the multi dimensional characters and dialog that made those movies great."
"EMDevilman","10","2","4","10 October 2003"," A Breath-Taking Action Movie, with Talking Heads on the Side
","Kill Bill: Volume 1<br/><br/>To use a metaphor, if `Reservoir Dogs,' `Pulp Fiction,' and `Jackie Brown' all feel like Ford Caminos cruising down a back-alley L. A. street at about 35 mph, then `Kill Bill' is a Yamaha crotch rocket motorcycle zipping down the highway at 150 mph.  The difference is extraordinary.<br/><br/>All of Tarantino's trademark details are in Volume 1.  Everything from Red Apple cigarettes to the box of cereal that appears in every Tarantino film. Including the level of violence in his film.<br/><br/>Violence is a strong subject in Tarantino films, which turns off many less-capable viewers.  It is that same strength of violence that propels Kill Bill above the rest.  Everything from Tarantino's trademark gun-related blood splatters to an exaggerated number of Kurosawa-esque arterial spurts, to an anime short to the levels of blood that had to be color-filtered into black and white as in `Raging Bull', the body count and the severed limb count rise above every mainstream Hollywood movie before it.<br/><br/>As this is an action movie, this is not completely unsurprising. Unsettling images and thoughts are another hallmark of Tarantino, and this one pulls it out in spades.  Lucy Liu's character is set-up with a particular disturbing Aeon Flux-style anime short that involves a gruesome murder and the mention of child violence.  Actually, there's two potential moments of child violence.<br/><br/>As such, Tarantino again masters his ability to call back to movies of before to bring these characters and moments to life.  Cliches of Hong Kong `Chop-socky' Martial Arts films and American westerns to edgy modern cinema such as `Fight Club' and back to Japanese Samurai epics are resurrected in an age where they are not appreciated because of their. age.<br/><br/>As such, there is little room for the swaying character development that is a hallmark of Tarantino.  A meager revenge plot facilitated with assassins and other unsavory characters.  But no one should care if it's a little shallow on the plot - it's fun, fast, disturbingly high-intensity action at its best.<br/><br/>How would this movie compare to the `Matrix' or `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'?  Kill Bill never loses sight of the major themes and the strength of the central character to push through to the other side, as both of the previous movies do with their artificial complexity.  Instead, Kill Bill uses a multitude of cinematic ideas to express the same thought and process: Revenge.<br/><br/>Rarely does a movie deserve its hype.  Kill Bill: Volume 1 deserves it, and more.<br/><br/>10/10.  Tarantino scores BIG with this action movie."

Every substansial character is so well-developed with their stories and characteristics revealed on the screen.<br/><br/>Worth pointing out, the movie is at times ridiculous, surreal and fantastical, and it works, especially in the homages. The flying and floating and high leaps, the bride having a samurai sword on the plane in open view, the gushing and spraying of gallons of blood are obviously not to be taking seriously and are fun to watch.<br/><br/>KILL BILL is also very emotionally draining at times. The bride getting shot in the head, her comatose body being used for sex, losing her baby, her family, her everything. O-ren-ishi seeing her parents being brutally slaughtered in front of her. Vernita Green's 4-year-old daughter seeing her mother murdered.<br/><br/>The black and white sequence at the showdown at the house of blue leaves will be controversial. The way I felt about it is that the change from colour to black and white is like a symbolism of the bride's killing of dozens of people, the killing eventually just becomes cold, emotionless, plain to the bride. And then colour returns, and after killing a few more people she lets a young yakuza go, which is very appropriate of her because of the reason she is seeking vengence.<br/><br/>The last 30 seconds are as good as it gets in terms of ending the first volume and segwaying for the next.<br/><br/>Excellent movie, great action, acting, story, visuals and homages, and much more."
"ernestoac","9","0","0","22 May 2020"," Amazing but incomplete
","I loved this film so much, maybe it isn't the most realistic but it is not supposed to. The plot may not be engaging for all but for me it was, just an almost murdered woman who lost, or at least thinks she did, her unborn daughter seeking for revenge on those who were involved.
Some of the shots are just amazing, the action is impecable and constant throughout the film, there are almost no flat points, plus we get some doses of comedy here and there.
Either way, even though I liked this so much it still feels a bit incomplete, maybe some scenes were longer than they could have been, therefore making this movie shorter or adding a bit more information, development to the characters or building a stronger structure for the plot.
The fact that this story is also divided in two parts contributes to making the story feeling incomplete, as the film was coming to an end I noticed it as it was slowing down and, somehow, closing this first half of the story, but it just didn't feel all that right to me, I feels, well, incomplete, and it is, but I just wish it wasn't so noticeable.

"javaman-7","9","0","0","20 May 2020"," More of a ballet than a bloodbath
","Like Welles and Fellini before him, Tarantino eschews chronological order in telling this martial arts tale of revenge. Not only does he follow his Western masters but also the Eastern filmmakers who have greatly influenced him. The fact that one of the major characters is of Chinese, Japanese and American lineage is no accident. It seems that Tarantino has made a movie that pays tribute to every action film he has ever seen.<br/><br/>But much of Tarantino's strength resides in his writing, as evidenced by his first three outings (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown), at least two of which are destined to be classics. In this movie the writing seems overwhelmed by the action, though the film still contains some very good lines.<br/><br/>But this is only Volume 1, and we don't even know what the main character's backstory is yet. Tarantino has Volume 2 to fill in some of the missing motivation as well as display his formidable writing and character development skills. With that, we may have another film classic to be. Or at least a glorious B-film masterpiece.<br/><br/>As for performances, the cast comes up with some great ones. Thurman, who is in nearly every scene, excels in a role that must have been extremely exhausting. She does away with more opponents in one scene than Eastwood ever piled up in all of his spaghetti westerns. Liu is especially effective as the ruthless gang lord who runs Tokyo, and who gives vivid meaning to the expression, ""heads will roll.""<br/><br/>As for the violence, the style is such that it is not that upsetting. By the end of the film, it is so stylized that it has become more of a ballet than a bloodbath. The scenes that are the most disturbing in subject matter are presented in Anime, the most stylized of all the filmic forms. I'm not saying that no one will be offended, but this is what the R rating is for.<br/><br/>Music is very creatively used, one example being what sounded to me like a Salsa number that heralds a snowy battle scene in Japan.<br/><br/>Does this break the rules?

"fernandoschiavi","8","0","0","15 May 2020"," Tarantino who, six years after 'Jackie Brown', returns to his roots, but this time without holding on to the reins, creating, in the end, an explosive catharsis. unparalleled
","Quentin Tarantino was already considered one of the most prominent names in Hollywood, having been responsible for Dogs for Hire (1992), Pulp Fiction- Time of Violence (1994) and Jackie Brown (1997), three classics of the 1990s. When the new a project called 'Kill Bill' was announced, expectations were high for the fourth authorial film by the director, who had the idea for this film during the filming of 'Pulp Fiction', also starring the actress. In this project, the director planned to create a fictional revenge drama, which pays homage to ancient genres such as African-American Blaxploitation films of the Exploitation genre, Asian old kung fu films, Japanese samurai films, Italian western spaghetti, trash, anime, a great reference to popular music and pop culture; and high deliberate violence. We can say that Tarantino managed to mix all the references in a harmonious way in another contemporary classic full of striking scenes.<br/><br/>In this first part of the story, the Bride (Uma Thurman) is a dangerous assassin who worked in a group, led by Bill (David Carradine), composed mainly of women. Pregnant, she decides to escape this life of violence and decides to get married, but on the day of the ceremony her co-workers turn against her, almost killing her. After five years in a coma, she wakes up without a baby and with a desire for revenge. The Bride decides to search for, and kill, the five people who destroyed her future, starting with the dangerous killers Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).<br/><br/>Originally conceived as a single film, it was released in two volumes (in the USA, volume 1 debuted in the fall of 2003 and volume 2 in the spring of 2004), due to its duration of approximately four hours. In this first part, the director wastes no time opening the production with the last moments of the Bride before the supposed death and minutes later we start to start the revenge. The out-of-order edition in which we are not yet in the situation and the reasons for it is occurring is another attraction that makes the public apprehensive and wanting to discover a little more about the past history of that group of murderers, since we all know that they are being hunted for participating in the Bride's assassination attempt.<br/><br/>In this first part, Tarantino manages to win over the audience in the first scenes, bringing us a strong scene, in which a pregnant woman receives a shot in the head in cold blood and theoretically dies. Soon after, we accelerated years in time to witness an apparent innocent visit to an American middle class home ending in a bloody beating festival, curiously interrupted by an unusual factor that generates perplexity in the viewer. It is precisely this contrast between the cruelty between the rivals and the maternal desire of both to want to spare a child from that bloody confrontation that further increases the tension in these sequences. Soon after we know how the Bride woke up from a coma after years, learned about the sexual violence covered up by the hospital nurse who committed against him while she was defenseless and how she already begins her revenge against those who have hurt her. There, we see visceral revenge, there was still no training and he had not even started hunting his real targets. There, we already knew what to expect from the two volumes of Tarantino.<br/><br/>The director reproduced the kung fu films of the 60s and 70s in the smallest detail. There is no lack of sound effects from series, leftovers from Godzilla films and tributes to the stars, aesthetics and situations. There is a pop reference for all tastes: Akira, Bruce Lee, Green Beetle, high school girls (one of the biggest freaks of the Japanese) and even Charlie Brown, from Snoopy, is referenced. In addition, the careful selection of the soundtrack, one of the filmmaker's trademarks, is impeccable<br/><br/>The director exercises his power by creating a work that mixes real and credible violence like the sequences between the Bride and Vernita Green, with the cartoon, present in most of the feature with the Japanese core, which is excellent. Firstly, it is necessary to emphasize the peculiar humor of the director and screenwriter in the scenes between Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba), his restaurant assistant and the Bride in Okinawa, making allusions between Japanese and American cultures (You like samurai swords and me in baseball) . Already in possession of Hattori Hanzo's famous and deadly sword, the Bride then leaves for Japan after O-Ren Ishii, where the best sequences of this first part are concentrated. We know about the Japanese / American assassin's past through an excellent animation, which Tarantino made a point of directing. The scene, produced by the same studio as Ghost in the Shell, brings all the cartoon aesthetic of the Land of the Rising Sun, with the greatest possible load of drama and violence.<br/><br/>In this animation we know about the death of her parents by the Japanese mafia boss Matsumoto, her revenge as a child and how she became the Japanese mafia boss, being feared by everyone around her. There was not a single person capable of questioning his mestizo origin or his actions. We also know Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), Johnny Mo (Chia-Hui Liu) and young, beautiful and deadly Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama). This decision is different and incredible, since it would be impossible to achieve a more brutal effect using flesh-and-blood actors, since the expressiveness of the animation is unparalleled.<br/><br/>When the Bride arrives at Casa das Folhas Azuis, a Japanese restaurant / club, we witness an endless stream of blood gushing, severed heads and limbs and mind-boggling choreographies. The work is cartoonish and exaggerated to the point of being funny, a great comedy. At one point, the Bride faces the gang of 88 Madmen, in a sequence to embarrass Neo and the numerous virtual Smith Agents of Matrix Reloaded (2003). Each severed arm, perforated abdomen or torn head generates rivers of blood, splashes that flood the clothes, in a reaction as intense as it is obviously false. While she slaughters, beats and kills dozens of members of the Japanese mafia, it is in the struggles with O-Ren's main helpers that the main sequences are. The fight between the Bride with her sword and Gogo, with her angelic face and dressed in a school uniform with a checkered skirt, pantsuit, shirt and tie carrying a spiked ball attached to a chain, is one of the best and most inventive. The sequences that mix the most realistic violence with mind-boggling acrobatics are exciting. The final fight against O-Ren is also tense and the scene chosen with a lot of white snow that contrasts well with the red blood. The way the loser ends is shocking.<br/><br/>The most interesting thing is how Robert Richardson's photography knows how to alternate black and white photography, with moments of contrast in blue and black and a warmer color palette in scenes in Texas or Pasadena and cooler in several sequences in Japan from harmoniously, creating various tones for each scenario. Together with Tarantino, they turn off the light, play with shadows, make everything black and white, turn the color, change the scenery, for everything to insert a remarkable moment. It is plenty of creativity that we see.<br/><br/>Since the story is not told in a linear order, we are still introduced to Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen) and Bill (David Carradine), from whom we only hear the voice and see parts of the body, without ever showing your face. An interesting suspense already preparing the audience for the final meeting between him and the Bride in the second part. All of these factors were carefully inserted to increase the audience's interest for the second part and leaving the audience to question what even more sadistic and cruel could be shown against the other targets of the protagonist. Certainly, at the end of the projection, the feeling is one of anxiety and excitement for the sequence. Even more so because the final sentence is a chilling revelation.<br/><br/>Without debuting the conclusion of 'Kill Bill', Tarantino knows how to use the few references he has at hand. The music whistled by Elle Driver, since the Bride's revenge music are already part of pop culture. The pieces may not combine at first sight, but the result is, oddly enough, harmonious and very well executed, which cannot be said of several other examples of films that highlight their shape and drown their substance. This volume 1 is, inescapably, a sensorial experience without major deep meanings hidden in subplots, with Tarantino really privileging aesthetics and letting it dictate its chapters that tell the aforementioned simple story of revenge. 'Kill Bill' is cartoonish and exaggerated, but never confused and monotonous. It is an ode to a type of cinema that no longer exists and a gift from Tarantino who, six years after 'Jackie Brown', returns to his roots, but this time without holding on to the reins, creating, in the end, an explosive catharsis. unparalleled."

After spending four years in the plant form, the protagonist woke up and recalled that day, so he started his own revenge plan.<br/><br/>The movie uses a flashback technique. The movie first tells the plot of killing the second person, then talks about how to restore consciousness, and then kills the first person. The whole movie is dominated by fighting. Almost 80% of the plot is spent in fighting, but there will be some small details revealed in the fighting, sublimating the movie.<br/><br/>For example, when killing the brunette, the two started to fight from the moment they met, and when the daughter of the brunette came back, the two couldn't help but stopped. When the daughter of the brunette entered the door, they both put the knife away. , And then started talking about homely. The child's heart is innocent and not bloody. Although they have grudges between each other, they try not to bring them to the child. Although the protagonist was still seen by the child when he killed the brunette, he still brought the color of blood to the child's world, but the protagonist told the little girl: ""If the future hatred cannot be calmed down, I am waiting for you to take revenge.

","A simple revenge film, but because of the director 's ghost talent, he rejoiced all the bloody shots-he carefully processed all the bloody shots of the church into black and white, and the blood gave the lens a heavy shadow, which also represented the moment in The vagueness and pain in Uma's memory. This is a flexible extreme. At the other end, Uma 's Revenge Journey, especially in the first half of his trip to Japan, Xiao Kun treated the dead as a toy-either by Liu Yulian 's head being cut off and carried in his hand, or the water column was like a champagne bottle. The blood spurting was either Liu Yunlian 's 88 death-bearing team members who were cut off by Uma 's solitary arm and thigh on the battlefield. The first beautiful snow drifting, quietly unable to hear a whimper, Liu Yulian in white clothes and white socks standing on the snow, pure as a fairy, but unfortunately less than ten minutes, the top of the fairy's head was cut off by a third. The wriggling brain, because she was involved in the church blood bath, owed Uma's life. You say this is a violent aesthetic? Or is it aesthetic violence? However, you will never feel sick, pleasure and pleasure from head to toe like McDonald's big frozen Coke in the summer, you will not feel happy for Uma because these people who died under her knife are worth her. Such a violent death.
Come out and mix, always be mixed.
By the way, Liu Yulian performed really well, and the animation that explained her life experience was also good. The ghost of Xiao Kun lies in what he learns like, playing small animations in Japan, and white eyebrows in China, and the aura is very good.<br/><br/>One of the scenes that made people feel guilty was the big ending shot from the top. The size of the boss is dead or disabled. Uma's daughter sits on the bed to watch cartoons. Uma lies on the bathroom tiles and hugs a hair The plush toy burst into tears. It wasn't a fluke in death, not the excitement after reaching the ultimate goal, or the hatred that was once there, but love, killing Bill, who was once in love, with your own hands.
Because she has this power. Also because she has no other choice. Hate is born of love.
A woman's own small universe is so powerful that she even prepares her own guardian angel. If you are on her small list of love, please cherish it; if you were once on her small list of love, please be careful.
She does not necessarily need to kill you personally, because the most beautiful revenge is bloodless, the most beautiful revenge is not to kill, it is to forget.
If time is her weapon.
If time is a weapon, please let us forget the sea.
The weird thing is that the actor who played Bill died of ""suicide"" in the United States 2 months ago. We can only believe that Uma did not kill him."

","The first part of Uma Thurman's and Tarantino's iconic revenge tale is masterful, beautiful, gloriously violent and extremely cool! The Bride (Thurman) is viciously massacred at her wedding by her ex-partner in work and love, Bill. After several years being stuck in a coma, she finally rises back up and vows revenge on him and the entirety of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad one by one; the team that took her down. It's made with a deep love for martial arts and samurai films as well as revenge stories that is really infectious and makes you want to go back and watch them all! From the opening black and white frames of the Bride traumatised and blood splattered to the final cliff hanger setting up the second volume, it's a gorgeously told story with real cinematic power. Thurman creates her definitive role here; a very strong willed person who will stop at nothing to wreak her vengeance and has all the emotional backstory to support it fully. The incredible fight scenes are again done with a real love for cinema; the past of O-Ren Ishii explored in stunning anime style, the Crazy 88 sequence in ultra cool black and white. A thrilling classic! And this is just the first part...."

","I was disappointed by the fact that the story (of Vol. 1) was about only action and did not have much of the story involved.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman kills only two of her enemies in Vol. 1 and which takes about 1:45:00 hrs of yours which is highly undesirable. Chronologically the first enemy takes about 45 mins of the movie and the second enemy dies in 10 mins of the movie. Which I think was maybe exaggeration of the first enemy (fact that the first enemy actually doesn't fight with Uma Thurman for 45 mins but the action sequence is that long).<br/><br/>What I would suggest you is when the fights get too long, you skip it because it won't affect your story (make sure the dialogues are covered. Which aren't many, so yeah you can skip). Maybe you'll need to skip from 00:56:00 to 1:35:00 of the movie because it is literally worthless if you're not looking for and action movie.<br/><br/>Then at the end is the important part. And most importantly, you don't see David (Bill) in Vol. 1. *This was just a walkthrough for you all because I seriously don't think it is worth the time if you don't like action or to be precise 90s action.* If the story wasn't linked to Vol.2 I'd seriously despise this one.<br/><br/>But brilliant direction on a separate note!"

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","0","2 February 2020"," Revenge, served up Tarantino-style
","The two-part ""Kill Bill"" saga found Quentin Tarantino paying homage to Asian cinema, particularly martial arts & samurai movies. Originally intended as a single film, the story was split into two volumes at the behest of the distributor (Miramax). This is understandable since a four hour runtime would have been daunting for most movie-goers, regardless of the director's stature. You could certainly argue that the story's more digestible in two parts, though there's arguably a bit of imbalance as a result. The first volume is certainly the more action-oriented of the two, so I'm not surprised that it's (slightly) higher rated.<br/><br/>The story is much more basic than previous Tarantino scripts like ""Pulp Fiction"" & ""Jackie Brown"". One might even say that it's a fairly routine revenge story. However, you can rest assured that Tarantino dressed it up with his usual knack for tight plotting and quotable dialogue. In a nutshell, the story concerns a nameless character (""The Bride"") who seeks revenge against her old allies after a wedding day betrayal that left her in a coma for four years. That's about it, though the exact circumstances of the betrayal and its aftermath are gradually revealed throughout the course of the story. It's a testament to Tarantino's skill as a screenwriter and a director that he was able to stretch such a threadbare premise into not one but two successful movies.<br/><br/>As usual with Tarantino, the cast is a big part of the film's success. ""Pulp Fiction"" standout Uma Thurman played ""The Bride"", which was a character that she & Quentin created together. Considering that the part was written with her specifically in mind, it isn't especially surprising that she did such a good job with it. She even received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance. Apart from Thurman, the other notable returnee was Michael Madsen, who played one of the targets of the Bride's revenge. However, most of his scenes are in the second movie. Sticking to the first movie, the other standout is another female - Lucy Liu, as the ruthless O-Ren Ishii, feared leader of the Yakuza. Her showdown with the Bride is unquestionably the centerpiece of the movie. Interestingly, Bill (David Carradine) isn't heard from much in the first movie, which proves to be an effective way of building suspense.<br/><br/>From a directorial standpoint, it's hard to find fault with Tarantino's work here. His visual panache is undeniable but the film's copious style serves the narrative rather than overshadowing it. Robert Richardson's cinematography is consistently impressive as well, resulting in a movie that's a sight to behold from beginning to end. Also, unsurprisingly, this is yet another Tarantino movie with a stellar soundtrack. This time around, Wu-Tang Clan's The RZA put together an eclectic mix of tunes that suit the action perfectly. There are enough iconic selections here that I honestly have trouble picking a favourite.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is a good movie but I wouldn't rank it among my absolute favourites from Tarantino. The main flaw is an abundance of over-the-top violence that I frankly find off-putting. I don't especially mind violence in movies but when it's cartoonish like this I find that it cheapens the movie, particularly when it's one that shows a considerable amount of care in all other areas of the production. There's also a bit of a disjointed feel to the episodic narrative but I can live with that, given the ambition of the overall storyline. The movie isn't perfect but there are definitely parts of it that are just about perfect."

","Just when I thought my top ten films of all time mini list, that had been unchanged for quite sometime, wouldn't actually change for a while, I go and do something I should have done a long time ago -- I watch both the Kill Bill movies. Or both parts, if that makes it easier. I remember I saw parts of the first instalment about ten years ago, but I never actually saw the film in its entirety. Then Netflix added both to its database, and I watched them last June.<br/><br/>I have to say, I haven't enjoyed a film (putting both parts together) like this in years. The sheer enjoyment and fun I endured watching both of these martial arts extravaganzas was a moment I wish I could re-capture. I seriously hate myself for putting them off for so long, but first chance I got, when they were there in front of me, I watched. And I simply adore Kill Bill.<br/><br/>The Bride is slick, brutal, gorgeous, and she's out for revenge after being gunned down at a wedding rehearsal by her ex-Husband, Bill, and the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Presumed dead, the Bride wakes up from a four-year-long coma and after teaching herself to walk and the basics again, sets out to seek revenge on those who tried to end her life --- which only deepens as the film's progress. The violence is never unseen. It's such a brutal and gory and bloody movie, absolutely perfect in its theme and setting though. The anime scene is absolutely beautifully done, intriguing, and a definite highlight for the film. The pacing is so good and each act conveys the martial arts, spaghetti western, action brutality to the fullest. The dialogue is less present in this in comparison with part two, but the dialogue is always interesting and the scenes especially between the Bride and O-Ren are wonderful. The brawls and sword fight scenes are standouts again.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman does such a brilliant job as The Bride, my favourite performance she's done. I think it's safe to say they're my favourites by Tarantino as well. These are now two of my ten favourite films. I'd put them in joint position though, to make up for them being two parts of one full film. The first part is the more action-based, epic, bloody-based part with the nice pacing, lengthy showdowns and exquisite choreography/cinematography. I think the intensity and energy in some scenes make this alone one of my favourite action-related films. The high adrenaline and exhilarating beatdowns are insanely good and well-executed. The writing and directing are masterful and the acting is at a good high as well. Everything about the Kill Bill films interests me and I love them. 10/10"

I found the over dramatization of the fight sequences incredibly entertaining, and the division by chapters, with each focusing on a different obstacle for the bride appealing.
The changes in style throughout the movie make the stories told memorable, and make the threats seem more threatening.
I highly recommend this movie, but it is not for everyone."

","I loved Pulp Fiction and other Tarantino movies. But this just wasn't that fulfilling from his other works.<br/><br/>The action and fighting in this movie is the only thing that this movie was meant for, alright. Movies' not focusing constant guts on a story that much that can make up for clever action are movies I like to see sometimes (though, they don't always do good.) <br/><br/>This is no different. This is a revenge story, but since the story isn't big and complicated, buildup was unnecessary with unnecessary side lore. <br/><br/>Then the action wasn't really done good. Especially terrible scenes with a bunch of people. Long fights made it a little boring since it had no tense moments and we could see the main character's obviously a badass. Why couldn't she do cool fresh fight moves? It was simple copy and paste fight moves.<br/><br/>To continue with that, simply shot. No cool angles while fighting or going around. Most shots are seriously her doing one simple thing. And they're about a minute each. They start going on and it doesn't add the sense of cool assassination adventure.<br/><br/>Shouldn't have focused on lore too. This is a simple revenge story. And they start to add lore about a specific character which makes no sense considering she could just beat anyone (without even showing how she learned the fight moves.) Like a Mario game. Simple enemies then a boss. Really had nothing else going to it. No cool lines, nothing really cool.<br/><br/>Not completely terrible, it had the attitude for the girl completely right.

","Chapter 1: 2 is like 3, they're all numbers, but how to use them?!<br/><br/>Drama, in its core, is known and invariable. All what the artist can do about it is just playing it differentially, trying to make it as amusing as they can. It's the eternal game which's named art. So nothing, mainly, can be original. It's just the surface that can be one. Actually, every now and then, some work just tells us that, openly and purely. For instance, Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! (2001) said it through very old and even trite story, yet Luhrmann showed us his version glamorously. But in Kill Bill 1, the problem is that Tarantino presents the surface as being taken also from other works that he's obsessed about, and wants to pay them the biggest homage. Therefore, in this deal, the whole thing lacks originality.. Badly.<br/><br/>Chapter 2: A,B,C.. I don't like LUCY!<br/><br/>Here, Tarantino is nothing but movies freak that got the chance to make one. However, he is doing it as a devoted viewer more than creative artist. It's a B movie that mimics other B movies with its stylistic characteristics and details by great passion and loyalty. But the final result wasn't that unique as a movie and homage.<br/><br/>The imaginative world of it didn't work for me. It's immersed in anything that doesn't guide or charm the viewer, missing fine original details for itself. Even the bride's yellow track-suit was worn by Bruce Lee in Game of Death (1978)! And I began to believe that her brown jacket at the start could be a reference to Jacky Brown (1997) or something! It like a silly competition more than a movie, to ask eagerly: from what movie this line, this fight, or this costume came from?! So it's a cocktail of movies that Tarantino adores, which's not necessarily something that we must adore too!<br/><br/>I could be the only man on earth that was so annoyed out of using mostly non-original soundtrack. True that Tarantino was achieving some dream, making distinct flavor, and rather summarizing the whole matter; the way Moulin Rouge's soundtrack did. But, with the exception of (Twisted Nerve) by Bernard Herrmann at Daryl Hannah's intro, it didn't eventually manage to be magical element. As if the whole movie is like Hanna's character; whistles, however unstoppably, themes from endless old movies and TV shows, pushing you out of it to them. That assured the lack of originality vexingly sometimes.<br/><br/>And when it comes to a revenge story, I don't love hearing bad dialogue, without comic relief, being all the time in the company of Uma Thurman OR seeing Lucy Liu! Some of the action was well done, but all of it seemed absurd. The black and white cinematography wasn't good at all. And the sequence of the Japanese cartoon looked so out of the mood, as just here because the director wanted that, more than the story for instance, I deemed it a treachery to the B-movie persona of it, being a part of honoring program, or so artistic act of another film!<br/><br/>So, it was unenjoyable and uneven. I just found myself preferring the original works over this pretentious hamburger of a movie!<br/><br/>Chapter 3: Kill Time!<br/><br/>Tarantino adores nonsense, and he just represents it in new forms. It could confirm that nothing is original but the way of dealing, YET this time, like mostly every time with him, his dealing wasn't that original nor great. It's average, being like a parody without laughs. When Spielberg and Lucas once wanted to pay homage to the 1930s adventure movies, they made a cinematic series named (Indiana Jones). Here, Tarantino made something where style kills the narration, without much originality, making a toy that gives the biggest kick for only its creator. He didn't either put something serious in the unserious mix of it; in fact, I'm searching for one reason that can make it stand for a second watching else killing the time, but I'm finding none. So, for anyone out there, who want to kill the time with an action movie, here's a pure action movie for you, so proud of being a ""B"" one too.<br/><br/>Chapter 4: Overrated!<br/><br/>I don't know how it can be a homage to the Blaxploitation movies because of one violent black woman in it??!! So, could the name ""Bill"" be a homage to Bill Clinton or Bill Cosby?! Ok, let's say that overrating is one crime done by ignorant viewers and reviewers which forever irritates me!<br/><br/>Chapter 5: They must build a statue for Tarantino in Hong Kong!<br/><br/>One value for it is that it glorifies certain Asian cinema industry in a way that no American movie did before. Tarantino admits his absolute love for specific school in making the gory work by the most practical way ever, undertaking making an album for cheap B-movies in a form of another one. But this volume was so dry and tasteless I can tell you that.<br/><br/>..To Be Continued with Kill Bill: Vol. 2."

"akwa01","Null","0","0","10 July 2006"," Thurman seems to have accomplished that for which she set out.
","Vengeance is never a warm subject. As we come to hear in the development of the film ""Kill Bill"", ""vengeance is a dish best served cold."" The theme, which is a central insight in the film, is clearly spelled out in the above statementand almost always, there is pain and anguish associated with the ones that vengeance pursues. Throughout the movie, Uma Thurman, the bride, pursues her enemies in the quest to eliminate their very existence. Accordingly, a lot of blood is spilled on account of the bride's revenge. There is enough screaming and moaning on the part of individuals who die at the hands of the bride all in the name of revenge. The framing employed in the film also depicts imprisonment and entrapment, events preceding death and revenge.<br/><br/>The subject of pain as a precursor of death is evident at the hotel and restaurant scene when the bride severs the limbs and dismembers the body parts of anyone who in one way or the other robbed her of any life with her family and anyone who caused her pain. Their waves of moans and groans would make a perfect song of pain. Additionally, at the hospital, it is observed that Buck's friend encounters a lot of anguish when the bride bites off his tongue as he screams away because of his abuse of her. Buck himself gets a feel of pain when his leg is cut with a sharp knife. We hear him scream with anguish and pain deserving of a molester.The pain encountered by Buck at the hands of Thurman goes to prove her vengeance upon Buck for taking advantage of her while she is unconscious. <br/><br/>The theme of revenge is bloody and depicts the color red. As seen in the development of the film, red is almost unavoidable in every scene. Red denotes bloodshed and a death of a painful nature. Thus, Uma Thurman's death list had names of her wrongdoers inscribed in red ink. ""The nurse"" wears an eye patch with a red ""x"" symbol and she carries a red umbrella. She also wears red lipstick on her way to commit the murder of the bride at the hospital. The wagon belonging to Buck also has the red motif depicting bloodshed, thus, enhancing the theme of revenge. We almost come to appreciate the black and white tone and the fade to black less begrudgingly because it helped reduce the bloodshed to make it more tolerable for the audience while accentuating the effect of detail. ""Kill Bill"" reminds me of ""A Man on Fire"", which stars Denzel Washington. There seem to be similarities between the character of the bride (Thurman) and Denzel's character as Crissy. They both avenge the life of their loved ones. <br/><br/>As already stated, revenge calls for entrapment and imprisonment. Obviously, the avenger needs to run down her enemies and put them in a vulnerable position. Through the bride's eyes, the audience captures a lot of tight framing. When the bride meets with Vernita Green, also known as Copper Head, at her home,Vernita is subdued by the stiff framing in the window, the cabinets in the kitchen and the framed wall hangings leaving no room for escape. The name Bill is trapped in the upper window of Hattori Hanzo's restaurant and steel shop. The stiff framing in the window implies that Bill too will die at the hands of the avenger, the bride. O-Ren Ishii gets a taste of tight framing when in the upper room. The wooden sliding doors behind her create a suspenseful atmosphere and it seems to be presented that O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), although surrounded by an entourage of bodyguards is unsure of her fate with Thurman. She is locked in by the sliding doors behind her also indicating her inability to escape the avenger's sword.<br/><br/>I recommend that anyone who has not yet seen the movie should do so at once. The use of fade to black is very thoughtful and is done in an impeccable way. Although the audience understands the process of revenge, we are helped out a little more so that digestion of the spilling of blood does not become unbearable. The audience looks forward to the next scene with confidence, knowing that the director will employ fade to black in the bloodiest scenes to help condense the act of vengeance. It is evident that in the end, Thurman seems to have accomplished that for which she set out--vengeance. The death list that Thurman keeps is symbolic of the tombstones of the individuals she finally slays during her revenge. Red means danger, blood, pain, and revenge. These ideas are all very well accomplished in the development of the plot."
"straker-1","Null","0","0","14 April 2004"," The 1st Review Of Kill Bill By Jeff Stone
","Contains spoilers<br/><br/>
""A triumph of style over substance"" is a well-worn cliche in filmdom, but it sums up Kill Bill Vol. 1 perfectly.  On the face of it, this is a beautifully directed, hyper-kinetic action movie...but look even slightly below the surface and you begin to see the many cracks in the mask. The first thing that struck me about the movie was the declaration in the credits that this was 'The 4th Film By Quentin Tarantino'. My immediate response was: ""Yes it is...so what? Why it is necessary to point this out?""  My second response was:  ""It's not the 4th film by Tarantino, it's the *first half* of the 4th film.""   The declaration might be a good way to sell the movie in a trailer or on a lobby poster, but to actually use it in the *opening credits* is probably the most repugnant example of a director's self-love I have ever experienced. OK, onto the specifics of the movie.  As I said, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is fantastically directed, and ranks as Tarantino's finest effort in this field.  The mixture of media (anime and live action) is inspired, if hardly original - Oliver Stone, for example, used it in Natural Born Killers, the original screenplay of which Tarantino wrote.  The pace never flags, and the shifting timescale is handled as deflty as it was in Pulp Fiction.  (Still not sure the voiceovers were necessary, though). The movie strikes me as a sort of Tarantuino Greatest Hits compilation. That's what ultimately sinks Kill Bill, folks.  It's completely unoriginal. The plot is wafer thin, if not non-existent.  One might argue that the 'revenge flick' genre, of which this movie is definitely an example, needs no plot, but that's just a cop-out.  We've seen so many takes on this idea that anyone attempting to do it these days has to bring something new to the table.  And for all its' undeniable visual artistry, Tarantino just gives us the same old stuff again. Oh, but it's a tribute to grindhouse 70s cinema, you might say.  Indeed; but what Tarantino and many other people seem to have conveniently forgotten is that 95% of those movies were *terrible*. Uma Thurman is very good as The Bride...why her name is bleeped out on the two or three occasions it is used is just one of the bafflingly pointless touches in the flick...and acquits herself excellently in the battle scenes.  Sadly, however, most of the dialogue she and everyone else is given to say is ghastly, clunky nonsense.  The dialogue is like the film as a whole...you are constantly being told that you are watching a spoof or 'homage', and if a movie has to do that to convince you it's just kidding, then you're in trouble. The plot, such as it is, has numerous plotholes, most of which concern The Bride.  How does she manage to evade capture or even police attention for her numerous murders?  Where does she get the money from to buy plane tickets and hire(?) motorbikes?  Why does she need to draw up a death list for herself comprising only five people; five people she knows intimately and will never forget?!! Guest star Sonny Chiba, of the classic 70s Street Fighter series, is the definite highlight acting-wise.  Chiba plays master sword maker Hanzo Hattori with great dignity, tempered with humour (his argument with his assistant is very funny)...I get the feeling he hasn't been given the chance to play such a nicely shaded role too often.  The other major star in the movie, Lucy Liu (as Oren Ishii) is at the other end of the scale. Liu is, I'm sorry, folks, as completely wooden here as she is in every other film she's done.  And it doesn't help that her hugely distracting lazy eye turns every close-up she's given into an unintentional visual joke. The film also has a very peculiar schizophrenic attitude to the Japanese, also...one moment it treats Japanese culture with reverence and respect, and the next it's depicting the people of that country as babbling, incompetent idiots who can't fight to (literally) save their lives.  The biggest joke of the movie comes at the end, when, after The Bride has wiped out 60 or 70 Yakusa killers single-handed, Liu comments that The Bride 'cannot fight like a samurai'.  Beg your pardon? The final battle between Oren and The Bride is also hugely anti-climactic, and largely consists of the two women staring at each other. Other points to close with. 1) Has no-one in this movie outside of the anime sequence heard of an invention called the gun?  2) If you're going to blatantly steal the torrential blood sprays from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Quentin, at least have the courtesy to show a character saying ""Ni!"" or 'Tis but a flesh wound' at some stage.  Ridiculous.   3) The all-female Japanese rockabilly band, the 5678s, that feature during the Yakusa battle, must've been chosen by Tarantino because they were the single worst exponents of their art on the planet. 4) The only reason The Bride rides a motorbike in the Tokyo sequence is so Tarantino can put her in yellow bike leathers and thus poach some glory from Bruce Lee's unfinished masterwork Game Of Death. 5) The trailers and lobby art slogans proclaim that in 2003, Uma Thurman will kill Bill.  Er, she doesn't even come close to Bill in Vol. 1.  I think you should've been honest and said that she'll do the deed in *2004*. Well, I'll be keen to see Volume 2, if only to see the rest of what should've been one movie. Despite what I've said, this was a good popcorn flick that starts off as a slickly-edited collision of Reservoir Dogs' blood and and Pulp Fiction's episodic structure and turns into idiotic crud only in the third act.  A hugely derivative, obnoxiously smug, clunkily written, occasionally pretentious movie, but good all the same."
"jrfranklin01","Null","0","0","11 April 2004"," Quentin Strikes Bizarre Again
","Spoiler!!! Quentin Tarantino does little to surprise the audience with this film, if they have seen some of his other works.  Quentin seems to prefer directing in the past (Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, etc.) and this film holds the same 70's/80's portrayal.  It also carries the morbidity, violence, sexual situations of Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, Dust Till Dawn, and Pulp Fiction. But what is most striking is his comical matrimony of the Japanese Samurai theme with the likes of Dolemite or Chips with retro themes such as split screen photography.  His tale unfolds in chapters with flashbacks, sometimes in Japanese anime.  The graphic nature of this procession is amplified and lends further humor and almost amateurism in the frequent use of blood-spraying special effects.  Stunts resemble those in The Matrix and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon with the overuse of cable effects.<br/><br/>If none of the above appears outrageous or excessive then elements of the plot can always be considered.  But Quentin does deserve credit in the basic story idea, where a female assassin wishes to leave the death business, get married, and have a child.  Unfortunately her `contract' is for life and organization she works for decides to assassinate her - at her wedding while she is an expectant mother.  But the assassin-ee/heroine survives and pursues a gruesome journey of vengeance.  To this point, the movie has great potential as a former assassin goes after her murderous comrades.  But Quentin's ever-persistent aim to be `different' and on the edge, leave him incorporating all sorts of bizarre elements from the soundtrack to anime to retro-sitcom themes to Japanese s.f.x. martial arts.  And underlying all this he still tries to maintain a serious theme of some sort of `Way of the Bushido' samurai philosophy as the heroine embarks on her quest for revenge.<br/><br/>Even more over-the-top is that the heroine survives being beaten and shot in the head, only to lose her baby and be left in a coma in a hospital.  She then is sold off as a comatose prostitute to be raped by the hospital staff and whatever Johns are brought in. The depressing and horrific nature of all of this is (once again) set as some bipolar/chaotic extreme to other elements of the story, such as intense cursing intermingled with almost prize-winning speech lessons.  What's perhaps worst of all (or not depending on how you were enduring the movie) is that Quentin only takes you a little more than half way in the plot.  That's right, there's no conclusion.  He prefers a sequel to finish this revenge saga.  But given what I saw, I think his movie sales may have had a better shot if his kept the film in entirety. If you like action, this film's got plenty of it, and that is perhaps its redeeming quality.  Just don't expect much else."

The story is pretty simple, The Bride (Uma Thurman) is ambushed and left for dead at her own wedding by her own husband (David Carridine)and his gang AKA DVAS (Deadly Viper Assissination Squad) played by Lucy Lui (Who is hot in this film), Vivica Fox (Who is also hot),Darryl Hanna (Same comment as the other two) and Michael Madson.

There are alot of comparisons to Bruce Lee films in this movie like the yellow and black motorcycle suit Thurman wears.  They are the same colors Lee wore in ""Game Of Death"" but I wouldn't say this film was ripping off any of Lee's films, if anything celebrating them.

The excessive use of blood in the movie makes it very clear that what you are viewing isn't real. Previous movies of Tarrentino are more realistic thus having a bigger impact. But, the use of this much blood gives it an new edge.

","Not great, no. Kill Bill Volume 1 is a very fine piece of entertainment. The visuals are often brilliant, a notable example being the transition into anime. Tarantino splashes blood like paint, and has no qualms about full-on decapitation and dismemberment. There are gruesome parts, parts that make you squirm. But mainly, it's the acrobatic kung-fu and self-conscious visuals (lights go out for no reason other than style, for instance) that keep you entertained. The script is nothing special. There are clever parts, like the way some characters are built up, and Tarantino once again plays around with the timeline to good effect. But the acting doesn't draw you in. It doesn't seem that Tarantino particularly wants you to care about these characters. So, the film certainly has a unique appeal, and is certainly worth watching. But, it's too long. Perhaps Volume 2 will prove otherwise, but Kill Bill seems an exercise in style and entertainment, and on that level it clearly succeeds, but it's doubtful whether it'll leave a lasting impression."

","I know many people here seem to think of Tarantino as a god amongst directors.  Kill Bill would be pretty good in my book if it weren't for two things he always does.  The first is that he always seems to put music in a scene where it doesn't fit.  Certain types of music work in certain scenes and other types do not.  I can live with it though because he's ""an artist"". It just seems like he tries too hard to make it artsy.  But what kills me the most (no pun intended) is that his movies, this one in particular, just end up being a huge blood-fest.  Half of this movie doesn't even need to be in colour, it could have been monochrome red and it'd look the same.  I would like to say that Production IG did an awesome job with the anime sequence, even though it was just as gory as the rest."

","Can't really say if this movie is good or not, because half of it is missing.

","<ul><li>Literally obscene amount of be-heading and de-limbing. - A water-park of gore.  Blood fountaining frequently.  In some scenes, it is presented more stylistically.  In other scenes, it is presented more realistically, with more disturbing effect. - Fewer fight scenes than I expected, but it would've been hard to cram more in without sacrificing the movie's balance.  So this isn't really a criticism, just a comment. - Little plot, but you should've been warned not to expect that out of this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>An action movie makes up for its rudimentary plot with amazing fight sequences, colorful characters, and occasional comedy.  This movie hits in spots, but falls a little short overall.  The fight sequences are okay, but nothing that hasn't been done before, and better, in a thousand Hong Kong Kung Fu movies twenty years ago.  Uma's wire work is particularly sketchy, although it's a shame that I have to say that because I've seen what somebody looks like the first time on a wire, and to even get to the point she did must have required a lot of practice.  She's also much sloppier with a sword than a super-assassin ought to be.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" is supposed to be Tarantino's homage to the kung-fu flicks he loved as a kid, and homage it is--with all the good and bad that the word implies.  There are times in the movie when it's obvious that a particular element was thrown in just because it's expected by the genre.  An example is when, in the middle of a fight scene, Uma leaps/flies onto a second-floor balcony, a la Crouching Tiger.  Using wires to ""float"" a character is a classic Hong Kong effect, but for some reason, in ""Kill Bill"", it feels like it was stuck in just for that reason: it's a classic Hong Kong effect, this is an homage, so it has to be in there somewhere.  It's kind of cool to see Uma Thurman doing these effects instead of Michelle Yao or some other Asian actress that we've never heard of, but it's obvious that she's out of her element in some of the stunts.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" has a lot of gore.  It has more gore than it needs to. Tarantino is obviously trying to create some effect in his audience.  I was a little turned off by it, frankly.  You can take excessive gore a number of ways.  You can do it cartooney, like ""Friday the 13th,"" in which case it loses some of its impact.  You can do it ultra-realistic, like ""Natural Born Killers,"" or ""Saving Private Ryan,"" in which case it has a strong impact that hopefully ties into a plot or some point that the film maker is trying to make that justifies the violence.  But in ""Kill Bill"", Tarantino presents in-your-face, over-the-top, fountains-of-blood violence without a strong plot or point to back it up.  It seemed juvenile to me.<br/><br/>There are a few good scenes in ""Kill Bill"".  The fight between Uma and Lucy Liu's bodyguard (the female with the spiked ball on a chain) is pretty well-choreographed and executed.  The fight between Uma and Lucy Liu is less physical and more psychological and mental, but still strong--right up until the end when *SPOILER DELETED*.  Eww.  There's another great moment when, after killing hundreds of his co-henchmen, Uma hacks sections off of the last henchman's sword while he cowers.  He drops the decapitated hilt and holds up his hands, upon which she puts him over her knee, then spanks him with the flat of her blade, saying, ""This is what you get for playing with Yakuza!  Now go home to your mother!""  The sheriff who refers to his deputy as, ""Son Number One"" (presumably it's really his son) and who has a row of spare sunglasses on his dash board is a great character even though he's only on-screen for five minutes in the whole movie.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" is punctuated with clever or entertaining moments, but overall, I'd say it's a rental.  Definitely not a must-see."

","Just came back from the movie. I've seen a lot of good comments and some people even praising the ""Mind blowing' action scenes.<br/><br/>Have you ever seen the huge canvas arts that are done by great artists? It may be simply two lines of paint but considered a master piece (maybe sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars) but if I do the same no body would even want to consider it since I am not a great artist.  The difference is that the great artist did draw those lines with a purpose, to describe something. But I simply draw that to make money.<br/><br/>When we look at the movie that's the idea came to me. The movie would have rated very low if it's attached to an amateur director's name. But knowing Torentino, We start to see the purpose of those amateur like rendorations of the story.<br/><br/>The Story: Not a powerful story to tell. We almost know what the story. It's very predictable and some times looks like a Hindi movie. I think the story is trying to take a road between abstract movie and a direct story and hence loose its power.<br/><br/>Fights: Not very convincing. It is trying to establish an ""Honorable Killing"" code but I cannot see it as a very good success story. As the director is ""lost"" between reality and abstraction we audience also lost in several scenes.  For example those fountains of blood, that keep on showering when ever a limb is chopped is something not natural. (I would have laughed if this happened in pulp fiction, but was not so sure whether it's done purposely or just a bad special effects seen) I can see that torentino trying to establish a Japanese Comic story like (No pun intended) style in those fights. But that effort has not given enough fruits and does not distinguish these fights from any other Hong Kong based ""Kung-fu"" movie.<br/><br/>Acting: I was never an Uma Thurman fan. I always thought she over act in her movies. I don't think she is doing any good for this movie either. The acting is very shallow and shows no emotion. (I think she took the ""This bride is not an emotional person"" statement literary ant try to avoid showing any emotion at all.  But I did like the Lucy Lou' acting. She was showing that ruthless killer character very well. Also her body guard. I think Lucy Lou would have been a better selection for the main role. (What an Asian heroin character. No way!!!) No we are not resists. But, No way an Asian for main character. (pun Intended)<br/><br/>
Camera: hmm I am no expert on this. But I cannot see anything exceptional in camera side. <br/><br/>Direction: There are few places I liked the way the movie is presented. But I am sure Torentino has more talent than we could see it in this picture. Not the best one from him. I would consider Kill Bill as an experiment gone wrong by Torentino. He was trying to develop a different style of story telling as always. But this time it's not a success. Any one seen Indian ""General Formula"" Movies would find this movie is such a movie minus the songs and the boy friend.<br/><br/>Not the best movie I've seen. I can give 7/10 that's assuming this as an experiment gone wrong. If I ever see Torentino speaking this other-wise will change the vote to 5/10.<br/><br/>PS I wonder which air line allow Samurai Swords in the cabin<br/><br/>PSPS plsase excuse me for the language.

","I was entertained by this film. It was better than 90 percent of what was showing in cinemas that week and it certainly wasn't a bad way to spend eight quid and two hours. But I did have a nagging feeling all the way through it - why exactly was I crossing London in the rain, was such a world-wide hype being generated, and a very talented guy spending six years of his life and a hundred million bucks of Hollywood's money (if you add the cost of Volumes 1 and 2 together), for the cinematic equivalent of a camp tribute act?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being unfair to Tarantino. A lot of film fans place unfair burdens on his shoulders because of his talent, in the same way that people always want De Niro to go all out in something like Raging Bull. With Tarantino people expect to see him cement his reputation as a world class talent by making films that show he is evolving and maturing. Quentin, on the other hand, seems only to want to make cool films that pay tribute to his favourite exploitation genres. That's his choice, and he can do no more than be true to himself. I went to the pictures, I paid my money and I was entertained, so well played QT. But there was definitely something missing.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 1 is a revenge story stripped down to the very basic essentials. True to the oriental and spaghetti western genres he is copying, there is little back-story and no depth. We get the story more or less straight, with The Bride (Uma Thurman) recovering from the almost successful attempt on her life to exact bloody vengeance on those responsible, her former colleagues from an elite assassin squad. The plot, characterisation, dialogue and style are deliberately cheesy, serving only to advance the film a step or two to the next fight scene. True to Tarantino's core values, the action is red in tooth and claw, with swords hacking limbs and blood spurting preposterous tsunamis across the screen in the graphic style of Shogun Assassin and similar ilk. This is all mounted in stunning style, showing off Tarantino's awesome command of film technique as well as brilliant cinematography and soundtrack. It's enjoyable, but frankly not all that gripping. The only moment of really nail-biting suspense was the Bride's fight with the mace-wielding teenage assassin. I got to the end of the film, having enjoyed it and definitely intending to see Volume 2, but I certainly wasn't blown away by it.<br/><br/>The law of diminishing returns seems to have set in here. The talent of the director and the large budget obviously make this better than a lot of the original films, but it doesn't really challenge the real masters in those genres and it surely isn't the best film that Tarantino could have made. Compare that to a couple of films that were conceived and made on a fraction of the budget while Tarantino was off making this - City of God and Nine Queens. The South Americans have obviously watched a lot of Scorsese and con man films, but they still manage to distil that into something new and vibrant, which coheres into much better and more entertaining films than QT has managed this time. City of God in particular, completely rocks the screen and is certainly no pompous art-house flick, but it managed to tell a great story that actually has some relevance. Tarantino has the reputation he has because he opened people's eyes to what's possible with a movie camera as well as entertaining us, but at the moment there are other people stealing a march on him. I find myself asking why Tarantino doesn't want to really test himself and take a risk, by trying to make something really challenging and ambitious. There are great stories like James Ellroy's novel American Tabloid that would make some of the greatest movies ever if someone could ever work out how to film them - is he afraid to give it a go? Even the genres he imitates so beautifully didn't always show such stunted ambition - Leone made The Good the Bad and the Ugly and broke the mould with Once Upon A Time in America. Some Samurai films attempt a little more depth like Seven Samurai and Ran.<br/><br/>There's a reason why people like to see a great film-maker make really classic films, the same reason why they want a great singer to move on from storming the local karaoke bar to go and make a great record, or a great athlete make the step up to the Olympics. That's where the real drama and entertainment is. It's frustrating when someone this good squanders his talent and that's what I fear Tarantino is doing.<br/><br/>His body of work so far includes a brash debut calling card with some awesome moments but still a little mechanical, a superb cinematic compendium of ideas that wasn't quite a whole story, a very good Elmore Leonard Adaptation and a kung fu movie. In twelve years. Quentin's idols in the exploitation world could have produced that many films in a year. If, God forbid, Tarantino were run over by a bus tomorrow, he would have ended his career without having once produced what we think he is capable of, and that would be a shame. The shame at the moment is that possibly the most exciting talent in film is not making the most exciting films."

","""Kill Bill"" has caused a stir among movie fans. It hasn't polarized audiences the way ""Matrix:Reloaded"" did earlier this year (this is only the first of many comparisons to the Matrix sequel), but this was to be expected: the majority of viewers went in to the movie expecting to love it. This is due in no small part to Quentin Tarantino's ostentatious presentation of his brand name on this film. I thought it was goofy enough for him to have ""The Fourth Film by Quentin Tarantino"" on all the trailers, but this phrase replaces the ""directed by"" credit in the opening credits.<br/><br/>This is nothing new, its fairly well established that Tarantino is an obnoxious, loudmouth who takes his method of assembling films out of pop culture snippets far too seriously. I don't like Quentin Tarantino the man, but try as I might I can't transfer that distaste to his movies. Yes, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is nothing but Hong Kong heist movies injected with Madonna references and other dialogue and imagery that Tarantino included because he thinks its ""cool"". But, it is cool. Its a thoroughly enjoyable movie. Then there's his tour de force, ""Pulp Fiction"" which is the movie that made him a house hold name. The film is clearly still juvenile and immature, but I can't help but love it. ""Jackie Brown"" is the other end of the spectrum, a film where you can vividly picture Tarantino behind the camera squinting in his effort to make a 'mature' movie. That is, when he's not orgasaming over how genius he is to have cast Robert Deniro in a mostly silent role. Yet ""Brown"" may be my favorite of the three movies.<br/><br/>From the first announcement of the project, `Kill Bill' was touted as being a grind house tribute, a mishmash of cinematic influences. Tarantino supposedly spent his six year hiatus renewing his love affair with cinema. It was clear that it was going to be something very different from his other movies. I read the first draft of the script that was released online, and had to love it despite the glaring departures from the Tarantino form: the script was very lax on dialogue and strong on action, and by far the most ridiculous and the most fun while taking itself deadly serious. I wanted to see the movie, I was excited to see this samurai sword epic with exaggerated kung fu sound effects and ridiculous decapitations.<br/><br/>The undeniable truth is this: `Kill Bill' is a good movie. Regardless of what your or my opinion is, it's a very well made movie. Even though you're aware that what you're seeing on the screen is ridiculous and outrageous and is an absolute parody.its never presented in that manner. Its all straightforward and executed in a very classy way. A friend who saw the movie with me said that the opening credits sequence went on too long, but I loved every second of it. And as far as the anime sequence is concerned, I thought it was unnecessary but very well done. I can't agree with all the people calling Tarantino a genius and pioneer and true artist for including the sequence..that's exactly what he wants.<br/><br/>A friend who wasn't a big fan of `Kill Bill' complained that Tarantino feels the need to skew the chronology of all of his films just to be different and `cool'. This is wrong. `Reservoir Dogs' makes use of the various flashbacks to tell the story, but that is of little consequence. `Jackie Brown' only time shifts in one scene and that is only because Elmore Leonard made use of the device in his novel. `Pulp Fiction' is the movie most people think of when confronted with Tarantino's time shifting. Is the disjointed timeline in the movie arbitrary? Not at all. If you reedited the film so that it played in chronological order, the emotional impact would be all but erased. The final scene would be Vincent getting shot coming out of the bathroom. You lose the emotional bookends that make the movie what it is. The same goes for `Kill Bill'. The movie wouldn't work if it was in chronological order. I heard plenty of complaints about the seemingly random jumps backwards four years in time. But they are the glue that hold the rest of the paper thin plot together. The fight with Vernita Green would be a yawnfest if it had followed the cinematic wonder that is The Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves.<br/><br/>Now the Matrix parallels. The House of Blue Leaves sequence is similar to the Burly Brawl in Reloaded, except for one key element: real people are fighting. It may be an over the top battle, but it never becomes a videogame. Comparing the two fights brings up my favorite aspect of the Blue Leaves fight: the majority of it is presented without music. Matrix obviously suffered from horrendous techno-pop music. Tarantino is well renowned for his musical selections in his film, but he really shines when he knows how to use silence. Also, both Reloaded and `Kill Bill' feature the use of samurai swords. In `Reloaded' the swords are futile, scratching a cheek at their most lethal. In `Kill Bill' limbs are liberally severed from the rest of their bodies and foes are sliced all the way down the middle. Where the Wachowski's wimped out in favor of CGI effects, Tarantino made a balls-to-the-wall action sequence. Finally, `Reloaded' has one of the worst, most laughable cliffhanger endings that I have ever seen. Many people I have spoken too disliked `Kill Bill's ending, but I think that it couldn't have been more perfect. The concluding sequence features the most impressive bouncing back and forth between different time frames that I have seen in recent memory. Instead of ending on a laughable note, it ends on a powerful one, even for me and I knew what was coming.<br/><br/>`Kill Bill' is extremely well executed B-movie schlock. The plot, characters and motivations are all superficial, but Tarantino once again proves to be a master of the frame. The logistical implications behind the movie's many impressive scenes are enough to tide 'film buffs' over, but `Kill Bill' is far from an empty shell."

But this is not a bad thing, because somehow it all works. Everything he does with the style of the film is pulled off with ease (switching from full colour to black & white, back to colour, then to blue with silhouettes and even at one point, to animation)<br/><br/>Tarantino is one of very few men who would dare to try something like his, and probably the only man who could pull it off as well as he did without audiences laughing in his face.<br/><br/>Kill Bill also has a great 70s feel to it from everything to the soundtrack to the yellow title cards and subtitles, which, although slightly cheesy at times, still makes it a fun film to watch.<br/><br/>There is one thing, however, that I can't decide. There was lots and lots and lots (etc) of blood shed in this movie, which is fine: people are going to bleed if you hack their limbs off, but is it really going to shoot out over 30 metres at a rate of a pint a second?

"grendelsmom","Null","0","0","14 November 2003"," Welcome back to the realm of mortals Quentin
","Having seen Kill Bill today, I think Quentin Tarantino is in danger of remaining a 90's icon instead of assuming his rightful place in the pantheon of great film directors. You get the feeling that the weight of expectation from his legion of fans is now too much for Tarantino and is stifling his creativity (much the same as George Lucas with the last two Star Wars flicks).<br/><br/>The main problem with Kill Bill is that it is all homage and nothing else. You take away the references to Kung Fu, Samurai and Female Blaxploitation films (and any other obscure genres that I might have missed) and the whole edifice comes crashing down. The references are none too subtle and in the end, you feel like you're watching a comedy show that's parodying these genres.<br/><br/>Kill Bill uses techniques that we've seen before in Tarantino movies, such as the non-linear plot, but here they do not serve any purpose. Then, there are things that are sadly lacking. Instead of the smart, sassy dialogue of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, we get the hokey martial arts mumbo jumbo (yeah I know it's supposed to be a reference to Kung Fu movies). Having a couple of women call each other Bitch is about as clever as it gets.<br/><br/>And really, I think Quentin needs to get counselling for his foot fetish before it gets out of hand. Instead of gratuitous nudity (of which there was ample opportunity to display in the film), we are treated to several loving close-ups of Uma Thurman's toes.<br/><br/>Despite all this, I still enjoyed the film. Tarantino has captured the essence of the genres he is paying homage to - I don't think anyone else could have done it so well. The fight scenes are OK and the decapitations and arterial bleeding are as good as I've seen in any samurai film. And Chiaki Kuriyama is genuinely creepy as the teenage killer."

The film is bricolage writ large. Postmodern pastiche. Tarantino is a brilliant postmodern semiotic architect. Deconstructing is the wrong word here, though it's always used incorrectly in this context; disassembling is better. Tarantino excels at disassembling low culture film and media - from Star Trek to McDonalds, film noir to Anime, from Hong Kong Action/ vintage kung-fu to kitsch pop music - painstakingly dissecting each into it's most elementary form, and then reassembling these symbols with new coherence and meaning into his own film. Each element, form, or style he lifts from B movie culture becomes an isolated symbol removed from it's original context. Moving it into a new context, it retains some, all, or none of it's original meaning, gains new context dependent meaning, and becomes part of a new gestalt - that of the Quentin Tarantino film. Tarantino's comprehensive understanding of his low culture source material and the mechanics of his narrative allow him to populate his film with excessive richness but with total economy and consistency. What you get is a Disney World effect - thrilling, stimulating, richly detailed, and at times disorienting - but fabulously entertaining. Academically and personally I enjoy and appreciate this type of work - which makes this one of if not the best film I've seen in the last 3 years. But I don't expect most to agree with me.<br/><br/>Can't wait for the second one, can't wait to see this one again."

","It is not easy to interpret my summary, and I actually have the same feeling after watching Kill Bill: Vol. 1.<br/><br/>I had very big expectations to this new Tarantino movie, I had hoped it would be just as good as Pulp Fiction. It was maybe a bit much to expect, but you should not expect less from such a talented director.<br/><br/>The actors chosen for this movie are chosen wisely, I really like Uma Thurman, she has ""it"" as Bobby Bowfinger calls it. It is hard to describe what it is, but it us a combination of personality and talent. The rest of the cast was also good, but Uma Thurman is especially a fantastic experience.<br/><br/>The action is good too, but it is actually a problem. Tarantino seems to be obsessed with impressive fight scenes, so he forgets to get flow in the story. At the same time I must admit that I am not a fan of the fight scenes used in ""Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", I prefer fight style ala Indiana Jones with fists, it is much more cool. It is maybe not as artistic, but it is how fight scenes should be.<br/><br/>Another Tarantino obsession is blood, and I actually like the use of blood as in Pulp Fiction or the Verhoeven style, but the use of blood in this movie was more like the Monty Python style, and it does not work in the long run in this movie. I could laugh a few times because of the extreme use of blood, but it could not keep the comical element for all 111 minutes.<br/><br/>As you can read from my review, I was not as pleased as I had hoped. The movie was without doubt beautifully made, but the plot was maybe a bit too thin and the story moved too slowly. Despite all this the movie deserves 7/10, but do not expect this to be a classic like Pulp Fiction."

","I always somewhat enjoyed some of the old Japanese sword fighting kung fu type movies, even though most of the time I never understood what they were saying, thank god for subtitles. Quentin Tarintino hasn't done anything to impress me since Pulp Fiction, this movie brings that element back of when everyone knew it was a movie out of the ordinary, had real memorable lines no matter how great or obscene they were, and always made you want to watch it over and over again because there was something you always wanted to catch again and again to see how you interpret it. <br/><br/>At points it felt like a real challenging video game, which is what I really enjoyed about it, if you can get past the mega violence factor then this movie would be as enjoyable as ""The good the bag and the ugly"" as Clint Eastwood's character the man with no name, where as Uma Thurman's character can be regarded as the same. Yes revenge can be cold, but for those who feel it hard enough, you will avenge with no other goal in mind, like a warrior.<br/><br/>
All of the fight scenes were done well, best one was between the bride and go go yubarki, and the scenes were shot very well. Has a great look to it, and a rough but slick feel to it at the same time.<br/><br/>Great movie, Quentin kept it straight to the point, not complicated at all, looking forward to volume 2. <br/><br/>Uma Thurman will Kill Bill!"

"justafanuk","Null","0","0","5 November 2003"," Welcome back Quentin
","In the world of film a lot of things can happen in six years. To some directors six years is a mere blink of an eye, such as Stanley Kubrick. Others, like The Coen Brothers would have to fill that period with as much great work as possible. In both filmmakers cases you always knew you would be rewarded with a great piece of work. And also in both cases, the strength of their established material was so great that they were never afraid of disappearing from the public eye.<br/><br/>During the past six years my heart and mind has been caressed and challenged by such new talents as P.T. Anderson and Christopher Nolan with masterpieces like Magnolia and Memento. And, during that hiatus, my mind forgot about the fact that Reservoir Dogs focused my direction toward quality films, the amount of dialogue from Pulp Fiction that is now part of my daily vocabulary and the laid back chilled out approach Tarantino took with Jackie Brown. My mind tends to forget what is good for it. And so we come to Kill Bill.<br/><br/>
Kill Bill opens with a bang and ends with a question. Both of them are unexpected and both of them hit you hard and leave you reeling. In-between those events Uma Thurman as The Woman With No Name (yet) starts out on her path of bloody retribution. That's all you need to know going into this film. That and the fact that there may be spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>
I've heard a lot of people who've seen this film complaining about either the lack of plot, the lack of 'typical' Tarantino dialogue, or the levels of violence. Well to all you who complain of such matters, you don't deserve this film! Go bury your head in the sand and wait for something formulaic to appear. In terms of plot progression, no, nothing much actually happens in the first volume. The Bride wakes up four years after being shot into a coma on her wedding day, orders some Japanese steel and takes out two of the people on her death list number 5. But so what if that's all that happens? Is it essential for every great film to have a complex and detailed story? No, absolutely not. In The Straight Story all that happens is an old man travels across the country to visit his estranged brother. But it's the richness of the way the story is told which makes it so captivating. And in Kill Bill everything is told with style. With regard to the dialogue, I think I would have found it off-putting if the film had been populated with characters that talked and discussed everyday matters like they do in Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. While this film moves incredibly fast, the characters don't. They're contemplative and remorseful over their actions, both in the past and for what's to come. Besides which, what film law states that Tarantino has to fill every film he makes with what's become known as his trademark dialogue?! Ridiculous! And there are some great lines in Kill Bill; `If, on your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut' and `I want him to witness the extent of my mercy by witnessing your deformed body'. Great lines and great deliveries.<br/><br/>As for the violence, yeah, there's a lot of it. Deal with it! Either watch and enjoy or shield your eyes. There's brutal ugly violence and insane cartoon violence. And then there's blood soaked anime violence. And unseen but horribly implied coma violence. Limbs go a-leaping and bodies are bloodied. There's a lot of blood in here. Think of Mr Orange as a starting off point and take your imagination from there. I like the level of violence in this film, it's refreshing after so many directors are afraid to show the full extent of damage that could be caused to someone in order that their film will be more accessible to mass audiences. I like the fact that the samurai swords in this film don't just kill people, but they cleanly slice through flesh and bone. And I like the fact that every move, every slice, every punch and kick really hurts.<br/><br/>This film is set resolutely in the revenge/exploitation genre, as Quentin himself has stated many times and as such the carnage has to be bloodier and more savage than you would find in mainstream movies. Until now of course, as Kill Bill is most definitely mainstream, but with an even wider appeal, reaching out to those of us who can identify the genres and styles he has successfully blended. Much like the way Pixar's films appeal to both children and adults, Kill Bill will grab the Friday and Saturday night audience tempted by the thrill of action, but it will also ensnare the serious film head who will appreciate the film on the same, but also a deeper level from the wonderfully measured performances, the technical aspects that Quentin is more in command of as a director, such as the camera work and editing, the mixing of genres and film styles; live action to anime, colour to black and white to blue-backdrop shadow outlines back to colour and of course Tarantino's latest soundtrack compilation.<br/><br/>
And it's here that he excels himself perhaps more than in any other aspect. Kill Bill contains my favourite Tarantino soundtrack so far and if anything, his musical choices actually seem to have improved in the past six years. Not that there was anything to ever complain about of course, but here it's just a little deeper, the songs and themes seem to resonate more with the action onscreen. Starting off with perhaps the most ridiculously apt song, Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down), straight after Bill slugs a slug into The Bride's head, he then stirs in spaghetti Western themed music against O-Ren Ishii's animated origin chapter to excellent effect. There's a superb touch that happens three times where Tarantino takes a short burst of music from Ironside and plays it when The Bride comes into contact with someone she badly needs to fcuk up. And there's a beautiful Japanese voiced song that picks up after The Bride and O-Ren Ishii's fight in a striking snow covered Japanese garden. The effects and sound design to this film are excellent and a vast improvement over his previous work. Methinks Quentin got into home cinema in a big way during his writing holiday.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are expertly choreographed and captured. Although there are only really two to speak of, the initial melee with Copperhead in suburbia land and the Showdown At House Of Blue Leaves, which takes on about four different stages and lasts for something like 20 minutes. The domesticated fight is messy and fleeting, both women grabbing at whatever they can to gain the upper hand. It's loud and it hurts but it's also prematurely broken up before too much tissue damage stops the fun.<br/><br/>House Of Blue Leaves however is a thing of beauty. It begins with an arm being hacked off as the Bride strides toward O-Ren, her bloodied Hattori Hanzo samurai sword in hand. Standing in her way is the small matter of O-Ren's six initial subordinates, her personal guard Go Go Yubari, and of course, her Yakuza ARMY. The first six are dispatched with very simply, no fuss, just slice and dice. Go Go is more of a challenge, with her whirling ball of spiky death, and more of a challenge to film. For this fight the camera moves around more, as in the same way that The Bride has to ready and better herself for each stage. You can see this by the first fight being fairly grounded, both The Bride, the camera and the combatants. With Go Go the fight moves around the floor more and up onto table tops and we get overhead camera moves and more varied shot types with quicker editing cuts. By the time she faces O-Ren's army, everyone is all over the place, The Bride uses the whole space of the floor, under and above, through paper walls and up the stairs, onto balconies and traversing down bamboo shoots. The camera follows in the same fashion, and even more rapid cuts are required, and the film changes to black and white. Now this can either be Quentin's homage to the monochrome samurai films of the 50's or that he didn't feel US audiences would handle the vibrancy of geysers of blood as well as Eastern audiences, who are getting their own full colour version of the film. Personally, I'll be getting DVD versions tailored for each side of the world so it matters not to me.<br/><br/>The fight and film changes again as The Bride and the remaining 8 or so of the Crazy 88's head up into a small room where, after a lighting change by the owner of the restaurant, the principals are cloaked entirely in silhouette, framed by a gorgeous blue background. Once the last suit wearing sword holding member has been spanked, and The Bride addresses anyone left alive to hear, it's onto the final part of the climax. I don't know where Quentin's production designer has been or what he's been doing for six years but that Japanese snowy garden is one of the most beautiful looking sets I've ever seen on screen. And again the film changes design, this is a slower and more calculated fight. Arguably it's less climactic than the previous fight but only in strict action terms. The exchanges between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii, as minimal as they are, provide the whole crux of the film, the understated regret and remorse from the main characters of what they have done in their past and what they intend to do in the future, should they even get that far.<br/><br/>There's so much that I haven't touched on as well, the little Tarantino tricks like Mia's onscreen 'square' in Pulp Fiction and his wealth of film references. The whole 'Man From Okinawa' chapter and the greatness of Sonny Chiba, the character actor! The performances of Darryl Hannah and the unseen David Carradine as Bill.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a masterpiece and the most exhilarating film I've seen in years. It's exactly how I would have expected Quentin Tarantino to bounce back onto the screen yet completely confound my expectations. And we're only halfway through the story!"
"chris123","5","0","0","3 November 2003"," an asian action flick fan perspective
","I came out of the theatre hating this movie, though I cannot figure out why. Kill Bill, for its story, is actually a very well-made movie; I have to give them that.  It is fun to watch, a lot of the scenes are visually cool. The blood is excessive, to the point of stupidity, but it's just so silly that I was kind of laughing at it.  It doesn't have much of a plot, but given that I'm really into brainless action flick, that's not the issue either.<br/><br/>In the end, after much discussion with my friends, I realized I hated it because it's a 'hommage' to movies that I grew up watching.  I'm from HK originally; being an action flick fan, I daresay I've seen most of the movies/tv shows that inspired Kill Bill. In fact, I still watch a lot of the kung fu/action films and tv series and anime these days.  A lot of them are very campy, but a few are really exceptional.<br/><br/>So for many of the 'things' in Kill Bill, I can find an example from asian cinema that does it 'better'.  For example, the blood spurting is quite typical japanese samurai and anime.  Yet, in better done ones, it doesn't look 'stupid'.  It's actually cool.  The focus was not the blood, but the tension before and after the sword strike; the spurting is there just to highlight the deadly elegance of the motion, which a lot of times is supposed to be so fast that you can't see.<br/><br/>And a lot of the 'oh-so-innovative' camera tricks, I've seen before in HK or Japanese movies, just not together, all mashed in one movie.  I believe, the manga sequence is probably the only portion that I find up to par to the standard of most modern day japanese manga/anime.<br/><br/>I cannot help but feel that instead of paying respect to the asian films that inspired it, Kill Bill was making fun of them by making the scenes look as campy as possible for laughs.  In the end, Kill Bill just seemed like an Americanized asian action flick/parody... which is not something I would gladly pay $10 to see."
"yieldedtochrist","Null","0","0","1 November 2003"," Unfunny is funny with Tarantino
","I say ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is a success - for what it is, anyway.  The style and content of this movie will vastly narrow down its viewing audience - obviously, it isn't suitable for children, and even many who are of eligible age will be turned off by the gore - so we have to wonder, why did Tarantino make this film?  I'm convinced that he just likes to make movies. His way.  He takes pride in being unique - indeed, his uniqueness has earned him critical praise left and right. What I love about this movie is that it shows us once again, as we saw in Pulp Fiction and other QT films, how he loves to make us find humor in the fundamentally unfunny.  I read a user comment on this site the other day that said violence isn't funny, and people getting killed is serious, and we shouldn't be laughing at it - and I think that's the point.  QT doesn't think killing is funny, but he wants to make people laugh when they don't expect to laugh, which is why he presents the killing in such a cartoonish way.  I read that in the House of Blue Leaves scene alone (the Japanese club at the end) they used 450 gallons of fake blood.  Come on, that's not realistic.  And once you've seen a waterfall of blood spewing from a lopped off appendage a few times - yeah, it's a little funny. There's a scene early in the film where The Bride is in the home of one of her former colleagues, now enemies, conducting a brutal, gruesome fight, when the woman's young child walks in the door from school, and the two women try to cover up that they've been fighting, despite the blood all over them and the ransacked house.  When that scene happened, the theater literally burst with laughter.  You see what he's done?  It's subtly brilliant - he's taken a situation and a moment that in any other context would be horrifying, and would cause the theater to collectively gasp - and made it funny.  No one can do that like Quentin. Anyway, if you have kids, DON'T TAKE THEM to see this one, and if blood makes your stomach turn, you might avoid it as well - but, if you like quirky, unexpected, well-directed movies with amazing fight coreography, Kill Bill is for you.<br/><br/>-Kyle"

","This film marks to firsts for me. It is the first Tarantino film I have seen in a movie theatre, and It is the first Michael Madsen movie I have seen in a theatre. I became a fan of both Madsen and Tarantino after seeing ""Reservoir Dogs"" a year ago, so when I knew that there was going to be another collaboration between them, I was thrilled........<br/><br/>
And I wasn't dissapointed. In ""Kill Bill"" Tarantino does exactly what he set out to do, make a bad 1970's samurai film. And it works. It can, in some ways, be considered a spoof. There are plenty of laughs along the way, and most of the gore is done for laughs. It also features Tarantino's uncanny ability to find a song that is absolutely appropriate for what's happening, or for what just happened on screen. in the first scene, we are shown, from simply a closeup on The Bride's face, Bill shoot her in the head. There is a blackout, and then Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang, Bang, My Baby Shot Me Down"" plays over the opening credits. Could it be any more perfect? I also enjoyed the quiet strains of ""Nobody"" playing during the climactic fight between The Bride and the Crazy 88s at the end. If you haven't seen it, you'll understand what I mean when you do.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is not a typical Tarantino film. It doesn't have the biting dialogue of ""Dogs"" or ""Fiction"". But It does have some choice lines, and the cinematography is stunning.<br/><br/>I read the screenplay and some postings, so I knew approximately where the move would end, and I didn't want it to. That's another thing I have to mention. The movie is an hour and a half long, but it absolutely breezes by.<br/><br/>
Overall, I am not disappointed. I know that I'll will have to pay to see the other half and I don't care. It's well worth the money. I cannot wait until February.<br/><br/>And how could I be a Michael Madsen fan without mentioning him. He is here, for about two minutes of screen time, and it was a wonderful two minutes. I loved the fact that Tarantino put him in a Black suit, I assume to give a little reference his Mr. Blonde character  from ""Reservoir Dogs"". He even has a little animae cartoon in the ""O- Ren-Ishi segment, and a cool line at the end. I wait until February, when his character of ""Budd"" becomes more of a prominent character and goes head to head with The Bride. Go Mr. Blonde!<br/><br/>
Mr. Tarantino, you have done it again, and I am proud to have contributed to the box office of your film. I already want to see it again, and I probably will. And I'll be waiting in line for Volume 2 in February<br/><br/>*****/***** 10/10"

Tarentino is back in the game with this monster movie, a subtle mixture of classic Hong-Kong style martial arts kick ass movie (featuring Sonny Chiba!), the grotesque amount of blood to match ""Braindead"", and last but not least, the extremely morbid humor of the master Tarantino himself. The movie mixes the madness of ""A clockwork Orange"" with the genius of ""Resevoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", adding a twist of ""From dusk 'till dawn"" in the gory, limb-cutting scenes seen throughout the movie. The master touch is, however (in my humble oppinion) the very subtle and almost disguised morbid humor of Tarantino...

Unfortunately by the over generous reviews Kill Bill has received it seems praising anything with QT's name on it is now mainstream.<br/><br/>I didn't read any reviews before seeing the movie. I just heard that it was really good. Instead I sat through a very confused movie. QT's usual scene shuffling in this movie serves no purpose. Its not ground breaking anymore its tired. The dialog is very lacking in comparison to his other films.<br/><br/>The movie is your usual QT style movie for the first 1/3 and then all of a sudden it goes anime. I think its too sharp a change in style for the same movie. It just doesn't flow very well especially with the excess of blood. I found myself thinking, ""Please turn off the blood jets or at least make them shorter"". I have the stomach for gore. In fact disturbingly enough I like it but this wasn't gory, it was stupid. I can't appreciate ""directing vision"" that is nothing more than, ""look its blood! Don't you think its gross?"". Way too much of it. Could have done a lot less and had more impact.<br/><br/>With Tarantino's movies like RDogs there is an excess of cussing. Every over word is the f-word. After a while it becomes obvious that its an attempt at shock value and nothing more. But after a few minutes of it you are numb to it.

In fact, musically the entire film plays like something out of Ennio Morricones nightmares. At times the blaring music and rythmic shots play like a music video gone wild. I was impressed with the performances. The film is almost an ode to Uma. I can think of worse ways to spend two hours than staring at Uma Thurman's beautiful and unique face. Some of the situations Uma finds herself in are almost incomprehensibly horrible. ""Kill Bill"" is like watching the ""Pulp Fiction"" overdose scene for two hours.<br/><br/>
The cinematography was almost too polished for the narrative. The film looks very good. I like the 70-ish ""feature presentation"" bit at the start of the picture.<br/><br/>All in all, I couldn't recommend this film to the squeamish but I would hope that a brave viewer would give this unique picture a chance. I think it will find it's way to the ""cult"" section in the video store nearest you in the future."

","Quentin Tarantino has done it again, bringing something fresh back to the table in a time where action films have been lacking of late.<br/><br/>Being now synonymous with his violent spaghetti-westerns with a twist, this surely doesn't disappoint. While come critics condone his use of violence in his films, at times its so over the top it comes off as comical, and not to be taken so seriously. A light humor that hangs in the background of most of the carnage that happens in his films, and i'd ask for anyone who has not yet gone and seen it on that side of the film, to take a look, keep an open mind. You're sure to be left with something that will be remembered with mixed feelings, but a unique flavor that is rare to find in box office blockbusters.<br/><br/>The music alone is memorable to say the least, Quentin Tarantino's choice in odd songs adds to the experience. We heard the surfy tunes of Pulp Fiction, and in the lead up to seeing Kill Bill it was a big question in my mind to what we'd find next. Cheesy but oh so lovable is what i was left with at the end of the film. Great soundtrack that i'll personally be buying when its out. From japanese sounds of old, coming through with its haunting strength, all the way to stuff we'd all thought had been buried back a few decades ago, all of it complimented the film.<br/><br/>Go and see, enjoy another Tarantino masterpiece."
"psi_fla","Null","0","0","28 October 2003"," Is this `Charlie's Angels' taken seriously?
","Rating: *** (out of *****)<br/><br/>What next for Quentin Tarantino? After crafting two of the most talked about films of the 1990's in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and then trying his luck with an Elmore Leonard adaptation (Jackie Brown), what more can this man prove?  Well, why not move into the martial arts world?<br/><br/>
His latest film, Kill Bill, tries to do just that. Unfortunately, I can't make a final judgement on how successful the whole film is as yet, for I am only reviewing part of it. By taking what appears to be a linear story, dividing it in two, and stretching out these two `volumes' into 1 hr 50 min. segments, Tarantino has regrettably bowed down to the money-grabbing demands of the distributor (although he  and they  claim otherwise). It's hard to watch this in the cinema without the unease that Miramax are ripping filmgoers off. A shorter running length with an intermission would have been far more appreciative.<br/><br/>Putting Miramax's greed aside, Kill Bill Volume I succeeds  to a certain extent. The dialogue and characters that you know Tarantino for best take a back seat to the technical side of things. But his mark is certainly on the film, and, as our protagonist, Uma Thurman shows a kind of ruthless glare and authority that I once felt was beyond her reach. <br/><br/>The film opens with our heroine, known as The Bride, facing up to a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The squad has five members: O-Ren Ishii, aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu  a Charlie's Angel suddenly gone tough, eh?), Vernita Green, aka Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox), Budd, aka Sidewinder (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver, aka California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), and the infamous Bill (David Carradine) who we don't even see, yet. They all thought they had killed her in a wedding massacre  they were wrong. She recovers from a coma, then she begins her revenge.<br/><br/>Kill Bill has a very Pulp Fiction-esque chapter-like structure, but the similarities end there. In some ways, this film is a straightforward, arty and sometimes overly pretentious hybrid of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. <br/><br/>The first hour is really enjoyable. The development of O-Ren's character (with a nice bit of anime to help) sets the ball rolling for some very interesting moments. However, Tarantino allows some scenes in the second half of the film to drag on for too long. This serves little purpose except giving us the chance to gaze at admittedly beautiful scenery and choreography (the latter courtesy of the Matrix man, Yuen Wo-Ping).<br/><br/>Comparisons with The Matrix Reloaded will be inevitable. Yet I must admit that at the end of Volume I, I didn't feel quite as cheated as I did when I first saw the end of Reloaded. This film does not end so abruptly, and we are clearer about the situation. There's a nice twist at the end, too (even if it feels too convenient). So it's not so much an unclear plot that annoys us as the fact that, in a matter of months, we will have to part with more money to see how it all turns out (for little reason).<br/><br/>
You may find another clear similarity with Reloaded in the closing battle. If you take out the blood and gore, the fight would easily fit into place in that film. Indeed, watching The Bride survive the hardest of attacks makes you think she may be some kind of Superwoman. (Although I wonder if it was such a good idea to use flying effects in the final showdown, for they actually look a little out-of-place in a battle where most of the fighting is firmly on the ground.)<br/><br/>It's good to see Tarantino having a go at this sort of film, even though if we see many more films like this, the genre really will become overexposed. Nonetheless, his fans will be kept more than satisfied, and the final twist should help ensure that many will look forward to Volume II."

","<possible spoilers> Once upon a time, people used to tell stories as a means of human communication - perhaps the highest means. Kill Bill is the zenith of the refusal of meaning - it's claim is to exist in a realm of its own, as ""pure"" filmmaking, ""pure"" cinema, which ideologically means ""pure"" ENTERTAINMENT. All of which makes the film a typical product of Capital - let me say, a commodity. The interesting thing is that the film is not only a blatant commodity in itself (one which exists purely as spectacle) but it also exhibits some consciousness of itself as a commodity by being ABOUT commodities. The figures that populate the film are images to be sold; each of them both exemplifies and exhibits the most extraordinary fetishism. The film is about both the objectification of its characters and their place in a world which privileges objects. The climax of this first part has The Bride proving the worth of her sword, which is a fetishized product, a special brand which gives satisfaction. In fact, the film renders its ostensible premise - ""Revenge"" - to the status of commodity, of fashion accessory. And as the `old Klingon proverb' quoted at the film's start states - such products `are best served cold' i.e. heartless and without any human content. Like all products, the film offers the possibility of gained satisfaction - as does ""Revenge"" for The Bride, and the sword she has made (which stands for the film itself) is proved within the plot-line to be satisfactory. Whether the second part will confirm or challenge the claims of these THINGS to provide satisfaction remains to be see, but the movie is nothing more or less than the quintessential commodity of consumerist society. Also, whether it is a Zen lesson in commodities or a mere product of the system is something I can't as yet figure out... figure out..."

","This film is unlike the three previous films by Quentin Tarantino, but it also has the 'Guaranteed Tarantino quality' -label on it. There are the familiar Tarantino-like dialogues (with lots of dirty words, of course), perfect songs for each scene, also a few surprises and of course, cool and classy atmosphere the whole time.<br/><br/>The first thing that sticks to your eye is the blood, the excessive amount of blood and violent images. I've seen some gory films before but this one also brought back up the kebab meal I had just before the movie. The fight scenes in this movie don't hide any details although they are lightened a bit in different ways. For example a long and bloody fight seen is shown in black and white and another part is in animation. The whole film is a very interesting mix of styles. There is a constant Japanese feel in the movie, much because of the martial arts theme, but at the same time there is also a touch of spaghetti western. The music in the duel scenes could be straight from The Good, The Bad And The Ugly or some other Sergio Leone flick. Even with all the different styles, they are matched perfectly together.<br/><br/>Watching this movie I had the same feeling as I had when I saw Pulp Fiction for the first time. Like Pulp Fiction, this one was something different from what I had seen before and that's why it was a pleasure to watch it. I had no idea what I would see in the upcoming scenes and that's a nice feeling nowadays. The cast was good, although only a part of it is seen in the Volume 1. Uma Thurman does her job well in her second Tarantino-film and Lucy Liu was nice in her role of a different kind of angel. The idea of a dark counterpart of Charlie's Angels popped in to my mind a few times during the film. The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (just say Bill's Angels), mostly consisting of women with ultimate skills in weapons and martial arts... and Lucy Liu as one of them. Do I need to say more? Well, I have to say that this is a much better movie than the two new Charlie's Angels -films together.<br/><br/>Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a very good movie. I can't say, how good it is in a Tarantino-scale, because it's not really comparable to the previous ones. This is more fantasy than the previous, more realistic crime movies, but it doesn't make it any worse (or better either). If you expect to see a good Tarantino-style movie, this is definitely it, no doubt about it. It's a shame that Kill Bill was cut in half and is now shown in two volumes. It's not so long that it wouldn't be possible to watch it from the beginning till the end non-stop. But, this is such a good film that it doesn't hurt so much to pay two ticket fees to see both volumes. Though, I haven't seen the second one yet, so I can't really say anything about that. Anyway, with Uma Thurman there's one very good improvement made since Pulp Fiction. She really looks better as a blonde. ;)"

","i find it hard to read the previous comments, being an avid fan of kung fu cinema AND QT. In my opinion, this is one of Tarantino's best outings to date; the action is flawless, the references are outstanding, and the acting fits. and that's the part that bugs me the most - people are harping on this movie because of its one-dimensional plotting and acting, because it's all action and no story. have any of you sat down to watch a 70s era kung fu (especially gordon liu films, i recommend eight diagram pole fighter or master killer)? these films are ALL ABOUT action, telling story through action, and constantly skimping on story/plot! while we laud QT for his ability to intertwine pop cult references into his movies, we criticize it when he takes it to the next level.<br/><br/>tarantino, in my opinion, does an incredible job of questioning the genre he's taken up: the use of campy, dated effects, when it comes to violence, allow the viewer to place it in the present. the absurdity is impossible to mistake, but at the same time, it says alot about the current state of cinema. the big questions are: why is more realistic violence rendered ""more appropriate"" today? secondly, why is it not alright to laugh at tarantino's blood bath, yet it's okay to stare in quiet horror at movies that portray intimately realistic violence? that's a scary division.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is excellent because it is what it is, and nothing more."

","For more than thirty years all important American films (and I include musicals and comedies) have been preoccupied with the realistic depiction of the gangster lifestyle and the glorification of greed, violence, sadism, firearms, cars, dismemberment and disembowelling as modes of self-expression or a way of life. This thirty year period of continuous lowering of moral, aesthetic and human standards had to culminate somewhere and it did in the personality of a terminally adolescent movie geek forever fixated on his masturbatory fantasies of celluloid sadomasochism. Quentin Tarantino has misspent his youth cosily sheltered from real life, in dank movie houses, obsessing over the kind of ultra-violent and ultra-nerdy cinema cranked out for the planet's social rejects and epsilons. He is now considered mainstream and the darling of Western intellectuals. When he crawled back under the rock from whence he first emerged, his fans worried. When he finally came out bearing a new opus, like Moses bearing the tablets of the law, it was nothing less than the ultimate legal snuff film for the Grand Theft Auto and MTV generation of immature and imperfectly-socialized twits and a triumph with critics and at the box-office. Nobody seems to mind that, like all his previous films and scripts, his last one is a soul-destroying and gene-altering abomination, not to mention a major rip in the space-time continuum, as long as the teenagers - who are not legally permitted to watch his movies - can get their jollies watching uniformed criminal-type chicks lopping off each other's body parts while blood spurts every which way. But this is considered OK in polite circles because (1) it is well done, (2) it is funny in a kind of mindless, slack-jawed, socially irresponsible way and (3) this type of violence refers to an existing nerdy sub-genre of adolescent fantasy (kung fu movies, triad movies, what have you), which makes it a bona fide cultural artefact worthy of anthropological study. No one seems to mind either that, reportedly, irony and decadence have been pronounced dead after September 11, 2001. Nothing hinders art's progress, after all. Tarantino would still be popular - and probably more so - if he admitted to having single-handedly warped the minds of all of America's youth and his responsibility for society's widespread desensitization to gore, murder, violence and the suffering of others."

","I'll say this about QT - he's one of the most stylish directors to ever work in the movies. He approaches things from skewed angles, picking up stories in progress and then going back and filling in the blanks. His movies are never boring; but I do think they suffer from a definite lack of substance. I realize substance was one thing KB wasn't really going for, but his other films don't have a lot of depth either. They come on strong and fascinate, but they don't exactly make you think. Not that every movie has to, but I think if QT wants to have a lengthy career, he needs to break out of his seventies fixation and show some variety.<br/><br/>Seventies fixation is what KB is all about. From the ""Shaw Scope"" opening to the snap-zoom close ups, much of Kill Bill is violent, colorful fun. Uma is great in the lead, and the supporing characters are cool. I have to say that I was disappointed by the final battle, though. I looked forward to it the whole time, and when it finally came, it all just seemed...average. There's better sword-fighting and wire-work in Crouching Tiger, the fight with the Go-Go girl is unexceptional, and the highly touted bloodbath is mostly in black and white! This really annoyed me because I know it was just done to get an R rating. To me, the b & w took most of the fun out of the scene. Hopefully the DVD will restore it.<br/><br/>Overall, KB was pretty cool, and I was ready to watch part 2 when it was over.

","Bruce Lee said that in Enter the Dragon, the kung-fu masterpiece.  It's good question in that movie and a good one here.  QT has made a pretty good homage to the genre he loves so much, however, the problems that plague many of those movies also occur here; namely that no matter how bad a kung-fu or sword master one happens to be, you can't beat a gun.  So why, when so many people seem to have their lives on the line, does no one pull out their piece when they are obviously overmatched in swordmanship department by the bride?  The usual answer to this question is that it is movie, but that isn't good enough.  Sure Tarrantino puts some bizzarre and improbable events in his movies, but none of them totally defy logic like having one person fight and kill 90 others with nothing but a sword, and corpses to be 2-90 never think about whipping out a nine a capping that ass.  This is why kung-fu tends not to work outside historical period settings, because people don't kill people, guns kill people.  This is why I have a problem with the showdown at the house of blue leaves, 90 vs. 1 and none of them, not any of the crazy 88, not the insane bodygaurd, not even the ultra-ruthless O-Ren Ishii pulls out a gun, Black Mamba is pretty much occupado and open for the shot in the back, but no one takes it.  Are you supposed to suspend disbelief so much as to accept that a group of gangsters was able to take power in the yakuza, which is notoriously violent, with swords. Otherwise, this was an awesome flick, especially the amazing anime sequence which looks like it was done by the cowboy bebop folks, the characters are not as deep as in say pulp or dogs, but QT is going for straight action here.  Also, he seems to be trying for a semi-literary feel, with the chapters and such, but again is going for action, so he uses pretty a basic plot a characters that more movie archtypes than actual people, this isn't the count of monte crist(the book) and Quentin isn't Alexandre Dumas.  Uma was good, but the best performances were Sonny Chiba and Lucy Liu, both of whom were pretty f-ing amazing.  Also not as much quotable dialog and the fact that this is HALF A MOVIE.  Was QT so anamored with the Matrix and Lord of the Rings shooting multiple movies at once that he decided to cut this in half, because length cannot be the issue, Pulp Fiction is two hours forty five minutes long, what you think people can't sit in the theater for three hours, give them an intermission, preferably so they go out and smoke a bowl.  Finally, the music is awesome, from the oppening song, to another great score by RZA, another big fan of 70's kung-fu, here going for more or a 70's funk vibe than the bad-ass beats he used to score Ghost Dog, now if only he could hook up with John Carpenter for the next Wu Tang album.<br/><br/>Any fool can pull a trigger."

What made ""Pulp Fiction"" a classic is the way it redefined a whole movie genre with its self-irony and grotesque plotlines. But in ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" Tarantino's goal was simply to pay tribute to his beloved martial arts movies he grew up with. So in the end, he simply copied and pasted from other movies making his fourth feature seem like a collection of quotes from other movies giving him the chance to flaunt his movie knowledge.

","The ample fun and excitement Kill Bill provides don't result from the fact that it's `about' anything, that its characters have motivations, or that its plot makes sense, but from the way it takes us deep into movies. And, in doing so, it also takes us deeper into the peculiar movie-loving mind of Quentin Tarantino. There are endless references to other movies, most of all the Shaw brothers and Bruce Lee and other martial arts extravaganzas and Sergio Leone. Perhaps more interestingly, since this is the first Tarantino effort where he lets himself go again with his own writing (after the more disciplined exercise of adapting Elmore Leonard in Jackie Brown), Kill Bill contains endless references also to Tarantino's own more personal movies, and particularly to Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Kill Bill's star is Uma Thurman, who above all is the most delightful, fun person in Pulp Fiction -- Mia Wallace, the wife of the awesome crime boss, Marsellus Wallace, and Vincent Vega's (John Travolta's) dangerous dream date. Don't think for a minute that there's none of Mia Wallace in The Bride/Black Mamba, Uma's role in Kill Bill. When Black Mamba comes to life and begins the chain of revenges Kill Bill chronicles after being teased by a mosquito into awakening from a four-year coma, she pops up exactly the same way Mia did after she got the hypodermic needle of adrenaline to the heart. It's a direct visual echo.<br/><br/>Of course, Kill Bill is a homage to a different kind of pulp, and it hasn't got the amusing dialogue Pulp Fiction has. But we can see the same thought processes at work in the way Kill Bill is put together. There's a prologue (equivalent to the diner holdup scene with Honey Bunny (Amanda Plummer) and Pumpkin (Tim Roth) that begins Pulp Fiction, which leads into the background of the wedding murder scene with its stylized Wild West imagery and Sergio Leone overtones.<br/><br/>From then on Tarantino thinks in big setting/action blocks: (1) the hospital sequence where Uma comes to and takes charge of the Pussy Wagon we saw her using in the prologue; (2) the Samurai sword/Sonny Chiba Okinawa sequence where Black Mamba gets her magic, invincible weapon; and finally, (3) the long Tokyo sequence. This is divided into four parts. a) two background sequences on O-ren Ishii/Cottonmouth, first (a) one distanced by discrete anime where we witness O-ren being turned into a killer as a child by being attacked by a pedophile grandparent, second (b) a scene of her with her Yakuza subordinates where she beheads one who objects to being led by a woman who isn't even pure Japanese. This is followed by the two big final sequences of (c) the interior of the restaurant/disco/nightclub where Uma/Black Mamba confronts O-ren's posse and wipes them out, and (d) the exterior snowy garden where she takes on O-ren herself and Vol. 1 comes to a astonishingly peaceful and beautiful end.<br/><br/>It's not only the higgledy-piggledy time sequence that has a lot in common with Pulp Fiction: there are more specific echoes. Besides the ""awakening"" of Uma, the showdown `in medias res' between Uma and Vernita Green/Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) which serves as a prologue feels strangely similar to the Kahuna-burger sequence with Travolta and Jackson, the exploded head in the car, and The Wolf (Harvey Keitel) calmly supervising the tidying up of the bloody vehicle at Jimmie's (Tarantino's) house in Toluca Lake. In each case, it's ultra-violence abruptly breaking out in a bland, mediocre suburban setting as professional killers take revenge, with interruptions for brief spurts of terse dialogue. And the blank reaction of Copperhead's pretty little daughter to the mayhem and her mom's extinction reminds one of the small boy in Pulp Fiction who gets the long narrative from Christopher Walken about his grandfather's watch. Kids in Tarantino-land are innocent victims and affect-less onlookers.<br/><br/>
Others may delight in the faultless choreography of Tarantino's martial arts sequences. For me the hospital sequence stands out even more brightly. Here again there are elements that rhyme with Pulp Fiction, because the way Uma's character brutally punishes the crude orderly who's been renting out her inert body, stabbing him and bashing his head repeatedly with the door when he falls, and the way she then painstakingly escapes to the Pussy Wagon and rids her nether limbs of `entropy' by sheer patient power of thought, recalls the patient, methodical Butch in the prizefight Zen/Maynard pawnshop sequence, retrieving his watch, escaping his tormentors, freeing Marcellus Wallace to revenge his sexual assault by `getting medieval' on the hillbilly pervert's ass, and then returning to Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) on the commandeered `chopper' -his `Pussy Wagon.'<br/><br/>Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is more highly stylized and ritualized homage than Tarantino has ever done before: it's interesting that the greater artistic freedom and budget he has this time has led him, in a way, to restrict himself more.<br/><br/>The movie's idiosyncratic plot sequences fit in with Tarantino's mentality as described in Larissa MacFarquhar's excellent New Yorker magazine article, `The Movie Lover"" (October 20, 2003); she emphasizes that Tarantino has an incestuous familiarity with an almost endless quantity of beloved pulp movies. Favorite movie sequences exist in the cyberspace-like limbo of Tarantino's insatiable visual memory as if he had a head full of videotapes hanging half spent and never needing to be rewound. Somehow, somewhere, his plots all mesh, but it's the furiously engaging set pieces that stand out both in his mind and in the movies he makes.<br/><br/>Tarantino is a `movie lover' and there's no irony in his homages. `The problem with the irony charge' against Tarantino, MacFarquhar says, `is that pop culture and life are not separable for Tarantino.' Therefore any homage to pulp is a homage to movies and a homage to life. That granted, Kill Bill becomes life affirming - and also art-affirming. `What is Kill Bill about? is an irrelevant question. The key to the treasure is the treasure. Statements to the effect that Kill Bill is `smart, but.thin' (J. Hoberman), `brilliant' but containing `no story' (Ebert), or worse yet `decadent' and `crap' (Denby) miss the movie's affirmative aspects and try to make it seem cold when it's bubbling with enthusiasm and joie de vivre."

And if you're a guy making movies largely for the shock value, that can probably get tiresome.<br/><br/>I think that Quentin just decided one day, for his own amusement, to play a huge trick on the American theatregoing public.  He was going to make a movie so<br/><br/>sadly derivative it couldn't even be called a pastiche, so horribly contrived it couldn't even be called camp.  There are only so many long moments that you<br/><br/>can watch Lucy Liu tremble dramatically before you've shifted from art into<br/><br/>parody and it's time to get more popcorn.  And he was completely conscious of all of this while he was making the movie.  He didn't even tell the actors and actresses what he was doing.  The joke was on all of us, and I'm sure he was<br/><br/>laughing quietly to himself the entire time.  For those of you who have seen<br/><br/>""S1MONE,"" this movie was Quentin Tarantino's ""I Am Pig.""<br/><br/>And we are all the saps that made it possible.  QT is sitting somewhere in the Hollywood hills laughing his fool head off at everyone who fell for his ploy, then lighting cigars with hundred-dollar bills, then laughing some more.  And more power to him.  He pulled it off; I fell for it.  The man is a god."
"byght","Null","0","0","20 October 2003"," A pop extravaganza
","All pop culture of the last 30 years collides in a carnival of color, motion, violence, and sound in ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1,"" perhaps the most unique action film since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino once said that ""Pulp Fiction"" was not based on real life, but on movies.  It was a tribute to the fantastic and the exaggerated--all banter and witticism and sex and drugs and blood.  ""Pulp Fiction"" didn't just breathe new life into movies.  It brought them back.  There is no more apt way to express it than that.  It established a new way for film, laid a new road between the glitz of big-budget Hollywood and the stodginess of indie cinema--both of which were choking on their own dullness.  It found the synergy between pop and art more than any film of our time.<br/><br/>Countless filmmakers have followed Tarantino's path since, but ""Kill Bill"" proves emphatically that none can navigate its twists and turns with the aplomb and vitality of the creator.  ""Kill Bill,"" like ""Pulp Fiction,"" is an unapologetic tribute to the heightened reality of the screen.  Tarantino ecstatically glorifies the genre films which make up his inspiration: film noir, spaghetti Western, kung fu, '60s biker movies, even animation.  What makes ""Kill Bill"" special is that we feel the same ecstasy.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" is arguably the single most violent major motion picture release in American history.  The kung fu sequences are breathtaking ballets of dismemberment, capturing the voluptuousness of carnage as well as any John Woo or Sam Peckinpah sequence.<br/><br/>The soundtrack and score are stunning, with Wu-Tang Clan's the RZA providing the original music.  Just as he enhanced the somber ""Ghost Dog"" with gritty, tragic rhythms and melodies, he embellishes ""Kill Bill"" with flamboyant, aggressive movie music.<br/><br/>The cinematography and production design are as striking and daring as anything you've seen in recent memory, and awards are sure to come in those categories.<br/><br/>But for all of this, I find myself marvelling at just how good the underappreciated STORY of this film is.  Like kung fu and spaghetti Western films, it is a fable of violence and revenge--relying on its simplicity for impact.  You sort of have to be a fan of these genres to ""get"" this, but if you do indeed get it, this becomes perhaps the most heartfelt of Tarantino's tributes.  It is a recognition of films as more than entertainment, that basic moral themes of truth and justice can run underneath even the glossiest and most appallingly violent exterior."
"filmbuff-36","8","0","0","19 October 2003"," Tarantino's samurai flick delivers what it promises, and how!
","Honor, betrayal and revenge are three traits that are renowned throughout all literature and media. But perhaps no culture has so thoroughly examined these issues to the point that rules have been established on all of them as the Japanese have.<br/><br/>That is perhaps what led avant-garde director Quentin Tarantino to make a modern day samurai movie, with the Bushido code of honor still fully intact among today's assassins. Tarantino's three previous films ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" have all dealt with the three traits, but from a decidedly American standpoint. Add that to the fact that he grew up watching chop sockey flicks during his formative years, it's little wonder why he would be drawn to make such a film.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is an unapologetic throwback to the low budget and violent kung fu theater flicks of the late 70s, but mixed with all the weird idiosyncrasies we've come to expect from Hollywood's favorite indie director. The story is told in chapters that are out of order, characters have seemingly inappropriate civil conversations during the middle of chaos, people are tortured for information and sometimes just for the heck of it, and bad guys compete with each other over who is the ultimate villain.<br/><br/>In this strange world or honor and insanity we meet ""The Bride,"" (Uma Thurman) a former member of a hit man team known as Deadly Viper Assassination Squad where she went by the code name ""Black Mamba."" The rest of her squad ambushes her and her guests on her wedding day under mysterious pretenses not yet completely known, leaving her for dead. She miraculously manages to survive the ordeal, and four years later awakes from a hospital in El Paso, hungry for revenge.<br/><br/>Black Mamba soon begins her long journey of hunting down her enemies, which include O-Ren ""Cottonmouth"" Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita ""Copperhead"" Green (Vivica A. Fox), Elle ""California Mountain Snake"" Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd ""Sidewinder"" (Michael Madsen), and of course the mysterious ringleader Bill (the as of yet unseen David Carradine). She really only wants these top five figures, but is more than willing to put down anyone who stands in her way as well.<br/><br/>Strong character development takes a back seat to violence and mayhem, which is sort of strange for a Tarantino flick. The characters are all interesting and unique, but this is not meant to be a deeply thought provoking experience. This is pure style over substance, with characters hacking each other apart with swords, knives and other weapons all for the benefit of the audience.<br/><br/>The film succeeds best when it is playing the material straight. Legendary Japanese action star Sonny Chiba has a small but wonderful role as Hattori Hanzo, a near mythic sword maker who crafts a special blade just for Black Mamba.<br/><br/>Tarantino, however, can't seem to control himself here. There are numerous comic scenes included with little rhyme or reason, such as a dirty hospital orderly who pimps out comatose patients to truckers, a scene where Hanzo keeps yelling at his lazy underling, and a lengthy scene in a parking garage where Black Mamba tries to regain control of her legs after four years of idleness.<br/><br/>Also, a ten-minute ultra violent animé sequence detailing the origin of O-Ren Ishii seems added for just the heck of it.<br/><br/>Tarantino definitely has his tongue planted firmly in cheek here, especially in the battle sequences. Victims who are decapitated or lose limbs spray out gallons of blood from their gashes in a disgustingly over-the-top fashion.<br/><br/>Not since the battle between King Arthur and the Black Knight in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" or the lawnmower finale of ""Dead Alive"" has so much of the red stuff spurted out of open wounds. Audiences will either react to such scenes by losing their lunch or laughing hysterically.<br/><br/>Really, the only way to enjoy ""Kill Bill"" is if you have a very sick sense of humor, and even then it's kind of hard to laugh at somebody lying on the ground screaming while blood oozes from a severed arm. Still, Tarantino knows who his audience is, and anyone who fits that demographic will have a blast.<br/><br/>The cliffhanger ending will entice others while leaving other people feeling cheated. But then, the whole movie is a rather schizophrenic affair. On one hand, it's nice to see a movie where you don't know what will happen next, on the other, the mixture of slapstick and extremely gory death scenes may be offsetting to most viewers.<br/><br/>I look forward to the second half of ""Kill Bill"" in February, though I'm not honestly sure why. Tarantino has certainly crafted an original picture here, but I doubt many people will think it lives up to the hype. As an exercise in extreme violence and revenge, the film is a full throttle blast, but as the latest film from one of Hollywood's most celebrated directors, it's just a strange detour.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars. Though at times it is an excessive assault on the senses, it's unique enough by itself to be visionary."

"NightTrekker","9","0","0","19 October 2003"," Light-years beyond what I expected going in
","Before I begin my review, let me establish that I haven't seen every kung-fu movie ever made... in fact, I haven't seen very many at all, but I HAVE seen enough to appreciate this film's many moments of homage.  In all honesty, if you've seen 2 good Bruce Lee films (and liked them), and you have a sense of humor, you'll probably love this.<br/><br/>I know this is horrible, but I've only seen three Tarantino films including this one (this is the only one I've seen in it's entirety), and the others (From Dusk Till Dawn, which I loved, and Jackie Brown, which I WOULD have loved if I had seen more of it) were on television and HEAVILY censored. I've been meaning to get around to to the good, uncensored stuff, but I'm a college student without a car, and I'm poor.<br/><br/>Anyway, on to the review (I'm not going to say too much about plot because... well, I want you to go see it :P ).<br/><br/>Wow- this single word serves well in summarizing my reaction.  And if that's not sufficient: I had to pee very badly the entire time I was watching this, and I STILL enjoyed it.  I went to see this with two of my friends (one of which had already seen it), and and I don't think I've ever looked over to check someone else's reactions as often during a movie (except maybe The Matrix).  After leaving the theater it was our sole topic of conversation for at least 10 straight minutes.<br/><br/>This is going to sound terrible cliché, but from the opening scene until the ending, this movie grabs you by the collar and shakes you vigorously.  The theater I watched it in had the sound turned up VERY loud, and though it was uncomfortable at times, it ultimately served to enhance the experience. And now, in no particular order:<br/><br/>The sound?- it's great.  Every movement on-screen is accompanied by fitting, satisfying, and often hilariously over-the-top sound effects.  The soundtrack is phenomenal and varied (with one intentional exception being the music provided by an in-movie band, and it serves the atmosphere well).<br/><br/>The acting?- superb.  Everyone involved in this film supplies either convincing, enjoyable, appropriately overblown performances or gratingly cheesy ones (intentionally so and very much in line with the movies that Tarantino is paying homage to).  Uma Thurman is excellent as The Bride, and David Carradine is perfectly casted as Bill.<br/><br/>The special effects?- impressive and howl-inducing.  I'm not sure I've ever laughed as much at a film (at the right times) as I did watching Kill Bill. Tarantino definitely did the right thing in refusing to use CG or big-budget special effects- this feels very much like a 70's kung-fu flick.  The animation parts of the movie are inexplicably appropriate and well done.<br/><br/>The storyline?- simultaneously ridiculous parody and heartfelt homage.  As insane as the action is and the characters are, I still found myself getting engrossed in the story.  Tarantino's love for the classic movies is palpably evident.<br/><br/>I have to admit it: I was skeptical about this movie.  I have very limited exposure to Tarantino films, and the man has such a cult following that I went in guarded and with high expectations, ready to lose the little faith I had in him.  Kill Bill did nothing but confirm that faith- Tarantino is immensely talented and intelligent.  He obviously in the right business, and he definitely knows what he's doing.  He's definitely on my small list of favorites.<br/><br/>One final note: this movie is extremely gory.  If you're not used to watching that kind of stuff, you might be turned off by it, but it's presented in such a tongue-in-cheek manner that you can't help but laugh.<br/><br/>Overall rating (from 1 to 5): an enthusiastic five.  GO SEE IT!"

","This movie relies almost exclusively on shock effect and stylized dismembering in order to affect a surreal indulgence in the absurd.  The violence doesn't carry the plot, and only draws out what otherwise might be an interesting (and shorter) story.  Why Tarantino takes his directing style to this extreme is beyond me, but I know people are going to praise this movie simply for its tastelessness, much like the nouveau European chicks sporting mullets...  Only the ""ignorant masses"" cannot appreciate true trash.  I suppose that I couldn't possibly understand what's to like in an <excrement> sandwich either, but I feel like I lost 3 hours of my life on this one.  What a disappointment.

","I had only few expectations about this film and even those weren't too positive. After first few minutes I knew that this movie was going to be better than I had thought. This movie ,as well as the other Tarantino movies has a great soundtrack which supports the atmosphere in the movie. Despite the great soundtrack, this film didn't feel like a real Tarantino movie. It lacked the feeling Tarantino had in his earlier movies. In some scenes the camera usage was lazy and uninventive. The dialogue in the movie remind me more of the matrix: reloaded (which I thought was really pretentious) than the pulp fiction. It seems to me that Tarantino has adopted too much from hollywood action movies. Not much but enough. This movie had some great action-scenes and I liked it, when the movie bounced between the lines of tastelesness and humour.<br/><br/>Kill Bill vol.1 is going to be very enjoyable to watch if youforget about the fact that its actually a Tarantino movie.

","The beauties of film making and the crafting of cars are fundamentally the same: both involve the elaborate composition of many elements and technologies to<br/><br/>generate a single, cohesive, entity. Therefore, if Kill Bill had four wheels, then they must have been assembled by Ferrari. Tarantino is the Ferrari of his art, and is a master of the combinatorial approach to film direction, gelling sight, sound, energy and tone into a piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>Tarantino has often stated that he grew up on Kung-fo movies, and this appears to be his homage to them. This represents the core premise of the film, with<br/><br/>concentrically arranged hierarchies of detail then constructed around it. In<br/><br/>lesser hands this approach could have led to a disjointed film, however the<br/><br/>imagination and care that has been injected are highly evident and enjoyable to watch. However, the plot concerning the path of revenge is relatively<br/><br/>inconsequential, and simply represents a platform onto which the action and<br/><br/>emotion are built. Not that this matters, since the action is so dazzlingly<br/><br/>spectacular and Uma Thurman's performance so startling.<br/><br/>The camera viewpoint is used by Tarantino as a humour in itself. Little touches such as the rows of sunglasses on the cop's dashboard and the `Pussy Wagon'<br/><br/>keychain are evidence of this. Equally he has become more sophisticated in the utilisation of difference camera techniques, connecting them to the rhythm of film. The best example of which is the long tracking shot to establish the Tokyo club layout, followed by an abrupt cut, at which point the action begins.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the use of sound in the film is excellent, both with the superb<br/><br/>musical soundtrack and the effects. Touches, such as the increasing beat of the spinning ball and chain weapon  as the battle reached its climax, were well<br/><br/>appreciated. Also, the moaning sounds of the injured during Thurman's rousing speech were hilarious.<br/><br/>This brings me to the violence of the film, which was admittedly gory but should be understood in two ways. Firstly, it is a tool used in the establishment of a constant tension throughout the film. Secondly, it has comedic value - watch<br/><br/>Monty Python's Question for the Holy Grail for the origin of the spouting blood from severed limbs gag. The film is essentially a cartoon, a fact accentuated via the anime interlude, and is not meant for literal interpretation.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Tarantino's skilful combination of the various auditory, visual and psychological components within the film makes this his best work yet. Roll on volume two.<br/><br/>4 out of 4."
"charlsbalazs","10","0","0","18 October 2003"," Wow!
","First let me say--NOT a fan of Tarantino. In fact, kinda the opposite. I strongly disliked Pulp Fiction, and when someone starts in quoting the annoying dialogue, I just want to shoot them. Never watched Reservoir Dogs, everything about it just turned me away. Indifferent toward Jackie Brown, no interest.<br/><br/>But there was something about the trailers for Kill Bill ... after seeing the movie (about a half-hour ago), I think it was actually the music. I loved this film! And not just for the music. It's not about the plot, it's about the film. A lot of films are just made to tell a story, and the story (or, increasingly, the special effects) are what makes them great. The Lord of the Rings movies may have good-to-great actors and expensive special effects, but without one of the greatest pieces of English literature driving the story, it would be ... well, those latest two pieces of crap that George Lucas squeezed out.<br/><br/>But I digress, Kill Bill is cinema for cinema's sake, it's so drenched in, not just blood, but culture. It's an homage to so many styles, yet also breaks new ground. And, back to my favorite part, the music is just as past-meets-future amazing! Words can't explain this visual-auditory feast, because it isn't about words. It's not about the action scenes either, no matter how fun and cool. It's about film. See it with an open mind. (Some people still have them, don't they?)<br/><br/>I still can't believe how much I loved this movie, considering how much I've loathed Tarantino in general and Pulp Fiction specifically."

to even dare comment on Vol2, would be completely moronic.. it may be the worst film ever, who knows? just let us glaze in the glory that is Vol1 for now... even the dream of Vol2 satisfies me more than many other films.<br/><br/>PS: Kill Bill requires an understanding of Japanese/Eastern cinema... and if you liked KILL BILL, but know nothing of that side of cinema, i could do nothin better than recommend you discover it.

And Kill Bill Volume 1 is a worthy effort.<br/><br/>Many of the Tarantino trademarks remain - non-linear chapters, visceral violence and cool music. But where this film differs from his previous films is that the dialogue has been reduced and the stylized, operatic violence has taken it's place in centre stage.<br/><br/>As before, Tarantino, seems to specialise in taking trashy, exploitation cinema influences and mixing them into a spectacular whole. With this film he has done it again by using 70s martial arts movies, in particular, as his primary source of inspiration. The result is mesmerizing at times. There is even a Japanese Anime segment, which fits in despite the fact that it should never work!<br/><br/>This is another addition to a great catalogue of work by one of the best modern filmmakers."

The weakest character is strangly the main one, The bride as she is called, she just was very generic revenge seeking character that was well played by Uma Thurman. Although the character wasn't well rounded her performance was. The story suffers from all most to much bloody action, bit thank god it is incredibly well done. The anime sequence was simpky exdrodinary the best part of the first half of the film. My big problem with this film is the first half isn't nearly as entertaining, beautiful, or well paced as the second half. Which kinnda gave the film a off balence feel that all of Tarentions films have, I have always admired the kind of jerky flow he had but it just didn't seem to work in this film. The music was for the most part excellent as well as akk of the fight sequences. I am so happy to see a film that uses stunts instead of visual effects for fight sequences, there have been far to many films with visual effects assisted stunts lately its beginging to annoy me.

","In 1982, Italian horror director Dario Argento made a movie called TENEBRE. The most shocking part of that little film was when a woman had her arm chopped off and blood sprayed to all directions. Well, over 90 people lose their limbs with even more squirting blood during the 111 minutes of 2003's KILL BILL: VOLUME ONE, so a question remains in mind: What's next?<br/><br/>
The 4th film by acclaimed director Quentin Tarantino, (PULP FICTION, JACKIE BROWN) KILL BILL was chopped into two parts, or volumes. The first volume is the one in question. Released one week before the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake, KILL BILL: VOLUME ONE ranks as an incredibly superior and bloodier film. Tarantino's grindhouse dedication to the countless B Kung Fu flicks of the 1970s gets a grade A.<br/><br/>
Uma Thurman is ""The Bride"" (a.k.a: Black Mamba) a nameless assassin who decides to leave the business and start a new clean life by marrying and having a baby. But it doesn't happen that soon, as her boss Bill (David Carradine) and four other killers pay a bloody visit to the wedding and slaughter the entire party before putting the final bullet inside The Bride's brain. Fast-forward and The Bride amazingly survived and remained in coma for the last four years. When she wakes up after being bitten by a mosquito and soon realizes both her husband and baby are dead, she has two choices: Either go on with life or kill Bill. Which one she chooses? You guessed right.<br/><br/>But before killing Bill, The Bride will have to kill all other four hitmen that helped the wedding shooting: O-Ren Shi (a.k.a Cottonmouth) played by Lucy Liu, Vernita Green (a.k.a Copperhead) played by Vivica A. Fox, Elle Driver (a.k.a California Mountain Snake) played by Daryl Hannah, Bud (a.k.a Sidewinder) played by Michael Madsen.<br/><br/>And in case you didn't realize yet, KILL BILL is not to be taken seriously. The convoluted and ridiculous plot line is only an excuse for powerful visual action scenes and dialogue.<br/><br/>The movie is not shot in chronological order and starts with B&W footage of The Bride gasping in the church floor covered with blood after the wedding shooting and receiving the final bullet in the head from Bill. This moment is followed by the music cue of Nancy Sinatra's Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) which is one of the many interesting choices Tarantino made for the soundtrack. In VOLUME ONE's climatic battle between The Bride and O-Ren-Shi, Santa Esmeralda's Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood plays with all the Spanish beats setting the perfect tone for the scene. When we first meet California Mountain Snake, Bernard Herrman's Twisted Nerve whistling tune plays adding a much needed sense of humor.<br/><br/>VOLUME ONE is, without doubt, the goriest film to ever receive an R-ranting by the MPAA, surpassing 1971's TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE. Over 90 people are mutilated, sliced, and diced like meat. Every time someone looses a limb, blood is sprayed like it was coming from a water sprout. In the volume's most impressive scene (Which just happens to be animated) we learn the back-story of Cottonmouth and see how she witnessed her parents' murder as a child by a Yakuza crime boss and later killed him at the age of eleven. The animie moment has tons of blood sprayed all over the screen and the entire audience remained silent. If Tarantino had shot that moment as a live-action flashback, an NC-17 sticker would have been quickly welcomed.<br/><br/>VOLUME ONE follows The Bride as she travels to Tokyo and acquires her sword from sword-maker Hattori Hanzo (an excellent cameo by ex-action hero Sonny Chiba) and gets her first taste of revenge by confronting O-Ren-Shi. The climatic fight takes place in a two-floor restaurant called House Of Blue Leaves. That is when the movie's heart-pounding moments begin. The Bride has a sword-fight with over 88 henchmen and, of course, wins (amazing considering her legs were paralyzed over a month before.) Then there is the individual fight with O-Ren-Shi's bodyguard GoGo Yubari, (Chiaki Kuriyama from the controversial BATTLE ROYALE) a Japanese schoolgirl that carries a steel cannonball as a weapon. Prepare yourself for GoGo's sub-climatic fight with The Bride, the film's most visually impressive moment. The climatic fight with O-Ren-Shi takes place in a snowy Japanese garden and it leads to the open ""to be continued..."" ending that will leave the audience gasping for more after the final revelation.<br/><br/>Since I already stated this is a style over substance popcorn flick with a brain, does that mean the acting is flat? Uma Thurman doesn't play The Bride, she IS The Bride. She has the most powerful presence during the entire projection. And all of this is because of her break-trough performance: Not a dramatic one, but a physical one. Equally stunning is David Carradine as Bill. He only appears for three minutes in VOLUME ONE, but his presence is felt all the way. In 2001, Francois Ozon made a movie called 8 FEMMES where eight women confronted themselves because of a recently recently killed man they were all involved with. That man only appeared for two seconds in the movie, but you could feel his presence through the entire projection. Same thing with Carradine here. We only see his hands holding a sword, but you can just feel Bill. The remaining cast all deliver their best over-the-top performances very well, with Daryl Hannah being deliciously over the top (In a good way) as California Mountain Snake, a deadly assassin with one beautiful blue eye.<br/><br/>Did I just spoil the entire movie? No, not really. The trailer already shows you most of the scenes with the blood being digitally removed.  Does that mean you should go see KILL BILL because of the grindhouse Lucio Fulci-like gore?  No, KILL BILL is not just about blood-splattering fights, hot chicks, or character development. It is a movie about cinema. A movie on movies. The entire thing takes place in the world of movies. A world where everything is colorful. A world where you can easily escape a hospital. A world where you can cure yourself from paralyzed legs using brainpower. A world where woman are considered equally superior to men and have a similar killing spree wish. A world where characters take incredible amounts of damage and still stand up like nothing happened. A world where a woman who just woke up from a coma can defeat 100 highly trained villains.<br/><br/>

"Blade_Le_Flambeur","Null","0","0","20 October 2003"," A fun, energetic, creative film, possibly Tarantino's best
","The story of 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is simple. The Bride/ Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) is murdered at her wedding. Thought to be dead at first, she wakes up after a coma four years after the incident. Through out Tarantino's super- charged first volume of the film, she basically goes around seeking revenge on those who betrayed her. The supporting cast features Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu, and Sonny Chiba. Each cast member does fine in their respective roles, especially Thurman who manages to make the role seem realistic, and she also did well in her more emotional scene(s). The cinematography by Veteran director of photography Robert Richardson is beautiful to look at. The fight scenes are totally convincing, and the change to black and white flashback and at one point, an anime scene completely fits the film. Quentin Tarantino's screen- play is mostly filled with brutal fights and Japanese speaking, which is a bit surprising. Usually Tarantino's dialogue is the key element to his films, but it seems there will be a lot more to come in the February release of Volume 2. The direction by Tarantino is as the title of this review mentions: energetic and creative. It's definitely a throw- back to Kung Fu films, but Tarantino adds his own style here and there, making the film a blast to watch. The violence is often comical, especially since blood comes out of limbs like sprinklers. All in all, Kill Bill: Volume 1 is a must see. Solid performances, great direction, spectacular cinematography and more make this one very enjoyable movie experience. 9.75/10"

","Tarantino does it again!  As much as I want to hate the man (well, I do, in fact, hate the MAN--just not his movies) he is a phenomenally gifted film-maker.  Kill Bill Vo. 1 is clearly the work of someone in thrall to movies.  One of the reviews herein states that Tarantino hasn't the guts to go all the way and make an exploitation movie, but I think that comment slightly misses the mark.  I think he sees the potential in exploitation and uses it as a platform from which to create beauty and art--even though said art might contain elements one doesn't normally associate with beauty (cruelty, gore, coarseness, venality).  I think his use of Brechtian distancing is quite appropriate and really very funny.  Sure, one is always aware that this is ""just a movie""--that's part of the point. Not the entire point, however, or Kill Bill would not be such an emotional movie.  I found moments of the movie nearly unbearable--and they weren't the violent ones.  The moment in which Uma Thurman discovers a child has witnessed a violent act is not staged for comedy but for pathos, and it achieves this in the simplest way:  with silence, with stillness.  The overhead shot when The Bride walks away from the child across the cereal-strewn kitchen floor is absolutely beautiful.  And Thurman's sobbing when she wakes from her coma--how can anyone not respond to that?  (Though the director wisely cuts it short for an amusing ""play dead"" gag, it is a strong moment--and an important moment in that it evokes just enough sympathy to put us squarely on The Bride's side.  We know nothing about her--she might be the ""bad guy""--but Tarantino knows we have to root for her, or his film is meaningless.) But for all my pontificating, I'm neglecting to say that Kill Bill is, above all else, really quite funny.  The violence is over the top (another distancing trick) so as not to actually offend, and it becomes comic.  The Bride's thirst for revenge is not played for laughs, but the vengeance itself is.  Who can be upset over literal geysers of blood?  (This is a good place to add that the stage blood is very well done--it may spill and shoot and erupt more than it might in real life, but it does look real--not always the case in a violent film.)  The film's single funniest moment is Uma Thurman throwing on a pair of sunglasses to ""disguise"" herself (like the blood-soaked hospital gown and the two corpses nearby wouldn't be cause for suspicion).  The entire cast has the slightly stylized speech rhythms down, and everyone gets their comic moment.  Daryl Hannah makes up for a LOT of bad performances just by playing it hyper-straight, and therefore making her scene one of the comic high points of the film (it helps if you're a DePalma fan--as I am--to access all the humor Tarantino throws into this entire hospital room sequence).  And Chiaki Kuriyama is the scariest/funniest villain we've seen in quite awhile.  It's a smart performance--she can play Go-Go utterly straight (and very scary!) and still fit into the fabric of the movie because the sight of her swinging her chain while dressed in a schoolgirl uniform is deadpan comedy.  And Uma Thurman is an absolute revelation:  she should work with Tarantino more often, they seem to ""get"" each other, or at least what the other one is looking for and capable of onscreen.  She has to jump from sorrow to anger to humor (she definitely sees what's funny about all this killing) and every other emotion in the human spectrum often very quickly.  It is a performance so completely rounded, you know it can only be the result of so much hard work.  And unlike, say, a DeNiro or Streep, we don't see the research.  She is remarkably open--the emotions just come pouring out of her--kind of like all that blood."
"dcobbimdb","Null","0","0","17 October 2003"," Kung Fu - Tarantino Style
","This might be my new favorite Tarantino movie with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs being my previous favorites.  I've always liked kung fu movies and Tarantino's directing / movie making style, so when I knew he was coming out with his own kung fu flick, I just said `Tarantino, don't let me down.'  Well he most certainly didn't let me down!<br/><br/>This film rocks!  It's very inline with his directing cinematography style you've come to expect from Tarantino, a movie made up of short stories or segments that are somewhat out of sync in terms of a timeline.  Kill Bill isn't nearly as bad as pulp fiction as far as jumping around.  The only complaint I have is that you pretty much know who's gonna win in the end because it's given away early in the film.  It's another Tarantino trait which does take some of the suspense out near the end, but it's certainly made up for with the over the top blood spewing and genuine action of the fight scenes.<br/><br/>The story is all about a woman (Uma Thurman) who is nearly killed by the Viper Assassination Squad for reasons which I either missed or they didn't explain.  Anyway she after a 4 year comma comes back to avenge the 5 people who tried to kill her.  The first movie (there's a part two coming out next year) is about the first two people on the list.<br/><br/>The martial arts in this movie is great.  Very little CGI if any which I'm glad of cause it just ruins a movie in my opinion.  There is some `Crouching tiger hidden dragon' wire jumping, but not enough to annoy you (thank god). But probably the most notable thing about the fight scenes is the blood spewing from chopped off limbs, ect.  It's hilariously over the top, but magically doesn't detract from the excitement and seriousness of the fight scenes itself.  I'll bet they used 100+ gallons of fake blood in the movie. I sure hope Uma Thurman got paid overtime for this as she definitely earned it.<br/><br/>Cinematography is second to none as Tarantino makes use of normal, black and white, cartoon, and even a black light simulated scenes.  His use of music is similar to what he's done in the past with his 70's style that strangely enough seem to fit every moment of the film.  His thoughtfulness and attention to detail amazes me.  I hope when he passes on he donates his brain to science as he's the Rembrandt of movie making.<br/><br/>In closing, I'd say definitely see this movie if you either like marital arts, Tarantino, or woman power.  And for those of you who think he might ruin the seriousness of true Kung fu movies won't be disappointed as he doesn't (in my opinion) dishonor the spirit of them.  Only reason I can think of for not seeing it is if you are really squeamish about blood. Can't wait for part II!"

","Excellent. This will finish a close second to Lord of the Rings:Return of the King.<br/><br/>Kill Bill blows away everything that has been put out this year and will be put out until LOTR.<br/><br/>This is an example of how to carefully put together a great action movie. I'd suggest all the idiots involved in the Matrix franchise ask Quentin for his advice before releasing anymore of their crap. Kill Bill won't be challenged by anything from the action genre for many years.

","Tarantino has returned, this time with a kung-fu revenge story that's probably the most innovative movie of the year. <br/><br/>I won't go into plot detail or even an inkling of what the movie is about. I will simply say that Kill Bill isn't your average 2 hour, $8.50 movie that you'll yawn your way through and smile when you see the credits at the end. Instead, you'll be captivated by the many twists and turns and illegal amounts of blood used in this movie. The acting is all top notch, the fight scenes are reminiscent of pretty much every good kung-fu movie you've ever seen, and the music is well...interesting for this type of flick. Many people say this movie was a flop, why? Because it didn't have guns and briefcases in it? I say go and see this movie, not once but twice. There is plenty candy for the eye, and no I don't mean a scantily clad Uma Thurman or Lucy Liu(although, having either one of them scantily clad for even a scene wouldn't have hurt the movie). This is a movie that I believe will give my beloved Matrix:Reloaded a run for it's money at the next award show, in my opinion, it has already won Best Cinematography, Best Directing, Best Supporting Cast...Best Fight Scene will be the big showdown between Kill Bill and The Matrix."

","Before going on to the many good things I have to say about Kill Bill, I have to state what undoubtedly has been stated many times before:  I hate the fact that this has been split into two movies.  Yes, I know it means we get two great movies, but as one whole movie, this could have been an all-time classic.  As it is, it is essentially half a movie, and therefore Return Of The King will likely ensure that, for the third year in a row, Lord Of The Rings gets the position of film of the year.  However, its a good thing that you are left desperate to see Volume 2.  I could have sat straight on and watched the next movie right away, I was completely absorbed in this movie.<br/><br/>The audience is treated to a fantastic opening, shot in black and white, where we are treated to a close-up view of the mangled face of The Bride (Uma Thurman).  From the moment we hear a voice calmly say ""Do you find me sadistic?"" we know we are in the world of Quentin Tarantino, with ""Bang Bang"" by Nancy Sinatra perfectly fitting with the opening credits.<br/><br/>Then things are turned on their head, as a fast-paced fight scene between the Bride and housewife/assassin Vernita Green warms up the audience for a good hour of slow-paced (but completely necessary) exposition.  The plot of the movie, trying to spoil as little a possible, centres on Uma Thurman's character, known only as The Bride, since her name is quite bizarrely bleeped out whenever she speaks.  On her wedding day, Bill (David Carradine) and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad of Elle Driver, Budd, O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green (Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, Lucy Liu and Vivicia C. Fox respectively) slaughter everyone at the wedding, with only her surviving, albeit after being put in a coma by a bullet to the head.  Naturally, she wakes up rather p**sed, and makes out a death list, planning to kill the 5 people who have wronged her one by one, with Bill being last on the list. Her ultimate mission, therefore, is to KILL BILL.  Get it?  This Volume focuses on her settling the score with Vernita Green (the opening fight) and, for the rest of the film, O-Ren Ishii, with the complication being that O-Ren moonlights as the queen of the Japanese underworld, and has a small army of henchmen at her disposal.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty much that simple and follows this basic formula:<br/><br/>Bride VS Vernita - Backstory - Bride VS O-Ren<br/><br/>In chronological order, that would be:<br/><br/>Backstory - Bride VS O-Ren - Bride VS Vernita<br/><br/>So far, so Tarantino.  But as much as you can tell that Tarantino made this film, it is essentially different from his other movies.  Being an homage to his beloved cheesy samurai kung-fu flicks, this is, essentially, a cheesy samurai kung-fu flick, and in the hands of an inferior director, probably would have sucked.  But somehow, it just works, despite the surreal moments (Daryl Hannah whistling to the soundtrack that's playing) and corny happenings (EXTREME close-ups of Uma's eyes and, at one point, her toes). The movie is, as you've likely heard, very gory.  But this isn't shocking, war movie gore, this is ridiculous samurai gore.  This means that a head is cut off, and is followed by geysers of blood that pump away hard enough to hit the ceiling.  Nevertheless, it may prove too much for the squeamish - one of the people I was with had to leave the cinema because of all the gore, and that was just from watching the anime sequence, which admittedly never would have been allowed past the censors if it had been live action.<br/><br/>The acting is all spot-on.  Lucy Liu serves well as the villain of the piece, acting as a very effective diversionary villain before the real showdown with Bill in Volume 2.  Despite her tragic backstory, her sheer ruthlessness prevents you from sympathising with her.  Nevertheless, she is an unbelievably cool villainess, with a scene involving what she does when the taboo subject of her half Japanese - half Chinese origin and American upbringing is mentioned destined to be another Tarantino classic, this is easily the best role of Lucy Liu's career.  Vivicia C. Fox does well in the smaller role of Vernita, appearing to be a perfectly nice person apart from the fact that she helped murder the Bride.<br/><br/>Then there are the characters we only get a taster of.  We see too little of Budd to make any real judgement of Madsen's performance, but we can assume that he is going to be a killer with a conscience, rather than a 2-dimensional thug.  Daryl Hannah certainly looks older than she did when last in the limelight, but that suits the character of the eye-patch wearing Elle Driver better.  In the scene that we see Elle, we can safely assume that she's a twisted, vindictive cow.  I personally look forward to seeing her burn in Volume 2.  And then there's Bill.  The fact that we never see his face in the movie, only his ringed hand, means that he quickly gains a Blofeld-like mystique.  We reportedly get to see much more of him in Volume 2, which is good, because I think he's shaping up to be a great villain.<br/><br/>But the real plaudits have to go to Uma Thurman.  Tarantino was right to wait for her, I can't imagine anybody else as The Bride.  Uma handles the role to perfection, whether it be in downbeat emotional scenes, such as when she wakes up from he coma, or in fight scenes kicking-ass - case in point, The Showdown At The House Of Blue Leaves, arguably the best swordfight I have ever seen, and a battle which makes a mockery out of The Matrix Reloaded's Burly Brawl.  If there was any justice in this world, Uma Thurman would win, or at least get nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, as I believe she has created what will prove to be an enduring pop-culture icon. However, there is no justice in the world, and Kill Bill will be ignored by the Academy because its not to their taste.  Don't worry, Uma, we love you.<br/><br/>THE VERDICT:  The one thing that stops the movie getting full marks is that it's not a complete movie.  Essentially, with most of the plot (apart from the fantastic climactic battle) being exposition, this feels like an extended preview for Volume 2.  If that is the case, then it has done its job, as I am desperate for the next installment.  If it is as good as this, I'm sure we'll be looking at Kill BIll having full marks as an overall package. 9/10"

","Will save you all from yet another summary of the movie.<br/><br/>I was pleasantly surprised how much japanese involvement in this film from on and off the screen.<br/><br/>It is apparent that Quentin loves Japanese culture and Bruce Lee. Uma as Billy Lo, Bruce Lee's character in Game of Death where she wears a similar yellow jumpsuit and takes on the japanese underworld.  Not per se a remake of Game of Death, but borrowing, since this Vol.1 does not reveal the whole story, we have a non-linear partial story of ""Black Mamba"", with much of Quentin's campy characters, dialogue and cinematic vision and cool retro soundtrack.<br/><br/>Uma is surprisingly quite convincing as a ""caucasian girl playing with samurai sword"" rough quote from Lucy Liu's character in the final fight.<br/><br/>The action choreographer Woo-ping Yuen(Crouching Tiger, Matrix,etc) has done a stunning job of making Uma look super good in all the swordplay and despite the gruesome carnage, were spectacular to watch and behold. Though I don't totally agree that the audience is to expect all these amputations as unbelievable or cartoon violence, I cannot completely desensitize myself from these horrific images. And if you don't find some of it horrific, I am glad I am not in your high school or go to your post office!<br/><br/>Oddly, most of the story was really about O-Ren Ishii(Lucy Liu) with much of it in animi and the eventually showdown. Go Go Yubari is a great distraction!<br/><br/>Chapter 3: The Man from Okinawa was the best vignette!!<br/><br/>Conspiracy Theory: Could this movie have the subversive undertone that Black Mamba(aka Bruce Lee) gets revenge on Bill(David Carradine)....for stealing his role in the 70's Kung Fu series that Bruce actually wrote the concept for, but the movie execs could never see a real asian actor play? If in Vol 2, there is a tight face shot of Uma with a clenched face and the sound of Bill's neck breaking, I will tend to agree.<br/><br/>Rating: Film Fan 9/10 Movie Critic:7.5/10 Action/Gore Fan: 10/10"

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the scene where she emerged from her coma, only to weep in grief and horror at the loss of her baby.<br/><br/>Although primarily a Martial Arts Tale, it is the rage that poured forth from this moment that defined the sage.

"g1ao","Null","0","0","18 October 2003"," Retrotastic movie, Tarantino delivers!*SPOILERS
","I can almost - almost - guarantee that this film is not what you'll be expecting, and therein lies it's truer potency; an assurance that it can be included in the pantheon of one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces that this decade has so far seen. Tarantino draws from an eclectic range of different cinematic devices that help to lend the film a retroistic, jazz funked kind of coolness. Interspersed amongst the luridly coloured, incredibly sharp cinematic visuals are extreme moments of manga gore that help to underline the films powerfully self referential nature. Uma Thurmans yellow and black striped catsuit is of course a motif redolent of Bruce Lee's Game Of Death, and fans of the now sadly deceased master of martial arts will not fail to notice the similarity between this films closing scenes and those of - respectively - Fist Of Fury and Way Of The Dragon. There is scant characterisation in this film, and any details that we do learn about the films main protagonists or antagonists are revealed either through aforementioned cartoon flashbacks or statistical data such as you might find in a console game: In other words don't go watching this film for oscar winning character performances! The fragmented, postmodernised plot is almost film noir and will keep you guessing, and the setpieces are as good as anything you'll see in a Jackie Chan or a Jet Li movie. Thurman plays the ice queen with panache and the soundtracks are used to good effect to underline the films constantly swinging, transient mood. The cinematography is well observed with switches from neon, psychedelic crisp visuals to noirish moments clearly drawn from classic Japanese cinema. But it's not action from start to finish; rather the opening and climactic scenes serve as action quotation marks, the intermediary scenes functioning to flesh out background and character. Even if you're not a Tarantino fan and even if you have no real knowledge - (or interest) - in the genre that this film references, this film is worth a look on the virtue of its vision and originality alone: it doesn't feel like Hollywood; it doesn't feel plastic and in a world seemingly dominated by lifeless, bland sequels, this film makes a refreshing change!"
"MATTAN3","Null","0","0","17 October 2003"," What a gas!!
","Unlike a certain response I read here - which so happens to be the only one I bothered with - I have to say that this movie is a masterpiece of pulp fiction, as only Quentin Tarantino could provide.  Not only has he included a litany of old-school film references, but he's managed to invoke, with skill and purpose, the spirit of the old Hong-Kong action flicks that I used to stay up until two a.m. to watch on Cinemax.  The anime sequence that introduces O-Ren-Ishii is breathtaking to watch, when you realize that it was drawn rather than acted.  Again, in a story that should have few, there are many questions, questions which have answers that will bring us in droves to the opening of Vol. II.  Make no mistake, I am no Quentin fanboy. His script for Natural Born Killers was absolute garbage, and Jackie Brown had moments, nothing more.  I went to this film expecting to be like Baumer, underwhelmed and overspent.  I wasn't.  What I ended up as was a smiling movie patron, perhaps ambivalent about the good that this film will do for the human race (none) but still full of anticipation for the next installement.  To those of you who find yourself predisposed to dislike this movie, don't be.  You'll miss out, even if you're paying attention."

The collective result of this hard-to-pull-off blend is what keeps your legs crossed, your butt on the seat's edge, and your perspective on its toes.  Cinematography was nothing short of breathtaking and the sound effects, especially those in the realm of all things guttural or the least bit moist, were extraordinarily palpable.  Dialogue was sharp, clever and economical.  Combat choreography was surprisingly exceptional - especially with the scene involving the rarely seen spike & chain.

","I didn't go all religious over it as I am expected to. The lack of content is not revolutionary, the recreations of other scenes are boring, the action is lame, the martial arts are not really, and the slaughter of asians wholesale for mindless fun doesn't appeal to me. Sorry to offend you! I didn't say anything about that, other than it doesn't appeal to me. If you've seen a movie by Fukasaku, Miike, either of the Kurosawa's, or Tsui Hark, or the movie miramax won't release, Zhang Yimou's Hero starring an actual martial artsist, Jet Li,why would you even care about this movie, which by the way opened at less b.o. than Once Upon a Time in Mexico, which no one celebrated?

","Quentin Tarrantino once spoke about the infamous scene from Reservoir Dogs in which Michael Madsen takes his knife to a cop's ear. In the final edit of that scene, the camera pans away, leaving us to listen to agonized screams. Mr. Tarrantino notes that test audiences were far less horrified by an early cut of the scene in which all of the gory details were shown.<br/><br/>Of course, a good film maker wouldn't have needed a test audience to tell him this. At least as far back as Hitchcock, they have understood that creating suspense is at least as much a matter of what you don't show as it of what you do. In Kill Bill, Mr. Tarrantino has manifestly failed to recall this lesson. Here we see not only the ear, but nearly every other human body part removed in full, blood-spraying glory.<br/><br/>While I wasn't particularly disturbed or offended by any of this, I did come away wondering what the point of it was. The violence here is so supersized that at times it threatens to consume the entire film. This is particularly felt in the film's patient, stylish and well-filmed climax, who's cutting edge is left dull by the numbing splatterfest that precedes it.<br/><br/>
Apparently, one popular explanation/justification for all this violence is that it is so intense that it eventually becomes comical. Well, maybe, but I think it really depends on your idea of what is funny. The Road Runner was violent, ha-ha funny. Monty Python's Black Knight was violent, ha-ha funny. Kill Bill is violent, I-can't-believe-someone-actually-put-that-on-film funny.<br/><br/>Then of course, there is the legions of QT fanboys who toss around words like 'homage' and 'pastiche' like so many throwing stars. ""Don't you get it? Three decapitations-per-minute is, like, a reference to old kungfu movies, see?""  Well, these people clearly have never actually watched any of the old Shaw Brothers films to which Kill Bill declares itself a paean. While certainly violent, those films were rarely more than slightly gory, if only because they lacked a $10 million budget for latex and fake blood.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, QT's mastery of exploiting the exploitation film is clearly evidenced in Kill Bill's plot, dialog, editing, and soundtrack.  But for my money, films like Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are still much better genre reinventions because their directors don't feel compelled to hide behind winking pop-postmodernism. I dunno, maybe I'm getting old, but Mr. Tarrantino's brand of irony just isn't doing it for me anymore."

","This movie has a very distinct style and tone, starting from the opening credits, all the way to the end. The violence and tabooness of killing a pregnant mother-to-be on her wedding day only makes you feel sympathy for the main character, and further enrages your emotions when she seeks revenge.<br/><br/>Story and cinematography are top notch, yet non homogeneous. Fight scenes are amazing and should make the Wachowski Brothers blush compared with their shrek-animation fight scenes. However, with the absence of music in some fight scenes made them feel awkward, but yet in a sense, very much more real. The anime sequence seemed out of place, and slow, yet at the same time gave Kill Bill a more comic book like feel (if that's what QT wanted then he accomplished it... if not, this sequence is better left out). This genre jumping is distinctly different, but is continuous with each person she pursues.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is distinctly unique. A slap in the face to the film industry. I give it a 7 and 1/2 out of 10."

","Spoilers <br/><br/>At times, ignorance is a blessing. Not having seen a single one of Tarantino's movies, I am free of any baggage that may impair my immersion in total enjoyment of the ride in Kill Bill. Specifically, I am not distracted by thoughts such as how KB is similar to Pulp Fiction, or different from Reservoir Dogs. There are more than enough movies that KB reminds one of anyway, from Game of Death (Bruce Lee's yellow sport outfit in a gender switch) to Matrix Reloaded (100 Agent Smiths turned Japanese), not to mention the Kinji Fukasaku's movies to which KB is paying tributes.<br/><br/>
The synopsis can be taken care of in a few words. The avenger (not to be confused with one of Uma Thurman's previous movie roles) works on a list of five, and in the process picks up a masterpiece of a Japanese sword from a grand master. At the end of this `volume 1' (which in turn consists of five `chapters'), the score is two down, three to go, plus an almost predictable hook. See you in a few months, folks.<br/><br/>The ride I thoroughly enjoyed, including the fights, the photography, the direction and the music, particularly the music. Just about every scene is accompanied by music that depicts the mood with uncanny accuracy. My choice for the top three, in order of appearance, are the following: the chilling tune (mainly whistled) at the attempted murder of The Bride lying unconscious in hospital, the tranquil accompaniment during the sword selection, and the exciting overture on the converging journeys to the House of Blue Leaves (the Bride in a plane; O-ren Ishii and her cohorts in a fleet of automobiles).<br/><br/>A few words on the cast and characters. Uma Thurman is well chosen and nothing further needs to be said. Lucy Lui's character received a lot of sympathy in this movie. The fate O-ren Ishii suffered was at least as tragic as The Bride's even though no loss of child was involved. She is the only adversary that The Bride respects. Legendary Sonny Chiba plays grand master Hattori Hanzo who wields a new blade for The Bride. In making the spectacular fantasy Storm Riders (1998), when Hong Kong moviemakers could not find a Chinese-speaking actor with sufficiently formidable presence to play the villain Conquer, they turned to Chiba. Twenty-year-old Chiaki Kuriyama plays the seventeen-year-old, mace-swinging, blood-chilling bodyguard in a schoolgirl look. Her choice seems obvious, as she was one of the most ruthless contestants in Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale. Two members of the cast we saw only a preview of. One is Daryl Hannah playing probably the most venomous of the vipers. The other is Gordon Liu (Tarantino's much admired Hong Kong top martial arts star) playing Johnny Mo, a Green Hornet look alike, but a villain. While Hannah will come back in Volume Two in continuation of her venomous activities, Liu will play a different character: Pei Mei, the Bride's teacher. <br/><br/>Finally, it is quite amusing to see the restricted rating worldwide. Any normal, mentally healthy teenager brought up with today's cinema world will only laugh his head off (deliberate choice of words) with the proliferation of severed limbs and explosive gushes of blood throughout the movie. Give them nightmares or make them violent grownups? Let's be serious. Better ban Roadrunner first."
"saska-3","8","0","0","19 October 2003"," Highly entertaining homage to martial arts films, short on story but long on style
","KILL BILL I is many things: a lovingly-researched homage to the Hong Kong action flicks of the modern era, a showcase for Uma Thurman, an example of beautiful production design, a fun popcorn flick with a little of the old ultra-violence thrown in to discourage the squeamish.  There are also many things it is not: a well-crafted story, a genius-level example of time-shifting narrative, two hours of witty repartee.<br/><br/>Knowing what it would not be going in, and also knowing what it was supposed to be, helped me manage my expectations.  Wo Ping's fight choreography is becoming so well-known in America that some of the sequences here will be familiar to the audience as more than just homage - specifically, a few look recycled.  Tarantino's time spent lingering on his heroine and her prey in staring matches tends to dissipate the tension rather than increasing it. In addition, his penchant for showing the narrative out of order is unnecessary here, and further drains the story of the buildup that's part of the joy of revenge tales.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was how much quick-cut editing happened in the fight scenes.  From reading interviews, it appears Uma Thurman was up to the task of the long sequences, and that she pulled them off.  Many times, I wished for a longer take, a better opportunity to see the grace of the martial artists working through their moves.<br/><br/>Even so, this was a fun time.  The anime sequence is beautifully drawn and compelling.  Since the beginning of film, animation has been used to show us stories that would be too horrific and graphic in live action, and it works very well here.  The over-the-top violence and gore are laughable at the right moments, as they were in PULP FICTION - giving the audience a collective moment of reprieve just when the tension is at its highest.  Uma Thurman shows flashes of better acting than I'd seen her do in the past, most often when she's not speaking.  And to be fair, while the stare-downs are buzzkillers, I appreciated the moments of wary sizing-up that happened in the middle of fights - this is more like what a real fight to the death would feel like.  Characters are given a moment to contemplate whether their next move will be their last.  Music is used well, as in Tarantino's previous efforts.<br/><br/>KILL BILL I earns an 8/10 for me based on how much fun I had.  The real verdict won't be in until the story concludes, however."
"klesker","8","0","0","19 October 2003"," A welcome Change
","As everyone knows, Tarantino is known for his crime movies, quirky dialogue and foul language. Which is why, with his forth movie, a radical change to what his usual work is is a welcome sight.<br/><br/>I never had my doubts that this would be a good movie. I'm am a huge fan of Quentin and i will remain so for many years to come. More so with this movie as he has proved that he is a director that can work on a bigger canvas.<br/><br/>This is not his best movie. I still think that Jackie Brown is his best and proves that he can mature with the right material. Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were both fantastic films but with it's twisting plot and fantastic style and grace Jackie Brown takes the crown.<br/><br/>
Plot was the only major downside to Kill Bill. But what it lacks in structure it makes up for in style and acting. I never seen an actor be so good in this film as when Kevin Spacey played Verbal Kint in The Usual Suspects. Uma Thurman i salute you. Her breathtaking performance was enough to make me pitty her despite the fact that mercy does not exist when she's around.<br/><br/>Despite it's sheer greatness this will definately not appeal to a large percentage of the audience. If you are squeemish then this is not the film for you. The end half hour is a relentless battle between Thurman and 100 of Lucy Lui's henchmen. So relentless in fact that the majority of it is in black and white to tone down the violence.<br/><br/>This is very true to the genre though. If there wasn't that amount of blood when being hacked apart with a samurai sword then it would look unrealistic. It is true to the genre but it has a very Tarantino feel to it. Stylisticly the man has matured in the six years he's been away. We have one fight in black and white, one done in sillohette and one flashback scene told entirely in Japanese anime. This is done by a man who knows what he is doing and is not afraid to show it off.<br/><br/>It may not be his best but it is certainly one of the best films of the year. It has emotion, style, blood (by the bucket load), and a tremendous cast that bring the entire thing to life. In the hands of a lesser director this movie would have fallen at the first hurdle but with the driving force of Quentin Tarantino behind the wheel, we have been presented with an awe inspiring masterpiece.<br/><br/>5/5"
"jaesboxer","Null","0","0","18 October 2003"," Reinvented Tarantino
","Kill Bill is nothing short of remarkable.  Nine years after Pulp Fiction, director Quentin Tarantino's fourth film is a wonderful narcotic. Personally, I think Tarantino, though great as a director, is limited in his writing ability.  I know there are many who would disagree, but all three of his films share a general form of dialogue, a sort of hip-70's retro talk that grows old by Jackie Brown.  But in Kill Bill, the dialogue is at a minimum and I couldn't be happier.  Here, Tarantino pays brilliant homage to the chop socky films of Sonny Chiba (here appearing as a master swordmaker) and the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone.  Uma Thurman is flawless in her role.  The fight scenes, in their sheer brutality and obvious choreography, beat the Matrix all to hell.  Limbs fly and fountains of blood follow.  A cool comic interlude allows Tarantino to voice his inner bloodloving child in a series of bloody encounters.  This film is Tarantino's most enjoyable work, and without the dull 70's dialogue, the experience is enriched by the raw force.  Cannot wait for Vol. 2."
"Ziman","9","0","0","18 October 2003"," Tarantino is a genius... another masterpiece.
","As the trailer and the opening credits will tell you, this is the 4th film by Quentin Tarantino.  Granted he has had other projects other than just four, but this is his fourth that he has written and directed himself.<br/><br/>
Kill Bill: Vol.1 is the first half of an epic story about a woman, `The Bride' (codename Black Mamba) who was gunned down at her own wedding by the mysterious and apparently powerful (and yet unseen) `Bill'.  The Bride, as she is affectionately credited (and her actual name is bleeped out for dramatic affect) survives the gunshot and comes back with a vengeance to do nothing else short of  `kill bill'.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino grew up watching samurai movies and serials.  He has admitted on several occasions that they were partly responsible for inspiring him to make movies in the first place and that he has aspired to make a modern-day samurai movie.  Kill Bill is that movie.<br/><br/>Kill Bill: Vol.1 is nothing short of brilliant filmmaking.  It has the `pulpy' feel of Pulp Fiction (dare I say pulpier?).  It contains some of the brute violence (some say gore) of Reservoir Dogs, and is even influenced (admittedly) from a number of external sources and including Japan's Shadow Warriors series, old spaghetti-westerns, and there is even an exceptional Anime sequence right in the middle.<br/><br/>What's interesting to note is that all of these influences are often times so clichéd within their own genre, one wonders how anyone could attempt to make a movie with those elements without being one big cliché in and of it self.  The fact that Tarantino is a genius (to partially quote my friend Rene) makes it possible for him to pull it off WITHOUT feeling like we've seen this movie a dozen times already.<br/><br/>In Kill Bill: Vol.1 Tarantino also has the knack of being able to push the realm of reality a tad over the top but somehow not leaving us in disbelief or disgust.  Rather we are left in awe. His heroes (or heroines as the case may be) are not perfect and not without flaw, and we can at times see them falter, and I think that is what brings it down a notch from ridiculous.<br/><br/>Of course, Kill Bill: Vol.1 is packed with pre-existing music that only Taratino could accurately select and incorporate perfectly into his scenes. With perfectly choreographed action sequences and a haunting soundtrack to boot, you'll almost feel like you're watching a dance rather than a duel (In fact, on my second viewing, both my girlfriend and I were BOTH tapping our feet to the music) None-the-less, there is no shortage of pain, sweat, and blood to re-enforce that this is a brutal battle.<br/><br/>Personally, I haven't enjoyed going out to a night at the movies in a very long time as much as I had in going to see Kill Bill: Vol.1. In fact, it took me two-viewings to ensure I could be accurately inspired to write this review.  People only mildly impressed by Tarantino in the past may feel the same about Kill Bill, however, anyone who truly recognizes and appreciates his work, will enjoy Kill Bill to its fullest.<br/><br/>(NOTE: Volume 2 is expected to be completed this February.  Let's refrain from calling it a sequel, shall we?)"

I had no idea this movie had animation in it.  I have never watched a Quentin Taratino film before, but I must say this was a pleasant surprise to have all of my favorite movie types included into one picture.  Vivica A. Fox didn't last too long in this one, but I guess she will be back in the second part in flashbacks.  I also hear Daryl Hanna is going to get it in the next film along with of course Bill himself.  And she will also find out her daughter is still alive.  Very interesting...  They don't even mention that when she's in the hospital.  We all just assumed that she had lost the baby.  But, I tell these circumstances only occur it the movies.  To have the tar beat out of you when you are pregnant and then be shot and still survive and make a comeback the way the Bride does is totally amazing.  I heard that Taratino was obsessed with Kung-Fu films when he was growing up as a kid, thus we have Kill Bill Volumes I & II + Samuri Swords, a whole lot of asian looking people and a bunch of blood and gor, but it's not horror movie blood and gor.

","Kill Bill is a strange mixture of styles that is inconsistently entertaining. Roger Ebert once said ""few movies have as many good scenes as Pulp Fiction.""  I would say that few movies have as many good AND bad scenes as Kill Bill.<br/><br/>I liked a lot of things in this movie. Several scenes were very well done, including the bar scene with the master sword maker and the reluctant saki maker, the fight with the ball-and-chain-wielding schoolgirl, and the anime flashback of O-Ren's childhood.<br/><br/>The problem with the good scenes is they aren't supported by any of the other scenes in the movie.  I would have appreciated some stylistic consistency. The strength of Tarantino's earlier movies is that they never lost sight of the progression of the story or the development of the characters. In Kill Bill, I felt like each scene existed in its own world. There wasn't even a sense of rising tension towards the climactic scenes at the end. Things just happened one after the other as she crosses another enemy off her hit list.<br/><br/>Like many other people who have seen the movie, I felt that there was just too much in the movie. One extended plane scene would have been enough. Many fight scenes towards the end drag on and on as Black Mamba chops up guard after guard when we really want to see the big guys fight it out. Also, too much of the action is focused on swordplay. With the exception of one or two fights, there is none of the energy and movement of other movies in the genre that I really enjoyed such as Enter the Dragon or Legend of Drunken Master."

"starlit-sky","8","0","0","15 October 2003"," Here comes the disappointment from Tarantino
","Kill Bill Vol. 1<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's 4th film, Kill Bill, is a story of revenge that is quite stylistic in terms of fighting scenes but lacks a story that stirs up the emotions of revenge in the audience. It starts with a Klingon proverb from the movie, Star Trek II, The Wrath of Khan: `The revenge is a dish best served cold' The movie doesn't waste time heating things up. First, we get a glimpse of Umma Thurman's character severely beaten face, a sound of shotgun (which supposedly should have blown her head off) and we skip to the part where Umma's character starts to take revenge from the people who did her wrong. As we go along, we are introduced to the characters of Deadly Viper Assassination Squad through flashbacks.<br/><br/>This kind of backward storytelling, where we start from the end and gradually move back in time through flashbacks may work for other themes. Sadly, it doesn't work for a movie about revenge. By the time,  we get to know what has gone wrong between characters, the revenge part has already taken place and the movie is over. When we are watching Umma's character killing her enemies, we do not feel anything. I admit that every scene is very stylish, especially the fighting scenes. However, without establishing any familiarity towards the characters, the scenes are simply unable to create any emotion. This, I found to be the biggest problem with Kill Bill Vol 1. One might say that the real revenge will take place between Urma's character (Black Mamba) and Bill later, in the Volume 2, and by the time we get to see that happen we will have been acquinted with every little detail about the events that led to it. Even if this is true, the Kill Bill Volume 1 would remain to be a movie where an unknown character is taking revenge from her unknown assailants from the past. The fact still remains: we do not know enough about either Urma or her assailants to feel the slightest emotion for either one of them.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino was apparently influenced by the old time Chinese Kung-Fu movies and wanted to make a movie where he pays his due respect to those old classics that led him to directing movies in the first place. He does add his own style and humor to what is already a well-established, a distinctive genre of film-making. Nevertheless, a movie where you know so little about the characters is doomed for failure. If you are interested in seeing a very-well shot martial arts movie (Kung-Fu combats and sword-fight scenes) embellished with super neat camera angles, choreography, music and editing, then Kill Bill might be just your movie. If you are expecting more than that, then it will probably disappoint you. If you want to watch a good revenge movie, I would simply recommend First Blood/Rambo. You will find yourself take side with Rambo against the evil small town cop. And when Rambo kicks ass, you will cheer for him as hero and take pleasure in the pain of his enemy, something you will not experience in Kill Bill Vol 1."

","Tarantino resembles a politician that votes against his constituency once _their_ votes  have put him in office.  It is _us_ that praised him after the Shakespearian ""Reservoir Dogs"", after the  sophisticated yet lively ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/> Sadly, ""Kill Bill"" is just an extension of its own trailer. And its entirety is just a trailer for  the Volume 2 (after all there's 8 bucks left in some of our pockets).<br/><br/> It's spectacular to watch but, from the soul's point of view, has no nutritional value.<br/><br/> This movie contains hundreds of winks to other movies, comic strips, cartoons and  whole cultural genres.

","This movie brings out a theme that Quentin Tarantino has hinted at before: don't make women mad, because they will kill you. He is also paying tribute to several martial arts movies of the past: Five fingers Of Death, Five Deadly Venoms, Game Of Death,and many different samurai  movies. He is also giving nods to different directors: Hitchcock, in particular, with his camera placement during key scenes.<br/><br/>It is obvious that Tarantino places Bruce Lee in high regard, because he has no less than 3 tributes to him in this movie: the yellow workout suit with black piping worn by the Bride, the Kato masks worn by the Crazy 88s, and the playing of the Green Hornet theme during a car/motorcycle ride (the idea of one person holding off a rival army could also be seen as a nod to The Dragon).<br/><br/>The action, the fights, and the over-the-top violence mark this movie as a definite ""R""(although I'm sure it could have gotten an ""X"" for violence not too long ago).<br/><br/>I had a great time watching this movie, and can't wait to see the 2nd half next year."

"reyashines","Null","0","0","14 October 2003"," can't believe I got a sitter so I could go see this
","To be blunt, this film is one of the worst I've ever seen.<br/><br/>
I enjoy Tarantino's work, and really wanted to like this movie. However, Kill Bill has major flaws:<br/><br/>1 - Appalling lack of dialogue and narration. This movie went for incredibly long stretches of fight sequences and gore, allowing little time for the storytelling. What has made other Tarantino films work so well is that the storytelling was compelling and pulled together in a surprising way. This movie feels more like a vehicle for blood and action where the story had to find a way to be fit in around that. The story definitely seems like window-dressing for the action, whereas in other QT films, it seemed as though the action and gore were integral parts of the story.<br/><br/>2 - Limited appeal of the characters. While you feel sympathetic for the Bride and what she has endured, it is really hard to care about this character or any of the others. Really, they are not characters but are instead caricatures. I have so little interest in any of them that I have no desire to see Vol. II to find out why Bill tried to kill The Bride in the first place or if she gets her revenge on him.<br/><br/>3 - Unfocused editing. Quentin Tarantino must have sat in a room one day and said, `What's the most disgusting thing I can do in a film that will have the least amount of purpose? Wouldn't it be even better if I did it a dozen times?' If at least half the over-the-top fight scenes (preferably 75% of them) had been cut, maybe this Vol. 1/Vol. 2 nonsense wouldn't have been necessary. Someone should have stopped QT, because he apparently couldn't stop himself.<br/><br/>To call this film `genius' and `a masterpiece' really belittles films that are. An artist can defecate in a museum, but just because it came from an artist and is in a museum doesn't make it art. This is the case with Kill Bill."

Quentin Tarantino is as thrilling as ever, but he's never been this epic. The movie has Tarantino's trademark quirky humor, flip chronology, pop culture references, and buckets of blood. But this time he threw in the kitchen sink, including a pretty nifty anime sequence.<br/><br/>The film revolves around the Bride, a onetime assassin attacked by her old gang and left for dead on her wedding day. Awakening from a coma four years after the attack, the Bride decides to exact her revenge.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is the Bride, doing an excellent job with an extremely demanding role. Sonny Chiba also does great work as the Bride's martial arts mentor.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill: Vol.1"" 's longest, wildest, and funniest fight sequence takes place between the Bride and the Crazy 88s, an army of bodyguards in the employ of Lucy Liu's vicious assassin Cottonmouth. Blood spurts, limbs fly, and you won't believe your eyes.<br/><br/>Yet for all its gore, this is one beautiful and atmospheric work that is too breath-taking to feel like half a movie.

"SulphurMan","Null","0","0","13 October 2003"," Electrifying ""Kill Bill"" operates under its own (excellent) terms
","Quentin Tarantino's boldly proclaimed 4th film ""Kill Bill: Episode 1"" is a film that succedes on more levels than there are kung fu fighters in its majestic climax. It conquers its violent and surprisingly vacant subject matter with consistent doses of visual and sensory flourishes that co-exist seamlessly in a world where Mr. Tarantino has free reign over his ideas, and uses them to their most extreme and rewarding conclusions. Its violent, its mindless and you guessed it - its pure cinematic entertainment on a grade A level.<br/><br/>Before we go any further, lets jot it down for both good measure and vital importance: Quentin Tarantino has obviously got a thing for the world of motion pictures. Asian Kung-Fu flicks, Spaghetti Westerns and the gritty world of exploitation filmmaking are appropriate influences here, whilst big budget, objectively based, heart warming (and arguably maniuplative) epics are out. Unless youve lived under a *mutliplex* rock, you are probably familiar with his past features, films that focus on pulpy crime subject matter in a world of amoral, colofrul charecters who are no more than fanatsized creatures in the eternal planet of ""cool"". Kill Bill ambitiously takes this genre of filmmaking into the next era with a sense of reckless ambition and skill that pulsates each frame along at lightning fast rates, taking the viewer out for an experience once known as a night at the movies. Its important to note that rather than just recycling the similar dialogue based aspects that guided past efforts such as ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and the overlooked ""Jackie Brown"", Tarantino gives us a breather and brings us along for a trip into wall-to-wall action territory. ""Kill Bill"" marvelously does for action what ""Pulp Fiction"" did for dialogue: It re-invents the genre by giving it new life steeped in both classic film history and equally fierce independant ambition. Its definately a Tarantino type of film that doesnt scream the name like a broken record over and over again. Spielberg's and Scorcese's everywhere, take note.<br/><br/>
The plot of Kill Bill is...is...oh right, something about a bride who was left for dead, suddenly awakes and is out for vengeance, samurai style. The timeless yet firmly fixed and idealogically bankrupt plot structure provides the appropriate springboard for a trip into the previously mentioned genres of grindhouse filmmaking. Bringing an elemental yet still dignified approach to the main charecter (who's name is curiously bleeped out on screen) is Uma Thurman, the gen X femme fatale from 1994's massive Pulp Fiction. We get all the melodramatic conviction and endless energy of an actress taking a break from the cookie cutter assortment of predictable Hollywood roles set out for her and diving into a role with the possibility to really kick some butt. I knew this film was working when the supporting cast featured a refreshingly nice performance from Lucy Liu as O-Ren Oshi, a member of the DIVAS ensemble that takes top billing on a ""To Kill List"" devised by our heroine. The scenes involving her personal militia, herself and the bride will stand as some of Tarantino's best work for years to come. The cinematogrpahy, editing, charecter interaction, pacing, and the excellent soundtrack resound with a strong sense of achievement and purpose here, and you cant help but realize that youre sitting dangerously close to the edge of your seat for most of it. Besides, how many times can you REALLY say that you sat on the edge of your seat throughout your film going history? Im not talking about anticipating the films end either, Im talking about being stimulated on a visual level that seems completely assumed and natural. The kind that seem to have substance even if the plot isnt crying out for it with zealous self-righteous appeals. Its nice to experience this universe sometimes as opposed to the heavy, chin wagging, mind twitching CGI universe that landed a couple years ago.<br/><br/>If you are like this reviewer and youre not all that familiar with the film influences or genres being cited here, fear not and be thankful that you got an $8 crash cource in them rather than a late-fee ridden, year long excursion into your local blockbuster. Besides, sometimes its more enjoyable watching a skilled director distill these things for you than rummaging through the waste bin of important cinema. Its rare that Ill take style over substance, but in this case Im not going to deny it. Rather, I'll just sit back with the popcorn and gawk away at a film that knows how to achieve exactly what it sets out to mainly because it sets standards for itself that are precise and cliche, yet somehow fresh and entertaining. ""Kill Bill Volume 1"" works if you let it. This is a great film.<br/><br/>**** out of ****<br/><br/>Philip Jamieson, 2003 ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino Starring: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Vivica Fox and Daryl Hannah<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

I think that PULP was one of the twenty five best films of all time, and it took an immense amount of unique brilliance and talent to put it together, especially with the limited experience that Quentin had, at the time.  However, this one gives credibility to the second half of FROM DUST TILL DAWN, when the employees of the Mexican bar all suddenly become vampires.<br/><br/>After being shot in the head and left for dead, and after sitting in a car for six months and nursing her leg by herself despite the fact that doctors didn't think she'd ever walk again, little Uma Thurman single handedly takes on the two hundred best swordsmen in Japan.

If your thing is watching people get their heads and limbs cut off, then this film should make you happier than Michael Jackson at a LITTLE RASCALS festival.<br/><br/>RESERVOIR DOGS and JACKIE BROWN weren't bad, but comparing KILL BILL to PULP FICTION is seriously like putting KINDERGARTEN COP up against GONE WITH THE WIND.

","For fans of Hong Kong kung fu, Japanese samurai and yakuza, Italian westerns, and other disreputable (usually foreign) genres, Quentin Tarantino has fashioned an alternate universe in Volume 1 that will feel wonderfully familiar and comfortable, yet not without a host of constant surprises. He does it all with a cinematic flourish that is almost nonexistent in Hollywood anymore, which might explain why he had to go to China and Japan to do it. There isn't a single wasted shot or motion or edit in this film. Those of us who ""get it"" (and by that I mean those for whom it plugs right into the subconscious region of our brain) are immediately swept up in Quentin's world and taken along on a wild, gripping, compelling ride.<br/><br/>I would argue that Volume 1 marks the first true Asian/Hollywood film hybrid in that it represents a complete fusion of Asian and American sensibilities and styles. Moreso, I would argue, than ENTER THE DRAGON, THE YAKUZA, FACE/OFF, and THE MATRIX, to name a few you might suggest. For one thing, Tarantino is one American director who truly loves the Asian action genres he recreates here (anime, samurai, yakuza, kung fu, etc.) and has totally immersed himself in them. He has also surrounded himself with distinguished Hong Kong and Japanese collaborators, not to mention a Chinese crew. When he shoots Asian-style action, he gets it right (or almost right, which is still more than any other American filmmaker has managed to achieve). Nor does he ever stop to explain anything (as THE YAKUZA, admittedly, had to) or condescend to the American mall audience. He just says, ""Welcome to my world"" and plunges us all into it. Not everyone will want to take this ride nor will everyone understand its appeal, but some of us will need no map to follow it nor have to stop and ask for directions--the route is already imprinted in our subconscious."

","'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is the most violent movie made since Oliver Stone's 1994 blood soaked 'Natural Born Killers'.  Ironically, that film was written by Tarantino.  It is a well known fact that Tarantino has an on going feud with Stone over the way Tarantino thought Stone misdirected that film.  For some strange reason, there are amazing similarities between the way Tarantino directs KB and the way Stone directed NBK.  Unusual to say the least.  They both use ultra-violence that's over the top at times, animation mixed in with the live action and black and white is also used in both films.  A chuckle can also be had by the fact that both films are photographed by Robert Richardson.  <br/><br/>On another note, Stone admits that he went way over the top with NBK and I wonder if Tarantino will ever think and/or admit the same for KB.  I also have to question the legitimacy of KB as far as credibility is concerned in its believability.  But then I thought, ""What the heck, Tarantino has proven his skills as a talented writer and director so he's entitled to go wild this time.""  'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is an expert action film that has superbly choreographed fight scenes, top notch editing and great photography.  For that I have to recommend this film.  If you want to see a film that is well written and acted, forget it.  KB is NOT that kind of film.  It is simply an action film, no more no less with homages paid to Japanese mythology and the chop-saki action films from the 60's and 70's.  <br/><br/>Tarantino loves to rekindle the 70's and should audition for a guest spot on 'That 70's Show' or better yet, try and direct an episode of that well liked show.  Tarantino's love of 70's music is also a plus.<br/><br/>KB is destined to become a cult favourite and one little tidbit that has to be mentioned is the fact that in the closing credits, Tarantino thanks Governor Gray Davis and the state of California.  Interesting in that the same week this film was released, Arnold Schwarzenegger replaced Gray Davis as the governor of California.

","I'm one of the few film buffs out there that thinks Tarentino was overrated. Pulp Fiction was a good movie, but I never thought it deserved the status that it has recieved.  The same goes for the other movies he has written or directed.  I've always seen them as just a bunch of homages smushed together with a lot of f-bombs and n-words thrown in in order to be edgy. With Kill Bill, I will now take it all back.  Yes, the homages are still there, but it seems like he has transformed them into his own much more than he did with Pulp Fiction, IMO.  There is little dialouge, which is in more with the tradition of HK action movies.  Instead, more emphasis is placed on emotion, which leads to some very powerful performances by all (even the character of Budd, who actually only has one line of dialouge and is only briefly shown in flashbacks, yet he might be my favorite character). There's still some witty comebacks and wordplay, so QT fans won't be too disappointed, yet he no longer steeps to the overuse of profanity as he did before.  As for the music, it was brilliant and I hope to get the soundtrack.  It helped make the movie even that much more emotional, rather than simply being there for effect.

","I have read many reviews thus far posted here and many of them seem to Miss the Point I guess. This was One of the Best movies this year and By far QT's Best movie ever.<br/><br/>Be warned do not walk into this movie expecting Pulp Fiction. It is not going to be Pulp Fiction. It was never intended to be Pulp Fiction, and furthermore has absolutly nothing to do with Pulp Fiction what so ever! This Movie is entirely Different and should not even be compared to Pulp Fiction because doing so would be like comparing Mango's to Rice! In Fact Many People say that what Killed ""Jackie Brown"" was the fact that everyone was expecting Pulp Fiction too!<br/><br/>Go to this Movie if you wish to see the very best martial arts thriller ever made. This movie has everything! Within it's Over the top action and Violence, it's cleaver yet simple dialog and it's amazing cinematography, there is also some very serious and emotional issues. This movie emcompases everything a movie going experience should be. It made me laugh, made me jump, made me sad, and was extremely enjoyable to watch. Pure ans simple entertainment.<br/><br/>The best part is that as awsome as this movie is, it's part 1 of 2! Do not be discuraged by this however because volume 1 is a complete movie by it self. I look forward to being entertained just as much during Volume2!"

","I'd like to say that I saw the previews and thought, man QT is about to blow it. Uma Thurman with a sword? I grew up on Kung fu theatre, pretty much saw every martial art movie every made, especially when I was growing up. I really enjoyed Sonny Chiba, and QT's homage to Bruce Lee, The game of death jumpsuit, the classic tiger running shoes, the fight in the japanese garden (Bruce v. Russian boxer in Fists of Fury this is the original title, it was switched with chinese connection in the states).<br/><br/>The fighting sequences were great, better than I expected. QT used the Yuen Po (Iron Monkey, Crouching tiger, of course Matrix) and the wire techniques, minimally with good taste. The excessive blood spatter is the his homage to japanese anime. I can't believe how well he translated it to film. There is a scene with O-ren's crew surrounding her car with bikes and on the bikes Samurai swords!!!!! These sublties are what made Pulp Fiction the Bomb, QT uses this very well in Kill Bill, I was thoroughly entertained and was glad it's not over yet.<br/><br/>O-ren's bodyguard Go-Go rocks, and the fact that she is Asian adds to her assassin credibility. Was casted perfectly as well as acted. QT threw down!!!!!"

","First off, critics write this off as a movie with little story and all action.  Not that this is a bad thing but but they are wrong.  It is not action all and throughout like all the critics say.  There is almost too much story being told for there to be comments about their being no story. they have seemed to forgotten that this Quentin Tarantino and his big movie was Pulp Fiction in which it was not really one large story but a lot of little stories all connected through characters.  Kill Bill is made in a similer fashion but a little modified.  He makes it very clear that he is only telling you what is essential for every CHAPTER.  And each chapter has an incredible amount of story to tell considering that they are mere parts of the entire story.  Also, the chapters progress with the amount of signifigance that it holds and clearly, the killings weren't done in order of signifigance.  As for the stories being told, the route story of The Bride's revenge is pretty much left at face value, she is p*ssed and people will pay for it;however, the side stories being told have an incredible amount of depth, mainly Cottonmouth's.  Obviously, the focus at the start of the Kill Bill is not really The Bride but her enemies which adds further layers to the overall film because now she is not simply killing faceless killing machines, the Bride is killing living and breathing human beings who have their set of beliefs and fears (especially Vernitta Green).  If anything, this really hints at the brutality of the attempt at the Bride's death (in fact, The Bride actually describes to Vernitta Green what it would actually take for her to get even and it is not pleasant).  Speaking of Vernitta Green, that sequence is pretty much is metaphoric of how the movie will move after that point (only in reverse).  Now the scene literally kicks off (or more accurately punches off) and they are fighting no holds barred and then they are interrupted and it returns to the slow Tarantino pace with his snappy diolgue and slow movement.  Again, that pretty much summurises the rest of the movie's movements (again in reverse) because after that, the movie slows down and we can really see the pain, both physical and emotional, that the Bride is going through has well as her preperations for her next (or actually first) kill.  The action picks up a little bit with the anime sequence explaining Cottonmouths history and then it returns to the slow pace once again.  Remember, this is Quentin Tarantino so the slow pace is not really a bad thing at all and allows him to simply show the humanity of these characters (mainly the Bride).  And since he pretty much knows that we know what will happen, he worries more about showing us what is happening in the moment then what will happen eventually. Now, the performances were superb, especially Uma's because it was more physical then vocal and why would she really want to talk when she has 5 people that need to be killed. Everyone else plays their roles equally well but not really as physical (only exception being maybe Vivica A. Fox becuase she doesnt have anytime to say anything and starts off defending).  i would say the big suprise, to me at least, was Sonny Chiba.  Now i have all his Street Fighter Films and think of him as that crazy assassin who pokes out eyes, and rips off people's nuts.  in Kill Bill, he has a more homely type role and it is more hummorous then anything else.  And he plays the part very well, it was hard to believe that this was the same guy who brutally and slowly broke a guys arm bone by bone in the Street Fighter.  However, the standout performance (in this first part) would have to be Lucy Liu's. She is almost the Polar opposite of her character in Charlie's Angels.  In Kill Bill, her character is no one to mess with (which she makes very apperent in the film) but at the sametime, does not freak out or get overemotional.  She is really cold and calculating and every action she does is planned out in her head before she does it. Now to talk about the action (and to refer to the one line summary). Without a doubt, simply becuase this movie has martial arts, wire-stunts, and Yuen woo-ping as the choreographer, it will be compared to The Matrix. the big problem with this comparison is, well, they have absolutely nothing in common with each other.  Now enough abot the Matrix.  Yuen Woo-ping is known for his fantasy-like  choreography that  makes fight scenes more like dances then actual fights.  In Kill Bill, this is not neccessarily true. It looks more like an actual fight then a dance.  he has been known to say that when choroegraphing a fight scene ""keep the swords banging to keep people interested"".  in kill Bill this is a bit modified (in the final 200 man battle at least).  It is now, apprently, keep blood gushing and and slashes deadly and the people will stay interested.  there are only brief moments that are genuine Yuen Woo-ping but the majority of the fight scene is almost entirely different then what we (at least me) are used to seeing from him.<br/><br/>As for the climantic Duel between Cottonmouth and the Bride, it is somewhat apparent that this is where Sonny Chiba made is other contribution to the film.  It is rather slowly paced when compared to the fight scene preceding it but it is no less entertaining.<br/><br/>sidenote: everybody seems to assume that the fight scenes are anything but realistic.  this is because of the blood special effects and the way the fight scenes are shot at certain moments.  However, it is far more realistic then past american efforts at martial arts (again like the Matrix).  there is very little so called ""flying"" and when people get punched or kicked, they feel it.  When some gets slashed by the samurai sword, they either die or bleed profusely.  The wound is not passed over like a simple scrape."
"boondocksaint20","Null","0","0","12 October 2003"," Good, but mildly disappointing...but should be a treat for Tarantino fans
","This one took some time to digest when I left the theater.  Maybe it was b\c this is the first film Tarantino has made in around 6 years...maybe it's b\c of the almost unanimous outstanding reviews I've read on this board (and though I usually don't listen to the critics, theirs as well)...whatever it is, this is one that will definitely leave an impression on you at the end.<br/><br/>Now, I loved Pulp Fiction, thought Reservoir Dogs was great, and Jackie Brown was better than average...and from the previews and reviews I've read, I knew exactly what I was getting into.  So with this in mind, I turned off the 'expecting another Pulp Fiction' button in my head, and sat and enjoyed what is the epitome of a guilty pleasure movie.<br/><br/>What drives this film is the acting and QT's unique blend of storytelling. Oh yeah, and the hundred or so severed bodies of unfortunate Yakuza soldiers at the film's climax (which is the centerpiece of the film).  All of the leads do great...and I must applaud QT once again for using his incredible knack for using talented actors whose careers had washed up at some point in the past, and gives them the script to shine.  The plot is simple; an assassin is betrayed by her colleagues who turn her wedding into a massacre, and she exacts revenge after awakening from a 4 year coma caused by a gunshot wound to the head.  I love the sense of forboding with the 'hit list' that she almost childishly engraves on a pad of college rule paper in contrasting red and black ink.  It is one of those fine touches QT puts in his films that give them panache and flair...almost like a score card for not only the main character, but the audience as well.  And the fight scenes are excellent...I was so glad to see actual fights with actual actors and little to no CGI.  And by far, the coolest part is when Uma Thurman's character looks down upon scores of fallen enemy from her blade, and tells the mangled survivors that they may live, but their limbs belong to her. It is something that must be seen to appreciate, but it was one of those rare scenes from a movie that really stuck with me at the end.<br/><br/>
Now, yes, Kill Bill was a pretty good movie overall, but I have a fair share of criticisms as well.  First, the pacing is really awful...in Tarantino's other films, they were all either fast paced or fast spoken...in other words, there was never a dull silence either b\c of QT's snappy visuals or snappy dialogue (or the trademark loud as thunder gunshot effects).  Kill Bill has tons of moments where there is absolutely nothing said where there is complete silence...no poignant thoughts either, just plain silence. Also, the pacing is really slow in many parts, especially when you know a big action scene is about to occur...some movies use buildup to justify this effectively...it's almost like some parts of this movie were thrown together kind of sloppily, and did not emphasize on pacing.  Anyway, this is a complaint of mine, and it may very well not hinder other's viewing enjoyment.  Another thing I found a little disappointing was the lack of really cool humor.  QT tried many times (especially in a painfully overlong scene with two Japenese chefs arguing about who should serve the saki that failed to produce one laugh from the audience in the 3 minutes or so of dialogue) but just couldn't deliver.  He keeps this movie very simple, and in a lot of ways it works...unfortunately, lacking complete substance can never be compensated with artistic license.  Plus, I found the anime sequence (though I know it was paying homage to anime lovers...including himself) a little overlong and frankly out of place...I actually like some anime movies, but it just didn't belong here, and I couldn't wait for it to be over.  Now, I understand why he put it in but, like I've said about opinions, others may really love it so to each their own.<br/><br/>Anyway, I know Volume 2 is supposed to be more character and dialogue driven which would be a welcome break from the mainly action and 'dramatic pause' oriented Volume 1.  It is not for everyone, but I know certain people will love it.  I thought it was pretty good, overall, definitely not his best effort.  Volume 1 could have been cut to a clean 90 minutes which would have so very well helped the pacing...but I have the impression Tarantino pretty much had free reign to do whatever he wanted for this project.  At any rate, it is a bloody good time at the movies, despite many sluggish parts. People who do not appreciate or like profanity, Japenese anime/samurai movies, or swimming pools of blood admist dozens of dismembered limbs should steer clear.  Anyone who is a Tarantino fanatic, or who can say yes to any of the above questions should definitely go see it.  I fall more towards the latter of the two, so I will give it an above average rating of 7.5/10 stars."

","As a dedicated life-long zealous aficianado of all genres of HK cinema I went to this movie strictly for the novelty of seeing Gordon Liu in a Hollywood movie--he's a martial-arts movie demi-god. Having Sonny Chiba along was nice too. Plus Tarantino is also an HK action movies fan so I guess that's nice too. However I am not a big fan of his work--I was mixed on Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Right after watching Kill Bill I though OK, it's pretty much an action flick with zero plot on a big budget; pretty bad acting (Lucy Liu is a laughably bad actress with zero screen presence); a solid soundtrack; nice sound effects; and unusually large amounts of blood and mayhem. The anime addition was a nice touch too. And certainly he is paying homeage to several action genres -- with mixed success. But his parodying and homages (to Japanese and HK cinema) are somewhat difficult to differentiate.<br/><br/>Yuen's action and fighting sequences are good, (Uma was stunt-doubled quite well) but as typical with his Hollywood work, fairly simple and much watered down.<br/><br/>So OK, 6.5 out of 10 with an extra half point for having Yuen Woo Ping and Gordon Liu, plus a nice fight scene with Chiaki Kuriyama. 7/10.<br/><br/>
But wait...<br/><br/>After thinking about it, I started to realize that when one looks a bit deeper one finds this all very deeply disturbing--this is a new level extreme violence and brutality. But there is zero cost. 100% gratuitous. All entertainment. No suffering, no crying, weeping or wailing. Extreme violence and brutality with no cost is a sick concept, but one all too common of many aspects of American culture.<br/><br/>Looking at yet another level one also finds this movie riddled with racist and deeply bigoted messages on many levels. Uma Thurman is Tarantino's aryan goddess who can take on hundreds of Japanese fighters with only a few scratches, an African-american assassin, and a Chinese/Japansese assassin. She is just so superior. All the tired old standard bigotry against Texas/southerners is present as well. The point where she spanks the one remaining sword fighter was the coup de gras.<br/><br/>This is a disturbing and pointless exercise is racism, bigotry and gratuitous violence created by a little white American boy who has a lot to learn. This is absolute rubbish in every sense of the word."

","I'm not going to go into plot details because they've been explored on this site so many times it's just old hat. I saw this film last night and I can't stop thinking about it. It has to be one of the most violent movies ever made, well the most violent movie I've ever seen. However the violence is stylized, and in the hands of any other director would really become graituitious. The film is most definately pulp and every frame bleeds(no pun intended) Tarantino's love for Asian cinema, spaghetti westerns, and various other references that this humble viewer wouldn't pick up in a million years. Many of criticized the film for being anti-asian ok I can understand that if this film was set in the real world, but to say that this is set in the real world is to say that the Indianna Jones films are set in the real world, which is just not the case. Like the Indy movies ""Kill Bill"" lives in our cinematic imagainations what I mean by this is that this film is a cinematic other world, I'm not exactly making much sense I understand that. But this is a post modernist film at it's best it is a n amalgamation of every genre film that has come out in the past 40-50 years. So anyone criticizing the film for portraying the Yakuza in a diferent light than most needs to understand that when Uma Thurman's character ""The Bride""(whose name is bleeped out purely for effect)flies into Japan(a Godzilla set) she is not flying into Japan she is flying into our collective movie going imagaination of Japan. I don't know if that made any sense. I'm glad that Miramax and Tarantino decided to split the movie into two parts for one thing it needs an intermission the violence although stylized is still intense enough to warrant a intermission and it's good too b/c than a person like myself can get aquainted with Tarantino's references.<br/><br/>Another thing has to said about how Tarantino has now reinvented the action movie for one all the male characters are not the heroes in fact all the main characters in this first volume are all women. I will go on record here and say that Uma Thurman's ""The Bride"" will become an iconic image of this decade. And speaking of Uma Thurman, she does a fantastic job, with an entirely physical performance. We see the rage in her voice and eyes, and seeing her with a samurai sword gives us a thrill, and Sonny Chiba provides the films spirtual center...so to speak giving one of my favorite lines in the whole movie ""I can tell you with no ego, that this is my finest sword. If in your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut"".<br/><br/>There is so much more to say about the other actresses in the film who all do an amazing job I liked Lucy Liu for the first time, Vivica A. Fox who I haven't seen for a while does a great job. So much to say and not enough time to say it. I gotta say though if you can't handle violence stay as far away from this movie as humanly possible whereas unlike Tarantino's other movies where the violence stays off screen he keep the camera focused on it.<br/><br/>
And as for Volume 2 in Febuary I am so there."

","Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" is definitely not a film for everyone, and certainly not for the squemish.  The film is over-the-top with severe graphic violence: blood spurting in huge geysers, limbs being hacked off by swords, and axes landing in the middle of human heads.  It is also a deeply transgressive film - Uma Thurman's character is beaten, shot and left for dead when pregnant; then spends four years in a coma with her inert body being pimped out by an orderly; while Lucy Liu's character is featured in an anime flashback in which a child watches the graphic murder of her parents, and then takes her revenge by using herself as bait for a pedophile yakuza boss.  The film has obviously questionable morals, and equally questionable artistic value.  The dialogue is sparse, much sparser then Tarantino's past films, and lacks much of the video-nerd goofball/mundane humor that made ""Pulp Fiction"" so memorable.  The (barebones) plot, style, characterizations, and music are all highly derivative - explicitly borrowing and/or ripping off (per my observations) Sergio Leone Spaghetti Westerns, 70's Shaw Brother's kung-fu films, the 60's yakuza noir thrillers of Sejun Suzuki, blaxploitation movies, B-grade revenge films like ""Walking Tall"" or the X-rated ""I Spit On Your Grave"", the anime and manga ""Crying Freeman"", the ""Green Hornet"" TV show, Bruce Lee's ""Game of Death"", and 70s samurai potboilers like ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" and ""Hanzo the Razor"" (whew). In addition, Miramax's decision to slice the film in half leaves the viewer with an unfortunate feeling of incompleteness . . . AND I LOVED EVER SINGLE SICK MINUTE OF THE ENTIRE THING AND WILL PROBABLY WATCH IT TEN MORE TIMES IN THE THEATER!"

","As corny as the title of this comment is, there is no denying the true potential of this movie to reach the mountaintop of cinematic greatness. Astonishing enough, this is only the first part. And if one segment of two segments total can blow away consciousness and thought, it can keep you on your toes for Volume 2.<br/><br/>Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is the perfect exaggeration of life and reality. If life was given a slight sadistic charge to it, this movie would be the envision of that nether dimension. Exaggeration: the consistency of action and gore, and the outrageous but aesthetically incredible decapitations. As understood about this movie, this is Quentin Tarantino's tribute to many of his beloved die-hard genres, such as spaghetti westerns and kung-fu movies. It goes without saying that his tribute is a redefinition and reinvention of each genre. He basically made this movie, with the melting pot of genres, his own.<br/><br/>Kudos also goes to Uma Thurman for all the anguish she had during the shoot while acting out the anguish of one woman. A question that should arise from this movie might be whether or not Thurman may take the high step to actress-dom, or being one of the revered and sought after actresses in Hollywood.<br/><br/>This movie captured The Bride's anguish perfectly, even though this movie may be classified only as action driven rather than character driven. Nevertheless, Quentin, along with Thurman, created a character that transforms from mystery to woman-on-a-mission.<br/><br/>Godfather made people scratch their heads after seeing it because they wanted to check, recheck. and check again if they were seeing the unthinkable and incredible. Kill Bill matches that mindset and state. It can be thought more and more and seen more and more, but the action will mesmerize and graciously stupify you into awe.

Its incongruous mish-mashing of kung-fu grindhouse and spaghetti western makes for a mesmerizing, horrifying, and completely incredible movie-going experience.

","Quentin Tarantino proves with ""KILL BILL: VOL.1"" that he really can do no wrong. Right from the opening sequence, you're strapped in and clutching the arm rest of your seat. KILL BILL is about The Bride aka Black Mamba's (Uma Thurman) odyssey of revenge. When she is beaten and left for dead by her fellow assassins on the order of her boss, Bill (David Carradine),on her wedding day, she goes into a coma only to awaken 4 years later, thirsty for vengeance. She makes a list of the people that betrayed her, and goes on a absurdly violent killing spree. The plot is very thin for this half of the show, but Tarantino promises a lot more dialog in ""KILL BILL: VOL.2"". The film's highlights are the way the movie unfolds. It isn't a linear story at all (with Tarantino, it never is), but it's still damn entertaining. We learn the origin of O-Shi-Ren (Lucy Liu) in a kick ass anime sequence. We see The Bride receive the weapon she will use on her quest from the man who trained her enemy. And we see the end all beat all of fight sequences in the showdown at the House of Blue Leaves, which promises to astonish and amaze. Something that I have always admired about Tarantino is his taste in music. He always seems to find the right song, be it a Japanese rock tune, or Mexican type surfer music, that fits the scene perfectly. The Nancy Sinatra song that plays over the opening credits is perfect and so is the rock song that plays during the House of Blue Leaves melee. The one problem is that the movie is way too short. Only 90 minutes. I would have preferred to see both volumes as one 3 hour long epic. But it does end on a great cliff hanger line that comes out of nowhere. I honestly can't describe with words the perfection of the fight scenes, from the screams of pain to those who've had their limbs chopped off, to the brilliant choreography. But I will say that this movie is definitely not for the faint of heart. The violence is extreme and over exaggerated. I went to see it with friends whom a few weren't used to insane violence and they cringed and covered their eyes. But me, and the others who have been desensitized, loved every blood soaked minute. A movie about vengeance has never been so intriguing. You really feel for this character and root for her as she seeks restitution from the people that took so much away from her (things I can't mention without spoiling the movie). Bill (or what is seen of him) is played very frightening and worthy of a slice from The Bride's samurai sword. All and all, this is a great movie that would probably reach the heights of perfection if seen as a whole.<br/><br/>RATING: ***1/2 out of ****"

","After what's seem like an eternity, Quentin Tarantino finally returns with his sendup to the grindhouse films (as well as plenty of other styles) in Kill Bill. While the movies plot is relatively simple and much easier to summarize than any of Tarantino's previous films, that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It is a departure in many ways; Volume I contains considerably less dialog-focused character development than any of his other films.  The action and violence is at the front of this flick.  Tarantino once described Reservoir Dogs as seeming a lot more violent than it actually was because of the threat of violence that looms over each scene, and there were actually only a handful of occasions where violent acts actually occurred.  With Kill Bill, there is so much violence that it seems awkward when there is downtime.  In a scene where Uma Thurman visits Japan and is having a fun little chat with the propriater of a restauraunt/bar (there may be a term for such an establishment in Japanese that I am missing), Uma is all cutesy and fun, and it's hard to believe she's the same woman dicing up punk after punk in the rest of the film.  The word awkward is a bad choice, as it tends to have bad connotations.  There is nothing wrong with the non-action packed scenes in this film. Speaking of action packed, this film is packed with action!  There have been complaints that Tarantino is not a very good action director.  Well, the morons who say that don't realize HE'S NOT AN ACTION MOVIE MAKER!  They were much more dramas with occasional acts of violence that didn't require explosions and ellaborate action sequences.  But Kill Bill is an action film, and Tarantino directs it brilliantly.  There is also a great deal of variation in how the action is executed and revealed.  Every blood-soaked moment is a surprise. This is also Tarantino's most artistic film today, employing everything from black-and-white scenes (which may have been due to the excessive blood), animation, birds eye shots, oblique angles (there are far less long shots in this film, the story is divided into title chapters, the pace is much faster than the usual Tarantino style, probably cuz there's so many people to kill and so little time), and the scene where Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu have a one-on-one sword battle is film in a beautiful Japanese garden in the snow. Amazing mise en scene. It really reads like a graphic novel, a comic book.  It might not be the deepest Tarantino film, but it is certainly the most epic.  And there's still another hour and a half to go.  I can't wait!"

His story is interesting, nonetheless, if you learn how he got Reservoir Dogs done and then Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown, and then...Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Tarantino does something very special here...he does everything a film maker could ever dream of: a movie for himself, a movie he does cherish as much as some people will do in a couple of years, when Kill Bill is going to be a cult classic.  A movie in which he pays homage to Oriental cinema, while Lucio Fulci fans will be totally pleased to see guts being spilled and people being sliced and diced in very bloody fashion.  Also, Tarantino does punctuate the film with his own style, which has become a landmark in American cinema.  Here we get many things that differentiate Kill Bill from an conventional institutional film; the chronology, which is, as usual in a Tarantino movie, like a puzzle in which all the short stories finally fit well together, there is also the very appreciated presence of an amazing anime sequence in the middle of the film, the fact that some scenes are in black and white, and not always to symbolize flashbacks (maybe in the case of Kill Bill Vol.1 it was only to avoid an NC-17 rating though, but I'll talk about that later), and, to top it all, we got way too much blood and gore for a typical American film, which Kill Bill Vol.1 definitely isn't.<br/><br/>
Now, it really is evident that Tarantino did watch many Japanese movies. The animated part in his film is just as great and has the same crazily Japanese feel to it than ""Akira"", for example.  The animation is done quite beautifully, much better than any manga, but still keeps a very Oriental aspect.  Also, the combat scenes, especially at the end, keep the spirit and slow pace of classic Japanese cinema (think of Kurosawa or Kobayashi). Yeah, aside from all that crazy gore and limbs that fly all over the room, the honour-oriented aspect of the sword fights and the choregraphy just help to make of Kill Bill Vol.1 a true homage to Samurai films.  Yes, it is an American film, yes, that's also something you'll feel while watching it, but it is not common at all, and it really makes an interesting mix of genres which I think only the Tarantino blender could put back together to obtain something very interesting.  Yes, it did bother me a little at first to see that the fight against the 88 men in the restaurant was suddenly turning to black and white.  Yes, the violence impact was mostly gone because of that, but really, with the grainy picture and the sound changing too, for a moment, I really thought I was watching a better version of ""Shogun Assassin"" with better camera angles and much, much more blood.  And, then, right after that comes a fight which is shown only in shadowgraph...wonderful.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol.1 (and probably the whole film) does not really suffer from its very thin storyline, which is stylistically exploited to its maximum. Yes, it's just a plain story of revenge, but remember that Tarantino is behind it.  And, by the way, another movie last year had pretty much the same storyline and was considered by many (which include myself) as an excellent film; ""Gangs of New York"".  These two films exploit one of the oldest subgenres ever: the revenge flick.  Scorsese's film had an amazingly delivered historical background to it, but Tarantino's has something hard to describe.  One thing is sure, though, substance is not the main attraction here.  But who cares?  This film expresses the fundamental joys of cinema from someone who truly had fun making his baby.  And it does make a great homage to Oriental movies , and it SURE delivers lots of entertainment.<br/><br/>
Tarantino's directing is, as always, pretty good, while improvement has been made here; his three previous films were shot like (as he said himself) ""good old boring television"" but punctuated with some great shots and a pretty interesting knowledge in directing.  But in Kill Bill Vol.1, Tarantino keeps his good old habits, but adds some new things to his direction.  The black and white scenes are part of that, as well as some very dynamical camera procedures.  I would say Kill Bill Vol.1, for right now (because I haven't seen Vol.2!) is not Tarantino's best film.  But for the direction, it's the most original, and probably the best, though his style did fit better in his other movies.<br/><br/>The actors are all great.  Uma Thurman is pretty good as the protagonist, but David Carradine, which we don't really see in the first volume, was frightening in his parts.  Also, Lucy Liu does a great job as O-Ren Ishi, a professional assassin with a very dark past.  All the others are very good too.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is brilliant, really.  That's a Tarantino trademark too. The music is just perfect for the film, bringing incredible energy to the colourful and beautiful images which are delivered in a splendid and versatile photography.  Tarantino uses different colour textures and image grain for the different scenes, as well as the sound.  Yes, those things are apparent, which is something many people might dislike, but trust me, it does add a lot to the style and and value of this film.<br/><br/>So, overall, as a first volume, this was good, very good. Sure, it is not as good as ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"", but it does have bite, and a lot of it. And, to be honest, I'll be impatiently waiting for the second volume to be released.<br/><br/>8.5/10"
"enojy","9","0","0","10 October 2003"," A beautiful blend of Asian art and cinematography
","Most trailers for ``Kill Bill'' were careful not to reveal how deep the movie itself really is, and for good reason.  Director Quentin Tarentino was more than likely intending for the film's major target audience to be fans he has won over in the past (``Pulp Fiction,'' ``Reservoir Dogs'') and to let the success of the film speak for itself.  Being familiar with Tarentino's niche for clever usages of timeframes and scene changes, I walked into the theatre knowing what to expect.  Not only was I wrong, but I was glad that my assumptions were false.<br/><br/>The story begins explaining how a woman (Uma Thurman) who goes by the alias ""Black Mamba,"" was murdered by a quartet of assassins on her wedding day. She mysteriously survives a gunshot wound to the temple, and her strong taste for revenge to be dealt amongst the culprits outlines the plot that will ultimately become the Kill Bill series.  From the very start, the film is soaked in Asian cinematography subculture, including plenty of martial arts conflicts, Japanese voiceovers, and surprisingly, a 20-minute long segment of the film that is presented entirely in anime format (Japanese animation.)<br/><br/>For those familiar with the Asian style of common horror flicks, blood is poured by the truckload; severed limbs are in great supply; and the themes of honor and respect seem to be valued above all else.  It is this stylistic backdrop that makes ``Kill Bill'' as refreshingly unique as it is.  One can't help but form a comparison with the ``Matrix'' trilogy, specifically for the two film's heavy use of martial arts.  In my opinion, ``Kill Bill'' triumphs on all fronts.<br/><br/>Fans of Tarentino films will doubtfully be disappointed.  ``Kill Bill'' is an excellent example of prime storytelling, with just the right amount of character development to seed in with the entertainment value that most people will pay the matinee for.  Since the first volume of the series doesn't resolve a final conflict, it will eagerly have you awaiting the next episode.  Overall, one of the most intelligently creative films I've seen in quite some time.  9 out of 10"
"iusti","7","0","0","10 October 2003"," Entertaining, but... Never a Masterpiece (a few spoilers)
","I have been a huge Tarantino fan myself. I have always loved his insight and wit in his works. I know he owes Asian film-making tradition much in his creation, but I never thought that he lacked his creativity or originality. I rather admired his sense of style introducing flawlessly the part of that film history to his works without really ripping it off. He might have borrowed some ideas, but there have been many other things brilliant other than just HOMAGE to its tradition. At least, BEFORE KILL BILL Vol. 1.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, Kill Bill Vol. 1 can never be one of Tarantino¡¯s masterpieces so far. At best, it is no more than his so-so work. Although I am hesitant to say ¡®ripping off,¡¯ it too much depends on Asian cinema stereotypes, especially focusing on the cheesy ones.<br/><br/>Do not misunderstand me. Trust me. Kill Bill Vol. 1 was really entertaining unless you hate his bloodthirsty taste. Acting was overall good. Especially Uma Thurman's performance was very impressive to me. All the characters are well defined. The chain-throwing school girl (you know, she is really almost 20 years old, not 17 years old.), one-eyed Daryl Hannah, and the Japanese-speaking Star Track vixen are all lovable. (If you did not watch the movie, you may not understand what the heck I am talking about.) The scenes are well captured and connected. Especially, if you have never seen the real Japanese animation (I am not talking about Pokemon!!), you will have the taste of the finest of the finest of its kind.<br/><br/>
Also, as an Asian that I am, I have to admit that his understanding of Asian movies, stories, and even music are more than just a superficial level, although he probably got some helping hands. I laughed a lot listening to typical Japanese note of the background music on the scene after the duel of Uma and Lucy, and especially, when Uma and Lucy are talking about the craftsmanship of the sword even at the very end of Lucy's life, I was quite impressed.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, it was too typical, nothing new, especially for Asian people. Let me say one thing to the people saying that the movie has something new, unique, or saying that the movie is the best of this year or all-time. Asian moviegoers have gone through tons of better ones if Kill Bill is that great. For example, Jet Li has had tons of better mass fighting scenes in his early works than ¡®Uma-to-Everyone else¡¯ in Kill Bill. I have even seen those one-to-everyone fighting scenes in TV soup operas many times this year. So PLEASE, SAVE the expression, ¡°THE BEST¡¯ until you see the originals. In addition, another complaint would be that I almost smell of stereotyping and orientalism. However, while it is not certainly pleasing, I would not discuss it more because stereotyping and school girl fetish certainly sell.<br/><br/>
Again, don't misunderstand me. I enjoyed this movie a lot. I am just saying that it cannot be the masterpiece like many people think and that Tarantino could have done better than this. Kill Bill is nothing more than just a mishmash of things Asian unlike his real former masterpieces and Tarantino just succeeded in entertaining people putting the mishmash in the context of Hollywood."
"DJExcen","Null","0","0","11 October 2003"," Stunningly beautiful portrayal of the ugly head of revenge.
","While not being a total fan of Quentin Tarantino per se, his latest cinematic presentation was top notch.  It has better choreography than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, smarter comedy than all movies in my recent memory, and evokes more thought and emotion in the first half hour than many oscar winners do in the entire film.  While being a stunning and practically perfect example of filmmaking at it's finest, perhaps what is most noteworthy is that the movie is incredibly easy to watch.  Mind you, the blood and guts are not for the weak of stomach, but the violence is magnificently choreographed, graceful, and a perfect example of what eastern filmmaking could produce if the crews had a hollywood budget.  I am going to step out on a limb and say that this film, while being way too graphic for the tastes of The Academy, deserves the title of, ""Best Film Of The Year""."

"philserve","10","0","0","10 October 2003"," As much as a masterpiece as Pulp Fiction
","While watching the trailers for the movie on TV, I wondered, 'how good could a revenge movie be?'. But from the moment it started, Tarantino set the tone of humor, intensity, fierceness and over-the-topness, marvellously edited, such that it drew you in, but not so far in that you would take it all that seriously. It seemed to be telling the audience, aren't these martial arts films so hokey, but don't you love the ass-kicking anyway? The saving grace of the movie is that while it is telling the story of fierce revenge, it continually makes fun of itself, so that you are laughing with the movie, not at it. Uma Thurman looked radiant at time, Lucy Liu once again played the perfect cold hearted bitch - did her scream at the Yakuza gathering remind you of Amanda Plummer's hysteria in the final restaurant scene in Pulp Fiction?<br/><br/>But a warning, this is not only a high body count, but a high severed limb count, and if you at all squeamish at bloodletting, go see a chickflick!"
"frederickfilm","Null","0","0","11 October 2003"," Bottom line is: the movie is perfect...absolutely amazing
","Ok...I've seen Kill Bill 1 twice now and I want to tell everyone a little about it...no real spoilers...just some thoughts/comments.<br/><br/>
So...before I begin...I'd like to say that, yes, I am a huge Tarantino fan. I would like to think, however, that this does not bias my opinion about KILL BILL 1. I try to stay objective in my reviews/comments. For example...I didn't really like Jackie Brown or Four Rooms despite Tarantino making them...so...it's not like im gonna love Kill Bill automatically. Anyway...let me start:<br/><br/>1) Kill Bill is NOTHING like any of Tarantino's other films. It's not all a metaphor and dissection of pop-culture issues like Pulp Fiction...and it's nothing like Reservoir Dogs either in that it simply doesn't feel the same. But...this doesn't mean that Kill Bill isn't in Tarantino's style. Tarantino has shots in his mind that no one else could imagine...certaintly not in these circumstances. He thinks original thoughts that belong so much to him that this film creates a genre unto itself even tho its conceived of both eastern (japanese) and western (westerns) influences.<br/><br/>2) It is VIOLENT. This is not one to take you're wife to. Now...I'm not sexist...but...between the two showings that I saw of it, 26 people left...13 couples. You could hear wives yelling at husbands to give them the keys so they could leave...""why would you even want to watch this!?!?"" they'd say. So...yeah...it's violent. And it's not like in Pulp fiction where you don't see the violence. Here you see it in all it's bloody gore. People get killed with a sword in just about every imaginable way. Im trying to think of a way that people dont get killed with a sword in the film...but i cant think of one. The violence is realistic...even though it is totally exaggerated and over-the-top...<br/><br/>3) When people are cut (except for the lead actors), they bleed in geysers. Now...im not talking like geysers of blood that you see in war films like Saving Private Ryan and Platoon...im taking 10 foot high geysers...like when a fire hydrant breaks. Im serious...at one point in the film...there are like 7 guys all fighting with only one arm and the other are is cut off and is replaced by a HUGE stream of blood shooting out horizontally from the body. It is BLOODY. People are tortured. People are raped. People are cut into pieces. We see exposed brains...we see eyes getting cut out of heads. All before your eyes...or at least seemingly. Now...with all those geysers of blood...you may think it's a farce...or a joke...well...i dont blame you...many people in the theatre did...<br/><br/>4) YOU have to understand what Tarantino is TRYING to do and where he got all these ideas FROM. You should know that this film is the child of many japanese films. I would urge you to watch some...because it would help you to appreciate what this film is. Tarantino doesn't want you to love killing...he doesn't want you to go out and copy his portrayed actions. He wants you to REALIZE. Realize what our mentality is...realize what is going on around us...this isnt an entertaining film as much as it is a documentary about how violent the world is today.<br/><br/>5) It is VERY GOOD that it is in two parts...one three hour plus film would get tiring...it would test your endurance...and thats not what this film is about. You would agree if you saw it...and its not like the matrix or Terminator where you feel like your just gonna see more of the same in the next one...i mean...you know that in the next matrix Neo is gonna fight smith again...i mean...you know whats gonna happen.....you may not know the end of the plot.....but you know the route to get there. In this film you're not really dying to see the next one...you almost appreciate the wait so you can absorb this one.<br/><br/>6) There are NO boring parts. Everything hits you the way it should. If you should laugh...then you do...if you should cry...then you do. (I almost did...there is a very sad part in Vol.1)...if you should cringe...then...well...you do over and over again. This is is all about the ""Awwwgh!""...that sigh of digust in seeing something you wish you hadn't...like seeing your parents naked...or opening the garbage can and seeing a dead animal inside...what do you say?......""AWWWWWGHGH!""<br/><br/>7) One mistake i found...when O-ren Ishii is being introduced (not in anime) but when she is sitting at the table with all the members of the gang council...(just before she cuts that guys head off)...we are introduced to GO GO...the chick with the ball and chain...she is introduced as ""the girl to the right of O ren is...""......but.......Go Go is sitting to O ren's left. It is a mistake......because when we look at the screen...she is on the right side of the screen.......but......not on Oren's right. Maybe theres significance to that....but........i cant figure it out.<br/><br/>So...the movie is basically perfect. Everything about it is awesome. Some people wont be able to take it...but...its violence is an anti-violence statement...just like Pulp Fiction was an anti-crime/underground world/killing/drug film.<br/><br/>So...if you like Tarantino...go see the film...dont take your girlfriend...unless she can really take violence...cause walking out of a Tarantino flick that your so excited about really sucks.<br/><br/>Brandon"

When I bought my ticket and sat down in the theater, I had no idea what I was in store for.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is, bar-none, the best movie this year.  It has all the action of a super-mega-action-hit, with the underlying subplot that we've all come to expect and love from Tarantino.

"movieguy1021","9","0","0","10 October 2003"," Kill Bill: Volume One: 9/10
","Eleven years ago, a young man named Quentin Tarantino released his first film, Reservoir Dogs. It became a huge hit, and two years later he released Pulp Fiction. In 1997, he made his least acclaimed film, Jackie Brown. The long six year wait is over. Kill Bill: Volume One has been released into theaters with a great reception, and possible more violence than Pulp Fiction. Although I don't know much about the man, I can guess that Tarantino is not a modern Hollywood director. As he was working on Kill Bill, he didn't allow `squibs' to squirt fake blood, and he doesn't cast the most famous Hollywood stars. Knowing this, I was surprised that he allowed Miramax to split this movie up into two parts in order to get twice the revenue. Of course, if this movie hadn't been split into two, it probably would have been NC-17.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman isn't a name that rolls off of the tongue, nor is it the first name you think of when you hear the word `actress'. That's where Tarantino's work comes in: having worked with her in Pulp Fiction, he knows her. Any mainstream actress would have not accepted, for it is `too hard of a part' to be a martial arts star. Thurman was perfect for her role as `The Bride'. She's an assassin who has been in a coma for four years, brought there by the title character, Bill (David Carradine) and others, including O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox). She simply wants vengeance, for not only did they nearly kill her, but they also killed her unborn baby.<br/><br/>Put simply, Kill Bill is the most entertaining movie of the year. It's not light and breezy, but it's never boring and really keeps a smile on your face for most of the time. Tarantino goes from quick thrills to a heavy-handed sequence in the middle of the film, but the transition is smooth, which makes it bearable. The fight scenes were amazing. Uma Thurman doesn't look like someone you would normally equate with `action star', and that's what makes her even better in her role. She plays it was fierceness and the right approach. She had the discipline to learn the complicated moves for all of her fights. They weren't wanna-be kung-fu fights like in The Matrix, but real ones. There were barely any special effects for them, and they looked spectacular.<br/><br/>Of course, where would Tarantino be without controversy? The violence is much debated about, mainly for the cause of the two parts. Many, including me, say that the main reason that Kill Bill was split into two separate movies was to keep the MPAA rating for both as an R, instead of one NC-17 movie. The violence was gratuitous and extreme, constant throughout the movie, but it didn't seem real in the least. I've seen much of the same in the Grand Theft Auto video games. All of the blood did look real, however, and made me believe that it was actual blood.<br/><br/>The cinematography, by Robert Richardson, is spectacular. He tries a variety of styles: quick, MTV-style cuts, long, three minutes takes, and views from every conceivable angle, and some inconceivable ones. Another factor I loved about Kill Bill was how it tried, and successfully, recaptured the cheesiness of the 70's action movies Tarantino wanted to make this movie like. Although those movies didn't shift around time like Tarantino does here, it had a low budget feel to it (like in the opening, before, and during the credits), and a plain feeling to it.<br/><br/>There were only two things I didn't like about Kill Bill. First was how cheaply Tarantino tried to tone down the violence in a few scenes by either making the fight in black-and-white, or just having the silhouettes fight. The other was the ending. I wanted Kill Bill to go on longer, I enjoyed it so much. It left with such a cliffhanger ending, which revealed something shocking about The Bride, who, in 100 minutes and is actually a despicable person, I grew to like as a character. Other than that, if you can stomach it, go out right now to see Kill Bill.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong bloody violence, language, and some sexual content."
"fireinside77","8","0","0","10 October 2003"," Quentin amazes us yet again.
","This could be the best movie to come out in a long time.  It is the type of movie that we need.  Though excessively violent, it is not put there for shock but rather to pay respect to the movies that came before it.  Anyone that claims his other movies were to violent will most likely hate this one.<br/><br/>It is the perfect breed of comedy and action.  Quentin explores many genres in this movie, but I don't want to spoil it so I'll just say, the history of Lucy Liu's character O-Ren Ishi is spectacular. I like Quentin's approach to this movie, I like the acting and i like the plot. I recommend it to anyone that can stomach blood, a lot of blood."

","KILL BILL!!! Just saw it and was I ever pleased. Tarantino's hiatus has left all his fans yearning for another blistering flick from the cinematic genius. He returns with KILL BILL: Vol. 1. He returns with style.<br/><br/>The performances are all over the top, but this kind of tongue-in-cheek moviemaking calls for that kind of behavior. Uma Thurman is sensational, as well as Lucy Liu. Vivica A. Fox doesn't have much time to develop, so her performance can't be lauded too much. Daryl Hannah is promising, with more to come. Michael Madsen is almost non-existent. However, as with Daryl Hannah, he has more to come. David Carradine has yet to show his face but comes off riveting as the title character.<br/><br/>The scenes move quickly and the flow of the movie is uneven. The movie really shines for its style and little bells and whistles. There is a great amount of detail, and the nods to martial arts culture such as the music, the formats used (there's even Anime), the costumes and the characters themselves are very enjoyable.<br/><br/>In the opinion of this viewer, Tarantino, who is known for his great dialogue, has abandoned cleverness and gone more for emotion and in-your-face action. This film isn't very talkative and when characters are talking, it isn't engaging dialogue. You don't have fun with it. The dialogue is always building up to something and you almost always know what it is. The film is very straightforward. The flashbacks are a kick, giving further insight into the characters.<br/><br/>This isn't totally important to talk about, but it still is a major part of the film. Violence. I mean some serious violence. This is one the bloodiest films I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot. Some of the deaths are appalling, and for that Tarantino needs to be praised. When you go over the top with a film, you have to go all out. One of the characters has an accident, ala the movie Hannibal, that has to be seen to believe. Innumerable limbs and oceans of blood are lost. It's great. This isn't a movie to take terribly seriously, you 're just supposed to have fun with it the way Tarantino probably did making it.<br/><br/>Last but not least, twists. This film starts with a twist, cut off by a bang. I think most who saw the movie knew what Uma Thurman was about to say before she got that bullet in her head, which obviously didn't kill her, but only made her more angry. The bullet was courtesy of Bill, as mentioned in the trailers so I'm not giving anything away. He has a nice twist of his own, which serves as the last line to Vol. 1, leaving it in a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Where Vol. 2 will go, it's hard to say. If it is anything like Vol. 1, which I imagine it will be, then most are in for a real treat. KILL BILL is a great movie experience, with Tarantino at the wheel. Enjoy!"

And ""Kill Bill"" is exactly that. It's a MOVIE.<br/><br/>It's cool. It's style. It's kinetic. It's a great achievement of film of a movie maker at the top of his game.<br/><br/>Very few movies actually reach a level of going beyond the ""typical"" style of a movie.

","Kill Bill<br/><br/>There's something almost hypnotic about a screen face full of Uma Thurman staring directly at us and demanding `Wiggle your big toe.' She says this so much it starts to dawn on me that maybe she's speaking in code. Or perhaps I then realized shes so convincing in this one scene,that she could be spouting any mundane detail and I would think she is whispering the secrets of her life. Truth be told,a life was almost what she didn't have. We know her only as `The Bride'.  A young women whos whole purpose is to take aim and revenge at the very people who killed her daughter and laid her in a comatose state for 4 years. The film opens with just what the film trailers promise, revenge. This film is so raw ,obtuse and prurient, that I started to love it.  Kill Bill slays,guts,beheads,shreds,kicks,cracks and amputates everything that comes on frame. In fact sword use was so often used that when I generally here gunfire from film,I hardly flinch,let alone notice. Taranatino made me jump twice. This film follows all the formulas of kung fu films of the 70's and spaghetti westerns of the 60's that Quentin even has a cute homage of Feature Presentation at the start. He acknowledges his own work and even continues his small micro cosmic universe that he created years ago. We see Resevoir Dogs get a chinese influence,Red Apples cigarettes and Uma winking at Mrs Mia Wallace. The film is brilliant and an experiment in squibs that I now understand the reason for 2 volumes(due in February). Who could possibly sit through 3 hours of this film and not become aghast? A marketing ploy this is not. He realized the power of his own creation. He realized the energy of it. He knew a break for the audience was needed. Surely he was right. Making this into more of an epic would hurt the timing and pace. It's storytelling is choppy and unpolished. We remember very little of dialouge  that we usually get from Quentin. There is no `Dead nigger storage'. It would be to hap hazard to recommend this film for fan boys, as they are not interested in knowing if this film is good or not. There mind was made up months ago. Kill Bill was a blood thirsty treat bag and it reminded me of the first time I saw the Wild Bunch. That too was frightenly brash that I had to watch it again and again. Good films do that. I think I'm going to Kill Bill."

","Wow, this film packed a wallop. While it had some little flaws (weapons allowed on planes? how do passports and cash simply materialize when necessary? etc.) the action is truly great. And the filming of the action was clear enough to follow, unlike the trend nowadays to splice so quickly you can't even tell what's going on. It is way up there with the goriest movies I've ever seen. I'm trying to think of similar gore levels in movies that are not just all about splatter...Braveheart? Maybe I'm thinking of that cause that film had such visceral sound effects like some of the ones in Kill Bill. But man, the blood does fly and so do body parts in this, and I can't imagine anyone disappointed by the levels of gore. Artistic gore! Clever and new gore! But aside from that aspect of the film, is a great throughline of intent. The Bride is so strong and focused...you figure she'll get out of Vol. 1 just fine cause there's Vol. 2, but still, it's exciting to see how she does it. And yeah, I want to know the back story - when the cliffhanger came at the end, I really wished Vol. 2 was spooled and ready to go. I would have sat another 2 hours right then. I can't wait for more. As for the ""boycott"" trend, come on. Did any of us boycott Empire Strikes Back cause we felt gypped that Star Wars continued on? How about Matrix fans, obligingly ready for 3rds even after crappy 2nds followed a good 1st? Get off the $10 high horse and see 2 parts of a good movie, and forego paying for some crap movies you know will suck, if that's what it takes. Hell, I went to a matinee today which was $5.

","Spoilers below. Proceed at your own risk.<br/><br/>
Ok, that was definitely the best movie of the year. Truly a magnificent work. Just one warning: this movie has blood. LOTS AND LOTS OF BLOOD. FOUNTAINS OF BLOOD. If you don't like fake blood, don't see this movie.<br/><br/>Now, on to the review. As you all know, Uma Thurman's character, (whose real name we don't know because QT bleeps it over) was attacked on her wedding day in the chapel. They kill her fiance (husband?), and as we assume, her daughter (at the end of the movie, Bill says that she's alive). Four years later, the Bride (Uma Thurman)  wakes up, kills the guy (medical assistant?) who's been pimping her comatose body for all those years (""My name is Buck and I'm here to  f*ck""-yes, that's a line from the movie). Then, she takes his truck(the ""Pussy Wagon"") and goes off. But before that, as she is lying on the back seat of his truck, trying to regain control of her legs, we see the lfe story of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), told in anime (anime lovers, rejoice!) While I'm no expert on anime, I liked it.<br/><br/>Then, of course, she kills two of the atrackers (Lucy Liu and Vivica A. Fox), in a dazzling array of martial arts. And, of course, since this is Tarrantino, the second movie takes place earlier than the first.<br/><br/>While I'm going to spend most of the time on the first murder (the one you see in the trailer), the second one was awesome. Basically, she breaks into Vernita Green's (Vivica A Fox) house, and they trash the living room fighting. Then, however, her four year old daughter comes home, and they delay the fight, since the Bride doesn't want to kill her enemy in front of her daughter. They go into the kitchen, and as she i preparing cereal for her daughter, Green tries to shoot the Bride, and Thurman kills her. Then, however, we see her daughter standing in the doorway, seeing the whole thing. As she leaves, the bride says: ""When you grow up, if you still feel bad about this thing, then I'll be waiting"" :shock:<br/><br/>Ok, the second murder is what is what most of the movie is about. It's hard to describe, you have to see it, but basically, it involves fights between the Bride vs 17 yr old Japanese schoolgirl, the Bride vs. the crazy 88 (that's the scene you see in the trailer), by the end of which, the floor of the nightclub is covered in bodies, and of course the Bride vs. O-Ren Ishii. Great stuff.<br/><br/>Now, there is also a scene where this Okinawan guy makes her a sword. While I know that the actor who plays this guy is some kind of martial arts movie legend, I don't know anything about it.<br/><br/>Anyways, this was a great movie, and I truly think this is the est movie of the year. ***** (that's out of 5, in case you don't know)."

","Number one, I like this movie very much.  After the tired explosions and blah direction of this summer's blockbusters, this is a breath of brisk autumn air.  I gave it 8 of 10.  Little plot, great action, wonderful looking!<br/><br/>Now, does this mean it should be seen by everybody in the ""R"" realm? ABSOLUTELY NOT!  This is a tough, brutal film to watch.  To quote David Strutt in a previous review here, this is ""fight porn"".<br/><br/>Many others here will tell you how great this movie is viscerally.  Blood as paint, perhaps.  I just feel the need to add how brutally non-stop the graphic violence is.  The body (and limb) count is extraordinary.<br/><br/>So my question is, if this wasn't Quentin Tarentino, would this have been released in its current incarnation with an ""R"" rating?  If so, this is the most violent film I've ever seen with such a rating.  I don't see how this is even in the same ballpark (or planet) as Woody Allen's ""Anything Else"" which was also graced with an ""R"".<br/><br/>Maybe it's time for an ""R-17"" rating, since ""NC-17"" seems to be taboo.  If we are going to have ratings at all, use them as they should be used. ""Kill Bill"" should be ""NC-17"" Period."

Uma Thurman shines, in more way than one, as the protagonist of the film, and each character is as interesting as the next.  The colors and abstract camera angles (multiple use of the bird's eye angle) keep your eyes glued to the screen, and the original music (made by the RZA) and other music complements the film with perfection.

Lucy Liu, as O-Ren, is spectacular.  Need I continue?  Honestly, this is the kind of film that if you weren't already interested in, you're not gonna like later.  It is an ultra-violent tribute to Japanese chop-socky films, masterfully done by Quentin Tarantino.  It's only half a movie...but twice as good as any movie deserves to be.  And no, it's not quite Pulp Fiction...(not yet) but what is?

To quote ""Trainspotting,"" ""Take the best orgasm you've ever had and multiply it by a thousand and it still doesn't come close.""<br/><br/>The music, which is always a key aspect in Quentin's films, was dead on. The cinematography was beyond belief.  Acting was superb, especially Uma, she came out like a rocket.  The humor is the epitome of comedic excellence with jokes you wouldn't expect from a kung-fu flick, and others you would(like the spewing, lawn sprinkler-like blood effects).  ""Pussy Wagon."" Haha!  The action sequences rival all Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, and Jet Li films put together.  Just all around awesome.

Although there was a lack of the recognizable Tarantino vulgarity(that I personally love), the gore covers the swearing's ground.<br/><br/>Still, ""Kill Bill: Vol. I"" takes the cake for the best film (so far) this year, quite possibly one of the best of the decade, and puts Tarantino back on the tongues of movie-goers of all sorts."

"aelthuin_shalei","Null","0","0","10 October 2003"," Living up to High Expectations
","Quentin Tarantino is one of the most interesting and capable writers of today's industry. He is able to write scenes of pure dialog, completely omitting camera changes or actor blocking, and not lose the interest of the viewer. As we see in Kill Bill, he is also able to direct scenes of almost complete stillness without losing momentum. There is something in Japanese belief that places an equal importance on negatives as on positives. The art of sushi perfectly illustrates this in the balance of the food and the empty dish. Similarly, there is much stillness in Kill Bill. The balance lies in the stillness, or humanity, of the characters and their acts of inhuman violence. Tarantino seems to have created a very-nearly-perfect balance of vengeance and humanity, and of comedy and drama. This is not to say that Tarantino has created a very-nearly-perfect film. It has its flaws, and the viewer must remember not to take the film too seriously. However, the film was paced, choreographed and in all other respects directed with the finesse of an artistic master. It is not the film but Tarantino that must be taken seriously. Kill Bill was undoubtedly the bloodiest film I have ever seen. Just as in old Kung Fu films, the body count for a two-minute film clip would easily reach double digits. In many minds the graphic violence will be the most memorable aspect of the film, which is unfortunate. Tarantino's sense of humor is evident in the film, as is his self-confidence. It was a thrill ride from beginning to end. An unregrettable pleasure. This film is far from a common pleaser - it is not for everyone. As a great enjoyer and admirer of Tarantino's works, I had great expectations and was not disappointed in the least. If you enjoyed his previous films you can't go wrong with this one. If we can expect to see the same style and flow in the second volume then I will gladly pay twice to see the whole story. February can't come too quickly."

"nikecjc","10","0","0","10 October 2003"," Amazing Storytelling
","At the end of his career, renegade and brilliant director Quentin Tarantino will be known from movie critics and fans for two movies, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The first, being his Indie-cult classic that paved the way for his distinct, vivid storytelling ability. The second being his rise to commercial stardom with an ensemble cast perhaps second to none.<br/><br/>
It revived the career of former icon John Travolta, introduced Uma Thurman to the big stage, and also reminded us of the brilliance of numerous actors. Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, and Eric Stoltz are just a few. Oh, and that Samuel L. Jackson, well he just went out and stole the movie with an unforgettable performance as everyone's favorite character, Jules Winnfield. (That bad mother...you know the rest)<br/><br/>This previous paragraph would be undeniable for almost any true movie critic and fan. Sure there was Jackie Brown, a very enjoyable and well-acted movie that most Tarantino fans hold very dear to their heart. But it never hit mainstream like some thought. It never really caught on as one of Tarantino's true classics.<br/><br/>That all changed on October 10th, 2003. When Uma Thurman was going to Kill Bill. The preview had an auspiscious debut late last winter with a few cheesy promo clips showing Uma Thurman with quite a large sword, not that type of movie, and surrounded by several martial artists, in business suits and Shakesperian masks. Huh?<br/><br/>Almost a year later and Volume 1 of Kill Bill finally arrived. And while Volume 2 is still 5 months away waiting for February to arrive. Kill Bill will not only be added to Tarantino's impressive lineup, but it will stand with Reservoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction as true classics from the mind of the most innovative storyteller to direct in the past 15 years. Sofia Copolla is well on her way, but she is no Tarantino as of yet.<br/><br/>Film highlights? I don't want to ruin the fun. Uma is absolutely brilliant though, and looks more beautiful than ever. Tarantino once again tells us this story through his usual unorganized, yet perfect, method. We are introduced to each character, their story, and their relation to Uma's character abtly titled, ""The Bride"". Vivica Fox helps the movie get off to a strong start as villainess #1 and while we are teased with a sexy-return by Daryl Hannah, Lucy Lui then bursts out onto the scene with beauty and acting-grace with the beautiful, yet completely deadly O-Ren Ishi. Michael Madsen's ""Budd"" is foreshadowed and we even get a peak at the infamous ""Bill"".<br/><br/>Any more details outside of some amazing fight scenes, squirting limbs dumping out thousands of gallons of blood, an amazing battle pitting Thurman against countless of the afforemention well-dressed martial artists, and as usual, a perfect soundtrack (headed up by Wu-Tang Clan's true genius, the Rza)...this leaves Kill Bill: Volume 1 as an amazing movie to watch and enjoy.<br/><br/>Just save the popcorn for the next less-bloodied and limb-losing movie. I thank Tarantino for this amazing movie. And the best way I can think to, outside of this review, is by seeing Volume 2. I recommend you do the same."

","'Kill Bill' provides a variety of Kung Fu like sequences in a simple but clear plot, with strong influence from Chinese and Japanese films. Uma Thurman, in her yellow jumpsuit reminiscent of Bruce Lee, is absolutely fantastic in portraying the sweet motherly figure - with a tough tough edge! Don't mess with this girl!<br/><br/>I really liked the way that the graphically violent scenes are almost reduced to a comical, hilarious joke - some of the scenes are serious, but some are downright funny. The brief switch to manga style sequences in the film is particularly effective at portraying the anger and lust for revenge felt by most protagonists in the film.<br/><br/>The mellow background music and peaceful atmosphere surrounding the gory battle scenes - which are very unlike the over-mystified crap being shown in some recent movies - is quite reminiscent of the way 'Clockwork Orange' had used music to intensify the violence shown onscreen.<br/><br/>The major thing I strongly did *not* like in this film was the fact that it was split into two parts. I believe that with some proper editing, the film could have been released as a long feature in one part. I believe that the abrupt cut in the middle of the story is quite frustrating to viewers and leaves you with the feeling that the whole business of film sequels is being carried a bit too far lately.

Though it is slightly draggy in one section, this is truly a work of art and it should be viewed as such.  Tarantino is a master with complex storylines (""Pulp"") as well as complex ones (""Reservoir"").  This is a simple revenge thriller/comedy filtered through the warped mind of Tarantino until it becomes nothing but a giggle-inducing rocket trip to the moon and back. Tarantino takes such exquisite care with every frame, every second until what we are ultimately left with feels very polished and very deliberate which doesn't take away from the intensity for a second.  The weird thing is, I absolutely ABHORR action films and elongated fight sequences.

The story is good enough to keep you interested and yet you know in your heart you've read better.  You get to the point where the story begins to pick up a little and then you put it down never to pick it back up again?  I've done that so many times I can't fathom how many half-read books I have on my bookshelf.  Quentin Tarantino's (Pulp Fiction) new film KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 is very much like that.  It's watch able, it somewhat compelling, and at the moment it begins to pick up, the credits roll.<br/><br/>KILL BILL stars UMA THURMAN (Pulp Fiction) as The Bride (I prefer to call her *Bleep*, cause early in the film they bleep her name out three times and I thought it was kind of funny), a women on a quest for revenge.  It seems *Bleep* was getting married when a group of really bad dudes crashed the party, killing everyone, including her unborn baby.  That is except for *Bleep* who somehow and against all odd survives and now she's out for blood.<br/><br/>She begins picking off everybody who was involved in the plot to murder her. In Volume One she meets up with Vernita (Vivica A Fox, Juwanna Mann), now a housewife with a husband and a child and O-Ren Ishi, a sexy underworld leader in Tokyo.  She also makes friends with an old Mr. Myiagi type (Sonny Chiba, Immortal Combat) who designs kick ass swords and quotes old eastern proverbs like they've gone out of fashion.<br/><br/>To be honest there isn't much to talk about concerning this film.  Except to say that its pretty violent in a silly stylized way, the action scenes are well worth the price of admission, and that unlike most movies this one is missing a core story.  We never find out who The Bride is, we don't know why Bill (played incognito by David Carradine, G.O.D.) wants to kill *Bleep*, and we don't know why  *Bleep* doesn't have a name.  It's just one action scene after another and we're not quite sure whom to root for.<br/><br/>Of the movies that could have been split up into two parts this film is not a prime candidate  (1995 Gettysburg would have probably faired better in two parts). The way it's edited now it feels like a pilot for a television series and not a film.  I'm not even quite sure if I liked it or not. There's not enough here to make a distinction.  I guess it looks really good, the action sequences are top-notch, and there's an anime sequence that would make a great short by itself.  Other than that it's an action film that is really not about anything.<br/><br/>As for the performances, the only one that sticks out is Lucy Liu (Ballistic: Ecks Vs. Sever) who has an amazing screen presence to begin with.  In fact if there is a character in this movie that's worth rooting for, it's her.  But I think that's because she's the only character that the film digs deep into.  The aforementioned anime sequence is her back-story.<br/><br/>
Come to think of it KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 is like the first two stages of a `Double Dragon' type video game.  Each scene has little guys you need to kill and then a boss.  I guess Bill will be the final boss, let's just hope that he's a hard kill.  Cause I want Volume 2, to lift Volume 1 out of the gutter.<br/><br/>So at this point I reserve judgement either way until KILL BILL: VOLUME 2 is released in February.  Cause right now it's on that thin line between a great movie and a mediocre one. On it's own it's only worth the price of admission to action freaks and kung fu enthusiasts.  All others would probably do themselves better by waiting to see both movies together,<br/><br/>
Please Quentin don't let us down.<br/><br/>*** out of 5 (This could change pending VOLUME 2)"

","KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 (2003) *** (D: Quentin Tarantino) - Uma Thurman is great in her role as a vengeful femme fatale in a film that's good, if not great. PULP FICTION was better, but KILL BILL VOL. 1 still has much of the vintage Tarantino style that fans devour. It's fun, but uneven and disjointed. I'd just like to take a moment to praise the opening scene of the film; it's positively brilliant and compelling.<br/><br/>The action sequences deliver the goods but perhaps push the credibility factor somewhat (I had a tough time accepting that Thurman alone could so easily defeat an army of sword-wielding Asians!), and I could have done without the cartoon segment. Other than that, the fight scenes were entertaining if bordering on overkill at times. In fact, as for the controversy surrounding Miramax's decision to split the film into two parts... while I did have a good time for 90 plus minutes or so, I'm ultimately glad they did it; I for one was ready for Intermission Time by the end of the picture."

","First thing is that I'm a huge Tarantino fan. So are a lot of people apparently, thats why this Kill Bill film has gotten so much buzz. This flick tries to put too many different cliches together and ends up not knowing what its own true nature is.<br/><br/>The characters are very nicely cast- especially Uma- she plays her part perfectly. The goryness is what, in my opinion, takes this movie down from what it could be. Although I like the whole cutting heads, and limbs off thing, the blood spraying out like a fire hose gets real old real fast. And the matrix esqe 'her against a 100 guys fight scene' at the end is a tad overdone. I would have liked to see her fighting Lucy Lui for a lot longer then all that 10 guys at once stuff.<br/><br/>If you love Tarantino films like I do, you should like this flick. If your not a huge fan then you might be a bit dissapointed. Those seventies kung-fu flicks where cool during the 70's but the whole idea is really old now."

","I saw this flick at a sneak preview on Tuesday October 7th. Some background here: I Love Quentin Tarantino. I loved 'Reservoir Dogs', and 'Pulp Fiction', and 'True Romance'. 'From Dusk 'Til Dawn' was kind of lame (it started out cool), but I thought perhaps he and Robert Rodriguez were sort of screwing around after their new found power. Next, I didn't really like 'Jackie Brown', and I Hated 'Four Rooms' (except for the Robert Rodriguez segment). I became worried. He didn't make anything for a long time, and I figured since it seemed like 'True Romance', and 'Pulp Fiction' were essentially vicarious cathartic childhood fantasies exercised through film (even though I loved them), I feared that Tarantino had graduated to the lifestyle of the rich, famous and creatively dormant. It's like he didn't have anything to fantasize about anymore, because he had enough money to live it for real.<br/><br/>So then we all hear about this ""Kill Bill""...The story line sounded lame. Some chick goes around dispatching revenge on her enemies for the ENTIRE film?... and I wasn't impressed with the Trailers for 'Kill Bill'. It looked to me like Charlie's Angels and that scared me.  Tarantino's movies are close to my heart and I didn't like the last few pieces in his body of work. As I stood in line for the movie I had the lowest expectations because I didn't want to be disappointed, and although I was really rooting for it too be awesome, I felt underneath the movie was NOT going to be very good. I jokingly told my girlfriend ""be ready, because if this movie isn't good there might be a riot up in here when it's over"".<br/><br/>So there we were... the movie starts, and I have knots in my stomach. I am looking up at the screen wincing and cringing, afraid to laugh wholeheartedly at the first few funny lines.... The kitchen fight from the Trailer plays in full -totally different music then what is shown in the preview, different pace, and rearranged lines. Better... Compelling...Well Timed... I begin to breathe a little.. I fear that I am going to be fooled into liking it for a moment, and that suddenly something LAME will happen.... My stomach is tight, my nerves are a wreck.... More of the movie unfolds... About one third of the way in my skeptism is being beaten into submission.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Tarantino and have yearned for the freshness of 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', and 'True Romance', then I warn you that this movie is so wonderfully perfect, so skillfully woven in Tarantino's trademark style that some moments you will be close to tears of rejoice. This movie is an instant classic. I will say to the film buffs who complain Tarantino is trying to rip off Bruce Lee's yellow 'Game Of Death' outfit, and 'Green Hornet' Mask, and various other notables by watching the 'Kill Bill' Previews, that you WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED when you see how these elements play out in the film.  This movie is like a long lost friend! This movie is like finding a diamond in the rough during a drought of long spell of unimpressive movies, where audiences are left with the likes of 'The Fast and Furious'. This movie is love at first sight!<br/><br/>I can't speak for the rest of the audience but EVERYONE seemed to love it as much as me AND everyone lingered around until the end of the credits like they wanted to lick the bowl afterward. Take my word for it, if you are old you will feel young again. If you are young, you will feel like you are watching a part of cinema history.... Vol. 1 is so good that I don't even mind waiting around for Vol. 2. (even though that idea still sucks, you will see what I mean.) And though I despise the idea that I will like something that EVERYONE IS GOING TO SURELY LOVE and will be so hyped it will make me sick, I cannot deny the kick assityness of this masterpiece!"

","The film is a masterpiece, my favorite of the year. Tarantino has really outdone himself, the film is amazing. Every scene is something new and unbelieveable. The film is style over substance at its most equal point. Candy is for children. This film is visual narcotics. Its addicting and memsmirzing. You are sucked into the intensity and immensity of the magificent masterpiece. There are constant homages to the films he loves. The fight scenes are near mind-blowing as well as hilarious. A 17-year old Japanese girl in a school girl uniform wields a long-chained flail in a spectacular battle that will leave hundreds dead. They die with gushes of comical blood and join their fellow obstructions wiggling limbless or headless on the blood-red floor. Uma Thurman kicks ass and the film's fight scenes top without FX what the Matrix did with FX. Ok. I need to stop I am hyping the film way too much. Just see it. If your a QT fan you'll enjoy. Otherwise, if your a Bergman type guy pass because I do not want to hear your bitching."
"jdesando","Null","0","0","9 October 2003"," An echo of Shakespeare's supreme ability to focus on a single theme
","Quentin Tarantino's joy in filmmaking has been apparent from `Pulp Fiction."" Now it shines in colors, ballet, beauty, and focus as never before in `Kill Bill.' Uma Thurman embodies for him the ideals of grace and intelligence, vigor and violence, as she vengefully pursues murderers of her child and almost of herself, 4 years after being left for dead but awakening from a coma in a very bad mood.<br/><br/>In an echo of Shakespeare's supreme ability to focus on a single theme while creating layers of sub plots and themes, as for instance in `Hamlet,' Tarantino has crafted a cornucopia of cinematic styles and genres aiming at one target: the broken line of revenge. Othello describes its path: `Till that a capable and wide revenge/ Swallow them up.'<br/><br/>From the titles, the director shows a willingness to play with song and genre: Bad Bill is about to shoot his wounded colleague in the head while the director plays Nancy Sinatra's `Bang Bang,' as macabre and appropriate a choice as I could think of; second only to that is the whistle tune Darryl Hannah is almost dancing to-- Bernard Herrmann's `Twisted-Nerve' theme. And the violence of this title sequence reminds me of the assassinations in the director's other famously violent flick, `Reservoir Dogs.'<br/><br/>Everyone by now knows the director is honoring the Chinese grindhouse kung-fu films of the `70's and the exciting Japanese anime films.  One of the revenge ballets is in anime style, a powerful evocation of a child's outrage at the murder of her father done in the style that transcends cartoon to accentuate the meaning in an almost surreal world. Anime was made for Tarantino.<br/><br/>Although it is tempting to compare `Kill Bill' with `Crouching Tiger' for its martial choreography and the presence of Lucy Lieu as a villain, Tarantino goes way beyond `Tiger's' lovely violence into a nasty but beautiful world of courage and carelessness, camp and cunning.  `Kill Bill' is simply smarter than `Tiger' because it focuses on the textures of revenge, enlisting our sympathy for Uma the assassination machine while explicating the inevitability of the revenge drive.<br/><br/>Does `Matrix' apply here? No, because Matrix confounds with an artificial complexity. `Kill Bill' never loses sight of its theme; it just pleases the audiences with the multiple cinematic ways to express it. At the beginning of a fight sequence, Lieu says to enemy Thurman, `You didn't think it was gonna be that easy, did you?' To which Thurman replies, `You know, for a second there, yeah, I kinda did.' It is easy to like this movie."

","Yes, it's got a b movie plotline. Yes, it pays homage to everything from Shaw Brothers Kung Fu flicks to Spaghetti westerns to Kurosawa to every exploitation movie ever made. It even has a Japanese anime sequence. And yes, I realize that, as I've described it, Kill Bill: Volume One seems pretty unoriginal.<br/><br/> But mark my words, it's like nothing you've ever seen... Nothing.<br/><br/> I also realize that from the trailers, the movie looks kinda silly, and it is. But there's something going on beneath the surface that I can't quite put my finger on. I've only seen it once (four days before offiicial release at a press screening) so I'm not quite sure what that thing is yet. Rest assured, I'll see it a few more times before it's all said and done.<br/><br/> However, I think much of it has to do with the performances. Uma Thurman just plain blew me away. Much will be said about how physical a performance this is, and that's true, but that's not what impressed me the most. What really got me was the raw emotion she brought to the role. In a film where many implausable things are taking place, she grounds us in a stark reality. And what about that Luci Lu? After Aly Mcbeal, the Charlie's Angels movies, and Ecks vs. Sever, I had all but permanently stricken Mrs. Lu from my cool book. Well, she is absolute dynamite in this film! She's frightening, funny, sly, and even sympathetic.<br/><br/> Much will also be said about the film's violence. And yes, it's gleefuly violent. Cartoonishly violent. Ironicly enough, the least cartoonish violence in the film is in fact a cartoon. I defy anyone to not be disturbed by the amime sequence. But after a day or two, you'll start thinking about that opening sequence. Nothing funny about that. Then you'll rethink The House of Blue Leaves segment. Yeah, it's funny, but there's something about it that's just... unsettling.<br/><br/> I've tried to claim that this movie might be serious when actually, I'm still not sure. But I've thought about it constantly for the past three days, so there must be something deeper going on.<br/><br/> Then again, maybe not. Either way, kudos to Mr. Tarantino for, yet again, making a movie for an audience of one and getting away with it.<br/><br/> He's 4 for 4 in my book."

","Last night I saw the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life: Kill Bill. This movie did everything I wanted it do and then showed me what I had no idea I wanted to see. Quentin Tarantino made the movie that I always wanted to make and did the same stuff I have dreamed to put into a movie. For this I hate him because he made my movie and it looks awesome. That being said, he's created an awesome satire on the traditional action movie with his combination and use of setting and story telling.<br/><br/>Tarantino uses alot of signature moves in his 4th film, for example starting the movie en medius res and detailing each point before backing up or moving on to the next. The score (which I belive is orginal) has an offbeat 70's feel to it with some very classic chords that could have been taken right out of a Bruce Lee movie.<br/><br/>Although at times it is a bit jumpy when it comes to the plot the movie isn't really made for the plot here. The plot is very well summed up in the title and really says it all. The visiual effects and use of multiple locations makes this a movie that could make Tarantino the icon of the 00's action movie making."

","Spoiler Alert! Our heroine, Uma Thurman (The Bride & the Black Mamba), once a member of a group of international female assassins, quits the group after becoming pregnant.  She is about to be married when her boss, Bill (David Carradine), and the other assassins turn against her, and kill everyone at the wedding.  They leave her for dead, with a bullet in her head.  She survives and awakens from a coma after four years, and the only thing on her mind is revenge.  She strikes out to kill all the female assassins, leaving Bill for last.  If you like a lot of killing, you will like this movie, because about 50 people were killed, most of them by Thurman with a samurai sword.  The fight scenes in Japan are over the top, because they show arms, legs, and heads flying, and bodies squirting blood like hoses.  The film usually went to black & white when the killing began.  Thurman is one killing machine, and the knife fight with Vivica Fox (Copperhead), and sword fight with Lucy Liu (Cottonmouth) were very well choreographed. The film ends like a soap opera, letting the audience know that someone else at the wedding survived, and that she has three more names on her death list. It was better the second time I saw it.

","I saw ""Kill Bill"" with two of the biggest film critics in America two weeks before it will come out. Sitting alone in a small 20 person theater and watching Tarintino's triumphant comeback was thrilling, to say the least. Watching it a second time at a 400+ person promo-screening, two days before it's national release was even better. I knew every time when the blood-crazed audience was going to go nuts. I knew which scenes there was going to be an explosion of applause. And I know that the rest of the world is going to like this movie... Now, I said 'like', not love.<br/><br/>There is nothing not to like. Tarintino's vision of an hommage to 70's 'B' kung-fu chop-sockey flicks is nothing short of genius. But you must understand: 'B' movies are not good. This movie is not good! But that's what makes it great, if that makes any sense. It's a typical revenge-driven ""You-killed-everyone-I-love,-now-I-will-kill-you"" plot; Seen it a million times on any TNT or TNN made for TV movie. However, there is so much trademark Tarintino-ian style and careful crafting of  this bad 'B' movie, that it turns out wonderfully. From the out-dated flash-zoom pans, to the cheesy sound effects, to the laughable dialogue, make no doubts about it, this is the best-worst movie of the year. And what a cliff-hanger at the end!!!! I've seen the movie twice before it was released, and now I'll probably pay two more times to see it in the theaters again!<br/><br/>And yes, Uma is hot."

""Kill Bill"" is Tarantino at his finest -- intelligently irreverent and violently entertaining. I would love to describe the opening scene, but I wouldn't want to spoil it for any prospective audience member: it can't be described -- it must be experienced. It's absolutely hysterical.<br/><br/>
""Kill Bill"" is a salute to the spaghetti Western and cheesy Kung-Fu film as only Tarantino can deliver it. ""The Village Voice"" described ""Kill Bill"" as one of the most violent films in the history of American cinema, but I would strongly disagree. I have a hard time stomaching extreme violence -- odd for a Tarantino fan, I realize. I turned my head whenever [unnamed character]* gets his head blown off while riding in the car in [unnamed Tarantino film]. The violence in ""Kill Bill"" is purposely excessive; it's like what you would expect from an R-rated cartoon. ""Kill Bill"" is the only film in which I have laughed uproariously after watching someone get their head chopped off.<br/><br/>

"soanim8ed","9","0","0","26 September 2003"," Big, pulpy fun
","Spoiler Alert!! It's quite apparent from Kill Bill Volume One that Quentin Tarantino has not lost any of his love for pulp fiction.  From the opening black and white sequence of Uma Thurman to the final almost touching final fight scene with Lucy Liu, Kill Bill has the makings of an epic cult film.  I say cult film because I'm sure the movie will polarize audiences. Tarantino takes some big risks with his film genre bending and mixing. Most of them pay off.<br/><br/>The action sequences that were talked about are actually not as sustained as rumoured. In fact, it really shows a sign of maturity in Tarantino that the action takes breaks so the audience can take a breath before the characters start in on each other again.  It makes the characters more human, too, since even those in the best shape could not withstand these constant pounding without taking a short breather.<br/><br/>
The story?  It's a revenge plot, plain and simple, and as pulpy as those get.  Plus the actors are all quite up to that task.  They all go about chewing up the scenery, which fits quite nicely into the film as it's set up.  It's good to see Thurman again. Here she takes the lead as The Bride with much vigor and attitude because The Bride is p***ed.  Her old assassin team has killed her entire wedding party and even tried to kill her, but didn't quite finish the job.  Now she wants to get even.<br/><br/>And it's great fun.  With over the top fight scenes with heads and limbs flying to bodies squirting blood like hoses, Tarantino is wearing his cheesy gore film influences on his sleeve.  There are several film genres here and the best is the back story on Lucy Liu's character when the film switches to Japanese anime to set up the audience for the second half of the film which takes place in Japan.  The dialogue is more classy in this half of the film only between Thurman and Liu.  Instead of using the F-word (as Tarantino is want to do in his films), they shoot more witty barbs at each other as if there was once great respect between them.  This sets up a scene at the end of their fight that is actually touching and makes The Bride human instead of just a killing machine.<br/><br/>Of course, the film ends with a cliff hanger because Miramax didn't want to release a 3 hour plus film; however, with some creative editing it ends nicely and sets up for Kill Bill Volume Two.  It gives hints about The Bride's husband, the baby she was carrying, how she was found after going into hiding and her relationship with Bill to name a few things.  All of which are very soap opera, but a soap that is very stylized and willing to take chances.  None of this would have worked had it not been for Tarantino being self- aware he was just making a big piece of entertaining fluff.  In other hands, it would have just been another over-wrought pile of junk.  And even if Miramax cut it in two, it's nice to know that they have allowed out a film that tries to push the envelope."
"elevator_lobby_B","Null","0","0","26 September 2003"," A failure both as film and as parody.
","It's hard to believe that a Tarantino film with so many beautiful women, so much violence, blood, swearing could be so very very boring.<br/><br/>As if genuine camp was in short supply, Quentin Tarantino felt the need to manufacture camp in his latest retro-chic-martial-arts-satire saga, Kill Bill. His efforts are not successful, his goal is not noble, for if there is anything more pitiable than genuine camp it is counterfeit camp.<br/><br/>The film opens with promise-- a stark black and white closeup of a badly beaten Uma Thurman (who's character name was not made known at the press screening), ostensibly held at gunpoint by an assailant somewhere out of frame. The scene is well devised and builds tension, culminating in a moment of horrific violence, and indicates that there is an intense film experience to follow. What actually follows is a laughable slapstick nod to Hong Kong action cinema, to which Tarantino claims he owes everything.<br/><br/>
I cannot use the term homage, for an homage does credit to its subject's fine points. This only debases the merits of Hong Kong cinema-- delivered with nil grace, shot with an eye for retro whose novelty has worn off long ago, the film moves at the pace of a sputtering race car. Lightning fast at points, painfully slow at others. It is clear that Tarantino means to drag us through the mud-- these lapses in pacing are no accident. It's unfortunate that his film builds to nothing. Even as an Austin Powers style parody, the film is weak-- not even a knowledge of Hong Kong action films can cultivate an interest in Tarantino's plot twists. To say the least, Tarantino has a funny way of paying his respects-- if I didn't know better, I'd swear he was cruelly mocking Hong Kong cinema.<br/><br/>There are a few bright spots, however. Uma awakes from her coma, only to find herself without the child she was bearing at the time of her assault. A twisted sexual assault follows, as does her swift revenge. The scene actually manages to be dramatic, and for a moment fools the viewer into thinking that the film may undergo a change of heart. Alack and alas.<br/><br/>A long anime vignette is certainly one of the high points in the film-- stunningly animated, these scenes are exciting, edgy and exhilerating, even though the departure from and return to live action is wholly unwarranted and seems to have been done simply for the sake of appealing to a wider base of high school underclassmen.<br/><br/>Watching Kill Bill, it is hard to remember that he ever made Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, films that perfectly nailed the line between hard-as-nails crime flick stereotyping and substantive cinema. Both films were funny, hard hitting, powerful, and resonated long after the screen had faded out. But in Kill Bill, Tarantino simply aims to get a few chuckles out of the scads of frat boys that he knows will attend his film by the hundreds. A beheading here, more severed limbs than you could count, sprays of blood, Tarantino cannot clera the bar of his previous works, and it's a shame. Luckily, the film makes it clear that it is not to be taken seriously. If only it were entertaining enough to carry its own weight."

Starting with O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and moving on to Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox). This is about the head and tail of the story.<br/><br/>Many have commented about the action sequences - claiming them to be `absolutely incredible' and the like. I, however, was not so impressed. I believe that the action is bland and lacks imagination (we can see Tarantino at his keyboard now - `and she cuts him in half'). A film which has achieved this much press and good reviews should be prepared to offer the viewer something they haven't seen before but, alas, Kill Bill fails in this department as it does with so many others. We see eyes coming out (yeah, done better in Evil Dead), we see people being cut in half (better, even, in 13 Ghosts), arms being lopped off and simple stabbings. A generation desensitised to screen violence, however, will see nothing that foreign films haven't beaten 5 years ago. I found myself becoming very bored, even during the `great' Crazy 88 scene. Not even an interesting new angle was used to capture these events. There is an exception however. The fight between Chiaki Kuriyama (of Battle Royale fame) and Thurman is very well done.<br/><br/>The style of the film is another area of concern as it both succeeds and fails on different levels. I really liked the soundtrack and I enjoyed, also, the use of Japanese dialogue and subtitles to talk about areas of American society (such as pizza etc). This is probably where the humour ended for me. The editing, I would say is atrocious.Why is there so much rubbish cluttering up the film? Sally Menke must have been sitting there going `you know Tarantino if I cut out all the unnecessary stuff then not only would it be more exciting but it would also take the running time down'. Tarantino then must have crooked his eyebrow and said  ""no,  thanks anyway. Ok, now zoom into her toe -1,2,3,4, and back to her face -2,3,4 - and back to her toe -2,3,4' etc. Oh and wasn't Tarantino pleased to get Sonny Chiba involved - ""yeah Sonny you can play your character from the Hattori Hanzo TV series. Guess what I believe we can gicve about a 15 min dialogue scene for no reason"". The character of O-Ren Ishii also did not merit her screen time. I do believe that there are some nice little touches that most people miss but a few will linger on. The fact that the Green Hornet theme (very cool TV show/comic) plays when she is on that plane is pretty sweet. Thurman makes references to `Kato' masks (Bruce Lee's character in The Green Hornet) and the very tracksuit she is wearing is Bruce Lee's from The Game of Death. Perhaps I just left bitter by these references because I, and some others know, that this knowledge comes with commitment and effort - and all these people will leave Kill Bill thinking that they are `really hardcore' without putting the work in. There are also subtleties that add depth to the film such as the perception of Bruce Lee vs. Bruce Lee when Thurman takes on the Crazy 88. She is dressed in the enigmatic tracksuit of the ultimate martial arts legend while the 88 are done up in Kato gear (where Bruce played second fiddle to Van Williams). Seen in this way, the film could be said to be about racism but based on the content of volume 1, however, there seems to be little to justify these moral undertones and they seem to be slotted in to substantiate the film. The movie, however, is stylish, and we are never left thinking that we are out with the hands of a capable film-maker. The story moves fluently and is swift but this said however, and I hate to end with negativity, the reason we have this security during the film is that it is so familiar. The zoom in to the eyes is very Shaw Brothers, the banister action left me looking back to Crouching Tiger and the dialogue sounds like a Tarantino rip off. I can't say I wasn't disapointed.<br/><br/>The best way to describe Kill Bill is to compare it to a `best of' music album. The new comer may buy it and feel satisfied but the experienced fan of the band wouldn't be so keen. To hear people talk about the greatness of Kill Bill is to hear the man who has just bought `The Best of the Beatles' walking up to a Beatles fanatic - claiming to be just as experienced with the band. It is exactly the same. Perhaps I could add another star or two to the current award if Kill Bill had any fresh ideas or visions. As it stands, however, Kill Bill can only be reviewed on its merits which I feel are limited. The line between inspiration and plagiarism isn't thin, its very substantial. It is in this area that I believe Kill Bill has fallen short the most. Lets take a moment to think about Tarantinos intentions for Kill Bill. If it was released as a B-movie then nobody would like it. They would say the film is `unoriginal', `poorly constructed' and `pretentious'. Kill Bill wants to be a B-movie and I commend the efforts but at least they are creative and artistic. Kill Bill is just a mess. Ah well, maybe volume two will make it all work . . . until then branch out with your movies. Let Kill Bill be only an appetiser to the world of cinema you have yet to experience."

","I didn't see KB1 when it came out because it was almost exactly how I expected - minimal plot strung together by a series of bloody fights. Anyway, I decided to give it a chance. I had to fight the urge to turn it off after the first fight scene. It was very unbelievable and went down hill from there. There were many scenes which insulted my intelligence but the hospital scene was probably the worse. After just coming out of a lengthy coma, she was able to undress a grown man, then dress herself in his clothes, pull herself into a wheelchair, wheel herself out of the hospital into the parking garage (none of which she had seen having been in a coma since her arrival) without being stopped/questioned by any hospital staff, then pull herself up into an SUV. However, she didn't have enough lower body strength/control to move her big toe once in the SUV. Yeah, right!!! Of course, believability isn't mandatory when you're making your own movie. When QT sells a script, I'll be the first to check it out. Until then, I'll leave his special brand of Sci-Fi for those with less logical minds."
"axlroseisgod","1","4","12","14 April 2004"," Overrated, but fun.
","Yeah, so last night I saw Kill Bill, Volume 1 for the first time. I just don't know.<br/><br/>
As far as mindless fun goes, Kill Bill is entertaining. It is fun to watch. And yet, I can't help but feel disappointed and cheated. This movie doesn't live up to the expectations set by Quentin Tarantino's past work. Nor does is it deserving of all the critical acclaim that it has garnered. As I write this, Kill Bill Volume 1 is #90 on the user-voted IMDB.com Top 250 Films list. Kill Bill is certainly not one of the best 250 films ever made.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kill Bill is very lacking in plot, to the point where it's insulting. Uma Thurman's character, The Bride, awakes from a coma and then kills two people and escapes from hospital room despite having severely atrophied muscles. She gets to the parking lot, where she sits in a stolen car for an indeterminate but decidedly exorbinant amount of time. Then there's an idiotic scene where she tries to urge her atrophied toe muscles to move by yelling at them. In a ""brilliant"" directorial decision by Mr. Tarantino, the camera then zooms in on her feet. Somehow she doesn't get arrested in all this time that she's sitting there. I guess she must have killed the only guy who worked at that hospital, since apparently no one called the cops on her. Equally questionable is her ability to travel at will despite having no discernable source of income and no ID. I'm sorry, but without ID, you're not purchasing airline tickets in post-9/11 America.<br/><br/>One of the biggest faults of the movie is that it is hard to empathize with The Bride. Yeah, her entire wedding party was killed and she was in a coma for 4 years. Maybe she deserved it. In Hard To Kill, you feel for Steven Seagal. You learn more about the two members of Bill's Deadly Viper Assassination Squad that The Bride kills than you do about her. In that regard, you empathize more with them, especially Lucy Liu's character.<br/><br/>
Perhaps the most badly done part of the movie is the soundtrack. It is just terrible. In some scenes, there is an obnoxious siren effect when The Bride encounters danger. Almost every standout scene in the movie has pretty bad music. The first scene with Daryl Hannah's character stands out in this regard as well.<br/><br/>It's hard to understand Tarantino's goals with Kill Bill. The movie unquestionably draws from 1970s kung fu movies and 1980s action movies. But it's hard to tell whether the movie is paying tribute or merely a parody. The acting and the dialogue are both pretty abyssmal, but not hilariously so. None of the actors ham it up; in fact, they're all quite wooden which I guess their equivalent of attempting serious acting. Keanu Reeves looks like Shakespeare in comparison. The use of old school gore effects is also questionable. If you watch a 1970s movie using the spraying blood effect that Tarantino (over)uses in KB, it seems silly and trite. But if you watch an old movie using the same effect, when that effect was state of the art and the film quality was much grainier, you're able to reasonably suspend disbelief. The best way to pay tribute to old kung fu movies would be make a new movie that draws from them but brings them into the 21st century. Tarantino fails to do this. The only thing Tarantino has updated is the direction. And his frenetic flashy direction is a definite lowpoint of the movie. It's quite apparent that this movie was a labor of love for Tarantino, but his cinematography is quite detrimental to the movie. It was obviously meant to be artistic, but it comes off as pretenious, banal, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. The movie plays like anime, and bad anime at that. Good anime develops a compelling in-depth plot involving complex relationships that justifies the excessive gore we are shown. The fact that anime is animated also makes ludicrous gore seem less funny. There's an inherent level of surreality in animation. Kill Bill lacks this.<br/><br/>As a whole, Kill Bill doesn't add up. The parts don't fit together well enough and something about the movie just feels disingenuous. As an action movie fan, I was let down. There is NOTHING about this movie that gives an edge over the movies it emulates. At best, Kill Bill stands on par with old school action movies, and I'm not convinced that it does that. There's a level of intensity present in a Rambo movie or an old Jackie Chan movie or a Lethal Weapon or a Schwarzenegger movie or even a good Seagal movie that just isn't there in Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts On Tarantino: Your first three films are classic. This is not. Stick with what you're good at.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts On Kill Bill: It's entertaining enough, but not better than what came before in any way, shape, or form. If you want a good post-coma revenge story, watch Hard To Kill. If you want copious violence, watch Commando or First Blood Part II. Those two movies are straightforward action romps devoid of the forced pretentions of Kill Bill. One good thing that Kill Bill does is that it doesn't intentionally pander to the popcorn crowd. Tarantino is definitely trying here, but he falls short.<br/><br/>Final Rating: 3.2 out 5 stars.<br/><br/>Slightly above average."

","In this film, the first of two, the Bride, betrayed and abandoned to die by her groom, Bill, get her revenge route. Directed and written by Quentin Tarantino, the film stars Uma Thurman and David Carradine.<br/><br/>This is a film that can be good, but definitely is not for me. I like some of Tarantino's films, but definitely I cannot understand this one.<br/><br/>The performance of the actors is regular, the special, visual and sound effects are very good and the soundtrack, given the circumstances, is interesting. The main problem of this film is the non-linear narrative. This option simply does not fit in the film and makes it more confusing than it would be in a conventional narrative. Its an artistic resource, undoubtedly innovative, but that should be used when not hinder the understanding of the public. The public has to understand the movie, and it does not happen here. A person who knows nothing about this film, which has never read anything about it, don't understand it, and discards it.<br/><br/>The film's screenplay is interesting, although it has been virtually copied from another movie (""Lady Snowblood""). But despite the basic idea is good (the bride betrayed by her groom, abandoned and nearly murdered in his own marriage), the way the film develops it is quite negative. First of all, the film doesn't explain Bill's reasons. Surely he didn't wake up that day with a sudden urge to kill the bride, and this lack of rational explanation makes the situation far-fetched. Another problem of this film is the illogical manner it displays and mixes raw action scenes, western scenes or Japanese scenes. From a certain point, the film seems made with pieces of film found in a garbage dump. There is no logic in the way the film shows it."
"sandnair87","9","3","8","31 March 2015"," If Revenge is a Dish, Kill Bill Vol.1 is Lip-Smacking Delicious!
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is Quentin Tarantino's giddy homage to the movies he grew up with—the Hong Kong chop-sockies, the spaghetti Westerns, the Yakuza-samurai actioners, the Japanese anime and the American blaxploitation flicks, reshaped by the writer-director as a sort of reverie of adolescent enthusiasms. <br/><br/>The plot has a direct-action vividness suitable for a video game that walks a pretty straight path, especially for a Tarantino film. Cleverly constructed in five labeled chapters, from ""The Blood- Spattered Bride"" to ""Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves,"" the movie expounds the tale of The Bride (Uma Thurman with the look of a chiseled humanoid, in a physically arduous role) whose rural El Paso wedding is invaded by The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and turned into a bloodbath, leaving her trembling and bloodied. Four years later, rising out of her comatose state, she sets out on an unwavering mission to systematically eliminate her former cohorts one by one, beginning with the now domesticized Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), and the formidable O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), before tracking down Bill (David Carradine), the eponymous focus of her vengeance.<br/><br/>Firmly in fan-boy mode here, Tarantino prepares his revenge dish like a skilled chef, chopping and tossing it in an astounding spectacle that's as alluring as the meal itself. And because it's Tarantino, the bloodletting is in full flow. With heads severed and arms lopped off, he pelts us with stylistic jabs even as spouts of red spray the screen. It is a homage all right, but with an extra dollop of ketchup! Tarantino relies on delirious, high-octane camera work, an exhilarating musical soundtrack and wonderfully choreographed sequences (watch O-Ren's origin story told as a spectacularly brutal 7-minute anime or the designed-to-be-legendary showdown between the Bride and the Crazy 88s or the final confrontation between the kimono-clad Ishii and The Bride against the floating snow-flakes) to punch up a story that never loses its intoxicating magnetism. <br/><br/>Kill Bill is Tarantino's highly idiosyncratic and deeply personal excursion into a world of movie-inspired unreality. An unapologetic pulp scribe, Tarantino thinks nothing of dropping scores of allusions to the beloved pop culture of his youth into The Bride's universe. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is Tarantino in vintage form!"

","Some said this movie is sexist because the lead woman set out to kill mainly women. Some said this movie is racist or fascist because the winner is so white she's blonde and the losers are mostly non-whites. Some said this movie is just glorified glossy violence with fashion. Without these offensives, the movie has nothing else to offer. Tarantino said the movie is FUN, precisely because of the sexist and racist and senseless violence aspects! <br/><br/>They are all correct.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is not for everyone. If you have an average kind and gentle heart, basic self-confidence, okay love life, very little power envy, very little bitterness in your soul, if your pleasure does not depend on the pain of another, you will be bored or repulsed by this movie.<br/><br/>This movie had great success with the following:<br/><br/>1.

Kill Bill is a designer costume cat-fight, orchestrated by man for the pleasures and profit of men. Men shall feel strangely reassured and empowered after watching this ""female-centered"" movie.<br/><br/>2.

"ElMaruecan82","10","3","8","24 July 2011"," In 2003, Master Tarantino Forged us his Finest Movie ...
","A big slap in the face proving me once and for all that Quentin Tarantino is the most gifted and creative director of his generation. ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" isn't just one of the most thrilling and stylish action films ever, but also a captivating tale of revenge, justice, honor and redemption, incarnated by one of the most iconic characters of the 2000's, ""The Bride"" : Uma Thurman in an Oscar worthy performance. And not only ""Kill Bill"" is a career-defining film for Tarantino, the director, but it also establishes his unique talent as a storyteller.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a blood-splattered face that belongs to ""The Bride"", whose name will be 'beeped' all through the film. We see the massacre and foresee the recurrent theme in Tarantino's films : revenge, defined by the opening sentence as ""a dish served cold"" and the haunting music that interrupts the Bride's ""Bill, it's your baby "" directly plunges us in the darkness of her comatose state while she mourns an irreplaceable loss and wonders why 'her baby shot her down'. As usual, music plays a crucial part in a Tarantino film, with this unique power to get us in the right mood, and I can't think of any movie that pulled the strings of my emotions with such virtuosity, I can't think of a movie with a greater soundtrack. Music is Tarantino's language that translates what images and words can't express. And considering the film's style and the scenario, this is saying a lot.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" pays tribute to the famous Kung-fu Asiatic B-movies that replaced the Western Spaghetti during the 70's. These movies were famous for their choreographed fighting, Shakespearian-themed badly dubbed over-the-top dialogs, and stylish violence. What they lacked in budget, they made it up with style, something that the action genre cruelly lacks now. Call them cheesy, dated, laughable, but never underestimate the talent required for probably the most difficult genre to handle. Action requires a meticulous editing, and a tactful direction, and more than anything, it needs authenticity in the story, the hero, the motives, the emotions. ""The Bride"" is a wonderful cinematic creation embodying all the classic heroic virtues, a woman who got the crap of her life, beaten, husband and relatives massacred by Bill, leader of the 'Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', and an unborn child. She couldn't even get a break at the hospital, when the nurse, Buck, used her as a sex doll. But Buck brings a client the wrong night when she decided she won't take it anymore. He gets his comeuppance, and she gets her car, poetic justice.<br/><br/>The fight scenes in ""Kill Bill"" transcend the charm of 70's Kung-fu films, revering through them a whole culture, that brought up so many iconic images and beautiful stories of virtue and courage. As a kid who grew up with the mangas, I can't describe how I felt when watching the chapter about O'Ren Ishi, and how the violence orchestrated by the incredible Luis Bacalov's ""Big Duel"" music brought tears to my eyes. And our empathy to O'Ren's back-story foreshadows our satisfaction when The Bride will get her revenge. When O'Ren kills Boss Matsumoto who ordered the death of her parents, she was literally savoring his blood like the exquisite taste of the cold dish. More than the music, the images, the action, ""Kill Bill"" takes time to introduce all the Bride's targets on which she swore revenge. The first to die is Vernita Green, now a homemaker with a five-year old girl, coincidentally the same age as the Bride's daughter  if she was alive. She'll witness the brutal death of her mother, a sad illustration of the implacable 'eye for an eye' rule.<br/><br/>Each character has one moment to shine in. Elle Driver is introduced under a nurse's disguise, visiting the comatose Bride for a lethal injection, whistling the iconic 'Twisted Nerve' theme, before a serene male voice interrupts her and cancels the order for ethical reasons. O'Ren is chronologically the first target, her crew is composed by Gogo Yubari, a sadist schoolgirl-dressed bodyguard, Sofie Fatale as the half-French, half-Japanese right-hand and her henchmen, the Crazy 88, lead by Johnny Mo. Before getting O'Ren, The Bride asks the legendary sword-smith Hattori Santo to forge her a sword. This part is the last calm little moment before the storm, conducted by the beautiful Zhamfir's score ""The Lonely Shepherd"". Here again, I applaud Tarantino's musical taste as the themed beautifully embodied Samurai values with a Morriconesque melody, a beautiful melancholic sound before the music gets more frenetic. Following the ""Bumblebee"" song, the Bride tails O'Ren in Tokyo to the last stand in a Japanese restaurant, where a bare-feet female band plays some catchy Japanese Rockabilly.<br/><br/>The fight that follows is the climax the movie needed, screaming villains, sounds of strident gurgles, geysers of blood painting the floor in red, over-the-top, stylish, a pastiche of whatever fascinates us in Martial Arts films. And we know the Bride will be victorious, because she deserves to. And Tarantino has a way to show the fight, after having thrilled us with a poetry that would have made Kurosawa proud, the last shot of the Bride dominating the restaurant's floor is like a ""Ran"" painting. And the concluding fight with O'Ren, with the 'Santa Esmeralda's instrumental sound, concludes with O'Ren apologizing for having mocked the Bride, as a last redemption ... before joining her parents.<br/><br/>Of course, the movie features Tarantino's trademarks, the non-linear narrative structure edited by the late Sally Menke, the action, the violence, a foot-fetish to the extreme (not for my displeasure though) but more than anything, it's about honor and revenge, and the last minute featuring the shots of the second volume, transported me again with Zhamfir's music, brining some tears back, and hooking my heart with one of the most shocking finales ever, with the last line starting by ""One more thing, Sofie """
"Ziya90","10","3","8","6 March 2010"," The perfect mixture of art and entertainment
","I did not know that this movie has also a lot of haters who gave it only 1. I am not a blind Tarantino fan who gives every Tarantino movie 10 out of 10 and I am not one of the critics who try to cover up the flaws in his movies, but we should accept that he is a very good filmmaker. Personally, my favorite Quentin Tarantino film by far is Kill Bill Volume 1. It is quintessential cinema, also a pure mixture of art and entertainment. Kill Bill Vol. 1 has one of the best opening sequences ever, black and white visuals and that great music. I believe that put his directing talent aside, there are two things that he is great at: writing dialogs and music. Like Romance and Cigarettes, Kill Bill is a music collage from the old goods. All the tracks are great and the important thing, so coherent with the content. Visually and even including content, Kill Bill is one of the most colorful movies so far. This was the first cat fight I saw and probably there is not any other better. It seems that to shoot a cat fight scene is very hard rather than planned choreography. People don't fight in front of children in this movie, I know that Tarantino is not such a sensitive director, but I appreciated it. The second part of the movie is like a very stylish modern Western like No Country for Old Men. It is slow paced like Once Upon a Time in the West etc. The plot of the movie is also one of the most engaging and exciting ones, a revenge movie wouldn't be better. As for the anime, how a creative director Tarantino is. I had not seen any anime before, it made me like anime. However, this is quintessential anime, so my favorite in short length. Honestly, still I am not an anime buff at all and I haven't seen anime for a long time, but this is special for me, I watch it as occasion serves. The assassination part was too short, at least to me, because I did not want it end, that's the only problem. The maps recall atari games. Animes, atari games, Tarantino uses all of them. When I was a child, I loved the scenes in the movies which the hero of the movie chooses a weapon, sword from the collection, for example Red Sonja. While watching Kill Bill, I recalled Red Sonja. The story editing after the bride goes to Japan is weird (from the plane till the motorbike), in other words, there are time lapses, but this is not a flaw, it does not make us feel like the editing is scratchy and may be otherwise, the movie might have been pretty cliché, but still Tarantino could added somethings. The sword fights in this movie is the greatest, the longest, the most entertaining one and the most stylish one. I forgot how many times I watched this chapter, almost 50 from 2003 till now? The violence here is not sick at all, like Hostels or Rambo 4, it is not 'explotationish' like Saw movies and it is not disturbing like Romero's zombie movies, yes it is extremely bloody and violent, but somehow looks pure mixture of art and entertainment. It also deserves to be put in action cinema anthology. Especially editing and choreography is great. The last chapter. The place, atmosphere had seemed me superficial when I watched the movie for the first time at theater, but after, I thought that may be it is supposed to be. This chapter is so reposeful and still, it is like relieving tiredness part, not only for the characters, but also for us. Then, great Spanish-like music and Carnage of Flowers, my favorite track. By the way, I couldn't decipher the meaning of the ewer. As for the ending, one of the most impressive finals ever!"

","I think that this film is a clever masterpiece. If I could say that there's anything wrong with it; it's that its almost too clever (if that can even be something wrong). From the beginning Tarantino absolutely just bombards you with various amounts of imagery. What I find absolutely interesting about it was the combination of colors used from the set design to costume. From start to finish this film is just completely psychedelic. This film is also stunning when it comes to the sound effects used. You get this real sense of a subliminal mythology; and there's even an arc between films when you see the product of cigarettes advertised in this film that's mentioned in Pulp Fiction. But the thing is just when you think Quentin's run out of ammo...wait...there's more..."

I just saw it again for the second time and loved it. Uma Thurman kicks so many asses it's funny. Not since Pulp fiction have I enjoyed such a Tarentino film. I loved the original Kill Bill. I did also see Kill Bill Volume 2 when I was young and dumb. I didn't like it either. But I bet I will have the same treatment as the first one did. I bet I will love it also. Kill Bill has so many awesome scenes. Including the final scene where Uma Thurman slices up Lucy Liu's accomplices. Or the part where she is about to be raped and she bites the guy's lip off. Kill Bill is an awesome film experience with great Martial Arts sequences. You may not want to see it, but I think you should see it anyways.<br/><br/>The Plot: A woman wakes up from a coma and seeks revenge on the people who put her in the coma.

Mind you I was 13 at the time and didn't care about the ninties or the awesomeness that is Pulp Fiction (yet).<br/><br/>So I watched Kill Bill vol. 1 and was glued to the screen for 1 hour forty-five minutes. Uma was super cool as the Bride and as she hacked up all them crazy 88's, I was having me one helluva time cheerin her on. My favorite scene though was the last fight between her and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). It was so well done and had me afraid for a second that The Bride would die, only to be made very happy when she scalps O-Ren! <br/><br/>It was the first hyper-stylized over the top bloody gory slice n dicer I'd ever seen and it warped my already deranged mind. To conclude, best movie ever made, maybe."
"DonFishies","9","3","8","16 May 2006"," Tarantino's comeback does not disappoint
","Kill Bill: Volume 1 marked the return of Quentin Tarantino, one of the most innovative directors of our time, after a six-year hiatus (his previous film being 1997's disappointing Jackie Brown). Even though it was split into two parts, the first two hours of Tarantino's epic bloody masterpiece still resides with me as the better of the two.<br/><br/>While this film really does not get into much of the key story line that Volume 2 taps into, it still introduces us to ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman). She's a deadly assassin who was once part of what was known as the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. She decides to leave the squad one day, settle down and create a family. The squad feels otherwise, and their leader, Bill (David Carradine), sends the squad to kill her. The entire wedding party is decimated, and they leave The Bride for dead with a bullet in her head. Four years pass where The Bride is in a coma, and what proceeds after she awakes, is the start of a personal vendetta to kill all the members of the Viper Squad who ruined her life.<br/><br/>It may not sound like much coming from an auteur like Tarantino, or very original for that matter, but his brilliance makes it original. Through his stylish use of dialogue, story telling, martial arts and especially camera angles, he creates an absolutely amazing film that makes us remember why he was anything to talk about in the first place (along with a beautifully drawn anime sequence). This film is something to see to believe. It has its intensely violent moments, but it's done so tastefully that it ends up looking like a modern piece of artwork, and not something horrifically violent. The choreography in every scene is just so perfect, that it cannot be seen as anything but art. His gigantic colour palate, flying between uses of black and white, to all sorts of colours, is just astonishing. It really brings into question why this film missed out on an Art Direction nomination at the Academy Awards that year (or any award for that matter). It is intensely violent yes, but the way it is done is artful and brilliant. <br/><br/>Thurman is fabulous as the blood-soaked weeping Bride, and she makes for a great anti-hero for the ages. The way she comes at this role is just so hard-nosed and strong, that it gives wonder to where all this acting talent has been bottled up for so many years. A faceless Carradine serves as the main antagonist, and serves excellently in the scheme of things. The supporting cast, featuring Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and Sonny Chiba all are perfect in their roles, no matter how short. But the real supporting character to watch for is Chiaki Kuriyama, who first got noticed in Battle Royale. She had a bizarrely frightening aura about her there, and it translates flawlessly to her role here. For as small as the role gives her, she steals the show, and proves her worth. If only she could continue getting roles like these.<br/><br/>Another key greatness to the film is in the music. As has become standard for Tarantino, much of it is ported over from old tunes from the likes of much older Japanese Martial Arts films. But, just like those older Tarantino films, they flow beautifully into the film. Every blood soaked arts filled image has excellent and memorable music to go behind it that leave powerful visual images in the viewer's mind. They give it an authentic and distinct feeling that is so much different than most modern Hollywood made film. In a way, it just shows how Tarantino can make every facet of the picture work, and make it visually astonishing to the eyes.<br/><br/>As long as you can stomach the intense graphic violence, Kill Bill: Volume 1 is not one to have missed out on since it's initial release. This homage to the great Martial Art films of yesteryear is both insightful and brilliant. Tarantino has returned with a vengeance, and I can only pray he keeps it up.<br/><br/>10/10."

","I first heard about this movie over the radio. I really thought it was like a depressing drama where someone's kid dies, and blah blah blah... But then I saw the clip where Lucy Lui swipes off Boss Tanaka's head, and I thought I'd watch it, because Lucy Lui is one of my favourite actresses. I saw it in a hotel room, and I immediately liked it. My mom thought it was too gory and violent, and therefore wouldn't let me buy it. But it was my birthday, and I got one of my friends to buy it for me. Reluctantly, my mom let me keep it. I'm so glad she did. In my opinion, it was one of the best action-comedy movies ever made. I don't know if it was originally meant to be a comedy, but I found it really funny. The fight scenes were, as could be expected, very unrealistic, but nonetheless great fight scenes. The only problem I had with it was the extremely unrealistic amount of blood that squirted everywhere when someone died. It was a little over-exaggerated. Oh well, it was still a great movie for fans of gory, funny, action-packed, cult movies."
"1babelfish","9","3","8","12 January 2005"," Brilliant. Storytelling. Period.
","I loved this movie, as I do all other Quentin Tarantino films, simply because it is a simple story with one central theme, revenge. It doesn't get much simpler. Usually a movie with a bland central theme will not fair to well; however, they way in which the story is played out and presented is what makes it so great. In addition to just being a brilliant story, the way music is used throughout the movie gives a quirky yet not at all out of place feel. The first volume is most definitely the more gory of the 2. Whereas, Vol.2 gives more of the back story. Also, there is a wholly different feel to the second one which is most likely why the two movies were separated even though they were a single story."
"rightwing_redcoat","7","3","8","8 January 2005"," Good enough, but not as good as people say...
","I watched this movie some time ago, having been drawn in by all of then hype about it. I went in expecting a insanely violent action flick, as others had told me, and I was not disappointed. However, what I was not prepared for was the wave of almost worshipful comments and reviews that I was hearing about it. People were saying that this was a ""masterpiece"" and I believe it is on IMDBs Top 250 at #58. I honestly can't comprehend this. I mean, yeah it was entertaining, but that was about all. This movie had loads of style, but little or no substance. As I've said before, there's nothing wrong with that, but if that's the way a movie is made, it does not deserve to be on the Top 250. Take Lucy Liu. She is really a one-dimensional, cardboard villain, if you will, serving little purpose other than killing 20 minutes, allowing Mr. Tarantino to make 2 Volumes. The same with the first person killed in the movie, and the character of Elle Driver. The only really fascinating character from this movie was Gogo Yubari. In all, I believe that this movie was very entertaining, but also highly overrated. Watch it for a good, ultra-violent action flick, but don't go in expecting something on par with true classics."

","WARNING: No one who doesn't want to see billions of gallons of blood, severed limbs and super-duper graphic violence should ever see this movie...period. It is the most violent film I have ever seen and find it amazing it didn't get an NC-17 rating. I guess you can't show nudity in American films but bloody graphic violence is okay! What a world. This isn't a complaint against Tarantino--but one about the current insane rating system.<br/><br/>This film is not for everyone. In addition to the graphic violence, the film is an Americanized marital arts film with overtones of Italian westerns. If these sort of genres are not something you'd want to see, then once again the film is not one you'd appreciate. As for me, I am a huge fan of martial arts films and Spaghetti westerns, so it was right up my alley--even though I am not a fan of ultra-bloody films. And, because I have loved the films of Sonny Chiba and Shaw Brothers martial arts films, this movie is an absolute must as it is a loving tribute to the genre. So many references to these films are buried within the film, it's best you look through IMDb's trivia section before or after you see the film--then you'll REALLY appreciate the film! In addition to the martial arts angle, the film happens to be perhaps the coolest movie ever made. And, the coolest part of the film, to me, is the music. The soundtrack is simply brilliant and bizarre--from the haunting music of Zamfir to the quirky Japanese all-girl surfer band, the 5, 6, 7, 8s! Almost as cool are the costumes and characters. The 88s, the insane school girl assassin and the rest are really ridiculous but so, so cool. And, the film gets super-high points also for its strange style--ranging from an anime film within the film, a black & white segment and action scenes that go on practically forever! There is a lot more I could say about this film, but considering that it was released seven years ago and there are a zillion reviews for it already, I'll cut this short. While the film is intensely violent, for what it is you simply can't find any better. It is, in the action department, as good as it gets.<br/><br/>By the way, this is not a criticism of the film, but have you ever wondered why folks in films of the genre NEVER use guns to stop the hero? You'd think at least ONE of the 88s would have been carrying a gun in the huge fight scene in Japan!!"
"Quinoa1984","10","3","9","10 October 2003"," Arguably one of the most potent treatises on 'genre' film-making that you'll ever see
","After seeing Kill Bill Volume one tonight I am certain of two things: 1, Quentin Tarantino, mastermind behind Kill Bill as well as the smash hits Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, is the only filmmaker that can walk the tightrope of doing an unfortunate rip-off and a brilliant homage without falling onto the wrong side. And 2, I agree with his logic now of splitting his epic in two parts, if only because of the climactic battle between The Bride and the Crazy 88 fighters- any attempt to top this within the same time frame of a three hour+ motion picture is ridiculous. By doing so, Tarantino leaves us with one of the most violent (and I mean that as a compliment, since when violence is frowned upon in movies that means it's impressive instead of tongue-in-cheek like in horror films), visceral, and definitely entertaining films of the year. After seeing it once, to which I'll probably see it again, I can say that it's my favorite movie-going experience of the year.<br/><br/>The Bride, her nickname in the group Black Mamba, is killed off (or so they thought) by her fellow partners in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. When she awakes from her coma four years later, she regains her consciousness of what she must do- kill the four partners, and then her boss Bill (played by the immediately recognizable, if only by voice, David Carradine). In volume one she goes after Vernita Green (Copperhead), and O-Ren Ishi (Cottonmouth), and like in Tarantino's past efforts the story is told in a non-linear style that gives answers first, questions later. But these story elements are, unlike his past films, just little details. Even to those who won't like Kill Bill and I know they have their understandable reasons - for Americans this will be one of the most violent films they may ever see, and for marital arts/kung-fu fans on Asia this will be something standard, however in parody. But the violence is done with the message that it's all stylized, and that Kill Bill is a triumph of style over substance is a compliment the haters may feel poking at them (I'd say though that kids under the age of 12 and character-study film buffs should stay clear of this one). As an avid film-goer, I found that there was so much to soak up in Kill Bill that at the least it contained some of Tarantino's most daring direction, taking chances that paid off, and borrowing to the point of a true transcendence of the material.<br/><br/>One thing I love in a movie, personally, is when certain images or scenes stay in my head long after the film is over, and there are a few in this one that are still buzzing in my head as I write this commentary. The climax is impressive, yet the sequence that had me completely riveted was the Japanese anime sequence detailing the background on O-Ren Ishi. Like much of the rest of the film, it has bloodshed, intense close-ups, and quick editing. But there was just something about this whole sequence, the emotion that came through it. I'd have to say it's one of Tarantino's finest moments (and equal credit goes to whoever directed the animation, which ranks second to Toyoo Ashida, director of the classic Fist of the North Star), right up there with the overdose in Pulp Fiction and the opening in Reservoir Dogs. In fact, I also think an equal amount of praise should be given to cinematographer Robert Richardson, contributing heavily to Q.T.'s vision, and his usual editor Sally Menke for putting it all together. Kill Bill volume one accomplishes what it was hyped for- it's a spectacular showcase for devourers of grind-house cinema (while I've never seen any grind-house films, surprising I know, I felt I had seen so much of the genre in this one effort) and for Tarantino's main fan base. And while it is often assumed his fan base if mostly comprised of some film buffs and a lot of guys who like guy-action-movies, having Uma Thurman, Vivica A. Fox, and Lucy Liu (who all contribute great fight/stunt work by the way) turns Kill Bill into something of a chick flick as well."
"petereviews","10","2","5","27 July 2019"," Simply A Masterpiece
","The Good: Literally almost everything. Because a review should have more analysis though, let's talk about the movie's simplicity. The premise is very simple: A woman left for dead seeks revenge from all the people who wronged her (particularly Bill). In that simple premise, however, comes a mash-up of action genres and scenes that simply top each other. The Bride's fight against O-Ren is one of the most visually beautiful moments of movies I have ever seen, but you could make a case for her fight against Vernita, the animated interlude, or any other moment in this masterpiece.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of this movie is top-notch and the way backstory and the inner lives of the characters are parsed out throughout the film is something to behold. If you want to see just action setpieces, this movie has you covered, but if you want to analyze and read more into this film, there are so many details to uncover.<br/><br/>The Bad: The first five minutes of this film are very disorienting and upsetting in a way that I feel is too much for this film (even though it does give us some backstory at the same time).<br/><br/>The feet scene in the middle is too much though.<br/><br/>Conclusion: A masterpiece of a film.

","I absolutely adore this movie. Tarantino's perception of the world is astonishing, I just love how he he can make everything look so incredible. Many fans would file Kill Bill under Guilty Pleasures thinking it's not that good of a movie, but like it anyway somehow. I, on the other hand, reckon this is one of the most underestimated movies of all time. It's just this amazingly executed satire of almost everything, after watching it you're not quite sure if the actors weren't just mocking you for two hours for watching it through or if you just filled an empty hole in your soul that's been aching for ages. I feel like this movie is just a big joke that turned out to be one of the most iconic Tarantino's works, his unique perspective never fails to amaze me, I doubt Quentin himself had thought this would be such a hit. It's just a shame that it's considered a Blokbuster when in fact it should've been nominated for an Oscar or something"
"Angelo-T","10","2","5","5 May 2016"," A movie that defines a genre!
","I write this review, 2 minutes after watching the movie for the first time and without having watched the sequel. In three words, I was thrilled!!<br/><br/>To be honest, having seen most of Tarantino's work, I was expecting a great film but since I had never been the most fanatic admirer of Tarantino (I am more into Lynch kind of movies), my expectations were kind of average.<br/><br/>The close-ups of the director that are full of expresiveness and built-up emotion, the relatively random songs right in the middle of the tense fights, the contrast of colour throughout the whole film make this movie uinque, really unique.<br/><br/>As my friends told me, I am sure that this film hides a long list of references that my level of film critic do not allow to understand and judge. I am also sure that after watching the next film and read all these critics, I will engage in a long round of tracing the inspirations of Kill Bill in classic movies of another era. However, I can say one thing right now: <br/><br/>Kill Bill is a masterpiece and Tarantino is rightly standing in the hall of fame of the greatest directors of all time!"
"nimkal","4","2","5","9 March 2016"," Overrated, and 100% based on ANIME
","In a nutshell, this is Anime. There shouldn't be so much hype about this movie. I really enjoy the other movies by Tarantino, but I feel this movie was basically copy-pasted from already existing samurai styled anime. The story is average. The characters, the roles, the speech, the fighting style, the costumes even, are ALL an exact copy of already existing samurai anime out there. A few examples of such are: Samurai Champloo, Afro Samurai, Rurouni Kenshin, and many more which existed before this movie. I guess those that haven't seen enough anime or Asian action movies wouldn't really know about this and think ""wow this is so original"". It's really not. <br/><br/>Now when it comes to cinematography, sure it was beautifully done, but as for the rest... this movie doesn't deserve credit for fighting scenes and characters that already existed."
"zhongzl-kelley2014","5","2","5","13 February 2016"," I really don't understand why this is a classic
","The CG effects and color blending is perfect, I will give it that, but the plot is boring to death. This is a thousand levels lower than the average Samurai movies I've seen else where, and it can't even smell the toes of mob movies like Godfather. It is a mediocre fantasy of a white girl kicking the ass of a famous Japanese mob, and it has the stink of white supremacy. <br/><br/>First of all, how can an white assassin that waked up from a four-year coma suddenly become a such excellent Japanese sword user, that even beats a mob lead by one of the best Japanese assassin: Oren Ishii? During the time they run around killing people like cowboys with guns and powder, Oren has ruled Japan with her extraordinary sword work. Oren is not just a mob leader; she has a traumatic past and the superhuman gift that allows her to take down the famous gangster: Matsumoto in her first shot at the age of nine. After that, she has always been struggling in the swamp of blood and violence. But she didn't even last 5 minutes in the fight with our bloody bride: four minutes and 59 seconds, to be exact. After she is wounded on the knees, she seems to surrender in her heart. But before that the bloody bride has been wounded all over her body, and has been severely scratched from her back by Oren. The bride is much more physically and mentally exhausted than the elite assassin Oren, how come she is so easily subdued? If this bloody bride is such a genius, how come she was so easily eliminated by the assassins 4 years ago? Watching a whole hall of overlaying corpses displayed in the pool of blood, I sink into deep suspicion. <br/><br/>Second of all, we understand that Bill is a student of Hattori Hanzo. Hattori writes ""BILL"" on the window right after the bride says: ""I have come here for one of your student.""Therefore Bill is one of Hattori's students. Oren also holds deep respect for this retired sword-builder, but Hattori decides to build the sword for the bride without hesitation. He even gave the bride a Japanese Kimono to finish the ceremony of granting her the sword, so he actually hold deep grudges towards those student of his? Japanese mobs are not regretful towards their deeds, they are merciless cold blood murderers: they play by the rule, then they enjoy the success. Hattori has done making swords for 28 years, and he also finished his education for Bill long ago, now he suddenly feel sorry for this strange white girl and decide to overthrow all his gangster philosophy and help to kill his former students? It does make any sense.<br/><br/>The only thing I appreciate here is the camera work and the opponent colors: white and black, yellow and blue, red and green, all the colors render this movie an surreal quality. With the insertion of comic book fragments, I guess this movie is supposed to tell a legend, because the movements and characters are so elegant and fluent and distant like they step off a fairy-tale. The director is perfect, I will give his story-telling techniques a hundred points. But the plot is unfit for a large scale fiction movie like this. Hate to break it to you, Quentin Tarantino, you have to find a better comic book next time."

"james1080-272-547223","10","2","5","15 May 2015"," Bloody Masterpiece
","One of my all time favourites, Kill Bill is heart stopping mind-blowing greatness, every time I watch this movie I literally cheer and shout at the screen as the Bride slices and dices her enemies in bloody pieces. Uma Thurman is simply amazing, her intensity and motivation keeps the movie moving at a relentless pace, her line delivery is bad-ass as she faces up to her opponents, teasing them and threatening them, by the time she stops talking you are just waiting for her to perform some insane fight move. <br/><br/>Thurman plays the Bride, who is gunned down at her own wedding by the highly trained ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"". She is assumed dead but fortunately The Bride awakes from a coma and sets out for brutal revenge, and revenge has never looked so good. The fight scenes are the best ever, all expertly staged with equal jaw dropping violence in each one. Tarantino executes the violence through silence, just before an attack there is virtually no sound, just an atmosphere and a wall of tension, then all hell breaks loose. <br/><br/>The first fight between Vernita Green and The Bride is tough as nails, as they throw each other around the room into cabinets and onto tables. Even the animated scene showing O- Ren Ishii's childhood is splattered with blood and it's glorious. Then there's the unforgettable finale that sees O-Ren-Ishii send in her best bodyguards and the Crazy 88 to take The Bride down. This scene is one that's worth rewinding just to be blown away every time. Blood spews out from limbs like a fountain, heads roll across the floor, arms are torn to shreds and you feel every bone crunch and character pain yourself because it's such an effective scene. Before this scene is the stand off with Gogo Yubari who has a thing for violence, using a swing blade she knocks Uma Thurman about, but she can't be knocked down, she is not to be messed with, and you'll believe me when you see this finale as it is incredible beyond words. Stunt double Zoe Bell deserves an honourable mention for her incredible work! <br/><br/>Would I watch this again? I'd be stupid not to, this is a super slick movie that will leave you breathless, and it stands for me as Tarantino's greatest, one that will be hard to pass, if he makes a third film I will be delighted."
"cerca-sonia","8","2","5","6 February 2015"," Unforgettable
","Like all of Tarantino's film, you love it or you hate it. Presented as a bizarre action film, Kill Bill vol. 1 is fascinating, unforgettable and definitely not a movie for children.<br/><br/>In this film comes to attentions Tarantino's love for Oriental culture: martial arts, katanas and tributes to Japanese directors - the Bride's costume reminds Bruce Lee's in Game of Death.<br/><br/>The score, by The RZA, is overwhelming. The fighting sequences are spectacular, loved the last one.<br/><br/>The performance from Uma Thurman is brilliant.

But for me the plot, action, cinematography this is the best that I have seen. Tarantino when he made this established himself as my favorite Director/writer in the biz. I hope there is a part 3 one day, only one can hope. Only flaw I can really point to in the film is the fake CGI floating in the air in one of the fight scene that mimic Crouching tiger hidden dragon. But as I understand it this film was also suppose to be a tribute to all the early martial arts movies and although I don't like that part its only in one part really and is bearable and doesn't wreck the fight scene. If I could give the film a 9.5 I would but I can't so a 10 is good enough I guess."

I watched Pulp Fiction a few months ago, and I thought it was OK, so I gave Mr. Tarantino a second chance. His way of making this movie reminds me of a 14 yr old telling of a Bruce Lee movie. If you are attracted to fight choreography, I will understand why you might like this movie, but that's not my cup of tea. In order to make a good movie you need to have a good story to tell. It only took me a few minutes to figure out that the story just wasn't there, so I turn the movie off, and made better use of my time."

Also,it references to Japanese especially the samurai movies is very good. Last but not the least,homage to American culture of classic rape and revenge flicks. It is really a good mixture of everything and very entertaining. It's like watching Martial art movie in Tarantino style.<br/><br/>Actors performance's are great Lucy Liu,Daryl Hannah and Chiaki Kuriyama(really liked her in school uniform,)as i heard Tarantino signed her because of his love for her movie Battle Royale and especially Uma Thurman,She is just breathtaking .<br/><br/>The dark humor ,chicks fighting ,non-linear story line,clever dialogues and good cinematography. I really loved the story of O-Ren Ishii ,The animated sequence ,as violent and as amazing as the movie. Our genius director really knows how to depict every character. I have so much to say about this movie, but i think that will be all. Not Tarantino's masterpiece but a different,marvelous and high stylized approach,Thumbs Up. My Score is 8.5 but i am giving 9."
"raphaklopper","10","2","5","27 June 2013"," After ""Kill Bill"", the blonde jokes changed....forever! (And this is the review from both Vol. 1 and 2)
","After the not so successful ""Jackie Brown,"" Quentin Tarantino became a unknown and forgotten legend with only 3 films on his career. 6 Years later Tarantino confirmed his great return to filmmaking with ""Kill Bill"" Vol. 1-2. Many did not believe: thought he had lost his originality; his style would never fix in this new generation, but boy, we were wrong.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"", both part 1 and 2 show the great talent of Tarantino and shows why he is a true legend in cinema. Not only keeps its great and very intelligent originality but also makes a great tribute to the old Kung Fu and martial arts movies alongside with the old classic Western style, all in both Vols. that function as a single movie.<br/><br/>The story begins, with another unforgettable character of Tarantino, ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman). A beautiful blond woman appearing punched and shot in the head at her wedding (that's why she is called the Bride, she was unmarked so the police dubbed in that way).<br/><br/>Apparently she survived, and after a 4 years coma she wake up and find out that she had lost her baby (she was also pregnant). She swear it revenge against those responsible ... their former coworkers and her lover Bill (David Carradine). ""The Bride"" was an assassin who worked for her lover, soon after she found out that was pregnant she run away from the killing business. After a few years their own former colleagues along with Bill went after her to put an end for this betrayal, but they only woke up a sleeping giant.<br/><br/>In the 1st part of the story, we see ""The Bride"" going after the first two targets on her list: O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) the queen of all the Japanese mafia; and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) a 'simple' housewife. In this first part Tarantino shows his great talent in making a bloody violence and also pays tribute to the old kung fu and martial arts movies, all together delivering a bloody battle between ""The Bride"" and ""The Crazy 88s"" (the private army of teen's samurai working for O-Ren) with a direction that is simply superb.<br/><br/>In part 2 we continue with the great quest of vengeance of ""The Bride"" after the other names on her list: Budd (Michael Madsen) the lazy good-hearted own Bill's brother; and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) the cruel new lover of Bill; and also, the man itself, finally in person...Bill. Part 2 differs a bit from Part 1. While the 1st is seemed a crazy and beautiful martial-arts film, the 2nd part is also crazy but now is a true modern Western with angry blondes killing themselves. Not only in action scenes (which are few here) that Tarantino excels directing, but also delivers a fantastic and original writing giving dialogs full of Tarantino smartness and a fun black humor.<br/><br/>Not only that Tarantino is highlighted with a brilliant screenplay and his stylish direction but also the entire cast that fits perfectly into Tarantino style. All simply excellent: Michael superb; David Carradine fantastic as ever; Uma Thurman.... PERFECT, badass, suffering, hilarious, unforgettable.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" was the big return of Tarantino to show that he came to stay. With a story very well written and directed together with unforgettable characters, with Tarantino style more enhanced conquering fans of this generation and won even more in the future but not forgetting this unforgettable classic."
"tbills2","8","2","5","31 May 2013"," Kill Bill: Vol. 1
","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & Kill Bill: Vol. 2; choosing which 1 is best ain't easy. Kill Bill 1 moves along at a slicker pace; Kill Bill 2 has tons more prolonged suspense. The 2 movies are suitably unalike although still equally great. I'll stick to the 1st 1, as I completely understand many would; it's got better action for the most part, but don't sleep on the 2nd 1. Quentin Tarantino joins all his favorite movie genres, kung-fu, samurai, and spaghetti western, in the Kill Bills. Tarantino is the master at creating captivating conversation, delivering clichéd dialogue to a flawless degree. This skill was showcased perfectly in Pulp Fiction. It was done in Inglourious Basterds to a dazzling effect. But the drawn out dialogue in Kill Bill 1, while remaining very entertaining, is oft over-utilized. The talks between Beatrix and Vernita Green a.k.a. Copperhead during their knife fight, the chitchat with Hattori Hanzo before he forges The Bride's steel, and Boss Tanaka questioning O-Ren Ishii's position of power during council are some of the main moments being slowed in accommodation. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is at its best when things are happening at a highly stylized progressive pace. The attentive developing plot, the accompanying narration, the crossover to Anime, the excessively bloody effects, the alarming signature theme when The Bride is zoning in on her target, the quick, slick camera cuts blended with sharp sound and well-placed music in presentation of adrenaline pumping, overly intense action makes Kill Bill really awesome and really badass. The battle between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii and all of her subordinates at the dojo hangout in Tokyo is really insane, and the end stands out from the rest of the movie as being really, really awesome and really, really badass, especially Gogo vs. The Bride. There is no actress better to be The Bride than Uma Thurman. She's heroically merciless. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a superb outing from the entirely too talented Tarantino."
"Marc_Israel_365","9","2","5","26 April 2013"," Delicious and colorful tension with that sporty retro spirit.
","With a blink of an eye, or removal of one, Kill Bill delivers a masterfully and deliciously edited story of a bride fixated on revenge. Paced for a new generation, Kill Bill doesn't simply pay homage via the film genre cooking recipe, it packages each scene as if it's a ""greatest hits"" compilation. Don't flinch due to the sword induced refugee limbs as the storytelling is enhanced by the blood fireworks on display due to the rampage of The Bride. Uma Thurman wins as the ultimate heroine in chic glory. It's her story that Quintan orchestrates as diligently as we've come to expect. The sound track deserves merit, carrying long scenes, and has become a usual character in each Tarantino experience with that sporty retro spirit."
"regienaldg-283-237153","9","2","5","5 August 2012"," Brilliant. Thrilling. Comedic. Intelligent.
","Before I watched this movie, I was intrigued by the title itself. Kill Bill. It was a one of a kind title design, simple but enough to catch attention. The action scenes were fantastic and I must say that the duel between The Bride and Vernita Green was excellent. The fight was perfectly choreographed and was realistic. The showdown at the House of Blue Leaves was a perfect climax. The casting was also perfect. All the actors in this movie did a great job in portraying their respective characters. They brought life to their characters by showing off emotions of guilt and maleficence, Vernita Green and O-ren Ishii in particular. Daryl Hannah did an excellent portrayal of Elle Driver as the guiltless and wicked assassin who has no feeling of remorse. Most of all, Quentin Tarantino proved that he is a master of his genre. He was successful in blending several film genres into one exceptional movie. The only flaw I saw in this movie is the legal implication of The Bride's actions, for example: She killed Buck and escaped from the hospital and was able to stay in Buck's truck for 13 hours without being searched (at that point the police must have traced her in the truck, unless the police in the community were not cautious enough). However that flaw was overshadowed by the movie's excellent story and intelligent conversations. The story is simple yet assertive and provocative. This is a movie that I must have watched a hundred times."
"wolf9288","10","2","5","27 April 2012"," Great and very artistic film!
","Kill Bill Volume 1 is a great film by Quentin Tarantino. It is a film about a Woman (Uma Thurman) who is out for revenge, after she was brutally shot in the head at her wedding, had her baby stolen, and her whole wedding party was murdered. It is very fast paced and action packed. There are tons of gory martial arts fighting scenes and sword fights. The Director Quentin Tarantino pays homage to a lot of old Asian martial arts films throughout the movie. In the opening credits he uses the ""feature presentation"" screen of an old martial arts film, before the actual opening credits begin. There are many fight scenes that are very over the top and cliché as well. One example being the sword fight scene in the snow Japanese garden at night, which looks as though it was taken straight from an old Asian kung fu movie. <br/><br/>The film is full of artistic style. The music of the film is very fitting and does not feel out of place. Much of it has a classic Asian style with a modern twist to it. The lighting is done well, and the grimmest scenes are shot in black and white, such as the scene in the beginning where Bill shoots ""The bride"" in the head. There is even part of the film that uses Anime animation to tell the back story of O-Ren Ishii (Luci Liu), instead of using live action. The anime' portion of the film is very dramatic, gory, and over the top. But it does a great job of conveying the tragedy and terror that made O-Ren Ishii become who she was. Using live actors would not have been nearly as effective. <br/><br/>Some scenes in the film look unrealistic on purpose, and they add to the feeling of watching an old Asian martial arts film. One such scene is the scene of the plane flying over Tokyo Japan. In that scene it is easy to see that the plane, and the city are not real, and that they are models. <br/><br/>Even with the very gloomy theme of revenge in the film, some parts are actually funny. One such scene is when ""Black Mamba"" is fighting ""Vernita Green"" (Vivica A. Fox) in her house, when Vernita Green's daughter gets home from school, both fighters stop and hide their knives, and pretend nothing wrong has happened even as the little girl can see the room is destroyed. <br/><br/>I recommend this film to anyone who likes action films, or old martial arts films. It is one of the best and most artistic films I have seen in a long time. But be warned if you do not like violence this film is not for you."
"fuller32-318-181911","9","2","5","18 March 2012"," The Bride Taking Her Revenge
","Spoiler Alert<br/><br/>Kill Bill: Vol. 1 stars Uma Thurman as The Bride; she is a very rage driven woman and has only one goal. That goal is to kill Bill, who is played by David Carradine. The Bride goes through many different action packed scenes to inch her way closer and closer to Bill. She has to kill many of her past co-workers to get more information about where Bill is, and because she also wants revenge against them. She carries around list of 5 names on it, and she ventures out to kill them all. The list was made up of O-Ren Shi played by Lucy Liu, Vernita Green played by Vivica Fox, Bud played by Michael Madsen, Elle Driver played by Daryl Hannah, and of course Bill's name was the last on the list written bigger than the rest and underlined twice.<br/><br/>In Kill Bill: Vol. 1 The Bride only gets through 2 people on her list of 5, but she kills them herself. She kills O-Ren Shi and Vernita Green. The theme of this movie is a scorned women seeking revenge on the people that hurt her. She is also seeking revenge because she believes these people killed her unborn child. This film is a very unique action packed revenge story. This movie can be compared to the movie Hannibal Rising, which is also a revenge story in a sick twisted way.<br/><br/>Two techniques that make this movie so great are the motif and the angle. The motif in this movie is the Bride staying on one strict path. The whole movie she is on the path to get revenge on the 5 people that hurt her and nothing else. There isn't much else she thinks about other than her revenge. The angle in this movie is the best part about it. The way they position the camera angle during fight scenes and close up face shots to show their attitude during stressful situations. My favorite camera angle during the whole movie is during the fight between The Bride and O-Ren Shi. The angling really make the scene what it is.<br/><br/>This movie is a great action/revenge story that rides the line of being a little cheesy but in a good way. It is one of Quentin Tarantino's great films, and continues to be great in Kill Bill: Vol. 2."

","NO SPOILERS<br/><br/>When I first saw Kill Bill, I truly loved it. It's a masterpiece. I had never seen a film, since The Usual Suspects, with such a good screenplay.<br/><br/>The film itself its about this woman who wakes up from a comma and wants revenge. No more details... So you can see everything I'm telling you.<br/><br/>The film is packed with crazy action and hilarious, extreme, and excessive use of blood. The acting is good. But that's not the reason that made me love it. <br/><br/>If any of you have seen Pulp Fiction you will notice that Quentin never tells you what's inside the mysterious suitcase... He does exactly the same in Kill Bill, but this time, with The Bride's name. Every time someone is going to call her by her name there's a little disturbing, but at the same time funny, sound made. It's that kind of sound that the TV shows play when someone is cursing or saying ""a bad word"".<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it and you consider yourself someone, PLEASE, rent it or buy it RIGHT NOW.<br/><br/>It's a true masterpiece packed with those little details every Tarantino's fans like.<br/><br/>11/10"

"doonanco","Null","2","5","24 September 2011"," GREAT MOVIE!!! but you have to have a taste for it.
","Don't worry because this review is spoiler free. <br/><br/>Kill Bill is Tarantino's fourth film and you have been following Tarantino's work you will know that the first three films have been very successful. This movie does not disappoint. But like most of the directors work the film is a somewhat cheesier type of film. Its ""cheesiness"" is rather unique though because it is not the acting thats cheesy but more or less the style of the movie. If you have seen the films like: Planet Terror, Death Proof and Machete and enjoyed them well then you most certainly will enjoy this film! But on the other hand if you found them fake cheesy and stupid well then you might want to skip this one. All I can say is it really is a matter of opinion and judgement and in my opinion. Tarantino has yet nailed another film!!!"
"thepsychocritic","8","2","5","31 August 2011"," Bloody awesome murder.
","'Revenge is a dish best served cold.'<br/><br/>Welcome to the fiefdom of Kill Bill, a world where blood springs like water from the fountain of youth, heads fly like wild magpies, people are slaughtered like unfortunate pigs and in the end you are still with a sadistic smile lingering on your lips. Kill Bill is a movie about revenge, wrath, decapitation, blood bath, swords, evisceration, assassins; I could go on for a while.<br/><br/>One of those rare films with a female protagonist, Kill Bill is about an –ex-assassin bride (Uma Thurman), who was called Black Mamba in her better days. A bullet has been put through her head on her wedding alter and she has been left for dead; the culprits - her ex-comrades, leader Bill and a bunch of others. But she doesn't die; not just yet. After remaining comatose for four years, she flips her eyes open. First realization - the baby she carried is gone. Second realization - human tongues don't taste very good. Third realization - she has been immobilized from her knee down. Final realization - someone needs to die.<br/><br/>Tarantino's movies have a raw power about them and you can observe that through each of his films. He doesn't delve in being creepy or mysterious. If it's murder, it won't be a carefully injected air bubble in someone's vein; it will be a knife in the eye. Kill Bill takes this to a splendid new level. The movie is certainly not for the squeamish, and even those with otherwise strong stomachs should ensure that they haven't eaten anything volatile before watching it. The gore is immense, the blood flow relentless and the violence would probably make Gandhi pee his pants. At the same time, it doesn't disgust you, and only Tarantino could pull of something like this.<br/><br/>The film has all the necessary ingredients of a vintage Tarantino flick. His direction has a certain child-like quality about it. The title itself seems like a ten-year olds attempt at creativity. The movie has been made as neatly as a courtroom drama - hard camera shots, clever dialogue, rising tension - but underneath, it's an almighty mess; something like a monster dressed as Santa. There is the trademark from- the-trunk camera shot, and this time he even puts in a bonus from-a- bullet-hole-in-the-head shot.<br/><br/>Similar to Tarantino's second movie (Pulp Fiction), Kill Bill too doesn't rely very heavily on its plot, which is virtually non-existent. It is driven by the execution. Movies are meant for escapism and the director knows this. The story has been stretched to a point where it becomes almost farcical, which is also an escapist's paradise. Things that would have been awfully heinous otherwise become rather likable in the hands of Tarantino. Added to it is a dark tone and black comedy which make it highly even more compelling. Call me despicable, but there is something oddly appealing about cornflakes drenched in blood.<br/><br/>It is the subtle things that catch your attention and define the beauty of the movie. The cinematography is breathtaking. Right from a bullet leaving a gun to the large-scale mass murders every scene is awe- inspiring. There's B&W, slo-mo and censoring of names. There is a part in anime; a montage about the past of O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), a deadly assassin, Tokyo's mob-boss and number one on The Bride's hit-list. Perhaps he did it to show a relation between O-Ren's half Japanese ancestry. Or maybe he did to avoid getting an NC-17 rating (there's a paedophilic goon, O-Ren's a kid; add two and two).<br/><br/>The eclectic soundtrack by RZA can be termed as one of the most befitting ever heard in Hollywood. It reached #45 on the Billboard 200 album chart and #1 on the soundtracks chart; so you see what I mean. It builds tension superbly, often causing feverish excitement. If you close your eyes and listen to the music playing during the battles in the movie, you can still feel the adrenaline coursing through your body – that's how amazing it is.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman does a wonderful job as the vendetta-seeking, yellow-haired bride. She clears all sexist misconceptions from your mind about men being better at war than women. She is lethal and ruthless with an ever- present sardonic smirk on her lips – a true femme fatale. You have to give her credit for managing to hold onto her expressions while performing things that are absolutely nuts.<br/><br/>Vol.1 does not offer a satisfactory conclusion, leaving expectations of a second part, which Tarantino duly followed it up with. It leaves many questions unanswered, many people unkilled and many viewers thirsty for more bloodshed.<br/><br/>However, while parting the movie does teach a very important lesson – when you kill a woman you need to make sure that she is dead because if she isn't, boy, you are screwed."
"dokha","Null","2","5","27 August 2011"," i never EVE-E-E-E-R espected this movie would be awesome.
","kill bill is set in a twisted reality Japanese manga kinda world. the best thing about the film that we rarely see in others is that they tell the story nice and slowly so that you just enjoy don't have to put the pieces together, true that there's a couple of jumbled scenes and i am not a fan of that because its really doesn't bring any thing to the table story wise but it is not over used. crappy CONS ALTHOUGH THE ACTION AND fighting looked really cool, the camera angels gave it away for me, most of the fighting we see was too zoomed in up close and this takes away the sense of reality and technical possibility to it, that you'd have to replay because you didn't catch wat the hell happened in the last 0.3 seconds."

","Kill Bill Volume One has to be one of the surprising movies I have ever seen. I had no intention to see this because I was turned off by the previews and the previous Uma movie I seen before this was Batman and Robin and she was horrible. I'm glad I did because this is definitely an exciting film.<br/><br/>This is about a former bride-to-be who is left for dead on her wedding day while everyone else is killed. When she wakes up, she decides to go out for revenge.<br/><br/>I was skeptical of Uma at first because of her Batman and Robin role but the moment she appeared that thought vanished from my mind. I really liked the fight scenes at the end featuring Lucy Liu.<br/><br/>This movie is very violent. I would not recommend this movie to young children of course. It's very gory and I liked it.<br/><br/>The music is here is very good. It sounded like some traditional instruments were used in the score.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good action movie. I am highly anticipating the second one. I rate this film 10/10."

","Kill Bill vol.1 is one of the most exciting and stylish action movies made in recent years. It doesn't conform to Hollywood conventions and as a result is very fresh and entertaining. It takes the age old revenge formula and injects new life into the premise and comes up with some real originality. Kill Bill is vastly different than any film out there,thanks to its witty dialogue,imaginative plotting and fascinating characters. Kill Bill vol 1 doesn't really offer much in the way of emotion but that doesn't matter. This is a wild ride of a movie,one you do not want to miss. It provides awesome action and a steady supply of humor.This is a very original creation and is one of the most stand out films I have ever seen. It may not be quite as good as Pulp Fiction or even Kill Vill vol 2(Tarantinos other great works) but those films were masterpieces,in my opinion anyway,and the fact that it isn't as good as those films doesn't put it down in any way. So if you are a fan of Tarantinos work or you just want to see a really original,crazy action picture,this movie is for you"
"joshi_3592","9","2","5","8 July 2010"," Tarantino's 4th film. It's different, but still impressive.
","When I first heard of Kill Bill in 2003, saw the trailer, etc. I though this has to be crap. Just violence, and violence and no structure. then I forgot about it. The a few years later I started looking into Tarantino films. I saw his newest one, Inglorious Basterds, and I though; ""wow, this is pretty good"". It was refreshing to see someone with a unique and classical directing style. Then I saw Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, and already I considered him one of the greatest directors ever. Then after having seen Death Proof (not his best by the way) I figured; "" you know what? it's about time I sit down and watch Kill Bill volume 1"". So i sat down and saw it, and these are my thoughts on it.<br/><br/>Despite not being the kind of movie I like, I really liked this movie. Okay that sounds weird, but it's how it is. Revenge movies, and Japanese movies, and especially anime is on the bottom of my like list, hate me if you wan't but I fail to see the attraction to it. However, this movie is so well made, I put all of that aside. The tag line ""Tarantino's 4th film"" as if it is very relevant, is well placed in it's context. When I saw Reservoir Dogs I though; ""no way this is his first film! It's too good"". He made two more films, and didn't disappoint, so his fourth movie surely had to be a cinematic masterpiece, and I personally think it should qualify as such. It has a visual style both corny and artistic at the same time. He really taps into the heart of a good exploitation film. It is a surprisingly profound movie.<br/><br/>But now that I've praised this movie, I guess the complaint should be written down as well. I only have one complaint about this movie, which isn't actually much of a complaint. The violence. And don't get me wrong, I am not against violence in films in any way. inf act I often think it's very important to make a good and shocking film. However I think that there is only one thing that stands int he way of Quentin Tarantino's artistic abilities; he's need for violence. His Grindhouse feature following Kill Bill; Death Proof proved this point. The violence got in the way of the story,a nd the story got less impressive. I understand Tarantino's need to channel his violence ideas through films, but I'm afraid he might go too far one day. this film an example of how that might one day ruing his films.<br/><br/>Having set that aside, I give this movie a 9/10, and finish by saying, I really look forward to Kil Bill volume 2."
"rickytrapp","10","2","5","27 March 2010"," QT's violent, over the top masterpiece
","Wow, what a film. Quentin Tarantino's 4th film is his most violent yet. With a terrific script, sharp humor and interesting characters, this is QT's 3rd best film (2. Inglourious Basterds & 1. Pulp Fiction). But while QT's other films are laced with more dialog than anything, this film is solid action, but with some raucous dialog. The performances in this film are nothing short of brilliant. Uma Thurman is excellent as The Bride, Lucy Liu is just as good and David Carradine is the star of the show as the title character. If you want a solid action film, this is it. But be warned, the gore and extreme violence in this film is not for every taste. It is seriously over the top.<br/><br/>Kill Bill ****/****.<br/><br/>Rated R for Extreme Violence & Some Language."
"ryshpr","8","2","5","19 March 2010"," Amazing. But what do you expect from Tarantino?
","Quentin Tarantino does what he does best in Kill Bill: Vol. 1, his fourth film. The movie sees The Bride (Uma Thurman) who decides to escape her life as a killer. She fled to Texas, met a young man, and on the day of their wedding was gunned down. Four years later she wakes from a coma and discovers her baby is gone. She decides to get revenge on the people who were responsible for her death.<br/><br/>It's pretty mind blowing and gruesome stuff, but that's what Tarantino is known for. The blood is so gratuitous but that's what makes it brilliant. As with Tarantino's other films, he mixes dark humour with peril and mixes it amazingly well. None of it is pointless and none of it takes anything away from the story. It just flows seamlessly.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is superb in the role of 'The Bride'; the vicious woman seeking revenge on Bill. You can really feel her rage and determination as she ticks off the people on her 'death list'. Lucy Liu also does a fine job of portraying O-Ren Ishii; one of the five people who played a part in almost ending her life.<br/><br/>The lengthy sword fight scene will keep you wanting more and the cliffhanger will ensure you will want to watch Kill Bill: Vol 2. Brilliant.<br/><br/>http://ukmore.tk/"
"zoeisdead2002","6","2","5","29 December 2009"," It just wasn't good, clear and simple
","I wrote a previous review on how Zatoichi the blind swordsman was way more superior then this film. I have to say I wish I wrote a better review since I was just trashing QT's work. Just to let everyone know, I like Tarantino's work and I love what he writes, but as I said in my other review for Zatoichi, There is a real thin line between Borrowing and complimenting a scene. Tarantino in the past has been accused of being too much of a plagiarizer. The plot of Reservoir dogs did borrow from City on fire and the black suits actually derived from John Woo's A Better Tomorrow 2. I can forgive that because Tarantino filmed them at a different pace and kind of rhythm were he took his time to give his characters detail and life. Kill Bill unfortunately did not carry any of that. <br/><br/>One of my biggest problems was Uma Thurman; she couldn't act worth a damn in the film. She said she tried imitating Clint Eastwood as she tries to invoke her toughness for the Bride. Heres the thing, Clint Eastwood looks tough and is convincing as a tough guy. Uma is a lanky woman who looks like she's worried about breaking her nails rather than busting any heads. The dialog was repulsive, I suppose people will tell me that he was trying to make it like those cheesy action films with the catchy yet corny one liners. He does do that and it is even more cheesy. Back then the writers were not trying to make it funny, they were serious about the dialog and even though its corny, at the time it wasn't to them.<br/><br/>My next big problem was O-ren Ishii, she just didn't convince me that she could rise to the ranks of head yakuza boss of the Japanese underworld. Her henchmen are also laughable and even unconvincing as Japanese as well. Have you noticed the Japanese actors performance are a little exaggerated and a bit too fakish? I think QT should've made O-ren into a man and he should've been played by Tadanobu Asano, an actor who can make a more convincing villain.<br/><br/>The next complaint is the violence, note this: I like watching action films that have well done and well shot violent sequences so I don't have a problem with violence on film. The problem with the violence in kill bill is that it really looks fake and dull. The part were Lucy liu slices the head of that one Yakuza and you see the blood shoot out like a sprinkler was not jaw dropping. Please know that I'm aware of films like Lone wolf and cub and also Ichi the killer, but those films let the blood shoot out and paint the entire screen red!! QT was holding back on the violence and I was so angry at the black and white sequence which was really stupid and doesn't live up to the brutality of films like ""Battle Royale"", ""The Street Fighter"", and ""Riki-oh: The story of Ricky"". He held back and made the action very tame. This is a tame action film in comparison to action giants like John Woo or Tsui hark.<br/><br/>QT also tried involving a Western element in the film, most notably adding music from ennio morricone, a man no stranger to Spaghetti Westerns. I like the music but was unnecessary for these type of scenes, even though I think they would have worked better in a John Woo film then kill Bill. <br/><br/>All around the movie is a mess and as a movie fan I can tell you just exactly what films he was borrowing from:<br/><br/>Zero Woman: Red Handcuffs Delinquent Boss Girl: Worthless to confess Fudoh The Game of death Lone Wolf and cub Ichi the Killer A Better Tomorrow 2 Rainy Dog Zatoichi<br/><br/>I know that most people would say that he is paying homages to these films and is sort of advertising them to the western audiences. The problem is these homages don't live up to these films brutality of violence and the emotional depth these characters feel when committing acts of violence. Maybe I should stop slamming QT but I just can't help myself, the movie was just not good and is slapped together with a bunch of scenes of other movies that did the scene way better then this one did.<br/><br/>why not just watch the original films to begin with then looking at a picture collage?<br/><br/>If I have to recommend a good movie from QT just watch Inglourios Basterds."

","Kill Bill Volume I has the best and most spectacular bloody sword fight scene ever. I have seen the film more than thirty times and it never gets old. Quentin Tarantino is a master of mixing spectacular action, violence, and acting into one single film. I am a fan of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. They are masterpieces as well. But the thing that draws me to Kill Bill is the story. Although the story is straight forward, the heroin succeeds in killing everyone in her path in her hunt for Bill. But what she does not do is hold back from anything. She is ready for anything and is prepared to do serious damage. The characters in Kill Bill Volume I are comical and brilliant. Quentin Tarantino does a great jog with creating flashy characters. Gogo is the most disturbing character while Hatori Hanzo is the most comical. But by far, The Bride is the most ruthless. I recommend the film to anyone I meet. It is a must see!"

","Genius. Demented genius. Those are the only words that can be used to describe Quentin Tarantino and his Uma Thurman samurai-kung-fu-spaghetti-western-giallo-film-mish-mash. The way Tarantino combines three separate genres of the 60s & 70s and lets them run amuck in a world of assassins and extremely gory revenge is handled in a pure and masterful way. His obvious awareness of the importance of long & exciting build-ups to excessive violence is evident clearly throughout ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"". This is especially evident in the entire bit leading up to the ""Showdown at the House of Blues Leaves"". First there is the ""Green Hornet"" theme playing as The Bride arrives in Tokyo and O-Ren gets to the restaurant. Then, the famous electric samurai song plays as O-Ren enters the restaurant. Then, The 5678s play one of there messed up Japanese surfer songs while The Bride checks out the room that O-Ren and her posse are in. Then, The 5678s play the famous ""Woo Hoo"" song as The Bride enters the washroom to change and so does O-Ren's assistant, Sophie Fatale. And then, ""Da Uomo a Uomo"", the famous Ennio Morricone theme from ""Death Rides a Horse"", plays while the Bride slices of Sohpie's arm and O-Ren and her posse come out to get ready and play. The way Quentin handles all of this is pure cinema."

","What porn is for sex, is what this movie is for violence. Pulp Fiction was a good story with a lot of violence in it, but this thin story is just a bad excuse to let the viewer see as much as violence as possible, in a totally unrealistic way. When a head is chopped off, the victim changes into a blood fountain for seconds! This is totally ridiculous. You start to wonder why heads wouldn't get launched spontaneously if that is the pressure. There are a lot of spectacular Matrix-like moves, but The Matrix had a story to let such actions fit; this movie doesn't. The only reason why I gave a 2 instead of a 1 is that they did do their best to bring nice filmography. Please open your eyes. Not everything Tarantino craps is gold.

"winner55","8","2","5","23 July 2006"," Tarantino's genre film
","After long threatening to make a pure genre film - a film the plot and episodes of which are constructed by genre convention, and always secondary to the enjoyment of the action - Tarantino has produced a quirky but faced-paced homage to the Chinese and Japanese martial arts films of the 1970s (and some of their American clones as well).<br/><br/>There's certainly no denying that the action sequences are rapidly paced, and professionally shot and edited. The story is loose and a little hackneyed, but that's exactly what a genre-film plot ought to be, since it is really just an excuse for the action. So of course the dialog is riddled with cliché; that also is as it should be.<br/><br/>I suppose most of this will be missed by those unfamiliar with the '70s martial arts film; but they may be able to enjoy it as just an irony-laden action film of the current era.<br/><br/>At any rate, anyone who thought the Chiba Street-Fighter films fun stuff, or who harbored a secret passion for TNT Jackson, will certainly enjoy this film.<br/><br/>The one weakness is Uma Thurman. She was well-cast in Pulp Fiction, but I haven's seen anything with her that I've liked since. Here, she is just way too ""over the top"" for this kind of film. The martial arts hero has to be cool unless really really angry - but Thurman has her rage-meter pushed to the max from beginning to the end of this film, and it gets awful tiresome after a while. Wish they had brought over Sue Shiomi for this one.<br/><br/>Finally, a word about the sequel, Kill Bill II; and the word is BAD. Worse sequel to a good film I can remember.<br/><br/>But this first film is a lotta fun."

However, I do hope that anything he does in the future resembles the first Kill Bill rather than any other of his movies. Kill Bill is by far, the most stylish movie ever made. Even though it is so extremely violent, first class film-making has portrayed it in a very acceptable way. Don't doubt it. Just watch it. The final chapter in the House of Blue Leaves is itself worth watching the entire movie for, over and over again. Kill Bill Vol 2 was'nt anything like this but was still good.

","Comas are a deep sleep wherein a victim is neither living nor dead. The mantle of darkness protect the soul from the reality which put it there. However, an ancient proverb states, that ""if the spirit has unfinished business in the world of the living, then woe betide those who put it there."" Such is the premise of Kill Bill. Once part of an elite group of world wide assassins, 'B.B', the victim, {Uma Thurman} awakens and recalls well who tried to kill her. Throughout the rest of the film, viewers are introduced to her former friends all code named after the world's most venomous snakes. Not sure of the reason why she was nearly murdered, "" Black Manba"" as B.B. was code named, (The deadliest snake) goes after each of the assassins. It has been suggested, were Bruce Lee to have lived, this vehicle would have been his. Instead, the story was redesigned with a feminine twist and all the explosive action and martial arts confrontations were designed in the fertile mind of action Director Quinton Tarentino. From the first to the last, exciting sub-plots and well-choreographed martial arts scenes give this film it's special quality. The main target of B.B.'s revenge is of course none other than Master (Kung Fu) David Carradine as Bill. It is he and his 'Snake"" team which consists of Lucy Liu who plays O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver and Michael Madson who now become the intended targets. Interest in the film is ample as each killer has their own story and each contains the special formula of subtle sex, exciting physical confrontation and superb samurai action. In the end, what can be said of Kill Bill One? If this film is fantastic, I can't wait for part II. (of which there is) Excellent. ****"

Normally this would spell disaster, but when Tarantino directs you know you can expect good things, and that's exactly what you get.<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of style, and it's style that drives it and style that builds it. The plot revolves around The Bride (her name bleeped out in this movie), once a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, codenamed Black Mamba. But she leaves her boss and boyfriend, Bill, to marry somebody else. Bill is upset, and kills everybody who attended the wedding, and has his Squad beat the pregnant Bride into a pulp, before shooting her in the head, only a second after she informs Bill the baby is his. She wakes up four years later, bent on revenge. And from there on, the movie is about her vendetta, going through the Squad before getting to Bill. The movie opens with a battle against Vernita Green, a.k.a Copperhead, but the main ""villain"" in this movie is O-Ren Ishii, codenamed Cottonmouth, and now the boss of the Yakuza. Uma Thurman as the Bride, and Lucy Liu as O-Ren are magnificent, and give strong performances, as does Sonny Chiba as the retired Japanese sword smith, Hattori Hanzo. But the true focus in this movie is not the amazing acting, but the amazing battle scene. Bloody, yet amusing. Quick and stylish. And accompanied by a magnificent soundtrack.<br/><br/>You will enjoy watching this movie, because it is entertaining, and nothing more. But therein lies its charm.

That would be an amazing Trilogy in which case I would watch it as soon as it came out. However, It has been so long since the last movie I fear Quentin has given up on the third movie idea.

"MaxBorg89","10","2","5","10 January 2006"," QT's gor(e)geous return!
","Six years after Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino tackles a new genre, one that has been exploited hundreds of times in all the B-movies he so deeply loves: the revenge flick. And in terms of style, Kill Bill: Vol.1 has a kind of ""B"" look: very little is told about The Bride (Uma Thurman) and her motivations. All we know is she was an ex killer, who was brutally attacked on her wedding day and shot in the head by former boss (and lover) Bill (David Carradine). After a four-year coma, all she wants is bloody revenge. And bloody it shall be...<br/><br/>Actually, a lot of people complained about the excessive violence in this film (a Finnish critic, whose opinion I don't share, compared Vol.1 and Sin City by defining both movies ""a pointless violence choreography""). Come on, how can anyone take those scenes seriously? They are beautiful, but SO surreal: you lose a finger, and half the blood in your entire body bursts out like it was a volcano erupting! That's the brilliance of Tarantino's work: the movie is 5% talking, 95% killing, but the gore is so unnatural you can't help laughing at it and just enjoy the whole thing.<br/><br/>As I said before, Kill Bill: Vol.1 is more style than content: those who expect the usual pop culture-related dialogue will be more satisfied when they see Vol.2, as will the people who want more insight on the characters. There is though one person we get to know more about: O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), the number #1 on The Bride's death list. But in the end the best scene with her happens to be completely silent: her slow motion entrance in the House of Blue Leaves. It's an excellent sequence, brilliantly scored by Rza (the first time QT uses original music).<br/><br/>Oh, I almost forgot: there is one thing left from Tarantino's earlier films: impeccable acting. Vivica Fox, Sonny Chiba, Daryl Hannah and the aforementioned Liu and Carradine (who doesn't show up that much, actually) are great, but the film really is a one-man show, or rather one-woman: Uma Thurman was, to put it mildly, BORN to play the lead in this movie. She's so mesmerizing, no wonder QT calls her his ""muse"".<br/><br/>An almost perfect film, with only one defect: the last line spoken by Bill, which spoils the second part's main surprise. Apart from that, it's hell of a movie!<br/><br/>9,5/10"

","The Bride is on a path of revenge. Left for dead by her old colleges, she's out for their lives after their failed attempt on her life. She is left in a coma for four years after the massacre at the church in El Paso, soon as she wakes up, she doesn't waste time. Her we are taken through her first two victims; O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green. First on her list is O-Ren Ishii, who has become Queen of the Tokoy Underworld. Her second victim; though first in the movie, is Vernita Green.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is another great film for director Quentin Tarantino. Quentin has dropped a lot of the heavy dialog that he's done in his other films, and has replaced it with outstanding action. Kill Bill is a patch work of film influences and references, ranging from Japanese samurai film; the later half very heavy in this, Chinese martial arts, animation, spaghetti western and a range of others. Some parts are ripped right from other films, but are given that Tarantino feel. Though they range from all different sorts of cinema, Tarantino has done a great job and joining them all together to create his own world for this bloody tale. The violence is vulgar and very bloody, yet its very mesmerising. There is a beauty to it that raises it beyond pointless violence. The blood though does come by the truck load; it flies everywhere. The animation sequence of O-Ren's past sits so perfectly, it doesn't seem out of place, heightening the Japanese influence.<br/><br/>The action is nothing short of outstanding. This has the best fight sequences in an action film. The battle of the blue leaves blows the burly brawl from The Matrix Reloaded right out of the water. It's great to see that Tarantino didn't rely on CGI for the fights, making it all the more realistic. They flow so well and are choreographed wonderfully.The fight between The Bride and Vernita, though short is so fast paced and high in energy.<br/><br/>All the acting is perfect. Uma Thurman is just brilliant as The Bride, you cant fake tears like she did when pulling herself into the back of Buck's Pussy Wagon. She brought so much dignity and malevolence to The Bride. Lucy Lui is so elegant and ruthless as O-Ren, its shocking how one minute she is laughing and smile then next she is chopping some guys head off without a second thought. Vivica A. Fox though not having a major role is very good as Vernita. Sonny Chiba is just hysterical as Hattori Hanzo.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is violently beautiful, darkly funny and has a soundtrack to die for.

","I'm really going against the grain here since so many people really seem to like this movie and think it's great. I honestly don't understand why. It's episodic with each episode showing the revenge of assassin Uma Thurman over one of the people responsible for shooting her in the head on her wedding day. This scene is quite sadistic and is the first of the film so you know what you are getting into from right off. Although the violence and blood is supposed to be ""comic book"" I didn't find it that way and thought it was very excessive, and to what point. There are shootings, stabbings, decapitations, arms lopped off, limbs and necks gushing blood like fountains. I suppose director Tarentino thinks it's somehow funny. However, there is a scene in which Viveca A. Fox is murdered in front of her young daughter; I was dumbfounded as to how anyone could think that was not offensive. I don't understand the point of the film except that the point was to show as much violence as possible. There is no storyline other than the revenge, so in this way it's like a horror movie where the only point is to kill teenagers in increasingly gruesome ways. To me, that is what Kill Bill is very much like; just another slasher film but using martial arts. I was reminded of the film Dead Alive which I didn't like either. Slasher horror films are okay but you don't hear anyone praising them like you do this film. Maybe I'm just a lug head for not getting what all the fuss is about over this film."

Moreover, I disliked the overdone action scenes that may be unique (because they come from comic books)but they were redundant and lacked depth.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the performance of Uma Thurman and her character, but too much of the rest of the story is cliché and I was just basically waiting for her to kill off every one of her enemies."

"ryan_kuhn","9","2","5","13 February 2005"," No plot? No problem!
","If there is a weakness to movies by writer/director Quentin Tarentino, it is that the plots are often thin, at best. The first two of his movies, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, contained very little actual story, but the experience of hearing what the characters had to say more than made up for it. Tarantino's third effort, Jackie Brown, had much more story to it, and was my personal favorite. Now comes Kill Bill, Volume 1, which is the first half of what was to be one long movie. At nearly 2 hours, I'm thankful that the movie was cut in half, as there is so much energy in Volume 1 that it would be difficult to keep it up for an additional 2 hours during 1 sitting. The plot in this movie reverts back to early 90s Tarantino, very thin, but enough of a set up to carry the movie. Uma Thurman plays the Bride who has to exact revenge against her former employers for reasons we're not completely told of. We'll have to wait for Volume 2 for the psychological reasoning behind the Bride's methods. Kill Bill, Volume 1 is a fun movie that knows it's a movie and knows that the viewer knows that it's a movie. There is nothing real about it. Somewhere, you'd think the FBI would be investigating a 6 foot blonde serial killer, but not in this movie, and that's why it's so fun to watch. You know you're watching something that is fake, there for our enjoyment. The cartoonish way 88 foot soldiers are slayed has a visual style of it's own, and the beauty of the final showdown at the end of the movie is amazing. Notice the bright blue of the snow, bright yellow of The Bride's outfit, and the bright red splatter that is the final result of the duel, and it's a truly beautiful scene. The movie also features appropriate and timely music, another Tarantino staple. Some people will be put off by the over-the-top, uber-violence in Kill Bill, Volume 1, but those who remember that it is just a movie, one that has very little in the way of ""real life,"" will have a good time. Kill Bill, Volume 1 is the set up for the deeper, slower, yet more interesting second half, Kill Bill, Volume 2."

","Tarantino is a true talent in the eyes of many. Few debuts have been as handsomely constructed and powerfully original as Reservoir Dogs and few films have been as enjoyable and influential as Pulp Fiction. Both celebrate the art of script writing that awarded the supreme motor mouthed auteur with an Oscar. However with Volume 1 of his martial art epic Kill Bill, we see his weakest script work yet. The dialogue is slightly clunky at times and reams away from his most celebrated work but what it lacks in lines it exceeds in action. Compared with the other so-called action films released that year Kill Bill screams talent. Crash zooms, jump cuts and glowing crimson abound. The final 30 minutes or so of this film, where Tarantino flexes his action muscles are some of the most thrilling of the year. It should be clear to most that with this film Tarantino is showing us a different side of his world, and in terms of action and style he simply excels."
"Doggy87","9","2","5","11 February 2005"," Tarantinos ingenious brilliance + Thurmans acting = MASTERPIECE!!
","Quentin Tarantino has since his debut as a movie writer been an object of discussion - you either love him or hate him. For me though, the answer is simple. Tarantino is brilliant. In Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2 he takes both his own movie-making and the genre of violent action to a new level. It is quite understandable that some( or even a lot of) people are disgusted by his bloody scenes.<br/><br/>In Kill Bill the plot is once again intelligent with Uma Thurman as a revengeful professional killing-machine, who desperately urges for a payback at her former boss Bill and his people. <br/><br/>The movie goes in real Tarantino-style, with present time mixed with flashbacks, eventually ending up in a fabulous finish. <br/><br/>Thurman was a great actress in Pulp Fiction, but it's a pleasure to watch her in Kill Bill. It's impressive to see how she handles swords, for example. Tarantino tends to use the same actors in different movies, Thurman is one and Michael Madsen another. Madsen is perfect as the kind of nasty ""badass"" that frequently occur in Tarantinofilms. David Carradine, a for me quite unknown actor, is also worth mentioning for his strong performance as Bill.<br/><br/>Kill Bill vol 1 & 2 are great movies, not really as amazing as Pulp Fiction, but it comes up to Reservoir Dogs-standard, and that is a very good grade! A highly recommendable movie to people who aren't that sensitive. Even if much of it is censored (in a brilliant way again by Tarantino, the Anime-stuff gives me goosebumps :)), a lot of blood is wasted.<br/><br/>9/10"

I'm firmly convinced that the man can't make a movie worth the film it's printed on.<br/><br/>His latest outing is Kill Bill, an homage (cough cough) to old Kung Fu movies of the seventies, but this movie lacks the simplistic charm that old martial arts movies had, insofar that Kill Bill is a poor bastardization of seventies films.<br/><br/>Now, while this film is 200 times better than the sewer slime known as Pulp Fiction, I feel that I must confess that I do like the action and the conflict in the film, however the script was not driven by the actors in the film, and character development was poor. There were many times that I felt that the violence was being gratuitous, and the lawn sprinkler effects of the gushing blood was very laughable, at best.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman gave a very shallow performance in this movie as well, and maybe that helped her character a bit, but it didn't make the bride compelling. And i find it very hard to believe that Thurman could take out the entire Yakuza in a restaurant, when she couldn't take out Alicia Silverstone in Batman & Robin (which is also better than Pulp Fiction). Not to mention that she has very ugly feet (ugghhh!!).<br/><br/>All in all, about 50/50, in my book. I will say that it may be worth a watch, and eventually, when the DVD is in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart, maybe even worth a purchase. If you like Tarantino films, you may like this film, otherwise approach with caution.<br/><br/>5/10 stars"

","Don't get me wrong, I think of a 9 of 10 as pretty high praise, but it's no #77 on the top 250. That kind of rating should be for films which are about something more than live action anime. Tarintino does do a wonderful job at capturing and honoring the mood of today's violent cartoons and yester-year's B-movies. And those recurring gushers of blood are hilarious in a ""Yeah I'm sick but it sure can be entertaining"" sort of way. Tarintino also does a credible job incorporating a great variety of styles and approaches to the material, but the film's continuous winking at itself telegraphs that the plot is secondary and you end up wondering how much of the film is Tarintino and how much is second unit directors and stunt coordinators. ALSO, and this may be me and my watching Kill Bill, Matrix II, and Blade II all in the same weekend, but I'm awful tired of scenes where a horde of attackers supposed there to assail the main character take their turns politely waiting to get their butts kicked instead of just zooming in and dispatching the hero's ass like they should. Oh Quentin, if you could put this much love into something that really mattered ... sigh."

Over the past four years the market has been invaded with horribly made preteen flicks and movies that wouldn't hold you on the edge of your seat if your life depended on it. Even the Academy Awards has sunk to nominations of depressingly bad films. But this is a breakthrough. With some of the greatest cinematography scince The Shawshank Redemption or even citizen kane, and characters, that in any other film would be cartoony and unbelieved, are believable because of Tarantino's genius.<br/><br/>Even the chief opposing characters are somewhat cared for in this movie.

"lotus_chief","9","2","5","24 October 2003"," VERY Entertaining!
","The 4th film by Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill....what can I say?  I'm a big fan of Tarantino, and I don't have to explain how anticipated his next film was.  One thing about QT that I can always appreciate is how different he is when it comes to subject matter, style, etc etc.  Kill Bill is probably the most straight-forward piece he's done to date.  The signature styles and techniques of QT are here as well, and he employed some new ones also. Quite frankly, Kill Bill is a damn good movie.  I want to hold off on deeming it a classic until I see the whole thing.  But from what I've seen so far, its a film that will set new boundaries in cinema....the way his other films did. <br/><br/>I'm not a huge fan of Uma Thurman, I thought she was pretty good in Pulp Fiction, but she's VERY good here...I didn't expect her to be as convincing as she was.  Being a HUGE fan of kung fu movies (particularly from the 70s-80s), I loved the casting of Gordon Liu....although I would've liked his showdown to be a little longer. Bruce Lee's yellow jumpsuit as worn in 'Game of Death'....very nice homage to the master.  I'm not at all a fan of Lucy Liu, but suprisingly her casting here is not half bad.  Vivica Fox on the other hand.....is only here for style, she didn't serve much purpose at all. The story of Kill Bill, one of revenge, is straight forward but very intriguing.  The way QT presents the film, its almost like he thought of every possible technique/style he could think of and used it in Kill Bill. Things like the B&W sequence and the Japanimation sequence add a whole new twist to the film and is VERY creative...it works perfectly. <br/><br/>
I didn't like the fact that they cut the film into two parts, but I can't wait to see the second part.  Vol. 1 is a little short; nevertheless they cut the film at a good place, setting up the second part very well.  A VERY entertaining film, QT has done it again.  This is shaping out to be a milestone in filmmaking, hell it probably is already.  Vol. 2 will only cement Kill Bill's place in cinema history.  A truly monumental film. Bravo, QT, bravo!<br/><br/>*** 3/4 out of **** stars."

You have to hand it to Tarantino, he knows what he's after and how to get it. He simply steals from the best. To his credit, the direction is always smooth, inventive and sure-handed.

","I know the title of my review is very insulting, and I fully realise this, and very rarely, like once in five years, do I ever take on an individual with such harsh words or write about someone in such a manner. I say this with an apology in advance to Quentin Tarantino and his fans, but this guy seriously needs help.<br/><br/>Hell no, don't get me wrong. I do not to prefer to watch films that portray the bubble that I am living it. I am in fact very fond of hard hitting films that make you realise how brutal life can be, or how brutal a human-being can be, or still, how for a suffering death can be. To point an example, I absolutely loved the war film 'Fury' (2014) and recently, I have been awestruck, spell-bound and absolutely blown away by 'Revenant' (2015). The difference between these being, those, and possibly many other films that depict so much brutality, had a story, a plot, an aim, a purpose. The purpose, aim, the very reason for this films seems like violence, blood, brutality.<br/><br/>After I watched my first film by him, 'Django Unchained' (2012), I really kept asking myself who the director is. After searching his name, I literally stamped it on my head not to watch his films again, because his fascination for violence was apparent from merely one film. How right I was! Today, just now, I googled his name to get his name's spelling right in this write-up, I found this quote:<br/><br/>""Violence is one of the most fun things to watch.""<br/><br/>Now, the important question, why did I watch this piece of gutter? Well, I made the mistake of not reading the film-maker's name when I organised this film for myself. Still, 15-20 minutes into it I guessed whose brainchild this could be, but I went through it for the sake of it, and to confirm whether my conclusion after watching just one film by him was right or not. Well, at least I have my answer, an answer which in short is the title of this review."

","Kill Bill 1 is actually better than Kill Bill 2. Good story but every chapters are abit too long and slow just like his previous films. You can watch the colour version if you buy a DVD from Japan and there are extra fight scenes. <br/><br/>Who can remember the song 'Woo-hoo'? It's very simple song. <br/><br/>Two years before the film released, I opened a magazine and saw a picture of Uma with the yellow suit, it reminds me of Bruce Lee's film - Game of Death. I thought it must be martial art film then I kept reading the articles, Quentin directed the first martial art film and Uma signed it to do the film. <br/><br/>Quentin hired Yuen Woo-ping who is a fight choreographer after the Matrix film. If Quentin knew Lau Kar Leung or have seen his films then the fighting styles will be completely different. Lau made some best Shaw Brother martial art films like 36th Chamber of Shaolin, Martial Club, Eight Diagram Pole Fighter, etc. Superstar Gordon Liu was in all these films and he was also in Kill Bill 2, Pai Mei."

You may find certain flaws here and there but this is not about finding mistakes it is just about enjoying the cinema and the sharing the same pulse as the protagonist.I loved the anime part.It was the best part of the movie for me. I really liked the way the anime was used. It's like using the technology in the best possible manner.

","When I first started to see the film, I thought it would just be an action film with a lot of blood and that's all. And that was what I wanted to see, but the film offered a lot more than this. It is truly one of the master pieces of Tarantino. The consensus on rotten tomatoes is great which says â€“""It is a highly stylized revenge but what a style."" Seriously I have never seen killing and storytelling all combines with action and such a great style. This style is definitely specific to only Tarantino and none can repeat this. The soundtracks need to be mentioned specifically. They stole the show most of the times. Uma Thurman acted very nicely at all the times. The story all the times took so interesting turns that anyone can be glued.<br/><br/>""A must watch right now, if you are action sucker and a must watch for anyone else also."""

","Kill Bill Volume 1 is an action thriller film that stars Uma Thurman as The Bride together with Lucy Liu,Vivica A. Fox,Daryl Hannah,David Carradine,Michael Madsen,Julie Dreyfus and David Carradine as Bill.It is the first of two volumes that were theatrically released several months apart, the second volume being Kill Bill Volume 2.The story follows the character known as ""The Bride"", a former assassin who seeks revenge on still-active colleagues who massacre members of her wedding party and try to kill her. The movie was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino after a five-year hiatus. <br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 1 starts when The Bride opts to leave the outfit for a life of marital bliss. Unfortunately,it doesn't sit well with her boss, Bill, so he has her former cohorts.They show up at the nuptials, leaving behind a blood bath. Miraculously, The Bride survives a bullet to the head and, four years later, she sets out for revenge against her four assassins and their employer.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 1 is a great film due to its stylish direction as it pays homages to film genres such as Hong Kong martial arts films, Japanese chanbara films, Italian spaghetti westerns, girls with guns, and rape and revenge.Although the movie is somewhat strange,it gets better particularly the action scenes as it moves along.It is a very violent movie but it was done excellently by Tarantino.<br/><br/>Overall,Kill Bill Volume 1 provides us an action movie with striking beauty and violence like no other."

Thanks for the opportunity to comment because I don't always know if I'm doing the right thing on these sorts of sites, but bygones aside I'll let you know what I thought because Uma Thurman seems like one hell of a fox, except when she's trying to tell if her lips are aligned to yours, and then she's more of a little troll whose under a bridge trying to find where her porridge is. But regardless, and of course, back to Kill Bill, Uma really knows how to make a man gust with laughter and look for the nearest defenestration hole, because there is no way in hell that she got that way all by herself, and at that I think that we all need to give the world a hand of applause about how well we were all able to tolerate that totalitarian masterpiece of iron man logic that we saw there, most likely to my detriment because I think that my ex spouse got an extra bad case of diarea after she finished watching it... its kind of a girl thing but she's not supposed to get excited outside of the house and we have a tendency to slip her a laxative when she gets extra rubbish and Uma really set her heart on fire, wow!, pow!, wow!, ow!, it never stopped and Karen kept jumping all over the furniture and so it was kind of a disaster, but I guess that's besides the point. Really, I liked it, but not in a warm and cuddly kind of way because Karen ended up on the potty all night long afterwards, and it was the only way to keep her diarea'in ass from rioting in the streets.

The action, the comedy, the thrills, the action & the action. They all add up to one of the best movies ever created. Some of the scenes in Kill Bill never seize to amaze me. How Tarantino came up with the ideas for some camera angles & movements is beyond me. All throughout the movie are little ideas probably created on set which make the film even more enjoyable The acting was great.

"RMFendt","10","2","6","6 November 2005"," Breath-taking
","Okay, I will admit. I have been a big fan of Tarantino's works for a long time. So my expectations of this one were high indeed. And Tarantino delivers. It is hard, it is violent, it is fast. And expertly done, as always. And the musical accompaniment is, while somewhat peculiar, as with most QT films, of very high quality, and greatly helps setting the mood of the film.<br/><br/>No one but QT could tell a simple tale of revenge that lasts over 4h (including part #2) without it becoming boring. Here we see that it can work, however: one simply never gets bored, not for one second. Call it Tarantino's magic. Visually: a feast; the actors: brilliant; the story-telling: gripping.<br/><br/>So, is this ""instant classic"" material? It certainly is. Is this one of the best movies Quentin ever did? Oh yes.

Not in the way he does.<br/><br/>The fight scene is utterley jaw-dropping, and leaves you in complete awe of Uma Thurman when one of the hardest and best constructed fight scenes to date is complete. Seeing the 'Making of' in the extras shows you clips of the influences to this scene, and it makes you respect Quentin for attempting this scene. Million dollars and a big whole in the film could have been the result of this scene failing. The make or break scene of O'ren's downfall is a complete success and is a credit to Quentin and the choreographers."

","I'm quite sure Tarantino would be a fun person to discuss movies with and I have a feeling both of us enjoy many of the same kung fu and action movies from HK.<br/><br/>This tribute however does not work all too well for me. I will admit that seeing the Shaw Bros logo in the opening does make me smile and I will always appreciate this movie on some level for introducing me to the brilliant 5,6,7,8,s, but it does get tiresome to see references constantly to better material, older material and less appreciated material throughout the film's runtime.<br/><br/>I find it quite odd that this film is in the top 250 films on IMDB whilst very few if any, of the films this film outright referenced to seen in ""homages"" is nowhere to be found on said list. This unfortunately comes across as another film where Tarantino gets by a whole lot on his influences and simultaneously ends up being labeled original for it, which does not seem fair and the end result isn't a very satisfying movie either.<br/><br/>The action is not as good as I have come to expect from the people involved and Gordon Liu is sadly wasted in this (see him in the sequel, a much better role for him there)<br/><br/>I did love the 5,6,7,8,s music and the anime segment was nicely animated and I think and hope Tarantino has a genuine love for the original genres and material somewhere in his heart so this gets a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>The sequel is actually better made IMHO."

","I just watched Kill Bill<br/><br/>This movie is brilliant, the techniques Tarantino uses and masters are nothing short of genius. There is black and white, slow no, anime and a name that is beeped just for effect. It is just great filmmaking.<br/><br/>I once read a review that said it was ""all storytelling, but no story"" I disagree with that.<br/><br/>I was annoyed when it was split into two movies and I whinged about Miramax being greedy etc, and argued what scenes should have been cut from both movies too make one classic, but over time it has not bothered me as much.<br/><br/>Although, I think it could have been a lot tighter. There's a lot of padding to be found here, and it's probably the result of trying to stretch a single three-hour movie into two 105-minute features. I will say it is devoid of Tarantino's usual dialogue too. The number of quotable lines and memorable non-action sequences is small here.<br/><br/>As far as the performances go, Uma Thurman does a fine job as The Bride. We admire her tenacity but we never identify with the character. (This is a problem with a revenge flick, where we're supposed to root for the hero and despise the enemy. Neither is the case here, especially since we never see Bill.) Lucy Liu is a joy. Vivica A. Fox has virtually no screen time. Same for Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah who were being held back for Volume 2. We only hear David Carradine's voice. For me, Sonny Chiba does the best acting job with his role as a sword-maker.<br/><br/>Kill Bill grossed $70 million dollars (against a $30 million budget) at the domestic box office"

","Boy, was there a ton of blood shed in this movie! The movie started out in a really abrupt way but it wasn't so confusing that I couldn't figure out what was going on; from then on, the action progressed pretty rapidly, and never lagged at any point. Each of Beatrix's interactions with her former partners-in-crime of the Deadly Viper Association was unique and interesting to watch. Although Beatrix's physical capabilities were amazing throughout the movie, they were especially impressive when she knocked each and every member of the Crazy 88's gang with her newly acquired Hanzou sword. That must have taken a lot of training and time to perfect! During that scene, though brief, Gogo's movements were brutal and impressive as well, and she did indeed pull off the vengeful schoolgirl look very well.

It's a story that matches that of a lost Japanese Ronin warrior seeking revenge for the loss of their master. Only in this case the master betrayed the Ronin themselves. The film is outrageously fun from beginning to end, and keeps you locked in the entire time. The editing techniques bring back memories of old school Kungfu flicks, and yet lets us know that they are top notch for the year this film came out.
The editing in this film is amazing. The story starts out with Uma Thurman's character ""The Bride"" (her real name isn't discovered until the second film) being brutally beaten and shot in the head. It locks your attention in with this and then bounces back and forth in her timeline. It engages immediately and locks you in for the rest of the ride. This film's use of flashbacks and cut scenes makes it what it is. At one point the main antagonists back story is told in an anime format that is unexpected, and yet fits this film so perfectly. It pays respect to Japanese culture in throughout the entire film in a way that's feels unobtrusive.
The use of close ups in this film are extremely important to its motif. It makes it all feel so personal, as if you were betrayed yourself and are seeking vengeance. Every time the camera pans into The Brides face you can feel her hurt. You can literally see the rage on her face, and want her to complete her mission so desperately. I can't remember a time I was this engaged with a film like this.
Finally, the eclectic soundtrack makes for an exciting joyride. It bounces from a playful teasing feeling, to a dramatic overtone that helps you understand how each character is feeling, and yet lets you know how out of control this film is. At one point The Bride engages in combat with 88 Yakuza gang members at the same time. The music flips from Japanese Go-Go music that excites you to a theatrical song several times in the same fight sequence. It is jarring, and funny, and yet so severe that it helps you to understand that this film is here to rock you out of your seat.
This film draws its roots from 70's Kungfu films. She even wears a yellow jumpsuit that resembles Bruce Lee in Game of Death. All in all this is an instant classic, and I encourage anyone who wants a gore filled rollercoaster of an action film to watch it."

","6 Financial Lessons I Learned From Kill Bill - The Movie<br/><br/>As a martial arts fan and finance fan, I figure it would be fun to combine the two. After all, the zombies were able to teach us financial lessons, why not swords?<br/><br/>I know, shame on me, I cannot even enjoy a nice movie nowadays without thinking about finance.<br/><br/>Seriously, check out that post on 9 things Zombie can teach you about investing. It is irresistible. It even got featured in Rockstar Finance.<br/><br/>For those who are not aware of this epic movie, a little introduction before we get started.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is an American martial art film about a bride who survived an attempt on her life and her unborn child. She was hell-bent on having revenge on a team of assassins. The leader's name was Bill. Hence the name.<br/><br/>
The movie was so awesome, they did Kill Bill 2. While sword fight might not be as fun as the walking dead, there are many valuable financial lessons to scrape from the movie.<br/><br/>
Here are some business and personal finance tips I learned from this epic movie.<br/><br/>There are personal finance tips in everything you encounter daily. Check out these 6 financial tips from the movie Kill Bill While martial art movies might not be as much fun like zombies, these personal finance tips will move your closer to financial freedom.<br/><br/>
1. Teach yourself how to walk financially.
Self-education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is.<br/><br/>Isaac Asimov<br/><br/>If you are not familiar with that one, what about grandpa Lincoln?<br/><br/>All I have learned, I learned from books. : Abraham Lincoln<br/><br/>After the attack, Beatrix woke up from coma about 4 years later. Now don't ask me how or try to play the doctor card here ok.<br/><br/>The first thing she did was learn how to walk again. This was without rehab or any fancy facility or program, she did this with focus and determination. One step at a time.<br/><br/>This was how the concept of babies and toddlers of personal finance became our first categories on this site.<br/><br/>Learning takes a process and sometimes you have to crawl first like a baby. The bride started by dragging herself then crawled and then started walking.<br/><br/>Initially, her walk was ataxic (weird walk) and then ultimately taught herself to walk normally and even eventually run.<br/><br/>In business and personal finance, self-education is very important. Pick up a book and go nuts. Subscribe to some trusted personal finance blogs and go on Youtube, listen to motivational videos and personal finance concepts instead of watching cat videos. Although that one with the cat playing piano was awesome. Here is our review of The Richest man in Babylon book to get started.<br/><br/>To get the book or any book on Amazon, you can use our affiliate link<br/><br/>What I would like you to take away from this section is that there is no way around it, to be successful; you would have to be self-taught in many things.<br/><br/>No one was born with knowledge, we all acquire it. And like the sayings above, most of the useful knowledge is self-taught.<br/><br/>
The good news is, you will get there. The process will not happen instantaneously, but you will graduate from baby to toddler and eventually become an adult of personal finance. As long as you keep chipping at it.<br/><br/>
2. Like the HIT list, you need a list of goals
Set your goals high, and don't stop till you get there. - Bo Jackson<br/><br/>Setting goals are the first step in turning the invisible into the visible. -Tony Robbins<br/><br/>Once she was able to walk, the first thing she did was to create a hit list. She not only created a list, but she also lists them in order of difficulty from the easiest to the hardest goal which is to ultimately confront Bill - the assassin leader.<br/><br/>The truth is, despite me knowing she was the hero in the movie; I could not help but wonder how she was going to accomplish her goal. This is exactly what made her plan execution even more fascinating.<br/><br/>She focused on one goal at a time, cross it off her list and then moved to the next one. Sometimes it is best to focus on one thing at a time in order to succeed.<br/><br/>I am guilty of this for sure, especially with the blog. I wanted to be on all social media, wanted to create a course, do affiliate marketing, write content every day, which I failed at spectacularly. I also wanted to guest post and be on 20 different forums or groups at the same time. Those were just a few of the ones I remember.<br/><br/>After focusing more on just good content, Twitter and Pinterest, things became more manageable and more focused. Stick to a few major goals at a time.<br/><br/>3. Get the right sword to help you kill Bills
To be successful in business or personal finance, one must have the right tool. The bride in the movie sought out for the best sword to accomplish her goal.<br/><br/>The Bride traveled to Okinawa, Japan, to obtain a sword from a legendary swordsmith. It took some persuasion, but she was able to get what was referred to as the finest sword ever made.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Don't settle for less. In my short journey as an entrepreneur, I have come to understand that sometimes, you have to spend the money to get good help. Sometimes it requires you to reach out to others and convince them to collaborate with you.<br/><br/>You might ultimately have to travel to meet with certain mentors in the future. Don't settle for less.<br/><br/><br/><br/>4. Get a coach if needed. Don't be afraid to ask for help
Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player, a tennis player, a gymnast or a bridge player. Bill Gates<br/><br/><br/><br/>I can't emphasize enough the value of future leaders having a great mentor, sponsor, even a great coach.- Alec Bashinsky<br/><br/><br/><br/>As a fan of DIY and a die-hard teach yourself kind of guy, I must admit, sometimes even the best of us get stuck. In those situations, it is ok to ask for help.<br/><br/>The bride, otherwise known as Beatrix was a phenomenal fighter by nature. You have to watch the knife scene to grasp how awesome she is. To be even more badass, she sought the services of a coach, who was an old Japanese master named Pai Mei.<br/><br/>With the ""coach"", she was able to refine her skills, and master new techniques. How else would she learn the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart<br/><br/>It is very crucial to know when to ask for help. Mentors and coaches are an important component of good entrepreneurship. Why make the same mistakes when others have already made. Avoid pitfalls by learning from someone else's errors.<br/><br/>We touch base in our post on investing tips for beginners to retire early. If you need financial planner as the last result, there is no shame in that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>5. Never give up
It is easier said than done. They say winners don't quit and quitters don't win. This is very true.<br/><br/>If you are following the story or have watched the movie, you will know that her plan did not go smoothly all the time. She got defeated sometimes. Her training was difficult. Her coach made her life a living hell, during training, as it is always the case in most martial art movies. Trial by fire kind of style. I love it.<br/><br/>It was her resilient that got her through.<br/><br/>If you are not passionate about what you do, do yourself a favor and do something else. Many successful people believe in that too. Don't take my word for it. Talk to Steve<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. -- Steve Jobs<br/><br/><br/><br/>6. Put in the work.
Pele is regarded as the greatest of all time in football ( the real name - or soccer for the fake name). He is regarded as the player of the millennium by most and I agree. Here is what he has to say.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.<br/><br/>-Pele<br/><br/><br/><br/>One of my favorite quotes of all time is also about hard work.<br/><br/>The reason a lot of people do not recognize opportunity is that it usually goes around wearing overalls looking like hard work. Thomas A. Edison<br/><br/>Beatrix had to put in the work. As said above, the training with Pai Mei was very hard. Sometimes she has to do menial jobs as a test of her patience and resilience, she did it without complaining.<br/><br/>We get a lot of questions on how to get out of debt. People ask, how do I get out of debt when I'm living paycheck to paycheck, barely meeting my basic necessities and have nothing left, to put towards my debt? They are drowning in debt and feeling hopelessness. After making the suggestion to cut off all non- essential spending, I then have to be brutally honest. To get out of debt is hard work. If your paycheck cannot stretch, get a side hustle. That side hustle can be in the form of picking up extra shifts at work or venturing into something completely new. Do what it takes! If that means cleaning homes, baking goods, babysitting or driving for Uber. Put in the extra work.<br/><br/>If you need more inspiration, check out our interview series on getting out of debt. These people are a testament that it can be done, regardless of your economic background.<br/><br/>Success in business or personal finance life is not easy but it is very achievable. Learn from the martial art film Kill Bill and start self-learning today, get out your hit list of goals, find the right sword, get a mentor and a coach if needed, never give up until you crush your goal and put in the effort it takes. If Beatrix can come out of a coma after 4 years to achieve her goal, you can do the same."

"mariannacool","9","1","2","27 January 2019"," ""And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger..."" Ezekiel 25:17
","A yellow jumpsuit, a lethal Hattori-Hanzo sword and a charismatic blonde taking bloody vengeance? Yeah, you got it; it's the notorious ""Kill Bill"", the same movie that, I am certain, got hundreds of naïve cinephiles running to the toilet to force the impression of the film out of their stomach. And yet, despite not being everyone's cup of tea, the ""Kill Bill"" universe is meticulously constructed in such a unique way, that compels you to give it, the least, a try.
The story goes as such: A woman, and past member of the ""Deadly international viper assassination squad"", is pregnant and ready to walk down the aisle. However, such a conspicuous past doesn't ensure much tranquility and that becomes evident by the surprise- arrival of the other members of the squad, to the Bride's wedding, who, with the aid of their machine guns, fill the chapel with rotting bodies and leave the blonde protagonist in a four year coma. The tale presents a dark twist when the physically and psychologically beaten Bride wakes up, only to find out that the fetus is missing. That's when things start to get bad, as the incensed Bride swears to revenge all the traitors responsible for this tragedy, wreaking bloody chaos in her passing. Sounds compelling enough?
No? Then let's talk about the heroine. The Bride, whose name we are constantly refused to, used to be one the most talented and dangerous members of her squad. She is a determined and unstoppable force of nature and her efficiency is combined with undeniable physical beauty; she is a carnivorous flower, perfectly fitting to the violent Tarantino world. And this world is violent and ruthless in every sense of the words; it is crystal clear not only in the characters behavior (are O-Ren Ishii, the icy and calculating killer, and Elle Driver, the one-eyed femme fatale, ringing any bells?), but also in the scenery. Tarantino uses bold colours, innumerable pounds of blood and even a nauseating anime sequence, to underline this exact cruelty and madness lurking deep in the human psyche; the film is a celebration of human instincts, in their most crude and therefore perilous form, embellished with carefully chosen pieces of music and ""subtle"" references to the old-fashioned genre of '70s kung-fu movies.
If you are still nodding your head indifferently then don't bother to watch the movie and torment yourself for no good reason. Pick one of the thousand other movies waiting patiently in the shelves of video stores and leave ""Kill Bill"" for another time. Maybe someday you will feel challenged enough to watch it."
"dimitrispappas-71186","10","1","2","17 November 2018"," A True Bloody Piece Of Work
","Quentin Tarantino conceives Kill Bill as an homage to grindhouse cinema, including martial arts films, samurai cinema, blaxploitation films and spaghetti westerns. It's an ultraviolent exercise in pure visceral action and spectacle with a succession of increasingly incredible and insane setpieces culminating in some of the greatest fight scenes in film history. Kill Bill is definitely a true masterpiece with a classic story about a brutal betrayal and an epic vendetta.<br/><br/>It stars Uma Thurman as The Bride or Black Mamba (that's her best role out of her carrer), Lucy Liu as her opponent, O-Ren Ishii (again also her best role yet), Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, Vivica A. Fox as Vernita Green, Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo and David Carradine as Bill. The story may be simple but it's really interesting and touching at some point. The direction, the cinematography, the dialogue, the music, the performances, the fight sequences... they are all perfect! I'm glad Tarantino made a movie like this, an homage to asian cinema and spaghetti westerns, and not again a gangster movie. I can proudly say that this is my favorite movie of all time! And of course, as I expected, even better than the sequel!"

","Quentin Tarantino conceives Kill Bill as an homage to grindhouse cinema, including martial arts films, samurai cinema, blaxploitation films and spaghetti westerns. It's an ultraviolent exercise in pure visceral action and spectacle with a succession of increasingly incredible and insane setpieces culminating in some of the greatest fight scenes in film history. Kill Bill is definitely a true masterpiece with a classic story about a brutal betrayal and an epic vendetta.<br/><br/>""Four years after taking a bullet in the head at her own wedding, a former assassin, simply known as The Bride, emerges from a coma and decides it's time for payback with a vengeance. Having been gunned down and lost her baby by her former boss and lover, Bill and his deadly squad of international assassins, it's a kill-or-be-killed war she didn't start, but she is determined to finish.""
Starring: Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox...<br/><br/>The movie is obviously a case of style over substance. In essence, it is just a basic revenge flick without too much depth or meaning. This, however, is exactly like how Tarantino intended it to be. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is simple, straightforward, completely over-the-top, but above all, beautifully shot and superbly directed. Its story comes totally secondary, as Tarantino used this movie as an experimental tool to mix several, mostly Asian cinema, styles together and blend it into one big visual experience of violence and unusual over-the-top looking sequences. His aim was style and with that, Kill Bill Vol.1 most certainly does not disappoint. The story may be simple but it's not poor nor boring at all. It's all about a woman's quest of vengeance, after being betrayed by her former companions and her ex-lover and boss, who tried to kill her at her wedding ceremony. The result? She lies in a coma for four years and after she wakes up, she realises that the baby she was carried in her womb is gone. It's kinda interesting and touching at some point.
The violence is definitely brutal and straightforward, as gallons of blood are spilled in front of the camera. But all of the violence is done in such a, deliberately, over-the-top and fake looking way, that it becomes more entertaining, rather than shocking or stomach turning. It even becomes poetically beautiful to watch at times. It also contains a manga anime sequence on it, which makes the movie even more impressive. The action sequences are definitely the best parts of the movie and they are well choreographed and shot. When things get too graphic, the film simple conveniently switches to black & white or turns to other creative cinematic solutions. The power of this movie is definitely its visual style and overall style of directing. Tarantino uses different themes throughout the movie but yet it manages to create one big unique identity. It never feels incoherent or disjointed in its style or storytelling.
Moreover, dialogue is sharp, music is brilliant and Uma Thurman is truly superb as The Bride. I can honestly say that this is her best role out of her career. Also, really superb in her role is Lucy Liu as The Bride's opponent, O-Ren Ishii. Again, also her best role yet. Daryl Hannah also gives an impressive performance, even if she only appears in one scene. Unusual, over-the-top but strangely intriguing, entertaining and overall brilliant."

"Bored_Dragon","10","1","2","22 May 2018"," Uma Thurman has really ugly feet
","At the time ""Kill Bill"" came out, movies were a totally minor thing in my life. I watched them relatively often, but I did not payed any attention to ""details"". I had no idea who the director was, and the question is whether I knew at all what the director was. Besides Uma Thurman, I think I never heard of other actors back then. I rated movies on a very simple scale - whether it's fun or not. This one was fun for a ten. Fifteen years and several thousand films later, I look at movies from a completely different angle and ""fun"" is no longer at the top of the criteria that distinguish good movies from bad ones. Now I analyze them in more detail and I still haven't found any flaws in this one.<br/><br/>It could be said that Quentin Tarantino's talent is a gift from God, but I think it's far more likely that he sold his soul to the Devil. The lowest rating I have ever given to one of his films is nine, and I'm not a ""fanboy"". ""Kill Bill"" is an action thriller, and for me action films are the lowest form of the seventh art. But Tarantino's ability to create an action movie which is also an art film is fascinating. The story is crazy and great, but the least important. Camera work, fight choreography, use of color and sound and feeling for details make this film a masterpiece of cinema. The cast is more than good, and Tarantino manages to get the most out of them. I doubt that any of these actors have ever given a better performance than in this movie. And, of course, music! Music is very diverse, totally unexpected, often even unsuitable for the scenes it follows, yet again in such a perfect (dis)harmony with the divine scenery and crazy choreography, that it all leaves the viewer breathless. For movies like this one even ten is depreciation.<br/><br/>10/10"

","'KILL BILL: VOL. 1' - 2003<br/><br/>Directed by Quentin Tarantino<br/><br/>Starring Uma Thurman<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ​After a team of lethal assassins lay siege to her wedding and kill her child, The Bride(Uma Thurman) seeks revenge against those who wronged her... and she takes no prisoners!<br/><br/>Don't let that over-dramatised plot overview fool you! This movie is fun personified. Tarantino's bloody revenge thriller is everything I wanted it to be and so much more. I can highly recommend this movie to anyone has not seen it, and if you have, watch it again. It is that good of a film. Well deserving of being in the Top 250. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a masterpiece. I have a lot more to say about this film so I better stop gushing.<br/><br/>The plot for this movie is a very simple revenge plot. But that is the beauty of it. Such an overly simplistic and basic plot is actually kind of poetic, when taken in regards to the rest of the plot. The ending is perfect and the last scene just before the credits is utter cinematic brilliance. Well done Tarantino and Thurman. Your deceptively simple plot is actually genius.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman was EXCELLENT as the Bride. This could be considered her best role and I can see why. She provides such a wide array of emotion and anger through just her facial expressions and actions that I think this could have been a movie were she won an Oscar. Maybe I over-exaggerating. Who knows? All I am saying is that she was fantastic in the film. Withholding information from us about her was a genius idea because that really adds to the mystique and intrigue of her character.<br/><br/>Lucy Liu was also terrific as O-Ren Ishi. I think she was unfortunately sifted to the back lines due to Thurman's spectacular and iconic performance but I do definitely think she deserves some more recognition.<br/><br/>I am definitely a fan of leaving us in the dark about Bill and the other assassins. This route lets them characters blossom in Kill Bill Vol. 2(I hope) and means more time can be dedicated towards them. It also saves shoving too much exposition down our throats in one movie.<br/><br/>What can I say about this movie's technical side that hasn't already been said? To be honest, nothing but that won't stop me from praising it to death. The CGI in this movie is hysterically funny and awful but works so, so well with the ultraviolent over the top tone. The cinematography, editing and lighting are all so visually stunning. It is a fantastic looking movie and I can recommend it purely for its gorgeous cinematography. Both the costume and set design are exceptional. It is a technical masterpiece of a film!<br/><br/>Now the action. The ACTION! It is beautiful. B-E-A-UTIFUL! When this movie goes down, it GOES DOWN! There is ONE black in white sequence, during which my jaw was on the floor in total and utter awe. Making that rhyme wasn't intentional but it was a fun occurrence so I ain't touching it. All major action set pieces in this movie are excellent and look fantastic. They are stunning and true delights to watch.<br/><br/>​ This is such a great, fun, ultra-violent movie which I cannot recommend enough. Don't let the overly violent nature of it scare you off, I haven't got a strong stomach but it is more cartoony than disturbing. Not that I recommend kids see it, though. I'll rate this movie 10 Severed Limbs out of 10! Please see this gem if you have not."

","I started watching all of Quentin Tarantino's films and the one I was looking forward to was Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2. But, I watched it and I felt that it was good but I don't see why everybody loves it so much. The film's style and direction are very good and I did absolutely love the soundtrack. That scene in which The Bride is killing the 88s is just one of the most glorious scenes I've ever, well, scene. But I found the characters very bland and I found I couldn't care about any of the characters. The action sequences (apart from the incredible Crazy 88s scene) weren't very well shot or directed. The story itself was very well written and the dialogue felt lacking for a Quentin Tarantino film. I was just quite disappointed overall but I still like it - 7/10"
"pounde","8","1","2","1 May 2016"," I love It!!!
","This movie is super packed with wall to wall martial arts action! Kill Bill is the story of an assassin that became pregnant attempted to start a new life then was attacked for leaving the group she worked with. She survived the attack on her life and sought her revenge on her attackers once she woke up from several years in a coma. This film is loaded with great actors such as Uma Thurman as The Bride, Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and David Carradine also appear in this film although their characters don't truly manifest until Kill Bill Vol. 2. While it is easy to get lost in the action and get turned off by some of the over the top highly improbable special effects, this film is really just fun to watch and try to figure out what is going on in the mind of Quentin Tarantino as he produces films with such a unique style of editing and transition between scenes. While some of his films can be hard to keep up with kill Bill is pretty easy to follow but sometimes hard to watch as the ""blood and guts factor"" can be a little rough. The major focus of this film is the story of The Bride and her journey to exact revenge on her attackers and she does this in fabulous fashion! It seems that there has been such a decline in great martial arts films over the last few decades and Kill Bill Vol. 1 is defiantly a film that could light a fire in this genre. The theme of this film is purely revenge at its finest! To be more precise, revenge against the individuals that tried to destroy her life and ended her chance to be with her family. A true story of revenge reminiscent of films such as ""The Punisher"" and ""Gladiator"". <br/><br/>Some of the things about this film that really stuck out to me similar to most Tarantino films, were the many transitions through time the story jumps back and forth through the timeline to help piece the story of The Bride together. Also the different shots in which the characters are captured truly presents the actors in intense dramatic fashion, some of the unrealistic gore was slightly over the top but I truly believe that simply captures Tarantino's style in film production. This series is definitely on the list of my favorites when I just want to sit back and watch a good fight."
"jewjubes","10","1","2","25 April 2016"," The Quintessential Martial Arts/Revenge Film
","Quite possibly the greatest film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Tarantino has really outdone himself on this one, from the art direction to the music, every little detail of this film was clearly hand-picked to give the maximum effect. <br/><br/>The action sequences are plentiful and are full of excitement. Drawing influence from 1970s martial arts films, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 brings martial arts into the new millennia. This film is not for everyone however, as it is incredibly violent (as expected of Tarantino), though the violence is very well done and adds incredible excitement to the film.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is the fight between the Bride and O-Ren Ishii. This scene is excellent in the way that it contrasts Japanese fighting and setting with Spanish music. The whole film is this way, contrasting things that you would not otherwise expect to work, but somehow, through Tarantino's mastery, does. The scene leading up to this one in which the Bride fights members of the Japanese Yakuza is also very memorable.<br/><br/>In short, 10/10. This is the quintessential martial arts and revenge film."
"Irishchatter","7","1","2","15 April 2016"," Woah a lotta fighting there!
","I never actually seen this before until a few nights ago. Kill Bill is like this action movie where there is so much fighting, that you could easily get lost in figuring out what is actually going on here! Uma Thurman was really good in this but what was the point in beeping out her name,seriously? It doesn't make any sense whatsoever, we know she is, there is no need to wipe her name out. I mean herself and the people involved with her are bad guys yeah? So again, why? I'll never understand why Tarantino would add that onto the movie! Sure he adds everything dramatic and creative so ill have to give him credit for that! <br/><br/>I wasn't able to see half of the movie but I wouldn't consider going back to watch it again. Not because it's violent but it's just not the movie I would enjoy much regardless if it had a lot of action or a super heroine involved in it...."
"donuthaters12","6","1","2","8 January 2014"," Style Over Substance
","Kill Bill is an epic film that is split into two volumes, though one story, the two volumes cannot be more different in it's execution. Kill Bill, when I first watched it as a whole, was definitely entertaining but as time went on I have watched Tarantino's films over and over again, I started to lose that feeling that I had with this film and changed my perception of it. Kill Bill may be epic but it lacks something that keeps it from being his best work.<br/><br/>Kill Bill: Volume 1 is written by Quentin Tarantino and what he has written here is simply a revenge-action story. This approach is not a problem for me because it allows me to digest it simply and avoid ambiguity in it's storytelling. Jackie Brown was an example of Tarantino taking a conventional 3 act structure and making it his own. Kill Bill: Vol 1 follows that approach but making it much more epic and somewhat adventurous. The thing about Tarantino's writing here is that he has written something that is much more mainstream friendly than compared to his previous work, which in a way is great because I think that's what he really wants, is to exploit these dying genres and styles to his films for the mainstream audience. Tarantino has written a protagonist that we know very little about, yet we enjoy seeing her kick-ass and reaching closer to her goal. The film is full of dialogue, though not as punchy and indulgent as his previous films as the dialogue here is more reliant on it's attitude and delivery. The most enjoyable part of the film is truly the last half of the film where she is up against O-Ren Ishii, and honestly it is so interesting to see these two battle it out because of all the backstory and hype that is being given to us of O-Ren Ishii, it makes her seem like such a challenging opponent.<br/><br/>This is the 4th film by Quentin Tarantino and between the two volumes, I can definitely say that this first volume is much more fun and entertaining to watch. The reason this film is so appealing is that it is enforced with such style mainly influenced by the Asian cinema, particularly in the 70-80s. I don't mind that the film is stylish but it can only do so much. I am more disappointed with the film's screenplay rather than Tarantino's vision and direction. Kill Bill is the mark for Tarantino, when he started paying homages to his personal attachments in films, and he continues to do so in his latter films. The first three of his films has this technique in delaying action and giving us more of the characters in their most normal moments, but Kill Bill strays away from that by upping the violence and action almost to the point unbelievability. Also, the audience must lower their rational thinking when watching this as the film doesn't take itself too seriously, which is a reason why this is viewed over and over again by it's fans.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is also the start of Robert Richardson's collaboration with Tarantino as his cinematographer. Richardson has worked on prestigious films for most of his career, and worked with prestigious directors like Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese, and Rob Reiner. Out of all of those directors, I think working with Tarantino allows him to experiment more with the camera and create something more unique. Kill Bill may not look like a unique film as the way it looks feels more like something you have seen before and that is the response that it's supposed to get from us. Kill Bill's photography pays tribute to the shots found on Sergio Leone's films, or the clichés that are found in Asian action films. Kill Bill's image looks colorful and at times being so saturated it loses the sense of naturalism.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is also the start of Tarantino relying on a film score in driving the musical side of the film. His previous films were full of soundtracks that go exquisitely well with the scene, it's the same outcome here but just replacing it with a score from RZA. The score for this film isn't cutting edge or the best I have heard from a Tarantino film but it is stylish enough that it goes with the director's vision. There are spots in the film where you can hear musical segments either made by Ennio Morricone or inspired by it.<br/><br/>This film is primarily driven by Uma Thurman's performance as The Bride and she does a great job, though this isn't my favorite role from her. Thurman has to play this character who is clearly emotionally and physically traumatized by Bill's actions but at the same time project a shade of a bad-ass assassin who is fueled by anger. I don't think anybody else could have accomplished this role physically. As the film doesn't take it's self seriously, it does hold Thurman back from showing her range in acting. Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii was great; she was fun, exciting, dangerous, and bitchin'. Liu stand out scene was when she was at the table with a group of Japanese gang leaders, as she managed to come off as frightening but at the same time give off a comedic under tone in her acting. The bulk of the villains are not seen until the second volume, so for the most part it pretty much covers both of these actresses.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is definitely an example of style over substance but it does well enough with the former that it doesn't lead off as such a terrible movie. Do I wish the script was better, yeah maybe it needed a bit more, but that isn't enough for me to dislike it. Give it a try but I suggest lowering one's expectations and rationality before heading in."
"Samiam3","Null","1","2","14 April 2010"," exceptional style, memorable but not perfect
","What is the recipe for Quentin Tarantino. A little Spagetti Western, a little Akira Kurosawa, a bit of mixed media, and an artistic/humorous take on the spilling of blood and bodily fluids. Works great in Kill Bill, a film with exception style, worthy of praise even if it is occasionally slow.<br/><br/>Another thing memorable about Quentin Tarantino, is the manner in which he has found a loophole through the rules of conventional storytelling and narration. I am referring of course to the way he gives his film chapters, allowing him to jump from here to there without ruining the story, always something new. The smartest thing about Kill Bill, is how you know absolutely nothing when the film starts, and even when it ends, there are many questions posed (intentional of course). With each chapter something new is revealed. This is how he keeps you going, in order to get answers one must sit through and endure his tedium, black sense of humour, and you won't get any answers if you walk out.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is essentially the ultimate revenge story, a modern Count of Monte Cristo. Uma Thurman, wakes up from deaths doorstep, and she is eager to go after the five people who almost killed her on her wedding day. Bill is #1.<br/><br/>Of course the reason Kill Bill is in two parts, is because, Tarantino is slow. He throws in pauses and segments of silence where no other filmmaker since Kurosawa (or Sergio Leone) has. This is one of the reason he is so controversial. Much of the movie is a build-up, but the payoff is sufficient, Kill Bill vol 1. has a killer climax, and an equally big cliffhanger ending.<br/><br/>If you can stomach Tarantino, I guarantee, Kill Bill Vol 1 will make you eager for more."
"michael_the_nermal","7","1","2","11 November 2009"," A Film for Film Buffs----Casual Movie-Goers Beware!
","After having seen ""Resevoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" and Grindhouse"", along with this movie, I can safely assume that Quentin Tarantino makes movies for those in the know about crime dramas, martial arts films, ivory tower academic analysis of pop culture and ""the aesthetics of violence"", and '70s TV shows. Those who are not familiar with any of the four subjects will not understand Tarantino's movies, nor are they likely to fully enjoy them. I, myself, am not a film buff, but merely a casual movie-viewer, much like the general public. I have not seen many crime dramas or martial arts movies, and my knowledge of '70s TV shows is limited to the sitcoms that aired on Nick-at-Nite and TV Land. I spent some time in the ivory tower to obtain a liberal-arts degree, but it was not in film, sociology or any degree which would help me understand film-as-art, much less the concept of the ""aesthetitization of violence"" in art. As a result, Tarantino's films, and ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" in particular, make little sense to me. Not having a film degree or an IQ above 120, I will attempt to judge ""Kill Bill"" as I see it, solely on its own merits as entertainment and as a story.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" is a simple revenge story, with the unique use of females as butt-kicking super-heroes and supervillains, rather than the muscle-bound, virile men, such as Charles Bronson or Chuck Norris, that we've seen a gajillion times. Having a female as a tough, resilient, capable hero, as opposed to a delicate damsel-in-distress is a tradition that is best exemplified in the 1979 classic ""Alien"", where Sigourney Weaver does an excellent job as the protagonist Ripley. This genre results in above-average-to-excellent acting on the part of the actresses. Uma Thurman is wonderful as Black Mamba, a former assassin with a blood-lust for erstwhile allies who massacred her soon-to-be husband and entourage at her wedding. With a bullet presumably still lodged in her brain, Black Mamba is somewhat unhinged and given to spurts of savage violence, yet still possess a conscience, and will not harm those in a helpless position, nor will she attack innocent bystanders. The morality of Black Mamba's vengeance quest is analyzed by the character giving her her superweapon---her ""Excalibur"", if you will----Hattori Hanzo. At least Tarantino gives Black Mamba a conscience and does not give free rein to guts and gore without considering the consequences that violence will have on people.<br/><br/>People who deplore violence in movies can at least be relieved that the carnage in ""Kill Bill"" is so over-the-top and incredible as to be cartoonish. Black Mamba is not a realistic assassin, but a superhero like those in the comic books who can literally slice and dice a whole army of Japanese mafia thugs, take katana wounds that would kill an ordinary person and still have the stamina to kill off even more enemies. Perhaps her madness and lust for vengeance render her an invincible hero (like Stalone's ""Rambo"", to whom Black Mamba would undoubtedly be compared), and enjoying ""Kill Bill"" and its ultra-violence require a huge suspension of disbelief. This film's a celebration of other films---possibly even violent flicks like ""Rambo""----rather than anything resembling real life.<br/><br/>Many aspects of this film seem clearly inspired by other movies. Uma's character has close-up shots that focus on her eyes as they narrow on an enemy. This, along with Black Mamba's proficiency with a sword, seem, consciously or not, to be inspired by Taarna from ""Heavy Metal."" ""Kill Bill"" certainly seems to share that cartoon classic's love of bloodshed. Like ""Resevior Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Kill Bill"" has an eclectic soundtrack of '60s rock and pop hits, as well as some weird Spanish bolero instrumental that plays while Black Mamba faces off Volume 1's main antagonist, Cottonmouth. In all, Tarantino wanted a movie that was far more style than substance. If the audience does not understand that, they most likely will not like this movie.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is as beautiful as ever, and it was a delight to see those close-up shots of her deep-blue eyes. She is a wonderful actress, and has a full understanding of what Tarantino wanted for his protagonist. The only other stand-out performance was Lucy Liu's understated yet sufficiently-menacing role as the leader of the Japanese mafia, Cottonmouth. I will need to see Volume 2 to adequately judge David Carradine and Daryll Hannah's roles as antagonists. Vivicia Fox's role as Copperhead is all too brief, but she does well for the limited screen time she has.<br/><br/>As I'm not intelligent enough to get art-house movies or understand Tarantino's vision, I cannot give a truly thorough judgment. Still it was a decent, if bizarre movie with a powerful female lead who was fun to watch on screen. As a stand-alone, Volume 1 is a missing piece. One would have to watch Volume 2 to ""get"" the whole of ""Kill Bill."""
"JoaoPovoaMarinheiro","8","1","2","13 September 2009"," Fast paced cult action flick that mocks oriental martial arts films and B-type movies
","Quentin Tarantino has done it again. This time he returns with this odd western spaghetti/martial arts/action movie that turns out to be brilliant in it's content and in it's message.<br/><br/>The story centers around a woman only known as 'The Bride' (everytime someone says her name, we can hear a beep), that was brutally mistreated on her wedding rehearsal, along with her groom and friends (all killed), by a gang known as the Deadly Viper Organisation led by a man only known as Bill. Even with a bullet in her head, she doesn't die and swears revenge on all that were involved in the massacre. And here begins a wild ride filled with fights, samurai swords, and a lot of blood.<br/><br/>Once again, Tarantino delivers us a fun-filled crazy plot, different from his last movies, and in which with 'Kill Bill Vol.1', he exploits ironically this unusual western spaghetti flick mixed with hard martial arts action, that of course mocks the oriental flicks of the same genre and uses the B-type films main theme: vengeance. The result is a bloody fast paced action movie that really achieves what it's meant to achieve, and that's to entertain.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is brilliant with her deadly 'Bride' role, and she rocks with her legendary Hattori Hanzo sword. She highlights this movie. The rest of the cast are an interesting choice and we get to know four members of the group. The O-Ren Rishii animated introduction was an excellent point by the way.<br/><br/>RZA gives us a strange but adequate soundtrack with pop, country, rock and oriental influences.<br/><br/>Finishing up, if you're a Tarantino fan and want to see a flick filled with bloody martial arts action and a story about vengeance, then 'Kill Bill Vol.1' is a success in those patterns - 8/10."
"Eumenides_0","5","1","2","9 September 2009"," Ode to Superficiality
","Some people argue that there isn't anything most boring than a revenge story. It's really nothing more than someone going around killing people in escalating violence, and with paper-thin characters. Kill Bill certainly reinforces that perception.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman plays a super-assassin who's betrayed by her former teammates on the day her wedding. After years in a coma, she wakes up seeking nothing but revenge. And for more than three hours of movie (I'm already including vol. 2 - God forbid vol. 1 actually had 3 hours!) what follows is repetitive action involving martial arts and swords.<br/><br/>Of course Quentin Tarantino is up to his usual gimmicks, so we see everything out of order and he inserts little stories in the main story in a poor attempt to flesh out uninteresting characters.<br/><br/>The tone of the movie is silliness combined with austerity. The characters' every action - whether talking or walking - is in a slow, very composed manner, full of solemnity, like they're doing something really deep. But then they're one-dimensional shadows, so everything they say is rubbish no matter how disguised it is with wanna-be philosophy. Everything is fake and unconvincing.<br/><br/>Only Tarantino's camera work is interesting in this movie; the way he crafts a fight scene is really amazing, I'd even say epic. Unfortunately he's not designing videogames.<br/><br/>I guess people who watch Kill Bill will get exactly what they know they will: superficial fluff with 'cool' lines and characters, and lots of violence. I'm sad to say I want more from my movies."

","I would say this movie was the ""Matrix Reloaded"" of this year, except that Reloaded WAS this year. Tarantino's suffered from all the same problems. Almost all scenes, fighting or dialogue, went on about twice as long as they needed to, several scenes just shattered the realm of even our most suspended disbelief, and finally this movie just thought it was way better and cooler than it really was. It had such potential, and did have some really good ideas and even some good scenes, but could have easily been only one hour long, so this whole 2-part BS could've been one film. Maybe with both parts together (and abbreviated) it could add up to one good film's worth.<br/><br/>Worst of all: At least the Matrix decided to use the separate Animatrix DVD to tell superfluous unnecessary back stories and side plots. No, Kill Bill decides to give us the wholly pointless origin of one of its supporting characters, and does it with a 10-15 minute segment, which would be bad enough, ...but they also decided, for no reason, to do it in anime...and not very good anime at that. Last complaint: the music. Wow, was that annoying."
"gftbiloxi","5","1","2","10 June 2007"," Entertaining But Trivial
","Tarantino makes movies about other movies: his films lift everything from characters to plot devices to camera angles, glosses up the costumes and attitudes, laces them with adolescent humor, and then swirls all the bits and pieces together in a tub of blood. The results have been extremely inconsistent but never less than interesting in at least an academic, art house sort of way.<br/><br/>KILL BILL, VOLUME 1 is essentially a teenage boy's blood and sex fantasy run amok. The story is so classically revenge it might have--and maybe was--inspired by Elizabethan drama. A woman who has been a member of an international squad of hired assassins becomes pregnant and decides to marry and retire; at her wedding reception, however, her handler and co-killers crash the event and kill every one. Well, almost every one: she survives. Four years later she awakens from a coma, is mightily ticked about the whole thing, and decides to kill everyone who was involved in the attack.<br/><br/>As in PULP FICTION, Tarantino borrows a great deal from a host of film masters, perhaps most notably from Hitchcock, Kubric, Altman, Stone, and Lynch: narrative camera angles that rise to provide a bird's eye view of the actors as they move through the sets, disjointed time, overlapping plots, and a heavily stylized visual sense. He also borrows a great deal from 1960s and 1970s ""trash cinema,"" most particularly Kung Fu foolishness and deliberately sparse spaghetti Westerns. In terms of story and overall execution, however, this is essentially the stuff of a pimple-ridden teenage boy's blood and sex fantasies: sexy women fighting, shooting, and slashing the hell out of each other.<br/><br/>In this instance Tarantino gets away with it because he seldom gives you very much time to think about any of it--and on the rare occasions when he does, he goes out of his way to point out his various juxtapositions with a gleeful ""I Meant To Do That!"" finger. And there is a lot about the film that is quite funny in the same pitch black, subversive way that PULP FICTION was funny. Two women square off in a snow-drenched Japanese garden to Spanish music and so on, the sort of small inter-cultural cinematic jibe that Tarantino does so well when he puts his mind to it. It's actually very entertaining.<br/><br/>But there is a problem here, and it is the same problem that has plagued every one of Tarantino's films. Yes, the film is deliberately trendy in a truly relentless way and often very funny as a result; yes, the fight choreography is visually stunning; yes, the deliberate clash of music and visuals and cultures is often very witty. But in the end it is all a surface cleverness with nothing underneath, and the film is really Tarantino's ode to how hip and cool he wants us to think he is. We never see him on the screen, but we're constantly aware of him standing off to one side screaming ""LOOK AT ME!"" You might describe the whole thing as an entertaining study in the director's overcompensation for not actually being the ""super-cool"" guy of his own cinematic fantasies.<br/><br/>Note to Mr. Tarantino: as a friend of mine is fond of saying, ""cool"" can't be acquired, it simply is, and you either have it or you don't. I've never met you, but I'm pretty sure that you aren't a quarter as ""cool"" as you tell people you are, and I'm also pretty certain that you know it yourself. Now, you actually seem to be a talented guy; why don't you stop this foolishness and actually do your own movie instead of tap-dancing through all the stuff, good and bad, you saw when you were fifteen? That said, I actually rather liked the film. (A lot of people won't. It is very bloody and the humor involved is dark.) It's worth a look, and if you don't expect anything except pure surface you may well enjoy it. But it's not something I'll watch again and I can't see myself going out of the way to see KILL BILL VOLUME 2.<br/><br/>GFT, Amazon Reviewer"

Kill Bill is based on a very thin story, the most important is to kill those who kill.

","Warning: really serious spoilers.<br/><br/>Curiosity led me to tape this off TV, and watch it. I have no fault to find with the acting: Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu, in particular, are excellent, and it is for that, and the undeniably impressive action scenes, that I give a mark of 7. But ...<br/><br/>I am not enough of a film buff to recognise all references, influences, etc., but for me the strongest influence is the comic book, and especially what I have seen from my son's collection of anime. This, of course, is fitting, since much of the action of Part 1 takes place in Japan. But it is most like the comic book in its focus on the central characters, who often seem to be moving in a world where the outside world barely exists and certainly does not interfere with their actions to any notable extent (no police pursuit of The Bride after the killing we see first, for instance; no attempts to find her when she's left the hospital). The central character, The Bride, is effectively a superhero; she survives what ought to be mortal wounds (even a shot in the head!); manages to dispose of two men and get herself into a wheelchair, and from that into a car, when just recovered from a bedridden coma lasting 4 years, apparently; fights and disposes of multiple opponents with only a samurai sword, displaying more than Xena-like agility and stamina and taking only minor damage until her climactic duel with Lucy Liu's character. How the child she was carrying is supposed to have survived is not at all clear(cut out of her after she was shot?); but we only learn this at the very end, in a pretty outrageous piece of manipulation. Maybe it is explained in Part 2(not seen yet).<br/><br/>This presentation of a character without any explanation of her abilities is not confined to The Bride. Lucy Liu's character becomes an expert assassin - fine; but she then becomes the 'boss of bosses' of all the yakuza in Tokyo. We are not given any hint of how she achieves this amazing feat, simply that she has. By this time, she has acquired an entourage of extremely lethal henchmen (and an equally lethal schoolgirl bodyguard), but The Bride disposes of them all (none of them takes a shot at her, even with a bow - they only use swords and other weapons of similar vintage), while their boss waits to fight the final duel, again with a sword only. Why? There is a good deal of extremely gory slicing off of hands, feet, limbs etc., but all those affected survive - they don't bleed to death, as they surely would without prompt application of tourniquets - especially the lawyer whose arm is cut off at the shoulder. But she must survive, to have information that The Bride wants tortured out of her.<br/><br/>Such total disregard for reality grates after a while. Comparisons with LOTR are inappropriate: in that characters cannot overcome great odds absolutely single-handed, they die (or appear to, in Gandalf's case), take wounds, feel fatigue etc. They still achieve their quest, very much against the odds (but they do have some magical help at crucial moments), but they seem much more plausibly human.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this film is a series of spectacles, which one is meant to admire without questioning any details of their presentation. I cannot suspend disbelief to that extent; but I will watch Part 2 just to find out how the end happens (I know from reviews the barest outline of what happens in it)."

There is virtually nothing really new in these two movies, and what is worse, QT chooses to emphasize what he PREFFERS from his CALEIDOSCOPE of creation, and he chooses kung-fu, no plot, violence, special effects and pointless chaos. These elements, combined with good story, complex acting and witty and original dialog, to name a few of the things I like about QT work, are complementary, but in Kill Bill, they stand alone and dry out in the film.<br/><br/>I will give this movie 4 points for beautiful visuals, some nice dialog and some good directing now and then, and generally for QT, which I like a lot as an artist and an innovator, but, man, stop your eclectic, self-indulgent ""thing"" and move forward instead of backward."

","I saw Kill Bill for the first time tonight. Time for me to do my part in informing my small sampling of the population within my email grasp of a few points: That is the weakest most pathetic excuse for a kung fu flick I have EVER seen, and I have seen a lot of kung fu movies. Absolutely pathetic fight scenes. PATHETIC and a mockery of all that is quality Asian fighting. After hearing so many people tell me that it was such a great movie for so long now, I have decided that from this point forward anyone and everyone that ever even hints at telling me that it has actual ""kung fu"" quality to it will personally offend me since they obviously have no idea what a real kung fu flick is (see: ANY Jackie Chan, Jet Li, or even some Bruce Lee movies, and just about any old kung fu rerun on some bad cable channel is better). Why personally offend me? Because if you insist on Kill Bill's kung fu quality I am sorry but I find it insulting to my own selection of associates that I would actually hang out with people of such 1) high ignorance and/or 2) poor taste.<br/><br/>To add to that, in case you are swept away by pop-culture mass-thinking and mass-conformity as most of the general population is, let me also point out that * the cinematography was only average and above so in maybe 10% of the movie at most, and that's me being very generous, * the acting was mediocre to average, only occasionally reaching above average, * the casting was just OK, * the over-abundance of gratuitous violence is like dumping the whole bottle of cologne or perfume on oneself instead of the appropriate dab, * and lastly, the only redeeming values to it were 1)the plot, 2) the soundtrack (pretty good, even though any potentially decent fight scene was completely wrecked by poorly selected corresponding tracks), and 3) the sword-making Japanese guy, who was very very cool.<br/><br/>I thought I would let you all know since apparently this type of drivel has been media-hyped enough to have taken advantage of those unfamiliar with higher levels of quality movies (see: Hero or Iron Monkey or Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) and tricked most people with its childish flash into using it as some sort of benchmark. If you don't agree, fine.

I apologize to the many dedicated Tarantino fans, but honestly, if not for the accolades from this dedicated group, Kill Bill Vol. 1 would be just another theatrical foot note from the many films released in 2003. I'm not saying it was a bad, but certainly not an ""instant classic."" <br/><br/>You've heard the expression that something is so ""bad it's good,"" I assume that this is what Tarantino was trying to do with the over-the-top Kung-Fu action and corny storyline. I can't say that he was unsuccessful, but not to the degree of earning ""classic"" status. That's really my only gripe with this film. <br/><br/>The featured band, the 5,6,7,8s, whom I genuinely liked very much, would also fall into that category of being so bad, they're good. I think the decision to cast them in this film was an apposite choice. (I just wish that Vonage didn't play the song ""Woo Hoo"" in their US TV commercials, it's really made that song become quite annoying).<br/><br/>In its cheesy and corny way, this film does successfully pay tribute to the genre of Japanese action films, Menga, and Anime. If this is your bailiwick, you will certainly enjoy Kill Bill. Moreover, it's done with tongue-in-cheek and can be quite clever at times. Nevertheless, the action, gore, and story become a bit too sophomoric at times.<br/><br/>To summarize, this film is not bad, but aside the cheesy tributes and over-the-top gore, this film lacks the DEPTH to warrant the praise Tarantino received from his earlier works. In 10 or 20 years I suspect that Kill Bill will fall from ""instant classic"" to just a book mark.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Fun action film, but let's not go crazy."

The plot is: ""A women was gunned down at her wedding and her former comrades, now she wakes up from a comma and is determined to get revenge on them."" That is it. The Bride (main char) is not at all likable. We should have seen her before the shooting, so we can attach with her character. Instead we found as a b****, ruthless hunting down married people for revenge. That is what the plot is, one women hunting down people for revenge. It tries to be more interisting with loads of pointless flashbacks and flashforwards but fails miserably. The only time the film gets remotely interisting is at the very end<br/><br/>SPOILER ALEART!!!!!<br/><br/>when we find out that her daughter might still be alive.<br/><br/>END SPOILER!!!!!<br/><br/>The gore in this film is so over used that it becomes comical. I was laughing at times which I do not think was suppose to happen. Having people get cut and spray blood out like a fountain is not emotional, it is unrealistic and funny. You have got to learn how to do gore right and Kill Bill fails here as well. The violence washes over you, it has no meaning. It is not like saving private ryan where you feel shock when you see and guy go torn in half. The gore is comical and badly used.<br/><br/>However, despite it's flaws, Kill Bill is an enjoyable flick. I recommend it but do not expect anything special from it."

","Did everyone either love this or despise it? I watched this with my son shortly after he had had four wisdom teeth removed. He was on pain killers--I was keeping him company and he asked me to rent this. He's much more savvy than I am toward these things. It was intriguing--Quentin Trantino's blood fest. Now, is this a ballet or a movie, because if one does not suspend disbelief (even at the bedrock of the thing) this is just ridiculous. Arms severed, blood flying, one gory scene after another, one trying to outdo the previous one. As with most of this stuff, anyone who has ever banged his shin or cut himself, knows that it takes very little to disable a human being. So, if you go ahead and accept that human beings can handle this, then you move right into fantasy, and as I said, a ballet of violence. Choreographed as are most martial arts movies, it works as a meandering blood portrait, a Jackson Pollock of gore. Numbers mean nothing. One person defeats an army. The army simply widens the landscape and the dance continues. Is there anyone in this movie we care about. I can't think of one. Enlighten me. Everything escalates and we are left with one last part of the ballet.<br/><br/>Pardon my naiveté, but the people who love this stuff--why? What is it in you that makes you gravitate toward it? I know I'm an old fogie, but it's easy to see why we don't care what happens to people in war. We feed ourselves a constant diet of this. The violence on the streets continues. ""A Clockwork Orange"" predicted this culture a long time ago and, look around, we have met the enemy and he is us. I suppose that every movie is looked at as art. Even the wost filmmakers call themselves artists (musicians seem to always do this), and there's little question that Quentin Tarantino has an incredible camera eye. I would be interested in seeing if he can make something other than a blood bath."

","this is gonna be a two person review by Clo and Moo. We're just sitting together so we might as well review like our favourite movie. Background info: Kill Bill follows The Bride, a former assassin who worked for a man named Bill. The film commences on her wedding day, when Bill and the rest of the Deadly Vipers squad ambush the ceremony and leave The Bride for dead. She returns from a coma to get revenge on every person who wronged her, especially Bill. Hence the name 'Kill Bill'. <br/><br/>Moo: Kill Bill wasn't awful. It's a definite favourite on my end, even though there are some faults and flaws to the movie so it isn't really worth a 10. <br/><br/>Clo: I'm a huge Tarantino fan, and let's just say I wasn't disappointed with this. This movie is definitely violent (not for little kids!) but it's awesome for the older set. Not quite as good as Pulp Fiction, but definitely on a par with Reservoir Dogs. <br/><br/>Moo: Yeah..straight from the QT fan there. Hehe I've never seen anything else except for the Kill Bill movies from QT, but to me I really appreciated the fake violence. Some people might complain, but the violence (like spurting blood) really made it seem like an epic cartoon parody which is, of course, uber fun. Unreality rocks. But there are some parts of the storyline that take away from the film. There's no point saying what because I'd get blacklisted! :) <br/><br/>Clo:That's all for now! I definitely recommend this film. However, if you are disgusted with violence or gore, this is NOT your thing. <br/><br/>Moo: But it's a great thing for a Saturday night with friends. It's actually fun for all the dramaticness. Check it out."
"MichaelMargetis","10","1","2","2 April 2005"," Tarantino's Amazing Comeback!
","For about 100 years (well actually six), we anticipated the return of Quentin Tarantino to cinema. Many people didn't know what he was doing, and there was some ill-conceived rumors going around that he was dead. In 2000 or 2001 Tarantino was involved with a Broadway production with Marisa Tomei, but most of us don't want to see Quentin act. He was put on this earth to direct. I was immensely excited when Kill Bill was announced, yet very critical when I found out that it would be split into two parts; Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2 (due out four months after the release of Vol. 1). When I walked into the theater on opening day for the first showing in Arizona (I believe it was 10:50) I didn't know what to expect. I wanted to expect an awesome tour-de-force film filled with mind-blowing visuals and unlimited coolness, but I had a pretty good idea I'd be let down. Well as soon as the credits started to role, I realized I was wrong. This was not an excellent film, it was something even better. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a masterpiece, a surprising masterpiece.<br/><br/>There are so many magnificent qualities of Kill Bill Vol. 1. The visuals are to die for, the action sequences are exquisitely choreographed (especially the one at the House of Blue Leaves), the writing is crisp and not repetitive, the directing is top-notch and the acting for the most part is very good. Uma Thurman delivers perhaps her finest screen performance as The Bride, an ex-hit woman gunned down at her wedding by her previous boss, Bill (played by Kung Fu's David Carradine - in a terrific role) and his other protégés including O-Ren Ishii aka Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green aka Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox - in a tiny role), Budd aka Sidewinder (in an even tinier role) and Elle Driver aka California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah - in an interesting role.) During the process of shooting up The Bride's wedding, The Bride miscarriages and goes into a coma for four years. After she awakens she goes on a kill crazy rampage to get revenge on those who tried to kill her and murdered he would-be baby girl. <br/><br/>In Vol. 1 the Bride only gets to numbers 1) and 2) on her hit list which are Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu, but in Vol. 2 Carradine, Hannah and Madsen are said to have way bigger roles. <br/><br/>All in all, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a masterpiece of a film and a hell of a way to start a film saga. Although it isn't nearly as groundbreaking as 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs', I think it will be more widely popular because of it's more mainstream attitude (not to mention it's not an independent feature like 'Pulp' and 'Dogs'). If you haven't already, go out and rent this along with Vol. 2. Thank you Tarantino, Kill Bill was worth the six year wait.

"killbillroxxorz","10","1","2","27 March 2005"," One of the best films ever made!
","Quentin Tarintino has surely directed a masterpiece in Kill Bill Volume 1. Using his passion for Samurai movies he has written and directed, in my own words, a working masterpiece. Each minute of this movie blows me away every time i watch it. The characters, the dialog, the story. It all fits in perfectly at the end. Definitely worth the watch if your a action or movie lover alike! The shocking conclusion then leads on to Volume 2 which is just as awesome. I know the name being killbillroxxorz might seem abit biased, but i am a definite movie lover and the first time i ever watched Vol 1. it surpassed Donnie Darko and Fight Club as my most favorite movie of all time. There's not enough words in the dictionary to describe the brilliance and passion of this film. The House of Blue Leaves scene makes the DVD worth the cash! A must see!"
"dan_delago","9","1","2","13 March 2005"," Tarantino hits one out of the ball park!
","I first saw this movie in the dentist's chair of all places. That's right, my dentist allows you to watch a visor with a film playing while he does his drilling and cleaning. I thought Kill Bill Vol. 1 was appropriate in the dentist's chair. This is a non-stop action flick to the nth power.<br/><br/>I decided to purchase the DVD and give it a second look. I was not disappointed. I was never bored, never looking at my watch. Uma Thurman plays the ultimate femme fatale. I liked the yellow jump suit effect. It reminded me of the jump suit that Bruce Lee wore in his last unfinished film called, ""Game of Death."" I was a big fan of Bruce Lee movies and I like the way Tarantino pays his respects to Bruce Lee and the Kung Fu genre as well.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie is captivating. The way the scenes are set up and the music really contributes to the heightened tension in the scenes. The choreography is spectacular. Uma really must have had to condition herself for those fight scenes. You can tell it is her in most of the fight scenes doing her own stunts. Don't you hate it when you see a double in a fight scene? You don't have to worry about that in Kill Bill. This is the real deal folks.<br/><br/>I also like the Japanese characters in the film too. It brings such an authentic feel to a picture when you here the villains speaking in their own native tongue. I don't mind subtitles in those scenes. It gives a nice touch to the scenes. You really think these fights are taking place in Japan. And who was Lucy Liu's body guard? Her character's name was called Go Go. She is wearing this naughty school girl outfit. She's hot! This film will definitely go down as a classic. Tarantino's signature style shines through once again."

","An amazing achievement by Quentin Tarantino. Very good plot, very strong acting. Highly recommend this to any and all movie lovers. This movie is filled with intensity and action. Many outstanding fight scenes, a must see movie. Kill Bill Vol. 1 ends and makes you want to see Vol 2. I have yet to watch that. The movie clasps onto you throughout the entire film, and takes you through the mind of the bride. It ends after 2 hours and feels like what has been 30 minutes. One of the best made movies of 2003 and an extremely detailed story line that takes you through piece by piece. Expect an overall good movie and be sure you have volume 2 handy, for you wont be able to sleep until you've watched it. A real thriller and a classic film worth seeing."
"metjetfan10","10","1","2","2 February 2005"," Quentin's masterpiece?
","i have long been a fan of writer/director Quentin Tarantino. after i saw the first film he wrote, true romance (which i strongly recommend), i knew that Tarantino was destined to go far. that he did. he proved with reservoir dogs and pulp fiction that brilliant acting and outlandish violence can go hand in hand. i was immediately hooked to his work, i awaited his next film.<br/><br/>about 5 years after pulp fiction, Jackie brown was added to Tarantino's resume. i entered the theater hoping for another bloody tale of criminals. to some extent, i got what i had hoped for. yet i was not satisfied. i was very impressed, yet something was missing. to this day, i do not know what it was.<br/><br/>this did not decrease my obsession with Tarantino's work. i was eagerly anticipating his next film. in 2003, he made what i feel is his best work. kill bill.<br/><br/>the weeks before the much talked about opening brought out the doubters of the film's quality. the plot was simple, too simple many thought. a former assassin seeks bloody revenge on her attempted murderers from her wedding day. i almost began to agree with them, until i saw it.<br/><br/>the opening scene is possibly the best in the film. ""Do you find me sadistic?"" are the opening words from the faceless Bill to a bloody women (uma Thurman) in her wedding gown. after a short monologue, bill shoots the bride in the head after she says something so shocking, it was make an audience completely surprised if it had been at the end of any other film. <br/><br/>and it just gets better from there. after waking from a coma which took 4 1/2 years of her life, the bride goes on a revenge rampage unmixed in any film to date. the violence is shocking, yet it is one of the main reasons of the film's greatness. Quentin Tarantino creates a style of sword-play in which an area of the body that has just lost it's attachment (neck, shoulder, etc.) will shoot gallons of blood straight up several feet like a fountain. this tackiness makes the movie so much fun to watch. you almost want to jump up and cheer in the theater after a head is chopped off. <br/><br/>several months later, when kill bill vol. 2 came out, the doubters were nowhere to be found. it was somehow the same movie, yet completely different at the same time. Tarantino fans attended showings of the film expecting another sword fight in the garden with oh ren ishi, but were treated to another side of the bride. a compassionate side who will stop at nothing for those she loves. and the fearless samurai who slaughters hundreds with no remorse? say bye-bye, because the bride will be afraid. <br/><br/>but perhaps the best performance in the film is that of Michael madsen, or Budd. of the former colleagues f the bride in the deadly viper assassin squad, he is the first one to seemingly have a conscience. ""that women deserves her revenge. and we deserve to die"". this truly brings out the character of Budd. he is sorry for all the people he has killed and wants to start a new life. he has even gotten rid of the one thing that represents his past. <br/><br/>Tarantino is able to make us take pity on the sworn enemy of the heroin, and you might even hope for a second or two that Budd doesn't die. but don't worry, because he soon proves that he is nothing but evil and all he knows is brutal murder.<br/><br/>Tarantino, in kill bill, has created a whole new genre of film. it's a little bit of martial arts, comedy, drama, and spaghetti western. he has even added a few things from his old movies (uma fingers a square in the air, like pulp fiction; Samuel l. Jackson even makes an appearance in vol.2, but you'll have to look real hard for him). <br/><br/>kill bill is by no means a family film, but if you are looking to be entertained, kill bill is the best place to go to."

"miken-3","8","1","2","24 January 2005"," A different type of action thriller!
","If you liked a movie like Pulp Fiction (I believe it was from Tarantino too) you will definitely like this film. It is sliced into chapters that are each individual stories which do not happen in sequential order. Each chapter is excellent in itself (one chapter is done in animation) and the only reason I didn't rate the movie higher is the time sequencing sometimes gets confusing and by the end of the movie you still don't understand what happened to have Uma Thurman's wedding party attacked.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are very unique and extremely gory, though a lot of the blood looks like colored water from a sprinkler. Tarantino has a lot of tributes to Bruce Lee such as using the Flight of the Bumblebee song (theme of the Green Hornet), having several of the villains wear Green Hornet masks, and having Uma wear a Bruce Lee type body suit (a la Game of Death) in the grand finale fight sequences."
"A Jay","10","1","2","19 January 2005"," Can't get much better than this
","This is a masterful film. Superbly acted, wonderfully directed and expertly rolled together in an all action romp with a sword. From the opening scene I knew I was going to love this film. Uma Thurman gives a totally believable performance as the bride so mercilessly tortured by Bill and his D.I.V.A.S<br/><br/>The basic premise is that the Bride on her wedding day was brutally attacked by the gang she left when she wanted to get married and have a baby. Because the attack was so violent the bride remains in a coma for 4 years. When she wakes up, she discovers her baby gone and goes on a brutal killing spree against the people responsible for the attack. In this film, Vernita Green a respectable housewife now and O-Ren Ishii, head of the Japanese mafia. The Venita Green fight is short and violent, but none the less satisfying. It introduces us to the situation and leads happily on to the main part of the film, which actually takes place before the brides attack on Vernita Green. It is the tracking down of O-Ren Ishii. Her backstory is cleverly told through Japanese style animation. <br/><br/>The whole style of the direction of the latter half of the film is wonderful. The homages to various styles of kung-fu films from the 60's and 70's is a fascinating take on the story and brings a refreshing view to what could have become a very stale and boring story of revenge. the reason why it works so well is that it is taken to a whole new level of clever moments that thrill the audience and kept me captivated for best part of 2 hours. With a film this good, time goes out the window. Yes it is insanely violent in places, but hey this is Tarantino and to have held him back to a PG certificate wouldn't have done the film justice. I couldn't help but give this 10/10 because I loved it, plain and true"

"astarte59","10","1","2","13 January 2005"," A contemporary myth
","The ""Kill Bill"" films comprise (among other things) a self-conscious creation of a contemporary myth. The characters are larger-than-life in the manner of the classical gods, and like the classical gods they are jealous, violent, often petty, and indifferent to the loss of human life. Existing on this mythical level, they can't be judged by human laws or ethics and social conventions. They're operating in a different realm altogether. Thus, almost every aspect of the film is larger-than-life, often in self-conscious and deliberately humorous (albeit dark humor) way: the spurting and raining, and artistically spattered blood, the name of Bill's Gang (the Deadly Viper Assassin Squad, which just sounds silly), the numerous references to other films (building on an accumulated contemporary myth), the use of an anime film-within-the-film (O-ren Ishii's biography), the Bride's ability to defeat a mini-army of kung fu fighters, the tangled relationship between the Bride and Bill (again reminiscent of the classical gods), and finally, the Revenge (with a capital R) motif and the Bride's re- creation as a Mother (think Ripley in ""Aliens"" who is also larger-than-life). The Bride's skills are obviously larger-than-life, giving her a superhuman quality. The films also comprise a quest story (a la Joseph Campbell), including the elements of separation, initiation, and return, and including such typical quest conventions as the helping character who provides the hero with a gift (in particular the katana the Bride receives from Hattori Hanzo and the knowledge of the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart technique she learns from her martial arts Master, Pai Mei. The films are filled with hilariously exaggerated moments, suggesting that they aren't to be taken entirely seriously--self-conscious myths can be funny and mythic at the same time, and the Kill Bill films succeed wonderfully."
"robincurrie42","10","1","2","2 January 2005"," Amazing !!!
","Kill Bill is directed by one of the finest directors on this planet - Quentin Tartintino, but Kill Bill tops all of his other great films. The films main theme is revenge and it is full of it. There are lots of great characters who you either really hate or really love. It is full of kick ass fighting and great speech. Uma Thurman is great in the film but my favourite character has to be the crazy teenage Japanese killer GoGo played by Chiaki Kuriyama ( also in Battle Royale.)I think that Kill Bill Volume 1 is better than Volume 2 so if you haven't seen Kill Bill and you like great action films i would definitely recommend it to you. To everyone who does not like blood an gore you really shouldn't see this film as it is very violent and graphic, but for everyone else go and see it NOW !!"
"jodee2970","10","1","2","29 December 2004"," A sumptuous tale of revenge
","Any new Quentin Tarantino movie has to rank with what you might call 'event cinema'. I say this because few directors give you that feeling that what you are about to see will be something really special, but Scorsese, Spielberg, James Cameron, Ridley Scott and Michael Mann give me that feeling. Now I would put Quentin up there.<br/><br/>As it says' it's the 'fourth film' by QT. But Tarantino's brilliance as a story teller and director is upstaged by even his casting (remember Mr Blonde in Reservoir Dogs - who else could have played that, and still, for me, is the best Tarantino creation). The Bride, played by the often excellent Uma Thurman is a brilliant character, only upstaged in Vol 1. by Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii.<br/><br/>**SPOILER AHEAD** Okay, the film opens proper when The Bride pays a call to Vernita Green, but the film shows the Bride's Death List 5 - the five people she is going to kill, with O-Ren already wasted. We know QT uses the flashbacks and back and forth mode of story telling, but would'nt it be more exciting to know, or in this case, not know, O-Ren's fate? **END OF SPOILER**<br/><br/>After the disappointing Jackie Brown, 'Kill Bill' had to be something special. With his first two films QT had set an incredibly high standard for himself and with KB 1 and 2 he shows an awesome return to form.<br/><br/>The story itself is simplistic, but as the man said, how complex do you need a revenge flick to be?<br/><br/>Gunned down at her wedding by her ex-boss, Bill, the Bride recovers from a coma, setting out to kill those who put her in a coma in the first place. For Vol 1, the 'Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves' is a great finale, and is filmed really beautifully too.<br/><br/>The use of anime, black and white, blue photography is brilliant and does never detract from the film.<br/><br/>Sonny Chiba is fantastic as Hattori Hanzo, and another star is well, the soundtrack, featuring maybe the best piece of music I've heard in ten years, it's the 'Battle without Hounour or Humanity' and is used when O-Ren and her gang are walking through the 'House'.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino clearly has borrowed ideas from others in the genre to make it, but he takes that, and makes something a hundred times better.<br/><br/>Vol 2 is also excellent, but as kick ass, pulsating cinema goes, it does not get better than Kill Bill Vol 1, and ranks second only to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon as my favourite martial arts film. It's SO good, that you can watch it on it's own and enjoy as a 'complete film' - the ending is classy and the whole film itself is jawdropping. Simply put, this is awesome."

","Excuse me while I have multiple orgasms at the mere thought of this example of sheer stylistic genius.

I thought at the time that it was the particular film going experience (first date) was why I enjoyed the film so much in the cinema. That was until I saw it on DVD and was reunited with its greatness. <br/><br/>Infinitely entertaining, it does not stop pleasuring the viewer in an almost sexual way. Kill Bill has blood, entrails and limbs spraying left right and centre, some of the best lines ever to grace my ears, an odd (yet strangely fitting) soundtrack, and even the costumes are cool! There is also a breathtakingly beautiful scene in a snowy garden, a disgusting suggestion of what happens to women in comas, and a cliffhanger ending that still makes me gasp every time I see it. Brimming with homages, but also plenty of originality makes this one of my all time favourites."

If the story dosen't suck you in the action sure will.The music is superb as well. It has a great cast: Uma Thurman, Lucy Lui, Michael Madsen and David Carradine just to name a few.

"RossLikesMovies","Null","1","2","1 November 2004"," A wonderful achievement. Tarantino is a master of the silver screen.
","Every time Quentin Tarantino makes a movie its pretty much a dead cert that it will become a classic. This is no exception. This is not only the best revenge movie ever made, but it is also one of the best action movies ever created. This is pure movie magic. <br/><br/>A usual array of quirky characters and wonderful cinematic techniques are blended perfectly with a superb soundtrack and an ingenious sense of style to make this a must see movie. All the characters are realistic, but outrageous. The perfect direction also makes for a hugely entertaining 90 minutes. <br/><br/>The film is also very original and a great homage to past movies. Tarantino has drawn inspiration from movies such as, 'they call her one eye' and 'shogun assassin'. Although its never feels as if Tarantino has just nabbed ideas from other material. He hasn't, he has simply payed his homage but put his spin, style and excellence into the blend of brilliance. To keep things interesting their is a lot of innovative story telling styles. Trademark flashbacks are used, along with a superb anime sequence and clever use of black and white or shadows. Slightly reminiscent of Oliver Stones 'Natural born killers' <br/><br/>Anyway, I've droned on way to much about how great this movie is. Now down to the plot. It sees the bride (Uma Thurman) getting her revenge after being attacked at her wedding and left in a coma for several years. Without giving to much away, she gets half of her 'bloody revenge' in a very cool way. Quentin uses his trademark flash back sequences to tell the story. You really must see the movie yourself to appreciate and understand why I'm raving on about this so much.<br/><br/>Its worth mentioning that this is the big action chunk of kill bill. Volume 2 fills in a lot more of the back story and has a lot more quirky exchanges of dialogue. This is because kill bill was originally planned as 1 3 hour movie. Personally I'm glad it wasn't. This volume doesn't have much dialogue but it is still tremendously good. Volume 2 takes the saga into a completely different imaginative direction. You'll love this for its action and super cool presentation and vol 2 for the great dialogue and back story.<br/><br/>Unmissable go see this right now! A complete classic 10/10. Its exciting, fun, stylish and downright cool!"

","To me, when a movie audience either hates or loves a movie, that's a good indication that the movie probably is a masterpiece.<br/><br/>In Kill Bill you probably don't have a middle section, either you will love it or hate it.<br/><br/>Back in the 70s, after the legendary Bruce Lee's death, there was a boom on Chinese kung-fu films, fast action, full of violence and Bruce Lee's wannabes, they were the main juice on oriental movie theaters.<br/><br/>Kill Bill captures this time.. and then.... so much more. Its a ""70's Chinese kung fu movie"", a ""Kurosawa classic"", a ""spaghetti western"" re-visited, a ""Manga cartoon""... all that wrapped up in a fast-paced action movie, very well directed with superb soundtrack and magnificent fighting sequences.<br/><br/>I must say that this is the best movie Quentin made since the classic ""Pulp Fiction"". Some people won't understand it, others won't stand it, but many will love it, cause its one of those movies made with such good taste and so many subtle details, that will soon become a classic.<br/><br/>The cast was carefully selected, only ""Uma Thurman"" could play ""Black Mamba"" in such a way. She's fragile and deadly, innocent and ruthless at the same time. Uma always had that flexibility in all of her movies, and Kill Bill is no exception.<br/><br/>Sonny Chiba as ""Hatori Hanzo"" is perfect, the dialogue between him and Uma is one of the most memorial moments in movie history. He's the perfect samurai, a humble barman and yet the best blacksmith in Okinawa.<br/><br/>Beautiful Lucy Liu delivers one of her best performances (the Japanese garden scene is one to be remembered forever, Darryl Hannah makes a unique and great comeback (and looks hot in nurse uniform), Michael Madsen usual is icy and subtle as a rattlesnake and ""Kung-Fu TV classic"" series David Carradine is perfect as the cool, mature and deadly ""Bill"".<br/><br/>To review Kill Bill part 1 and 2 separately is a mistake, both are only 1 movie and should be watched one after the other (same goes for Lord of the Rings trilogy, in my opinion).<br/><br/>Just as Kubrik and Polanski, Tarantino is the master of one thing, ATMOSPHERE.... you really get sucked into his creations, forgetting real life for a moment and live a unique experience.<br/><br/>Thumb's up to one of the best directors of our time."
"03mattil","10","1","2","19 October 2004"," Quentin's 2nd best film
","Most films that contain the sort of over the top violence that this film has are normally rubbish and unintentionally funny. However this film breaks the rules and includes gore and unbelievable acrobatics (possibly influenced by CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON) along with great performances and a decent story. Quentin Tarantino uses his normal style of unorthodox order of events, but shows improvement in camera style, possibly due to the big budget. All the cast give 110% especially Micheal Madson (my all time favorite actor) who, even in a small role, delivers the goods. While not as gritty as Resivour Dogs and not as original as Pulp Fiction this is Quentin at his best. And the minor details only means it gets 10/10 instead of 11!"

","*****WARNING SPOILERS DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE****<br/><br/>The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad consists of five most deadly killers, led by Bill. There is O'Ren-Ishii as Cottonmouth, Elle Driver as California Mountain Snake, Vernita Green as Copperhead, Budd as Sidewinder. And there is The Bride, whose name is not spoken, who wanted to quit because she was pregnant. One day, somewhere in the Texas desert, The Bride wanted to marry the love of her life. <br/><br/>Then Bill and her former colleagues showed up and killed everyone there. Leaving no one alive. Or so they thought but they did not do a good enough job: The Bride survives, barely, and is in a coma for four years. Her colleagues know this but won't kill her in her sleep; it would just ruin the reputation. One day, The Bride awakens. For her, not a second has consciously passed, and after she realizes all the things that have happened, The Bride decides to take revenge. Bloody revenge.<br/><br/>On each single one of those who betrayed her. The Bride sets out to take back what was once hers: Her life. First on her death list is O-Ren, who has become the yakuza boss of Tokyo, second in line is Vernita Green, who chose a more decent life as well. Thirdly, Budd who has become a bouncer is not living quite the life style his former teammates are.<br/><br/>Fourth is Elle Driver whom seems to have nothing that hatred for the Bride. And finally, the last on the list, BILL. The charming yet dangerous leader if the Deadly Vipers. The one who killed nine people in a church in Elpaso? Only one mistake, he should have killed ten. It has come to this. But after The Bride learns that her daughter is still alive, will she continue her rampage and KILL BILL?<br/><br/>Tarantino has really outdone himself this time around. Let's start at the beginning. In 1992, a little independent film named 'Reservoir Dogs' was released. It was soon to become a cult classic. It was made by a no name Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino. For that hit, he became famous. But it wouldn't be until 1995 when he would be REALLY famous for his classic and unforgettable film, 'Pulp Fiction'. <br/><br/>The film stunned audiences not only nation wide, but worldwide. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards and won Best Original Screenplay. It was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Actor in a Supporting Role, Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Best Director, Best Film Editing and Best Picture. It now stands on AFI's 100 Years 100 Movies. <br/><br/>He to write a segment for the film 'Four Rooms'. While I love the film, it was not received well by anyone. He also wrote the films 'From Dusk Till Dawn' and 'Natural Born Killers' and 'True Romance'. All have become cult classic, especially 'From Dusk Till Dawn'. One of my personal favorite movies. The year 1997 came along and Tarantino was at it again with 'Jackie Brown'. While an amazing movie, most will agree it was his weakest effort. Probably since the film is based on a book and not his own material.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be until six years later that Tarantino would grace us with his talents with the ultimate revenge tale, 'Kill Bill'. The film starred Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Micheal Madsen, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, Sonny Chiba and a while lot more. It's Tarantino's greatest effort yet. Personally, I would have loved to have seen the films as a whole, but we will soon enough. Hopefully.<br/><br/>The first film is basically a tribute to all the Kung-fu films of the 70's. Not 100% original, but a whole lot of fun. The blood fest is going to be ten times better when it's presented uncut. The way it's meant to be. It's not brutal, just very, very bloody. Tarantino's vision is totally awesome. The way it's presented is unbelievable. The music is great as well. Well not my favorite, still its Tarantino. I love the way he uses music. In all of his movies. <br/><br/>Vol. 2 is a movie all its own. The style has changed from 70's Kung fu, to Italian Westerns in the style of Sergio Leone. The music style has changed. With music from the legendary Ennio Morricone, Johhny Cash and many others. The visuals in the film are even better than the first. This has become my favorite of the two Vols. And one of my favorite films of all time. The film has a lot more story, and is more brutal to me. Not as bloody. But you know what I mean. I think.<br/><br/>Overall Tarantino has made a film(s) that have and will remain classics. While the rumors of two spin-offs are still lingering, I don't care the ideas: one being an all anime back story of the DiVAS, the other being a spin-off in the future where Vernita Green's daughter, Nikki, goes on a quest for revenge against the Bride. The anime sequence in Vol. 1 is my least favorite scene on both of the films. Not my thing. If your thing is bloody, story, and just pure Tarantino fun, checks out Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. <br/><br/>****/***** - (Both Volumes)"
"limubai_420","10","1","2","12 September 2004"," What some fail to realize...
","This is a GREAT film!!! Some people seem to focus on the fact that Tarantino has ""ripped off"" some of the greatest movies of all time. While this may be true, there are only a few directors who can be considered truly original (Cronenberg, Miike, Kurosawa to name a few). Instead, what QT has done is create a wholly original piece of work by taking elements of his favorite movies & combining them into a new & exciting film. The main difference between KB & other so-called homages is that people who recognize his sources of inspiration & those who do not can enjoy the film the same nonetheless. I really wish people would stop complaining about how derivative this movie is & just enjoy it for what it really is: entertainment."

","Both Kill Bill volumes are either highly praised, or viciously put down. Some hated the ""violence"" that is typical of Tarantino, and some thought they were uncharacteristic of his style.<br/><br/>Personally I enjoyed them, though the first is much more watchable. I don't quite understand the problem so many have with the violence; Kill Bill was such an obvious spoof/tribute to various film genres, and all of the blood was over the top on purpose. I thought Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction contained much more realistic violence. Kill Bill was meant to be fantasy in a way, and almost every element of the film shows this.<br/><br/>No, Volume 1 didn't contain a lot of ""Tarantino dialogue"", but so what? It would get old if he did the same thing every time, and while his other films show his writing ability (among other things), Kill Bill gave him a chance to focus more closely on action and visuals. Regardless of the bloody scenes, this movie is truly a joy to watch, even if you had it on mute. The colors and filming techniques create series of beautiful imagery (which carries into Vol.2). If for nothing else, it is worth watching just for this."

","Once upon a time, in 1993, a no name wannabe writer sent a story idea ""The Bride"" to a Dark Horse comic talent search request, he also sent the opening scenes, where the bride's groom, ""Bill"" is killed on the altar by her ex-boyfriend, the leader of a bike gang. Still in her wedding dress she chases after the gang taking her revenge one at a time. Nothing came of it, so the writer having a family to feed put the story away until he had the time to work on it. Then the release of the first part of Kill Bill, at first the story was not definite on a story line and the ninja and samurai stuff was not my story. But when the second part came out I knew I had done a foolish thing to send anything to Dark Horse. I've heard Dark Horse would steal anything but at the time I took the chance. I any case, I have to say Tarantino is like the rest of the ""has beens"" when they haven't got an idea left, they resort to the last option. Oh, yeah in 1995, for a screen writing class I copyrighted a slight version of ""The Bride."""

"guapisimo","10","1","2","16 July 2004"," You love it or you hate it. I liked it.
","Just my two cents (Spoilers)<br/><br/>1.- Despite all that was said about this movie I was expecting a continuous non-stop stylish bloodfest and mindless action. There's action, but only in the first and last part of the movie. It's not as intense and well choreographed like in Matrix Reloaded. Left me waiting for much more chopping.<br/><br/>2.- It's stylish and the cinematography is beautiful. Colorful scenarios, specially the snowy one.<br/><br/>3.- The violence is that strange kind of cartoonish violence that a child could see and sleep that night without problems. The anime sequence is far more violent (but is animation). The film doesn't take itself serious. I do not understand all that complaints about the violence in this movie; Dawn of the Dead is painful, Kill Bill is funny. That's the difference.<br/><br/>4.- Tarantino has no heart or compassion:<br/><br/>a) a beautiful 4-year girl sees her mother being killed. b) also beautiful Sofie Fatale didn't deserve that finale. c) comatose Mamba is sold to a pervert.<br/><br/>5.- The Music fits PERFECTLY in the movie. A director that finally understands that music is as important as filming itself.<br/><br/>6.- Blood fountains are beautiful. Should create a new standard in action movies. They are responsible for that cartoonish effect that smooths violence. More is less.<br/><br/>7.- Uma feet are not beautiful. Feet at all are not beautiful. Tarantino, you are a fetichist.<br/><br/>8.- I want a ride in the P*ussyWagon!<br/><br/>9.- All women in this movie are sexy and cool with no exception, including the bizarre musical group 5,6,7,8s. Sofie Fatale is gorgeous and stylish, GoGo is every man's dream, O-Ren is wildly attractive... well, the restaurant waitress is beautiful in her own manner...<br/><br/>10.- It's a movie to entertain. Nothing more and nothing less. If you don't like blood, manga, katanas or Tarantino at all, don't see it and stop complaining. <br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>See ya!"

"lcr","9","1","2","8 July 2004"," A tribute, a Parody, and an Intelligent Study
","In my mind, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is the quintessential bad-ass movie. It borrows so much from so many, not unlike previous Tarantino films, but this time... this time it's different, more polished, more... seamless. Everything just clicks in place. Kung fu movies, spaghetti western, grindhouse, surf rock, violent Japanese anime, plus a million other obscure references lost on 99% of the audience. Everything is thrown in, and boiled down to the simplest, most basic plot ever: revenge.<br/><br/>I am amazed at the results. I think of Tarantino as a master ""recycler"", picking up ""film trash"" from the past (OK, no hate mail on this. Be honest. Bruce Lee, exploitation flicks etc. were hardly the peak of artistic expression, were they?), and weaving it into a beautiful work of art.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is gory. Disturbingly so, at times. However, violence is so graphic that the end result is ultimately cartoonish, not realistic.<br/><br/>My only complaint (insert tongue into cheek). I wish there were more ""naked chicks"" (no hate mail on this, either, ok? I'm being *ironic*, for crying out loud!) running around. I believe a sprinkle of Russ Meyer (you know, just for seasoning) would have imparted a special flavor to the movie."

I love the fact that Uma's outfit is quite similar to that of Bruce Lee's in Game Of Death. I love the fact that they mention Kato and then use the theme from the old Green Hornet TV show ( also with Bruce Lee) Still this film IMHO is nothing more than a way to waste a couple of hours. You can love it or hate it, but you must admit that while the substance may not be much his style is almost always interesting.<br/><br/>That's just my two cents, but hey what do I know."

","Well, I actually had a good time watching this, one of the silliest movies I ever saw. And I do appreciate silly movies as long as they are sophisticated enough not to insult my intelligence.<br/><br/>The referential jokes are many, and blinks are everywhere. I'm surprised that everyone here seems to notice only the Western, Samourai and Kung-fu elements, as to me the references to gore cult movies are numerous, from Raimi's Evil Dead II to Jackson's Braindead (US title ""Dead or alive"").<br/><br/>It's obviously not a movie to be taken seriously, except for the very competent but somewhat pretentious direction and cinematography... The story is vapid (on purpose), but the storytelling is excellent, thanks to Quentin's skills.<br/><br/>Now my problem is that OK, it's fun, but then what? Has Tarantino so little ambition that he's unable to put some real substance into his films? Does he really only wants to be an entertainer?<br/><br/>And why does he have to quote so many directors? He quotes so much that his own style is almost absent from the movie. And what with DePalma, why are references to Brian's style all over the place in ""Kill bill""? I don't get it...<br/><br/>I've read so many critics here saying that DePalma is all style and no substance, and mimicks Hitchcock.

"BlueCypress","7","1","2","8 June 2004"," Tarantino. Still clueless after all these years...
","Let me just say that I have never been a big fan of Tarantino from the start so don't let my comments get to you too much. Tarantino has always been and still is... clueless. What amazes me is how high a ranking this movie has at IMDb. Tarantino never was and is not a fan of martial arts films. But more importantly, he has no respect for the martial arts genre nor for the Asian culture. I truly feel that Kill Bill is a result of Mr. Tarantino watching a few ""martial arts"" films, then cashing in on the Matrix influence (i.e. American public now loves martial arts fighting.) All I can give him credit for is finding a good martial arts director. That's it. <br/><br/>Now before all you Tarantino fans go ballistic on me, let me explain my disgruntlement. Tarantino claims to have paid homage and tribute to many genre, including spaghetti western and martial arts films in Kill Bill. But I ask, just how do you pay ""homage"" to a genre when you are insulting it? Case in point... Tarantino lumps Chinese and Japanese into one genre and one CULTURE. Anyone with HALF interest in martial arts OR Asian films will tell you that they are completely different. There are obvious references to Bruce Lee. Uma Thurman is wearing a yellow jump suit with a black stripe, as does Bruce Lee in ""The Game of Death"". She fights the final battle in a Japanese garden, as does Bruce Lee in ""The Chinese Connection"". In fact, I am nearly positive that the garden in Kill Bill is exactly the same as the garden in the final battle scene in Chinese Connection. BUT TO HAVE THIS IMAGE OF BRUCE LEE FIGHT IN THE SAMURAI STYLE IS SHEER IGNORANCE AND IDIOCY. Having a Chinese icon fight in a Japanese style is like having a Jew fight with a swastica banner engraved on his/her chest. It just doesn't make sense. Most Asian nations were oppressed by the Japanese before WW2 and ""Chinese Connection"" explicitly depicts this oppression. Turning it around and having the hero, in this case Uma Thurman who is obviously suppose to represent Bruce Lee, fight in the style of the enemy is a complete insult. Perhaps if you are not familiar with martial arts and the identity and the genealogy from which it spawns and what it means to the culture, I can give you a glimpse of the magnitude of the insult by saying something like ""Rap music was invented by Vanilla Ice"". Get the point?<br/><br/>I guess ever since Tarantino made a fool of himself at the MTV Movie Awards by constantly saying Jackie Chan's name incorrectly, my esteem of him as a director, but more importantly, as an intelligent individual, plunged like a 747 on fire. But this ""tribute"" to martial arts film is the icing on the cake. <br/><br/>I love action films. I always have and always will. Fight club, The Matrix, and every Jet Li films will always have a place in my movie library.<br/><br/>But this hodgepodge, confused, rip-off of a film is not anywhere near the ""classic"" status that has been given by the members of IMDb. Furthermore, it seems that a vast majority of the people here believe that if you copy ONE movie, it's a rip-off, but if you copy a dozen movie, it's a tribute... Well now I know the magic formula. My next movie will be Obi-won will be searching for the Lost Ark but is opposed by the Mummy and Scorpion King so has to go to the Godfather for help. But since the Godfather has been killed by the Joker, Obi looks for help from Conan the Barbarian, who is currently in battle with Aliens..."

And this story... well it's thinner then an anorexic cheerleader, but hey what do I know It's probably ment to be this way and I respect the fact that It's inspired by the 70/80's kung-fu movies like Shogun Assassin/Lady Snowblood and so on, but where is the great dialogue, the humour, the intricate plot?<br/><br/>So in the end I'm probably one out of a hundred but I'll give it a 6/10"

","Kill Bill was watchable as far as it went. With David Carradine in it (sort of) it felt like watching a souped up version of Kung Fu or the Dukes of Hazzard. You know - some daft 70s thing. With Lucy Lu in it - i.e Charlies Angels, that also made me feel like this. Which was good, I liked the film for this.<br/><br/>However, the next day I watched 'Who Am I?' the Jackie Chan film. Now there is a kung fu movie. Most of the baddies in this are not actors, they are genuine kung fu fighters and kick boxers. And watching Jackie and these guys knock seven-bells out of each other makes you realise what a whole load of Hollywood posturing nonsense Kill Bill was. Don't make actors do kung fu, they can't do it and they look silly!"

","This is art ? Give me a break.If QT wanted to accomplish something remotely close to what I feel he was trying to do he should have viewed the old "" Man Without a Name "" trilogy.As it is,this movie is pretty damn horrible.The scenes jump around like an A.D.D. MTV Rap Video geared to fans of old "" chop socky movies "" with alot of gore.The main characters arent even likable.Uma Thurman as an ex-hitman ? Lordy,that's not even CLOSE enough to be CONSIDERED palatable.The three things I feel really killed this movie were as follows : 1 - Hitmen are not the most emotionally exorbitant people in the world.If someone did plan revenge on a fellow colleague the whole world wouldnt know about it until they were already stone cold dead.It's not believable that a professional killer would change tactics REGARDLESS of what happened to him/her.Not too logical or efficient. 2 - There is no way in hell anyone outside of Japanese heritage would EVER run the Yakuza.Period.ESPECIALLY a woman..unless there was an emergency,as when Shindo's ane-san ( his wife ) took over for him while he was in jail. This is as ridiculous as when Daredevil featured a Black man as the Kingpin of Crime.This isnt a racial statement people,it's just that the criminal element doesnt mix race or gender very well.It's kind of like a white guy running a Jamaican Drug cartel.Never happen on this planet....3- She sat in a guy's car ( the guy she killed ) for 13 hours yet the cops didnt come outside to look at the car after they found the two bodies ? Sure,sure,and I'm the King of England.Give me a break.How this bad of a movie could crack the top 100 blows the mind.Then again,considering the lack of widespread intelligence in the world it shouldnt surprise me.Some much for morality and good taste.The difference between Kung Pow and this movie ? Kung Pow was INTENTIONALLY funny.... *** out of Ten.Poor Movie,view at your own risk."

"king_obrien","Null","1","2","24 April 2004"," A few questions regarding the martial arts...
","Hi,<br/><br/>I enjoyed Kill Bill although I have a few questions regarding the references to the martial arts used in the film...<br/><br/>1) Hattori Hanzo was a renowned Ninja who lived late 1800s, Ninjas were a lower class to the Samurai, most of which were assassins and spies.  They disregarded honour ( in most cases ) in favour of getting a job done, they also did not respect the Katana like the Samurai did.  Why is Sonny Chibas character called Hattori Hanzo? To me ( probably due to my lack of understanding ) calling the character Hattori Hanzo is a pretty weak reference, as the character in the film is so unlike the real person...<br/><br/>2) How does The Bride become so efficient with the Katana? ( although saying that the sword does look to heavy for Uma but that's beside the point! ) All we have seen so far is that Chinese dude Kung Fu master training her. Again probably due to my lack of understanding but how can a Chinese Kung Fu master teach a Japanese sword art? ( ie Kenjutsu ) Its stupid!!!<br/><br/>3) Not a martial arts question but doesn't Bushido teach that if your master ( ie Bill ) wants you out of the picture you GET out of the picture! ie. become a ronin or cut your stomach open?  Seppeku was a common thing in Japan during the days of the Samurai( or so we are told ) and if the Bride had any sense of honour or being a Samurai she should have either taken her own life or just left things alone.  This being a revenge picture choosing the Samurai code of honour to base the Brides actions on is just plain wrong.  Anyway, if she knew anything about the Samurai code of Honour she should have gone straight for Bill and taken control of the Vipers herself. If the other members had any sense of honour ( O-Ren for example, as she makes such a song and dance about being a Samurai ) they would have followed the Bride.<br/><br/>4) What has Bruce Lee got to do with anything? Why do the Yakuza sport Kato masks? Why does the Bride sport a yellow track suit? So far we have seen no Kung Fu or Gung Fu in the film, so why reference Bruce Lee? Aside from being a massive star in the Martial Arts genre Bruce Lee has nothing to do with what we see in Kill Bill, again it just seems like a weak reference based purely on Lee's star factor.<br/><br/>5) O-Ren mocks the Bride trying to be like a Samurai, Silly white girl trys to fight like a Samurai... Isn't O-Ren half Chinese? Samurai are Japanese families, O-Ren was not born into a Samurai family... neither was the Bride... so isn't O-Ren playing Samurai like the Bride? ( if I type Samurai one more time ill explode )<br/><br/>There's loads more questions I have but Iv ranted on long enough.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Chris"

","Let me just get one thing clear. I've never liked Quentin Tarantino. Ever since I saw as much as I could bear of the horrendous Resiviour Dogs (a film which for some reason is judged a masterpiece) I didn't think I'd see another film of his again. But hearing about Kill Bill I thought the man would pleasently suprise me. But no, yet again it is juts another film which consists of nothing but a blood-splatter fest verging on the pornagraphic.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong. I have no problem with violent films- Die Hard, The Terminator,etc these films I have no problem with. But Dogs and Kill Bill just have scene after scene of gore which I really got utterly bored of. I stopped both films before the end as I really was tried of it. Tarantino has to be the worst director ever. Uma Thurman and the music score are the only two good things about Kill Bill."
"igiana","Null","1","2","20 April 2004"," Tarantino has lost the plot.
","Whilst leaving the cinema after viewing kill bill i heard a guy in the row in front of me say ""He's lost it a bit hasn't he"". He took the words right out of my mouth. I still find it hard to believe that someone who made quality movies like pulp fiction and Jackie brown could possibly be guilty of making such an awful movie. People say that Tarantino spent several years watching kung fu movies before he made Kill Bill. So how come he ended up making a samurai style movie. There is a big difference between the two genres. But to be honest this movie shouldn't count as martial arts full stop. For a start there are no quality martial artists playing the main characters and thats always going to be a problem. The movie spends a lot of time covering the same old ground. The quirky sound track, the over stylistic approach. There is nothing new here. The levels of violence may have increased but surely only the most dim witted of people would rate a movie just on the number of killings they see.<br/><br/>Many critics are raving about this movie at the moment but i feel it has a faddy kind of appeal. It's one of those movies that people blow out of proportion just because they like the previous work of Tarantino. I don't feel they are judging it purely on what they see at the cinema/dvd. I hope Tarantino can do better than this in the future because up until this i was a big fan.<br/><br/>I rate this movie  5 out of 10. In future leave this genre to those who know what they are doing."

Tarantino wisely pushes such things to the back burner. We know that Bill and his assassins killed nine innocents and nearly killed The Bride.<br/><br/>There it is. She has no name. The only time she mentions her name in Part 1, it is bleeped. (And again an moment later when Viveca A Fox says the name) She doesn't need a name.

"red_core","5","1","2","13 April 2004"," a movie that works hard to annoy me
","I like Quentin. I really do. I respect his love for the genres that influenced him, and I completely support his desire to actively pay homage to these genres through his movies. All three of his movies before Kill Bill did that, and I loved them. But I didn't love them because of some in-jokes they were making that cinephiles were all over. And I didn't love them because of the almost-casual way violence and depravity are shown in them. His first 3 movies are good because of characters that are interesting and human (even if they inhabit some kind of alternate fantasy reality), dialogue that's snappy and amusing, and plots intricate and well edited. That, and his raw ability as a director, of course.<br/><br/>Well, Kill Bill 1 has no shortage of the latter, and the in-jokes and cartoonish (and cartoon) gore fly in your face non-stop. But this movie has no heart. This movie's characters have no heart. The dialogue sure as hell has no heart. And, frankly -- though I'm sure this is on purpose -- the acting is equally lifeless. This film has action galore, all of which is well done though not particularly memorable, and that's the only thing it really has going for it.<br/><br/>The story is dead simple (not a bad thing in itself): The Bride (an expressionless Uma Thurman) is gunned down with her entire party during her wedding, even though she's pregnant. The culprits are the other 5 members of the assassination squad she was formerly a part of, headed by Bill himself (whom we hear but don't see in Vol. 1). Bill shoots the Bride in the head, but she survives and later wakes up from a coma. Understandably p***ed off, she decides to kill those that wronged her (and anyone else to come in her way).<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is about the Bride killing 2 of the 5 assassins: The barely-present Vivica A. Fox and O'Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), who's given an extensive backstory, both through anime and normal exposition.<br/><br/>So, Uma: (1) gets shot, (2) wakes up, (3) goes to Japan to build a sword, (4) fights O'Ren and helpers, (5) fights ... uh, Vivica. Granted, this is told a bit out of sequence (for NO discernible reason, unlike, say, Pulp Fiction), but this really is the gist. Oh, and O'Ren's backstory is shown in very gory anime form. The rest is reserved for Volume 2.<br/><br/>With a story like that, there'd better be something to keep us entertained, yes? Well, the dialogue is atypically empty (for some reason Quentin's usual profanity sounds ridiculously fake in the Vivica/Uma confrontation). The characters are all ruthless, evil bastards, even the Bride, really. (O'Ren would be cool, but read on.) And there's a LOT of sword-fighting. The thing that you'll notice right away is that gallons of blood spurt everywhere from open wounds. People are split every which way. Most of this is so over-the-top, you won't be grossed out or particularly moved by it. Some of the violence, however, goes into serious-slasher-movie territory, while in a few others moments the serious tone of the movie is combined with a ridiculous moment of gore to make one feel quite uneasy about enjoying it. That kind of thing did nothing for ME other than make feel uncomfortable. And if a film is supposed to be light-hearted fun, as you'd think about this one, at times, feeling annoyed should not be part of the deal. Kill Bill never decides what it wants to be when it comes to violence, and perhaps that's the director's intention, but the mood of the action is uneven enough to make me feel ambivalent about the action itself. To see what I mean, note the anime segment; the end of the O'Ren fight; and the end of the Gogo fight. At one point, the top of a character's head is chopped off, in graphic detail, on screen, at an extremely, extremely inappropriate moment emotionally. This sort of fate should be reserved for expendable drones, maybe, but not a principal character.<br/><br/>The action is solid enough that I might give this one a 6 or a 7. But all the annoying stuff is enough to rate it down to: 5/10.<br/><br/>NOTE: I don't care if Vol. 2 is better. This movie came out on its own, and it feels kind of like the first episode of a TV mini-series. And that's fine! It's not that it feels incomplete, as many say; it's just a weak episode."
"chrisman316","Null","1","2","13 April 2004"," Misconception
","It appears that many people do not have a full grasp of the types of films that Quentin Tarantino is involved in. If some one went to see Kill Bill Vol. 1 and expected a classic martial arts film, or a serious drama, or action coated eye candy then they would not have been greeted with what they expected. Tarantino is famous for his dark humor. Sometimes it is a little too dark and too subtle. That is why the people that like him LOVE him and the people that do not like his work generally do not understand him. His humor is often so subtle, a good majority of his audience does not pick it up. I myself do not understand many things that go on in his movies or why they happened however I often find myself chuckling to myself regardless. Perhaps this is part of Tarantino's appeal in his ability to leave people in the dark about so many things and let his audience draw their own conclusions. In the case of Kill Bill there is the matter of the cheap blood, the long anime scenes, the beep over Uma's name, etc. We do not understand why these things happen but many must admit they were strangely entertained by ever odd occurrence. It is fun for things to be left for the audience to ponder and let their own imaginations run wild. That is why we all love Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and Jackie Brown.<br/><br/><br/><br/>GO QUENTIN TARANTINO!!!"
"bbagnall","Null","1","2","19 April 2004"," Visually Slick but Brain Dead
","It's a Quentin Tarantino movie, so I expected the usual over the top violence. It's also a ninja movie, so physics and reality go right out the window as expected. Yes, skinny Uma Thurman apparently can take on a room of 50 ninjas. Yes, an 11 year old Japanese girl can in fact revenge kill a middle aged man. Yes, rail thin Uma can in fact lift a 150 lb Japanese man over her head on her sword. That's the kind of movie this is and apparently people who love Asian movies really dig this stuff.<br/><br/>There's also the usual dregs of society that Tarantino likes to explore for some reason. While Uma is in a coma, apparently her male nurse had sex with her, and also lets his friend take a turn on her for cash. Fine, if Tarantino wants to drag up this kind of perversion in his films I guess that's his prerogative.<br/><br/>However, she is in a coma for 4 years. Having just woke up (then for some reason pretending to be asleep when she hears her nurse) she swiftly kills the 300 lb friend who is attempting to rape her. Then when the 260 lb nurse comes in later she kills him by slamming his head in a door jamb repeatedly. Apparently rail thin Uma can take him on, even though she was in a coma for FOUR FREAKING YEARS. And when the beating begins, apparently he just decides to lay there rather than, like, defend himself or crawl away.<br/><br/>
Anyway, it's great Hollywood Marxist stuff (lots of groin slicing off, emasculation and that kind of thing). So if you can suspend rational logic, and your belief in physics, and you don't mind a plot that is pretty weak, and you like pretty pictures, then you might like this film."

David Carradine plays the<br/><br/>title character and focus of Thurman's venom in the film; Darryl<br/><br/>Hannah returns from Hollywood exile for a brilliant cameo<br/><br/>reminiscent of her villainous turn in ""Blade Runner;"" Vivica Fox is<br/><br/>memorable as an assassin-turned-soccer mom; and Michael<br/><br/>Madsen also returns as one of Tarantino's favorite bad guys. The<br/><br/>one lackluster casting choice here is Lucy Liu, who has a rather<br/><br/>typecast role as a bad-ass martial arts master.<br/><br/>Cinematically, Tarantino is on his game here, offering forays into<br/><br/>various genres such as revenge film, road film, samurai film and<br/><br/>even anime. Unfortunately for the viewer, the sum is less than the<br/><br/>collected parts, as each set-piece stands well enough alone but<br/><br/>fails to blend together.<br/><br/>Ironically, if Miramax studio head Harvey Weinstein had left well<br/><br/>enough alone, ""Kill Bill"" would have been an epic, 2-and-a-half<br/><br/>hour genre-basher, worthy of the rabid praise being heaped upon<br/><br/>it by his legion of fans, as well as placing it among one of the best<br/><br/>action films of the past decade. Unfortunately, greedy marketing<br/><br/>tactics led to this would-be great film being whacked into two<br/><br/>parts. Although there is nothing either new or wrong with cinematic<br/><br/>serialization (it worked well enough for the Lord of the Rings<br/><br/>trilogy) -- in this case it is an unwelcome artifice, providing a<br/><br/>cliffhanger ending to ""Vol. I"" which Tarantino never intended to<br/><br/>have.<br/><br/>As a result, I considered giving ""Kill Bill Vol. I"" an ""incomplete""<br/><br/>grade, but I believe a more proper score is 4 out of 10 -- just like<br/><br/>the film itself, I took the grade of 8 which I would have given it, and<br/><br/>cut it in half.

The story that can be represented in one sentence ""they almost killed me, now I'll kill 'em all"" has been far-fetched just to have a reason to refer to this stuff as a movie rather than some unformed set of video clips. Second volume (as it appears to me) will not bring any answers to any questions. Actually the questions should not be risen here at all. Who cares who the Bill is and why he did what he did... Just check out Uma the brutal fighter!<br/><br/>Technical performance is good. There were a several scenes that probably look doubtful but they can be attributed to grotesque movie style. However I cannot evaluate the style by itself without any base. Yes, this is definitely Tarantino's hand. But there's nothing written with this handwriting. Action... that's fine but what about the plot, intrigue? So I was candidly boring during prolonged bloody slaughter.<br/><br/>That is my humble opinion.<br/><br/>P.S.

If you think it was brilliant because all the ""cool"" people say so you need to get a brain.  Secondly think about the styles he was copying, there is no message in those that violence is bad or that they are making a commentary on real life.  Neither is true of Kill Bill either.

","I went with my girlfriend so all the time I was worried about what she thought of it (especially as she kept telling me what she thought of it), maybe I'd have enjoyed it more without that worry.<br/><br/>Even so, I think it was too simple. It was just fight after fight. There was no sub plot. In most films when a key piece of action is over you go to a different story for a while, for a rest. In this when a fight was over they just stared at each other for a bit with music playing and then the next fight started. So there was only one story and it was a very thin one. The Bride kills lots of people in revenge. That's it, that's the entire story. There's no suspense, you know who'll win the fight. It's not like Nightmare on Elm St et al where the interest is in seeing people die in lots of different imaginative ways. There is only one way, they are killed with a sword. That's it. 110 mins of people being killed with swords in virtually the same way over and over. It is extremely violent but to counteract that he keeps reminding you that it's not real by going into cartoon or black and white, which makes it even less involving, more like watching a pop video. Reservoir Dogs was great because of all the talk, the violence wasn't what it was about. This had very little dialog. He was making a Hollywood version of a Japanese Samurai film. But most of the dialog was in Japanese anyway so why bother. It wasn't even high budget so it was just like seeing the films it was a homage to. On the good side, it reminded me of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Taking its time, lots of atmosphere and style but you could have walked out after 15 mins and walked back in 15 mins before the end and you wouldn't have missed anything."

An assassin (Uma Thurman) is gunned down in a desolate church just outside of El Paso, Texas by five fellow killers (the never seen, but always heard David Carradine in the titled role, Michael Madsen, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah and Lucy Liu) for unclear and unexplained reasons. Thurman, about to be married, also watched helpless as everyone else in the church was killed mercilessly. Four years pass and Thurman has been stuck in a coma and actually dodged death as an attempt on her life was strangely aborted. Of course Thurman pops out of it at the most convenient of moments and her only thoughts are of revenge on those aforementioned players who tried unsuccessfully to take her down. Thurman's quest takes her to suburban America (where she finds housewife/mother/little league coach Fox) and even to Tokyo (where she tracks down underworld crime boss Liu). Keep in mind though that Tarantino has never cared for chronology or production order so naturally he would rather leave those methods at the door. Thus the film goes forward, back, pauses and even goes from color to black-and-white on occasion. The effects may be dizzying, but may also win you over in a wickedly intelligent way. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is a thrill-ride that matches very well with Tarantino's earlier works (even though this is arguably his weakest effort). Tarantino also smartly took a page away from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy by splitting this saga into two parts (this project began as one very long epic film). Samuel L. Jackson once said that Tarantino was the best he had ever seen at stealing other people's ideas and changing them just enough to make a completely new concept. This is very evident here as Tarantino even uses that cheap-looking exploitation angle and further advances the picture with a crazed Asian-styled Toonami sequence that somehow seems more poetic than pathetic. The movie is ultra-violent, but does not fall to shock value or silly teenage-styled slasher clichés. The main reason is the dynamite performance by Thurman and Tarantino's second-to-none direction. Tarantino is kind of like the Dennis Rodman of Hollywood. Everyone either loves or hates him. You can either let yourself be sucked in by his brilliant creativity or you can be repulsed by his risk-taking and obvious bad boy attitude towards the medium. While still not a perfect movie, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" delivers a darkly funny and exhilarating experience that will keep you awake if nothing else. 4.5 out of 5 stars."

"jnaniguy","Null","1","2","26 December 2003"," You people are seeing it all wrong (not all of you)!!!!!!
","Funny, i registered purely in order to write this review, which isn't really a review rather a comment on how people are seeing this movie.  There are spoilers, but before we get to those i want to say something to all those who are going to see this movie.  The truth is, in order to enjoy this movie or even understand it, you need to free yourself of your preconceptions of what film is and get back to the basics.  Film is, in its purest essence, a fine art, and it tries to do what all fine arts try to do: convey the desired emotion.  Plot, mise en scene, soundtrack - these are devices, and it is my opinion that QT, as he is afectionately referred to here, is in full mastery of all these elements.<br/><br/>Ok, now i'm going to talk about the movie.<br/><br/>So far there have been these complaints:  It is too slow.  There is no plot (which isn't true, but the plot is very simple, so it gives off that impression).  There is too much violence/gore.  The editing is annoying. And in the end, it really just comes down to ""what is all the hype about?""<br/><br/>And the truth is, all these things are right on, or at least right to a point.  The plot is very simple, compared to all of QT's other movies (except maybe From Dusk till Dawn, and i know he only wrote that but it still counts).  It is slow.  The editing is troublesome at points.  There is an immense amount of gore, in fact a cartoonish amount (you start to wonder if there is really that much blood in the human body).<br/><br/>
What makes the movie so great is that all these things are purposeful...they are all tools for the end result, which if you stand back and take a look at it is quite monumental.  The plot is simple because the bride's existence is centered around a single point - avenge her daughter, her husband and herself.  The simple plot thus thrusts us, the viewer, into that sort of single pointedness.  Likewise, all the other elements of the story fit together in that sort of fashion.<br/><br/>Of course, the fact that these parts of the story work together wouldn't by themselves make this a great movie.  Rather, it's greatness comes from the fact that at heart this is a cartoon which takes itself with utmost seriousness...and in the end, it deserves it.  A wedding is destroyed, seemingly without reason.  A young child has her family murdered before her eyes, and she needs to sleep her way to the top of a japanese gang at 11 years old in order to get her revenge.  A coma patient is pimped out over and over again for over four years to anonymous clients.  This is what makes up Kill Bill...in essence, it needs the cartoonish elements to even make it watchable.<br/><br/>But the movie isn't about happiness.  The movie isn't even really about the plot.  Rather, it's about all the little scenes tha tmake your spine tingle. Like when The Bride tells, very evenly to Vernita Green,"" Get even?  Even steven?  No no...i'd have to kill you.  then i'd have to go upstairs and kill your daughter.  then i'd have to wait here till your husband, the doctor, comes home and kill him.  That would be even.  that would be about square.""  Or when Hattori Hanso says ""I say with no pride this is the finest sword i have ever made.  If god shoudl come across your path, you should cut him down.""  Or when The Bride wakes up from her coma, and realises that she's not pregnant anymore, and she completely breaks down.  I can't remember being that sad in a long time.<br/><br/>No, the real greatness of the movie comes from all the little lines that sparkle, all the little glances that rob your attention blind.  The litle siren sound whenever The Bride sees an old 'freind'.  The way she calmly claims all the body parts she 'removed' from her victims in the House of the Blue leaves.  Even the somewhat operatic opening credit sequence, where they introduce the entire cast of the movie and what parts they play.<br/><br/>
And of course, the action scenes kick ass."

","This movie doesn't live up to the hype at all. Ok, the scenes are beautifully shot, the martial arts are great, the music is very good, the references are interesting BUT....the story is very thin and the violence is really over the top. Maybe people are desensitized and need this kind of violence to feel again. I feel sorry for that. Is it necessary to show it to underscore the enormous anger and revenge of the leading character?

","Kill Bill <br/><br/>Wiggle the big toe . . .<br/><br/>Spoilers included<br/><br/>This is a very exceedingly artistic action movie of pure violence, not for the tender hearts at all . . . <br/><br/>Ho Haaa ! ! ! What a movie ! When I first saw the trailer for Kill Bill V 1 I had some doubts about Tarantino's 4th installment. Tarantino is a God among Gods of Cinema, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and finally the Kill Bill installment are his running legacy of pure talent and brilliance. <br/><br/>We all know the story is about Uma's revenge from her former ronin/assassins crew on the day of her marriage (pregnant). She falls in a coma and wakes up round four years from the incident, nemesis is her soul fate. The action scenes are so convincing that you soon are caught in the flame of this story, about the grave journey our beautiful Uma Thurman lady warrior takes her revenge through a vengeance kill list, its time to settle scores. I loved this movie, I loved Uma's performance, she is no dumb blond on the road, but a tough convincing warrior who honors the code. The movie is as great and enchanting as the mighty Hattori Hanzo sword, the great Sonny Chiba is Hanzo the retired sword master who meets The Bride's (Uma) dangerous vermin with a hand made cutting edge sword.<br/><br/>Vermin: Noun `1. Vermin - an irritating or obnoxious person Varmint bad person - a person who does harm to others <br/><br/> 2. Vermin - any of various small animals or insects that are pests'<br/><br/>Uma's is breath taking in this wicked action experience. Her shoots are so clear, her attitude in place, humor around, physically able to perform spectacular sword fighting scenes. She is a queen; I salute her for her G Globe best actress nomination and wish that such time and effort put in The Bride's character mustn't pass unrewarded.  <br/><br/>As for the king him self, Tarantino he has done it again, still amazing, proving that a film is nothing more than a cool story, good script, bunch of potential talents and the mind that directs them. He did succeed in bringing his long time dream of making a Kung Fu-Ninja cult piece. The blood and violence is elevated a notch, but Tarantino delivers his black fades and black and white cameras to comfort us and relieve us of excess. Also Tarantino manages to improve his work by smoothing out the scenes, not making it slow as his former masterpieces, but in fact accelerates. I can still hear the sword clash in my head. The sound score and tracks are in place. You can touch the relation of this movie with Quentin's True Romance story where various scenes include samurai sword fights<br/><br/>I think that Sergio Leone would have been proud of Tarantino's talent to bring back those very old entertaining movies from the golden age of cinema.<br/><br/>Manga animations, Mighty bloody, Humor, Lots of swords, and A mind blowing end can't wait to watch volume 2.<br/><br/>Put in mind that this is no Charlie's Angels movie, it's a juicy dose of artistic adrenaline. <br/><br/>8/10 with a smile on thy face !"

I didn't care about anything that happened in it.<br/><br/> I wasn't let down because i had high expectations from all the positive reviews and i love the genre that it was paying homage to. Nothing either drew me in or repelled me, it was a film that played and then i left the cinema, with absolutely no feelings about it at all."
"morfeus","8","1","2","19 December 2003"," Tarantino lost his bite?
","One thing I knew to be sure after 1992 and till now - all Earth could go to hell, bet Tarantino never had lack of realism. Now with Kill Bill vol.1 I can tell that he has lost his bite. The film itsel if flawless - directing and acting is great, and tarantino ""chapters"" resemble the famous PF. But the problem is with the plot - the best way to kill Blll could be ten times easier and less risky that one Black Mamba had chosen. Why rush into the Copperheads house when she sucpects nothing and could be easy shot through window with a sniper rifle? If Black Mamba wanted to have her fun with Copperhead using knife, why not didn't she use soprofic ammo or something before?(And then repeat the famous scene from Reservoir Dogs:))) Considering the fact that she was a pro, this whole attitude lacks motivation.Of course, you can motivate it with the post-coma shock, bet not the whole movie!(She had at least 3 months to recover, basing on the plot). Another stupid thing to do was to get into fight with all the 88 elite guards, 'cos in real life noone could really take on so  many enemies using only sword and win. And if those guards were elite, why none of them has a gun? What kind of protection are they? If a team of 3-4 guys equipped with machineguns entered the building in real life the ""mad88"" would make an easy thargets. But even with swords they could easlily chop Mamba only because they were to many, and you just can't move THAT fast unless you are the ONE:) So here comes another drawback - lack of originality. Tarantino definetely tried to copy both The Matrix Reloaded and classic Takeshi Kitano (even by having actors from Battle Royale in his movie)  scenes. It's not that bad at all, considering that the Reservoir Dogs were fully based on Kitano's ""Violent cop"", but QT failed to give the blood and gore fest (which I greatly appreciated) the charm and style, which ruled in R.Dogs. And some corny anime and huge ammount of Japanese dialogue(which is organic in Kinatno's movies, but pointless in Tarantino's) are terrible. So the only REALLY Tarantino-styled scenes are some dialogues (like between Copperhead and Mamba), catchphrases (like I'm Buck, I'm here to f***) and so on. 8/10 because of lack of style and realism."
"lvscott","8","1","2","16 December 2003"," Anime revisited
","QT here has once again showed his knack for creating fleeting absurd characters, over the top action scenes, and original adaptation from various genres. In Kill Bill, QT picks The main genre ""Anime"" to bring to life on the big screen. If This film were done in pure cartoon Anime, it would just be another Japanese Anime flick, but here we have Anime without the cartoon.(Except for a few brief moments)<br/><br/>The violence depicted here is absurd and over the top, exactly what we would see in many cartoon anime series. It is not intended to shock, it is intended to stay true to the anime genre as if we were watching a true cartoon anime.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman aka ""The splattered bride, aka Black Mamba, aka, her absurdly bleeped out true name of ""Beatrice"" is on your typical Anime plot based revenge march from an assassination attempt on her 4 years prior. In typical out of sequence QT, We see the first act of Vengeance, only after to get QT'a quick and fleeting foundation to the story, the reason for ""Beatrice's"" revenge. However we do not know the reason for the hit squads ""hit"" on ""Black Mamba"" The film is interesting and visually stunning, but lacks in depth character development. But is not not typical QT and why we like his films?<br/><br/>Spoiler!!!! Did anyone listen to black Mamba start to proclaim to Bill ""Its your BAAAB"" Then POW!! Maybe that's why Bill wanted her dead, JEALOUSLY! We shall see in volume 2 of this ""Anime revisited Genre.""<br/><br/>8 out of 10<br/><br/>PS Don't TAKE YOUR CHILDREN OR EVER ALLOW THEM TO SEE THIS FILM UNLESS YOU WANT YOU KID TO HAVE NIGHTMARES FOR MONTHS!"

","I've expected lot of blood everywhere and almost no story at all so hard that I was kinda surprised that it wasn't that bad about the blood or the story either. But never mind, this movie wasn't about the story, it was about style - style over substance. The creative way of displaying otherwise already boring scenes and situations kept me enjoying Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Among other things they were: black and white scene (where 'blood' was obviously replaced with water), animated scene, retro music, and the fight with bola. Anyway, the strongest character for me was Chiaki Kuriyama as Go Go Yubari. Her eyes were so wicked and her other features so sharp, she was the only character that gave the skin crawl.<br/><br/>And one more thing: the violence wasn't gratuitous, it was all exaggeration.

"stamper","8","1","2","8 December 2003"," The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 1 - The beginning of his return: Kill Bill Vol. 1
","Not much of a story, but well executed<br/><br/>
You know what the problem is with living in a small ass town in the southern part of the Netherlands? The problem is, that if you are unable to attend a screening of a film like Kill Bill, in it's first two weeks, no cinema within a 25 kilometer radius still has the film running on a big screen. Now that's what I call a problem! And how is one supposed to solve that? Watch Kill Bill on a small ass screen?? SOD THAT! Wait until it is released on video?? HELL NO!! So what does one do? One travels about 85 kilometers to the first big town, spends twelve bucks on the train-ticket, an additional 8,30 for the entrance fee in a multiplex far far away from home. In conclusion, one spends a hell of a lot of money and three hours on the train for about two hours of Tarantino on a big screen. When one has done all that, what do one do then you guess? Well, then One hopes that the film does not suck and let me tell you it doesn't.<br/><br/>
The beginning of Kill Bill is quite rough and that sets the tone for the rest of the film, which is constructed the same way as Pulp Fiction, regarding the fact that the story is not told in it's chronological form. Now I agree with the critics with the fact that Kill Bill does not have too much of a story, but one can see that there is still much to come in Volume II. Not only is The Bride's kept secret from the audience, but the really great and in also surprising ending hints at somewhat more story and more surprises in the second film.<br/><br/>
I must say that I am a fan of Tarantino's work as a director and I found it astonishing that even with this film he managed to surprise me, for Kill Bill is unlike any of his other films. It bears somewhat a resemblance with Jackie Brown, with which Q dived deeply into another genre of movie-making and that is exactly what he does with Kill Bill. Kill Bill is a martial arts, revenge film, with spaghetti western and anime influences that I must say he mixed astonishingly well, despite having a bit of a with the animated chapter in the film myself in the beginning.<br/><br/>
The music in the film is (once again) great and the characters, although not all are elaborate and some seem quite shallow are characterized in a believable and good way by the actors. Besides Uma Thurman, who portrays the Bride, I especially liked Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii. The character she portrayed suited her very well and she pulled off the mean and devilish little 'godfather' with style. If Lucy did a really good job, I must say that Uma RULED. I mean she just acted in great fashion and I think this film is her best performance since Pulp Fiction. Maybe some would say that it is even better acting-wise. I do not want to be the judge on that and the only thing I can say is that she is as great as The Bride as she was as Misses Mia Wallace. If you don't believe it, watch the film and especially the 'wake-up' scene. If you don't think that is great acting, you're probably still in the 'Stallone is the best actor ever' phase.<br/><br/>
The film itself, (yes you read and heard correctly everywhere) is quite brutal, with limbs flying around and blood gushing out of wounds as it does in manga films at times. But the fact is that in my opinion it could have been (and needed be) much more brutal. The thing I am referring to here is the Massacre at the House of Blue Leaves. I mean what the heck was Q thinking when he made the switch from colored film to black and white? Or does this relate to the fact that the American and European version is much less violent than the Asian version of the film? Is it all in color over there and did the film manage to get an R rating because the blood and killing were in black and white instead of being in color? Well I do not know, but I had some real difficulty with the film switching to black and white and I think I would have enjoyed the killing more if it had been in color. I guess I'll see what that was all about when this film comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>
The carnage and destruction in Kill Bill never gets boring or ridiculous (as it did in Matrix: Revolutions) and despite the fact that some things need getting used to, Kill Bill: Volume I is a film that makes 110 minutes seem pretty short indeed. I agree that there is not much of a story, but then again, the stories of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were not too elaborate either. The thing with Tarantino is, that his execution of a story is always top-notch (including this film). This film may not be as thrilling as Reservoir Dogs, as cool as Pulp Fiction, as complicated and mysterious as Jackie Brown, but I sure as hell enjoyed myself and certainly did not regret having spent so much time and money, since in the end I got something back as well. I for one can't wait until 2004, when The Bride will FINALLY Kill Bill.<br/><br/>

"Jenny Ho","4","1","2","6 December 2003"," Style over substance
","Uma Thurman is The Bride, an assassin whose wedding day is ambushed by her former colleagues.  She is left comatose by a bullet in her skull but she wakes four years later intent on revenge.  She makes a death list': number five is Bill, but first there are some others including O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu) to deal with.<br/><br/>The film starts promisingly with The Bride calling in at the house of a fellow assassin (Vivica Fox).  This is the most entertaining sequence of the film with some trademark Tarantino-esque banter between the two women as they fight.<br/><br/>My interest in the film disintegrated soon after with a lengthy sequence that introduces O-Ren Ishi and is entirely in the form of a Manga style subtitled cartoon.  I am still not sure whether the film sent me to sleep because after that, I have no recollection of a coherent storyline.  A flashback to The Bride's escape from hospital is mildly amusing but in a very black way.   There is also a lengthy black and white sequence for the confrontation between The Bride and O-Ren Ishi's bodyguards.  Here, I felt like I was watching a very violent computer game with lots of fighting and blood spurting from dismembered bodies.  <br/><br/>As is conventional with Tarantino films, the sequences are not chronological which makes Kill Bill' quite a frustrating film to watch.  Although I find Uma Thurman a very watchable actress, what this movie is lacking in is the witty banter between characters that made Pulp Fiction' and Jackie Brown' more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Volume 1 ends with an intriguing piece of information being revealed in anticipation of the story being continued in Volume 2.  Perhaps I would like Kill Bill' more and my opinion would be different if I were to view Volume 2 on its release.  Unfortunately, at this stage, I feel that the six year wait for a new film by Tarantino has hyped up the film more than it deserves and I increasingly feel that he is an overrated director so much so that I am inclined to wait until I can borrow the two disc DVD from someone."

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs<br/><br/>In a plot that pays homage to the Bruce Lee martial arts flicks Tarantino loved during his youth (even Thurman's suit towards the end of the film is an exact replica of the one worn by Lee in Game of Death),Uma Thurman stars as 'The Bride' (codename:Black Mamba) who is left for dead,heavily pregnant,by The Black Viper Assassination Squad,in the shape of O-Ren Ishii (codename:Cottonmouth)(Lucy Liu),Elle Driver (codename:California Mountain Snake),(Daryl Hannah),Vernita Green (codename:Copperhead) (Vivica A. Fox) and the as-yet undeveloped Budd (codename:Sidewinder) (Michael Madsen) and her boss,Bill (David Carradine) on her wedding day.Four years later,she awakens from a coma to exact revenge.The story is told,in true Tarantino style,with the use of flashbacks and back story.<br/><br/>Tarantino has never been known as a film maker who skimps on the gory details or makes films for the faint hearted,and this film is so far from an exception it hurts.It is truly one of the most violent,blood thirsty films in recent memory.So many decapitations,in the shapes of arms,legs,hands,ankles,and even heads get slashed off,not to mention all the graphic blood spurting going on (not all of it really necessary and,in one case,even believable) that by the end of the film,you've run the risk of becoming almost totally desensitised to it.<br/><br/>This,would,however match the nasty,mean spirited and often gratuitous tone that runs throughout much of the beginning.This actually ends up as being off putting and even a little upsetting to be honest,and it certainly makes it an arguous struggle to make it through to the middle and ending.It starts to get better and more mesmerising here,but there are other faults that start to creep in.While the visual style and soundtrack magnetize your attention,the actual story and script begin to waver.The story itself becomes almost none existent and the script has a few implausibilities (are we supposed to take the scene where Thurman wipes out so many members of the Yakuza with a sword single handedly seriously?Why do none of the gang members use any guns?).<br/><br/>And,with Tarantino films admired so much for their witty dialogue and banter,this certainly is that (hopefully) rare exception.A lot of it feels too forced and overly sincere,while some ('You didn't think it was going to be that easy,did you?','You know for a second there?Yeah,I kinda did') is just plain clichéd.<br/><br/>Perhaps Tarantino was trying to honour his kung fu film favourites with such bad dialogue,but,to me,it often seemed like the line between homage and parody started to blur uncomfortably together.I'm sure there's some witty social commentary that I'm not getting that some IMDb reviewer will end up pointing out to me,but I found it buried far too deep to be let out.<br/><br/>As I said,the soundtrack and visual style were excellent and the fight scenes themselves were brilliant,extremely well chereographed and sadistically entertaining no end (though you may require a strong stomach).<br/><br/>So,really a film of mixed halves,very good in certain areas with a lot to recommend it,leaving you dripping with anticipation for the follow up.****"

","It's difficult for me to judge this movie. Did I like it? Yes. Is it a ""good"" movie? No. I really liked ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"". Not very sure about ""Jackie Brown"". And ""From Dusk Till Down"" may be one of my all time favorites (directed by Robert Rodriguez, tough). But where does this movie fails? The problem is that it looks like a random mix of fight scenes taken from really bad Hong-Kong movies. The blood and guts look so fake and so funny that it can only be taken as a tribute to Monty Phyton's ""Holy Grail"". The plot, if any, is so narrow that we don't even know who those people are or why they are fighting about. I got tired of the action with no plot and my girlfriend got sick of watching that blinded violence. In the end, the film does not leave you anything.<br/><br/>But why did I like it? Because it entertained me a lot. Because is a non-stop action movie. But, then again, a lot of b-class movies did the same.

","""the blood escaped from the body like it was a fountain"" or ""How was Uma able to take a Samurai sword on an airplane?""<br/><br/>These comments kinda frustrates me, if you didnt know, this was supposed to be a tribute movie, a tribute to all the film genres that quentin loves. And especially (of vol. 1 that is) the japaneese samurai genre. And if you have seen a good old japaneese movie, you will notice that the blood actually ""escapes the body like it was a fountain"".<br/><br/>And for the Samurai sword on the plane. Ive seen people writing it was a riddicoulus(?) mistake by QT to oversee the fact that Uma brought the sword with here on the plane from Okinawa to japan. Do you really think QT oversaw that? What it is, is a tribute to japaneese samurai movies, meaning samurai, the sword and the movies, and all it represents, is such a important harritage(??) to the japaneese people and culture that bringing a sword on the plane should be a normal and common thing to happen. As you see on the plane seats, there are actually ""cop""holders meant for the samurai swords to be held in, or samurai-holders if you'd like!<br/><br/>Congrats to QT for making a unforgettable movie yet again.

","Yes its a good movie. It is worth watching. Tarantino provides an entertaining kung fu flick. It is particularly fun to try and pick out all the nods to previous movies. But, it is certainly not the best of any genre.<br/><br/>Neither is it really that violent. Yes there is more blood spraying and limb dismemberment than say Love Actually, but its certainly not a gore movie. So much so I was actually disappointed.<br/><br/>The Japanese version also is more violent, having the final restaurant scene in color instead of black and white.<br/><br/>But in the quagmire of hollywood humdrum it certainly stands out.<br/><br/>6/10"
"EmperorNortonII","8","1","2","26 November 2003"," Quentin Tarantino: Back With a Vengeance!
","""Kill Bill"" is the long-awaited new offering by Quentin Tarantino.  Six years in the making, it attacks with no subtlety whatsoever.  Uma Thurman stars as the Bride, and amazes in this tale of vengeance.  Her battle against Go Go Yubari stands out among all the scuffling and bloodshed.  The movie bears one of Tarantino's trademarks, a non-linear story.  This gives Sonny Chiba's ""Revenge is not a straight line"" speech a certain significance.  Another of Tarantino's trademarks is graphic violence, and ""Kill Bill"" offers plenty, even more so than ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs.""  The battle in the House of Blue Leaves is especially gory!  After seeing the first half of Quentin's labor of love, all I can say is brace yourself for Volume 2!"
"germanWoodyFan","4","1","2","20 November 2003"," Overrated
","This film seems to be nothing more than a lame excuse for showing violence. And while showing showers of blood (way overdone, really unrealistic and not even a bit funny) it does almost everything wrong, what a film can do wrong. There is no acting at all.. save Uma perhaps, who at least changes the look on her face. Lucy Liu for example is awful (though pretty). The ""idea"" of showing the plot not chronologically isn't new and one might get the feeling that this is Tarantino's effort to link to Pulp fiction. In this case it doesn't work. At all. While the plot may reveal itself as quite a bit better than thought in Vol.2 (who knows) this part is just boring.<br/><br/>Worst of all was IMO the sound engineering, something that is a flaw in a lot of films from the USA but this one takes the lead. There were however some nice scenes regarding camera work. But in battles as ridiculous as these, that won't help too much. Speaking of the battles. In Matrix and Star Wars we got at least an explanation for what is happening, in Asian films flying sword-fighters are something mythological. Here none of this applies and all we see is a 30year old women who spent her last four years in a coma and doesn't need even half a year before she moves like Marvel Super Hero. A little kryptonite would have helped."

","They told me this film was all style, no substance. Well, they were right about the substance - this film is devoid of plot, humor, character and dialogue, which I can't comprehend, because I figured that stuff was Tarantino's forte. Then again, Kill Bill's redeeming quality supposedly is its style... <br/><br/>Well, the movie sure puts a lot of styles on display, if that's the point. Tarantino borrows from various 70s flicks and drops references every five minutes. But it all amounts to a very uneven, tiresome movie, that feels three times as long as it is. The abundant violence, to me, was completely pointless, unlike ""Reservoir Dogs"" for instance, where the story & characters legitimize it. <br/><br/>I have tons of respect for Tarantino, but in this movie he simply forgets his audience. I honestly can't remember when I left the theatre so disappointed."

","Having seen this three times at the cinema now i was inclined to write a review of it. Kill Bill is quite easily one of the best films i have seen. I was surprised i liked it so much as normally i am more keen on films with a complex narrative and developed characters(Volume ii may help clarify this), nevertheless what Kill Bill delivered was a near perfect cinematic masterpiece. The main reason i loved this film so much was because of its aesthetic qualities. The violence looked almost beautiful, a sharp contrast to that of 'Reservoir Dogs'. The film is very reflexive in so much that Tarantino uses and appreciates a variety of sub-genres. Thurman is perfectly cast as the avenger who seeks to torment and destroy those who inflicted so much pain on her. Its violence but tastefully done.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the second installment to arrive and answer some of the questions the first volume left open.

","What a rush! As a fan of Exploitation pictures for many years, I greatly enjoyed this homage to all things groovy. Part of the rush for me is seeing a filmmaker adapting and allowing work that his influenced him to take new form. From the opening Shaw Bros. logo, we know we are on the cinematic equivalent of 42nd Street and it's time to get our film freak on. Eastern Kung Fu flicks dominated this stretch (alongside the soft and hardcore sex flix, natch)and this is a wonderful period of cinematic excess from which to draw.<br/><br/>For me, KB is about nobility of purpose. Both dark and white sides of an code of honour that binds all creatures. Plus having a candy-coated shell of excess and style to shelter this theme. The best B movies have this going for them. If you can educate and entertain at the same time, you have a rare opportunity.<br/><br/>KB does both with equal gusto. You really need to be up on your 'grindhouse' to dig all of the things QT has going on in KB. As a fan and a filmmaker I was thrilled at seeing The RZA, Master Ping and the calibre of KNB involved with this production. You know these guys are fans, artists and constant. Stellar performances from all involved on-screen and behind the camera. Tech. credits are super-solid.<br/><br/>As far as movies go, for me, KB is the kung-fu artploitation film of the decade. Nothing touches it. I can't wait for KB2 and hope that QT is happy with his final work. This fanboy is."
"Steve-283","3","1","2","17 November 2003"," Boring
","I have loved Tarantino's other films. They have always had three key components, a finely crafted story, comedy and violence. This film was exactly the same except that it didn't have the story or the comedy.<br/><br/>The film is only just over an hour and a half long, but it seemed longer. People clearly weren't gripped. I have never seen so many people wandering in and out of the cinema - they clearly weren't on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>Now I've got nothing against violence if it moves the story forward, or adds to the comedy. I think the scene where Vincent accidentally shoots a guy in the head in the back of a car is a great piece of comedy and directly leads to one of the best scenes in the excellent Pulp Fiction. But the violence in Kill Bill is practically constant - and that gets very, very dull. There's only so many times that somebody getting slashed with a sword can hold your interest.<br/><br/>The Manga is quite well done, but is again full of violence for violence's sake.<br/><br/>There is comedy, but I'm pretty sure that the laughs were coming in places that the director didn't intend...<br/><br/>And the story. Well that must have taken all of five minutes to write. Victim of a failed murder goes out to kill the four assassins who attacked her and their boss, Bill. Cue five interminably long fight scenes (two of which are in this movie) linked by some (violent - yawn) background about each. But because its Tarantino, the people are shown being killed in the wrong order. Innovative it is not.<br/><br/>Of course Tarantino is well known for his non-linear films. Maybe the story and intelligent writing comes in Part 2.<br/><br/>But I doubt it."

","""Kill Bill"" is simply a bad movie, plain and simple.  There's very little substance to the plot, no meaningful character development, and a vast overabundance of senseless violence.  The most unfortunate aspect of Kill Bill is that the trademark funkiness that has made Tarantino a genre unto himself is almost entirely displaced by endless scenes of sword-swinging, limb-amputating gore.  In fact, viewers will probably find the violence more boring than objectionable, there's so much of it.<br/><br/>Contrary to the claims of die-hard Tarantino fans, there's nothing to ""get"" about Kill Bill.  There's no deep meaning discenible only to martial-arts cinema philosophers, and there's no such-and-such-esque substance that gives this film any secret, subtle brilliance.  This is simply Tarantino's monument to his own dark obsessions, and not much more."

"Infofreak","Null","1","2","7 November 2003"," Tarantino's stylish and exciting encyclopedia of trash culture is pure entertainment! A purely visual, visceral super cool popcorn movie.
","I've just been to see 'Kill Bill'. Please excuse me if I find it a bit difficult to get my thoughts together, cos I'm still taking my jaw off the floor! First thing is I've been a fan of Tarantino since I saw 'Reservoir Dogs' ten years ago. I'm not a teenage fanboy who thinks QT is God. I'm a cynical old geezer who has seen a few movies in my time. If 'Kill Bill' sucked I would be the first to shout it from the rooftops. But it doesn't suck. It's easily the most entertaining action movie I've seen since... well, I can't even think of anything to compare it to. And yes, this is an ACTION movie, so if you're expecting depth to the characters, and any kind of insight into the human condition, you're out of luck. Tarantino showed in 'Jackie Brown' that he can do that. This time round he's come up with a purely visual, visceral popcorn movie. I usually despise most modern examples of that. All those cynically packaged and carefully marketed CGI-infested ""blockbusters"". The main reason I enjoyed 'Kill Bill' so much is that it was blatantly obvious that Tarantino has made this movie to please nobody but himself. That's why it really works for me. He doesn't give a damn whether you like it or not, he's just making a movie he thinks is super cool. Thankfully I agree with him! It's jam-packed with pop-culture references, and echoes of movies past and present - obvious ones, obscure ones, from 70s chop socky classics through to the outrageous genre-busting of Takashi Miike ('Dead Or Alive', 'Ichi The Killer', 'City Of Lost Souls',etc.) via spaghetti westerns and Peckinpah's 'The Killer Elite'. The soundtrack is mind-bogglingly eclectic and ranges from Nancy Sinatra to Morricone to Isaac Hayes to Krautrock legends Neu! to '60s one-hit-wonders The Human Beinz, plus some rockin' live numbers from Japanese girl band The 5.6.7.8.'s. There's Bruce Lee in-jokes and nods to 'Battle Royale' (one of the stars of the latter Chiaki Kuriyama is featured in the most exciting fight scene here), and a cameo from Sonny Chiba, and even - get this! - a homage to the hilarious martial arts cult classic 'The One Armed Boxer vs. The Flying Guillotine'. But look, you don't have to get all the references and recognize Tarantino's sources of inspiration to enjoy 'Kill Bill'. The more you know the more you'll get out of it, but even a novice will find plenty to entertain them. To say I eagerly await Volume 2 of 'Kill Bill' is the understatement of the decade!!"
"A60","3","1","2","6 November 2003"," Surprisingly Boring
","Really, the title says it all. I was especially surprised by the poor pacing. The vast majority of the film is spent explaining backstory, but the backstory isn't that interesting. ""The Bride"", as a meta-character, is inherently empty, as is most everything else in this film. Easily half the scenes could have been cut. Even the fight sequences (which make up about 10% of the film) seemed pointless. Some people I know who really liked this movie seem to have bought into its mythology. Clearly the film has its own world, it's just not a very surprising or interesting one. There are some good jokes here and there (the line of Aviator sunglasses across the police officer's dashboard comes to mind) but a few decent gags does not a good film make. I read in an interview with Tarantino that Kill Bill Vol. 2 is going to be ""slower"" than the first installment. Slower than this? Is that even possible? Looks like ""Kill Bill"" is treading into Tarkovsky territory, except you know, without any of that Russian existentialist poetic grace."
"kwarkfrietveld","3","1","2","6 November 2003"," visual, but no story
","Of course I was also curious by the new movie of Tarentino. After his movies<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction that was innovating, From Dusk Till Dawn, that was great by visual effects and surprising, Jacky Brown, that was sober but good my tensions were high. Unfortunately I must say I was disappointed. First there was a thin, or rather no story, it was obviously made for the visual effects. No problem, I also like movies with great visuals, but also on this point I think it wasn't very good. In the beginning you think: 'that's great, that's funny', but after seeing the same tricks again and again it started to be silly. Normally a strong point of Tarentino are the conversations, but in this movie they miss the sharpness and strength. Another thing disturbing for me was the music. It started also beautifully with the opening song, but after that it became worse and worse with the climax the pan flute muzak that was not funny. Strange thing was that the RZA had a big hand in it because you could have expected some quality from his hand after for<br/><br/>example Ghost Dog, the way of the samoerai. Funny I have to think about this<br/><br/>movie of Jim Jarmush, because it also handles about  fighting art, but this movie that is much more sober, has a story, a point and an atmosphere that is<br/><br/>authentic. That is I think the problem with this new movie of Tarentino, It misses the sharpness and strong authenticity I'm used when I look at his movies. This movie is entertainment, nothing more and maybe less. I'm afraid I will forget this movie soon, but I hope and will be sure that he will make new movies what will contain the sharpness i like"

"SwedishOR","10","1","2","1 November 2003"," A lamentable mess for some, but for the rest of us...
","*SPOILERS HEREIN*  This is my very first commentary on IMDB.com over a motion picture.  And frankly, I've never seen so much heated controversy over whether or not this film actually deserves full merit, or none at all. And me, I know I can't quite match wits or opinions with some of the others who have posted here, being a high school senior myself, but I shall try, in 1,000 words or less.<br/><br/>First off, something that must be made abundantly clear:  THIS FILM IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.  If you hate buckets of blood, obviously real OR fake, this film is not for you.  The same for those who don't approve of heavy collections of different cinematic angles and gimmicks OR slightly cheesy and camped-up dialogue.  However, for those of us who look past this and have the ability to see the true art behind a film's campiness (The Boondock Saints, Superman II, Ed Wood), then I HIGHLY recommend this film.<br/><br/>A few controversial subjects on the film I feel the need to justify.<br/><br/>1. The violence:  As much as we hate to admit it, some of the best filmmakers of this year have proven themselves artistic through the gore they deliver on-screen.  And frankly, no one has been able to pull it off better this year than Tarantino has.  Unlike his previous films which deliver blood HARD, FAST and REAL, this film, rather, delivers it with good taste.  Where there is an abundance of blood (as there usually is in this slash n' dash Japanese films), he overstates it with extremely fake SHOWERS of blood.  And where there is but a little blood, it is performed in good taste, with a true artistic liscense.  Personally, I have yet to see blood strewn out more beautifully in a motion picture than A.  Go-Go Yubari `crying' tears of her own blood, and  B.  O-Ren Ishii's foot padding having blood trickle between her toes and on the side as well.  In my opinion, Tarantino has overused the blood in this film, simply because there was no better way to deliver it AS WELL as to make it so abundant, so we really had no choice but to get use to just how much there was.<br/><br/>2. The cinematography:  Yes, a lot of tricks and gimmicks were pulled in this film, treating us to much EYE CANDY.  And yet, while it may appear as a mere distraction to some, for others, it is a feast for our optical senses. And yes, it is possible to look at all the different angles and camera tricks and say that it was simply thrown together.  But for me, what I saw was Tarantino making each segment of the movie its own, as each if section was a short story (Yes, a `chapter') of a much grander story.  Personally, I found the Anime to be very authentic and full of class, for what it was. The switch to black and white, then back to color, then the blue lighting.not distractions, mind you, but accentuations to scenes beautiful as they already are.<br/><br/>3. The setting/music:  Two in one.  I have personally been to Tokyo AND Okinawa, and can personally claim that this movie held VERY TRUE to its roots in these locations.  There are tea bar JUST LIKE the house of blue leaves.  The acting from the Japanese `thespians' was very true to form. And save the fact that it RARELY ever snows in Tokyo.other than that, I could see very little that would say to someone who knows SLIGHTLY about true modern culture in Japan `This just doesn't fit.'  As for the music, VERY WELL DONE.  Again, I can see how someone would consider this to be the most pathetic, cheesed-up, thrown in plate of garbage in the world.  In response, all I can do is point out the ceremony of the sword:  Authentic Japanese woodwinds with MARIACHI HORNS.  Sorry.you just can't beat that.<br/><br/>4. The dialogue/plot:  Campy?  Indeed.  Simplistic?  Yes, at first sight. I mean, what could be more blunt and elementary than `Uma Thurman WILL Kill Bill?'  BUT.it takes an eye to look past the first dimension of Quentin's usually flawless and realistic dialogue to see that this, like Fiction, Dogs and Brown, it IS an art film.but under a different genre.  Tarantino is much like one of my favorite actors, Mr. Johnny Depp.  Everything said and acted is melodramatic, over-reactive, over-stated and EXTREMELY drawn out. However, unlike the many flops of this year, the difference is how these two men perform the task of `over-acting' on PURPOSE.  Tarantino purposely over-did the entire script, simply to add not only to the tribute of previous classic Marital Arts flicks of oriental descent, but also to prove that he can take a plot-line, with dialogue, which would have BOMBED with `Gigli' proportions under another director/writer.and make it work. Also.did anyone else notice a slight feeling of De Ja Vu when Uma Thurman quickly drew out a `square' with her finger in the beginning, ala `Pulp Fiction'?  Meh.maybe it's just me.<br/><br/>To me, I consider this film an epic.  Not a `Lawrence of Arabia' epic to the very least.  But in it's own right, under this day and age, it is considered well done, and WILL be remembered.  If for nothing else, for reminding us of a time when plot and dialogue was allowed to be cheesy as hell, and it worked.  And forget what everyone else said.  Personally, for having to cut the movie into two volumes, I LIKE the ending.  Sure beats what we had to put up with for `Reloaded'.'What if I told you.her daughter was still alive?'<br/><br/>Casey's Review:  97% - A+"
"frederickfilm","Null","1","2","1 November 2003"," Why some people don't like or 'get' it
","It's interesting that Kill Bill Vol 1 and Scary Movie came out very close to eachother. Both films are such that if you haven't seen the films that they honour or mock, then you simply wouldn't understand what the film is trying to do. I recently saw Kill Bill for the 3rd time with a friend and she came out of the film saying ""I thought the story was very shallow...I thought that it was just relentless killing after killing after killing."" I realized that everything that I thought was 'cool' about the film, she simply didn't notice or understand. If you saw Scary Movie without every seeing or hearing about the Matrix or Scream, you would think that the film is a plotless and stupid film. It's the same thing for KILL BILL if you haven't seen any of the Japanese or Western films that this film feeds off of. For example...when the ""Green Hornet"" theme is playing through the film...I was so delighted and excited to hear that song again...and I found it funny and interesting...but many people didnt get it. The split screen DePalma stuff was awesome to me...only because it reminded me off WHY Tarantino did it that way. Lots of people just didnt get it.<br/><br/>So...please...if you think that it is a bad movie...dont spread that around...because you just dont know any better.<br/><br/>BT"

Most knuckle heads who favor the kind of crap out in today's theaters will not understand the references to such classics as Yojimbo, and Once Upon a Time in the West.  Tarantino made a masterpiece for true movie buffs. This movie is meant to be a fun throw back to grind house exploitation cinema, and not some bloated self-important psuedo-philosopical nonsense. Watching this movie gave me a sense of what movies are really all about. Fun, and escapism, if I wanted reality I'd  have turned on the eleven o'clock news."
"robnet24","3","1","2","1 November 2003"," Very disappointing. Don't believe the hype !!
","Shallow... this is my first impression after seeing Quentin Tarantino's new movie. It is shallow because the plot is weak, even though Tarantino uses his now habituals time ellipses. A good realisation doesn't necessary compensate with a weak scenario and Mr Tarantino should know it as he usually makes movie witch are excellent in both  plot and realisation. Well, Kill Bill is an exception.<br/><br/>Violent... words and images are utterly violent. In my opinion, this one goes too far. How can anyone laugh about pedophilia or a child seeing her mother being killed or even rape ? You need to be very talented and very sensitive to use these subjects in a movie and make people more aware of them, instead of using them to create a morbid-grotesque atmosphere. People were laughing during the movie but I think that it was because they were feelig uneasy and nervous.<br/><br/>No surprise... usually, Tarantino's movies are surprising, but Kill Bill is not. It uses and abuses of ideas seen before in other movies. Here is an example : why these Crouching-Tiger-Matrix-style fights ? It seems that nowadays, every action movies realisator wants to use the same effects. But After seeing them in countless movies, they loose their magic and originality. If you want good fights, watch the originals (Crouching... Matrix... Hero... or old school kung-fu movies).<br/><br/>Boring... there is no mastery of time in this movie. I think that it could easily be 30 minutes shorter. For example, the last fight is far too long and seems to be a weak excuse to split the movie into two parts. What about The Lord of the Rings ? What about Magnolia ? What about other very good movies which are as long as Kill Bill part 1 and 2 put together ? The reason is : pure marketing and a pathetic effort to be original... which fails."

Anyone who finds<br/><br/>repetitive fighting entertaining will have everything catered for him<br/><br/>in this flick.<br/><br/>The few times the script makes something of an appearance it is<br/><br/>to further embellish the idea of mystery instead of having to go<br/><br/>through all the work of actually making a mysterious movie, the<br/><br/>result is of course that the whole movie falls flat without leaving<br/><br/>anything but regret that one wasted so much time watching this<br/><br/>particular movie."
"audioslave1","10","1","2","29 October 2003"," Tarantino's best...
","I waited for this film for a very long time and the final product went above my highest expectations. This film is a masterpiece in every sense of that word. Its unique and people who say its a ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" rip-off are totally wrong. This film still has the 'Tarantino Feel' to it and its done by music as well as the dialogues, humour and the time shifting storyline. However, even though 'Kill Bill"" holds this Tarantino 'trademark' its a film totally different from the likes of 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs'. Tarantino, once again picked Uma Thurman, a move which proved to be so decisive. Her presence is felt by the audience and I think she is just brilliant. ""Kill Bill' wouldn't be as good without her. She must surely get an Oscar for that performance.<br/><br/>The fighting sequence is unbelievable. The agent fight in 'Matrix Reloaded"" looks silly when compared to this, especially that ""Kill Bill"" one uses hardly any CGI's. When I left the cinema after seeing it my friend said to me that the film would be better if the main character was male. I think the fact that its a female contributed to the film and made it more unique. Besides, I dont think that there is anyone that could replace Uma Thurman, she was born for that role! Some people might not like it because its too violent but the this violence is intentionally presented in a comical way. MASTERPIECE! 10/10"

","Quentin Tarantino is a genius. Sick and twisted genius, but a genius, nonetheless.<br/><br/>
Collect the best scenes from classical martial arts movies and other great stuff such as Samurai Fiction, Yojimbo, Seven Samurai, Green Hornet, Enter the Dragon, Star Trek, Matrix, Matrix Reloaded, Lone Wolf and the Cub, Battle Royale (take an actor from Battle Royale to play a cute schoolgirl) and countless others. Add some modern twist and use the modern possibilities to make them up to date - and how they should have been done. Give them all respect they deserve. Then, read a pile of comics - manga, Marvel's Japan stuff - and borrow the graphic style from them. And parodize everything in an intelligent way.<br/><br/>Make a story that is a mother of all vengeance stories. Don't take it too seriously - make it a parody as well.<br/><br/>Then, get a bunch of lads together. Make them to talk about the movies that they loved when they were 15 - get them back to that moment. Use their ideas of how you could put their favourite fighting scenes in to your movie - and then ask them, how would they want to spice them up. Use every single idea.<br/><br/>Add Quentin Tarantino to the soup as a main ingredient.<br/><br/>
Love every minute of it.<br/><br/>

"Stardust_4u_2","Null","1","2","26 October 2003"," Exceeded Expectations (spoilers)
","***SPOILERS***    ***SPOILERS*** Let me just start off by saying that I had never seen a QT movie before in my life and that in reality I went to the theater with my husband to see Scary Movie 3, but alas it was sold out and my husbands friend suggested KILL BILL.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of Uma Thurman so I wasn't happy about the idea and went into the theater with the attitude of a three year old who didn't want to take a nap. But as the movie started and well after Daryl Hannah's annoying Whistle Music I found myself actually caring about the character, which for all drama/film/theater students is the ultimate of a great story.<br/><br/>
There's certainly a lot of passion to the film and that's I think what gives it depth. Hearing at the end about how her child was still a live totally threw me through a loop even though I know now that's probably the only right way to end the film...makes a great bridge to the sequel.<br/><br/>The acting was at more than its best. And Lucy Liu and Vivica A. Fox totally blew me away with their performances. The only draw back to the film was the way you felt after watching it. Like you didn't get enough of the story.<br/><br/>
I'm impressed though. Way to go Uma and QT. I'm looking forward to the sequel."

","While the plot might be tolerable, the rest of the movie is totally boring. This film is poor in every detail except blood and guts.  This modern day terminator should team up with Rambo to rid the world of evil.  The fountains of blood were extremely over done to the point of boredom. However, the movie left you wanting to know what happens in part two.  I doubt that I will do anything but ""rent"" part two to relieve my curiosity.

","Do you have to be a film student to enjoy this movie?  I will be the first to admit that the movie shows exceptional directorial skills.  However, The film lacks one thing that I consider crucial for a great movie-plot.  Let me get this straight.  Uma Thurman's character was shot on her wedding day by ""Bill"" and presumed dead.  However, she survives and goes on a mission to kill those that were involved in her attempted assassination.  Now, to me-this sounds like the plot for a B-action flick.  I understand that he's paying homage or whatnot, but does that make it a great movie?  When I first walked out of the film, I thought it was a spoof. Another element I found extremely lacking that was prevalent in Tarantino's previous films was dialogue.  Pulp Fiction is one of the most quotable movies I've ever seen which makes it incredibly cool.  The dialogue in Kill Bill is cheesy and overdone (paying homage to old samurai movies again?).   There was very little done to make me identify with the main character, and there was absolutely no way I could contain my laughter when the volcano of blood shot out of the recently decapitated body.   I am not posting this to offend anyone that enjoyed this movie.  I seriously want to know what it was that I missed that makes this movie so awesome."
"twizzle777","5","1","2","14 October 2003"," Did IQ's drop suddenly?
","By no means did I dislike this movie, but the fervor and claims that this is the best or most entertaining movie of 2003 are retarded.  Have you not seen any other films this year?  It's not even a complete film, Two Towers and Empire at least have complete dramatic arcs that feel solid even though they clearly require films on either end to be ""complete"".  Vol 1 feels more like Reloaded, half of a movie, rather than a chapter in a saga.  For people who are fans of shaw brothers, chambara, and Sergio Leone, I can sympathize with the excitement of an amalgam and update to these classics by perhaps the most zealous film appreciator/creator of our day.  For those that have never seen, or don't care to see the roots of Kill Bill I especially can't see why they think this is so amazing.  There's plenty of weak sh*t to compliment the good stuff.  That's just honesty, people who toss around, ""You just don't get it"" need to hold their tongues, because I certainly do.<br/><br/>After I got over the Shaw logo, Sonny Chiba, the nod to Fukasaku via Chiaki Kuriyama's presence, the track suit, and Gordon Liu I took a serious look at this film and wonder WTF happened to QT's writing.  I don't need snappy dialogue or waxing on about the silver surfer, but goddamn, much of the dialogue is flat.  And it's not for lack of acting either.  Further, why are some scenes so fatty and long?  And by long I don't mean tick-tocks, I mean waste.  The Sushi conversation served no purpose till %90 of it was done. It totally sucks the juice out of a scene, and it's not building like the slow burn of Eastwood's Unforgiven or the tension of Scott's Alien, so WTF is happening?  This is meant to be a rip-roaring ride of revenge and instead it's got a limp.  Before the ADD cracks and MTV generation remarks come flying, that doesn't mean I object to the drama, in fact I think that is what makes the bloodshed engrossing.  But it needs to be well done, and in this film I feel that there's too much dead time.<br/><br/>The action scenes are good... and could we expect anything less?!?  Wo Ping and Chiba (as the kenjitsu advisor) are vets of the industry and Robert Richardson delivers some great looking film, as one would expect from a man who's worked on tons of Oliver Stone pictures.  It would be a travesty to not have them well done.  Though it is unfortunate that the grand sword battle had to be made B&W, some shots look classy while others are hard to appreciate due to the difficulty of seeing what's happening.  That said this is not the best action I've ever seen.  And it lacks a certain soul if you will.  A great action scene gets my pulse up and my hands will actually shake.  I think I kept a straight 59-65 pulse through the entire House of Blue Leaves (awesome name for a club).  Is it technically impressive? Sure. But look at the talent involved and the money.  I think the side effect of it, is that the movie lacks hunger.  Anyone who has seen a movie called Versus can attest that for $400,000 the movie has great action and splatter F/X, even if they don't like the movie besides these technical merits. Kill Bill has a total budget of 55 million.  I didn't see action on the screen that had the same drive to innovate or be clever that Versus or a dozen other similar projects have.  Tarantino and crew have basically lifted the WELL established action movements and scenario's from countless classics, and put a lot of money into making them polished.  This is all well and good, but the end result is that there is no single moment in the martial fury that the Bride unleashes that isn't a, `been there done that'.  Which also isn't really a problem except that people talk about this movie like it's the second coming, and QT himself talked up the action as rivaling anything he's ever seen, and I can only guess he's seen more than I have... So what gives?<br/><br/>I gave this section of the Kill Bill epic a 7/10.  It's clearly well made in many respects, but it hardly innovates, or sets the bar higher in any category.  Be that an exercise in style, gore, action, story, or characters. Perhaps Vol 2 will raise that overall score."

"stanteau","10","1","2","10 October 2003"," The Single Most Incredible Theatre Experience Ever!
","Kill Bill holds a very dear place in my heart. I'd be lying if I didn't say that I liked, nay, loved, nay, MEMORIZED everything Quentin Tarantino has<br/><br/>ever been affiliated with. Started with a spur renting of Reservoir Dogs to finding my parents copy of Pulp Fiction which I LITERALLY destroyed by watching so much and within a year I had everything he'd ever starred in,directed,or written under my belt. I'm not exaggerating when I say me,my dad,and my brother have memorized every single line in Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>At the same time I LOVE Japanese and Hong Kong cinema. I've watched almost every ""big"" HK kung fu movie and quite a few of the ""small"" ones. I've seen 14 Zatoichi movies for christ sake,and of course,Battle Royale.<br/><br/>Now,enter about nine months ago. I go on imdb and type in the QT man and find that he's directing a 4th film! Within an hour I've memorized the actors in it (SONNY EFFIN CHIBA!) and seen the teaser a good 3 times (I can't even begin to count how many times I've seen it now). This is MY film. This film was ALL I could talk about for the past 6 months and today at school I told EVERYONE ""Eff House of the Dead, it's about Kill Effin Bill!"" and everyone more or less hates me now cause of this stupid movie. SO! How was it?<br/><br/>In one word, scrumtulescent.<br/><br/>The movie is a train ride from the very beginning. The first thing we see is an AWESOME ""Feature Presentation"" logo, the kind you'd see in a 70's release of a Wu Tang flick. From there we open up on the bloody and scarred face of Uma Thurman as the mysterious Bill talks off screen. An amazing Tarantino soliloquy follows and then the credits. Nothing more than white text on black background while Nancy Sinatra's haunting ""Bang Bang"" plays.<br/><br/>Based on this alone you can get an idea of what Kill Bill is like. It's dark, it's bloody, it's gory, but it also has it's little hilarious quirks. This film is so quirky it's insane. It's shot in the Tarantino order,AKA,out of order but at NO point does it seem like a gimmick. At the same time Tarantino has no qualms with completely ruining the flow we've all come to know in the average movie. The best example I can give of this is when Tarantino launches into about a 10 minute anime back story (animated by our friends at Production IG,god bless ya'll) of one of the characters. Literally out of the blue. It does NOT seem out of place or anything at all, in fact, it's a great breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>The action is just...god, I can't even begin to explain it. I LOVE old kung fu stuff but lately it's too complicated. The fights go on far too long and involve such ridiculous stunts that by the end I just don't care anymore. This is old school all the way. Excluding 2 or 3 flips it is ALL grounded and it's kept nice and sweet. She doesn't play chicken with 50 guys for an hour, she beheads, dismembers, and mutilates about 80 or so characters in about 7 minutes and it's AWESOME! The violence is so ridiculously out of control that you can't help but just laugh at it but also be amazed at it's entertainment value. It blows anything the Matrix has even attempted out the water and this didn't need a bullet time gimmick.<br/><br/>And now we come to the ending. Something that everyone has been dreading since it was announced the film would be split. Does the ending work? Hell, mothereffin, yeah. The ending leaves you with a closed chapter but a plot twist that leaves you in suspense, but not the insane suspense of the Matrix. In the end I'm glad it was split, as I doubt even I could appreciate a 4 hour nonstop gore revenge flick.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that there isn't more. I don't mean the sequel, but I mean just more of the plot. I mentioned the anime sequence above. Now, I used to LOVE anime, I was knee deep in it, but I haven't seen an ounce of it in probably 2 or 3 months because it's just all poppy cheery kiddy crap or the same recycled romantic/shounen plot over and over. Well this is anime I LOVE! It's gritty, it's violent, it's dark, it's just some of the best animation I've ever seen. I just wish there was a fullon 24 episode series of it. At the same time, I know once the movie is over I'm gonna want more Tarantino hack and slash fun. I can only pray that this becomes Tarantino's ""Bond"" series where he makes a new installment every few years.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 10/10 but no matter how you cut it, A+, 100%, this is an amazing effin movie."

It's kind of like a stylish homage to his many influences:old Kung Fu movies, Hong Kong action flicks,Anime, and Spaghetti Westerns, and the cool dialogue you've come expect from Taratino.

There were so many subtle and not so subtle references to grade B action flicks even I may have missed a few.  I clapped at the opening splash on the screen that said ShawScope.  What a wonderful tribute to Hong Kong cinema.  Every scene was complete within itself.  The audience knew what to expect from seeing the thousands of films to which this one paid tribute.  Quentin delivered what the audience expected and what they wanted, but he did it better an more stylishly than they could have hoped for.

","What is there to say? This is obviously an homage to all b-movies, especially to the actor, Bruce Lee.  The yellow jumpsuit, the Cato outfits, the philosophical dialogue.  The humor was excellent but was not force-fed like every movie nowadays.  The action sequences are well choreographed and are actually fresh and new for once instead of bullet-time or just guns in general.  Compared to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, this is right up there in my opinion. I respect everyone's opinions except for those that come from crass critics; they have probably been nose-deep in trash for so long that they forgot what a good movie is like. This movie is not going to make you scratch your head; its just great fun with humor if you can stomach spewing blood and the occasional decapitation. I recommend:.:Cowboy Bebop:.if you can watch anime, this is very close to the style and characters of Kill Bill. This isn't Dragon Ball Z or Pokemon anime though; if you watch the first 5 episodes of Cowboy Bebop, you'll swear Kill Bill is a prelude to Cowboy Bebop. You won't be sorry for going outside the box."
"fred-287","Null","1","2","10 October 2003"," A review-proof movie?
","If you've been alive and conscious in this country for the last few months, you will have seen ads and/or the trailer for ""Kill Bill"" and/or articles in magazines/newspapers/the Internet and/or interviews with/appearances by Mr. Tarantino, Ms Thurman et al.  (Mr. Tarantino was on Jimmy Kimmel's show just last night, impishly suggesting 12-year-olds should pay to see ""Good Boy"" then sneak into his movie.)  So everybody who would see it anyway knows what it's about and what Mr. T's trying to achieve.  Just as J.D. Salinger recommended decades ago that a writer should write what in his heart he most wants to read, Mr. T makes the movies he most wants to see.  I think he thinks his fans will also like it or will come around eventually, and to hell with the critics altogether.  So, did I like it?  Well, this is the first movie I've seen in years that I was actually sorry to see end. Would I recommend it?  Well, remember the ads: what you saw there is what you get in the movie, and then some, and then some more ....<br/><br/>If this movie becomes a huge hit, I hope Ms Thurman will get the credit she deserves.  I was never a huge fans of hers before: another wan pallid languid blow-away-in-a-breeze blonde ingenue type, she struck me as being. I figured the brilliant performance Tarantino extracted from her in ""Pulp Fiction"" was the exception proving the rule.  Well, pass me the seasoned salt so I can eat my crow, because Thurman blew me away in this.  She now has the life-experience in her face that wasn't there before, physically she's at her peak from all that martial-arts training, she invests every line reading and every facial expression with just the right degree of oomph.  Tarantino called her a ""goddess"" recently.  In Europe she would be, benefiting from the reverence and great parts written for mature women over there.  Here?  Older actresses practically need their own production companies to get something other than the ""Honey, is everything okay?"" parts.  (Mid-thirties is ""older"" for Yank actresses, sorry to say.)<br/><br/>Don't want to slight the rest of the cast, we just don't see much of them except for the priceless Lucy Liu, who lets her iconic character exude a kind of sad resonance.  Viveca Fox is just a shade too ""Yo, wussup"" at times but then that's how Quentin wrote it, reminding us how he's ""down with the brothas.""  (Amazingly, there wasn't a single ""Nigger"" in his script--er, excuse me, ""N-word."")   Fun to see the legendary Sonny Chiba in a semi-comedic wise-elder role, & the Japanese thugs (male and female) are all appropriately over the top. Barely recognized Darryl Hannah behind her eye-patch, which of course had a red cross on it when she was impersonating a nurse.<br/><br/>Tarantino still eschews a straight linear narrative style, opening this story immediately after a mass murder (just as ""Reservoir Dogs"" opened immediately after a botched bank robbery) and then bouncing back and forth in time, assisted by old-fashioned ""chapter headings.""  He immerses himself in his usual trash-pop culture (mostly Japanese this time around) and displays the casual technical craftiness of a master as his camera follows people up and down stairs, into and out of rooms, up to ceiling level or down on the floor, plus the standard eye-blink editing sequences favored nowadays.  And some of his imagery is just plain gorgeous, like when the bloodsoaked tea room gives way to the hauntingly serene fake-snow nightscape.  As always, he finds the music he wants.  (Nothing by Shona Knife, unfortunately.)<br/><br/>A word about the violence: okay, yeah, it's violent---well, what were we expecting?  But not nearly as violent/gory as it could have been. There's an entire sequence done in animation and another one that eases into black and white at a crucial moment.  He deliberately uses the old-fashioned ""squibs.""  (Imagine if Kubrick had done a decapitation, how scientifically accurate it would've been.)  He manages to make his violence both painful and stylized, even weirdly playful at times.  There's nothing here like the ""sick"" atmosphere that many people seemed to think was the end of civilization in the recent ""House of 1000 Corpses,"" which actually had less violence/gore than ""Kill Bill.""   Tarantino makes it clear this is a capital-B-Movie (with modern production values, of course)--a B-with-Balls. But I hope people also notice what a strong moral sense he has.  I think it was no accident he used the term ""medieval"" in ""Pulp Fiction.""  Remember the sequence beginning with the orderly and the big redneck entering Thurman's room, with the dialogue gradually revealing what's been going on over the four years of her coma.  We see evil, and we see it get punished.  He doesn't think he has to spell it out for us.<br/><br/>There's already controversy over the decision to divide this flick into two parts released several months apart.  Personally I would've preferred one long movie with an intermission, to preserve the sweeping scope and emotional build-up, but I understand why these decisions get made.  It wasn't that long ago that ""Once Upon a Time in America"" got butchered by businessmen contemptuous of the attention span and receptivity of the American MTV generation.  If this is what it takes so we can see all the movie that Tarantino wanted us to see, so be it.  He knows a lot is riding on this flick--he even kids it with the introduction ""The 4th Film of..."" (Actually it's four-and-a-quarter if you count his contribution to ""Four Rooms,"" which would've been a lot better if he'd directed the whole thing.) He knows he's like the new Orson Welles who never went to film school or ""worked his way up"" through the biz.  He knows the burden of having adjectives made out of his name, viz. ""Tarantino-esque"" or ""post-Tarentino."" He's heard all the personal crap & gossip about him.  Well, he shrugged it all off and now tells us ""Here's my movie, go see it if you want to.""  I for one think you should, even if you weren't ""into"" his stuff before.  For sheer joyous audacious exuberance in filmmaking, there's no one like him today.  And remember people, if we don't support him he may have to go work (aaarrrgh) OVERSEAS.  He's ONE OF US, dammit, and I want him here.<br/><br/>
Why hasn't Michael Parks had more work over the years?  Bless Tarantino for remembering people like him and Robert Forster (""Jackie Brown"") and as far as I'm concerned, John Travolta should be sending Tarantino a Christmas card every year, preferably with a check in it...."

","A lot of people have been waiting a long time for this film (actually, two films) and it just isn't up to snuff. Just as the long awaited Star Wars prequel was long on style/graphics and short on just about everything else, this film can boast immense bloodletting, excellent music and style, but fails to actually be a good film. Only in a completely desensitized culture can the violence BE the plot.

"MovieGod14918","5","1","2","10 October 2003"," Pop-culture trash; not up to Tarantino's par.
","Tarantino's latest offering Kill Bill Vol. 1 comes up just short of good. The same filmmaker that wowed audiences with movies like Pulp Fiction, and Reservoir dogs has only disappointed this fan with what seems to be the same Kung Fu style action you can find just about anywhere else these days, but with the trademark gore that is Tarantino's flare. Flash forwards and backwards to piece together what seems to be a pretty flimsy plot thus far are much less confusing than in pervious movies, and therefore less entertaining. It almost seems that instead of making a movie he thought was good, and letting the fans decide if they like it, he is instead playing to the masses. Tarantino uses violence in most of his movies to get you to pay attention to major advances in the plots, in this movie the violence seems never-ending, an ongoing barrage of knife fights, sword fights, Kung Fu fights and even some decapitation. It used to stand that if I wanted mindless action I could go to any run-of-the-mill action movie in a theatre and sit and be bored with explosions, gunfights, and blood, but if I wanted action and something to think about I could check out a Tarantino film. Sadly this is no longer the case, and I must again reiterate how disappointed I was with this film. And if you are still in a deciding in your own mind if they decided to split this movie up to make more money by making you want to pay to see the ending, or if they thought it was just good film making, your question will be answered in the last line of the movie that closes on what is a soap opera worthy cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Over all 5/10, Tarantino's standards should be higher than this, check it out only to see the decline of a great filmmakers career that started just a decade ago."
"CareySandwich","10","1","2","9 October 2003"," Review of this film's madness
","(warning- this review includes speculative comments about the director's sanity that are intended to be humorous exaggerations. This critic actually knows nothing about diagnosing any mental inbalance.)<br/><br/>What can I say about Kill Bill Vol. I  that hasn't already been said by hellacious hallucinations of a blood-soaked hobits dancing outside our windows late at night?  For starters, it took everything that we thought we knew about what a movie is (which used to be something along the lines of a 2 hour visual narrative) and slam-dunked it into a small hoop that is hanging up on the door that separates insanity from hundreds of gallons of fake blood. Let me first get one thing out of the way to either entice or warn you off, depending upon what tickles you fancy: this movie is violent. It's easily Quentin's most violent work to date, and considering the fact that his movies are generally as violent as it gets, I'd say this movie hits close to being the most violent film of all time. Unfortunately, in my infant hours of having seen Kill Bill, that is really the only thing about the movie that I can be sure of. So if you're waiting for me to tell you what the movie was like, apart from the extreme violence, you'll have to settle for whatever descriptions can escape this speechless critic's brain. A decent jumping off point would be try to imagine Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon meets Army of Darkness and you have a small picture of what this movie is like. I, for one, have never seen ANYTHING like Kill Bill. Not in the movies. Not ANYWHERE. It doesn't even resemble a movie in any sense that we're familiar with. It's more like a 2-hour collection of footage depicting the revenge agenda of an un-named Uma Thurman character who has gone through hell, and will gladly go through more hell just to collect her vengeance. That essentially sums up the plot in its absolute entirety. Uma Thurman basically is on a mission for revenge and kills everything she sees. That's really all that happens in the movie. A great deal of the film is exposition, and the back story is pounded so well into us that even we are itching for Bill (whoever he is) to taste the wrathful vengeance of Uma Thurman (whoever she is).  All things considered, there is really nothing for us to work with apart from our crash course in revenge seeking, dazzling visual texture, and half-hour fight scenes. Some might argue that this movie is nothing more than eye-candy, giving us a long awaited taste of the interesting things that Quentin does with the camera. Whether or not this is true, nobody can deny that--if nothing else--Tarantino is the most interesting director of our time as far as seeing how his movies will look on the screen. His style is so independent of convention that, if I had never heard of Quentin Tarantino, I would be pretty sure after seeing Kill Bill that he has never SEEN a single movie in his life. Unfortunately, we happen to know that he is an accomplished filmmaker, which means that the only explanation for Kill Bill's madness would have to lie within the apparent madness of its maestro. And this movie is so bizarre, that if I (and I happen to be a huge 'tino fan) saw Quentin Tarantino on the street, I would avoid eye contact and try to walk in the other direction without calling attention to myself. Because he's not sane. And anybody who thinks otherwise needs to sit down and watch Kill Bill, and remind themselves that the art came from within the mind of the artist.<br/><br/>If you're upset because this review didn't help you much with deciding weather or not you want to go see this movie, I apologize fully and offer the following question: do you think you can handle it? Because if you're going to see this movie, you have to be ready to take lots of things with a grain of salt. If you're a film student, or consider yourself a film buff, this movie is absolutely mandatory. I, for one, found myself desperately not wanting this movie to end. Kill Bill was entertaining, and without question, the most interesting experience I've ever had at a movie theatre. Good Luck."
"dbstrutt","6","1","2","9 October 2003"," Fight porn
","Fight porn is what this movie is. Not a lot of dialogue, not much plot, not much character development, but plenty of money shots. The action is relentless so I'm sure a lot of people (read: guys) will love this movie. It is not a classic though. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were definitely better movies, as they had unforgettable characters and terrific dialogue, and great music too. This one has lots of swordplay and spurting blood. There are a few laughs along the way as well, with some interesting use of music, so it is a fair effort."

","10 out of 10.  The hype was deserved this time.  Best film I have seen in years - can't wait for volume two.  I don't remember an entire audience clapping at the end of a film before!  It's Pulp Fiction meets the martial arts genre crossed with Reservoir Dogs meets a western.  Violence, humour, amazing looks, great dialogue, superb soundtrack, fabulous direction and brilliant choreography.  Tarantino takes inspiration from everywhere and creates a fantastic blend of over the top violent stylish entertainment. The casting is perfect.  Uma carries the film so well - she portrays the pain and anger from the brutal storyline so well.  And Lucy Lui is terrific as the murderous Yakuza boss.  There is so much action and some of the best (and most bloody) fight scenes I've seen.  Thankfully the wire fu is kept to a minimum.  Warning - expect a lot of blood - a real lot of blood. Spraying blood from severed limbs and heads.  But it's done with great comic book style.  Don't go if you dislike violent movies but if you don't mind them, then do see this movie.  Some may say the plot is thin or there is not enough dialogue but this is a film where style over substance really works. Another masterpiece from Tarantino...."
"Monzanoman","1","3","12","8 March 2005"," Is this movie worth the 8.3 rating people gave it?
","I rate this movie 1 out of 10 because of the fakeness this movie provided. The special effects were awesome but the story had no real plot other than revenge. Uma certainly gets her revenge but it's a bloody squirting revenge. I don't take movies to seriously if a person is brutally beaten wakes from a coma paralyzed from the legs down and becomes this expert martial artist. What chokes me is this woman has a fight seen fighting over 40 guys all charging her with swords Uma kicks the crap out of them and has a challenge fighting the one woman. What is that all about? The movie cartoon animation is really great! I would rate the cartoon animation of this movie 8 out of 10. I wouldn't recommend this movie to someone unless they are a die-hard Karate Kid fan. I give this movie 2 thumbs down. Great action flick just not enough to get me to be a fan."

","The Bride (Uma Thurman) awakens after 4 years in a coma. It was her wedding day and she was pregnant. She was attacked and now she has no child. She's after vengeance on her attackers. She kills Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) who has since become a suburban housewife. Then we see she has already crossed out O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). Then it flashes back to the wedding and when one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) tried to kill her in the hospital. She's saved at the last minute by a call from Bill (David Carradine). The last member of the deadly viper assassination squad is Budd (Michael Madsen).<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino has created a simple action revenge movie reminiscent of the old exploitation kung fu Hong Kong action movies. This is an outrageously simplistic story that is highlighted by some great action scenes. It's a nice spin on the exploitation genre, but I don't know if it's necessary to have a two-parter. It's the only minor complaint I have about this. The story is way too simple to justify the extended running time. There are sections where Tarantino has stretched the movie a little too far. He tries his best to juice it up with some temporal juggling, mixed media, and eastern philosophy. But essentially this is an excuse to exercise some action filmmaking fetish. And it's beautiful when the action is so well done like the battle with O-Ren Ishii."

This is by no means a film for kids, not even with parental supervision. That's the only warning I'll give. And when I didn't think I was going to, I am going to see Vol. 2. The first one leaves you hanging. So, I can't wait. There were a couple questions I had, but I am sure they will explain in the sequel.

Four years later she wakes up and sets out to kill everyone who tried to kill her.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is back in full throttle!  This movie just keeps going for 90 minutes and doesn't stop.  Film references fly all over the place (love the Brian DePalma homage with the split screens) and there's virtual non-stop action.  Thurman's fight with Vivica A. Fox is fast and violent. Even better is her trying to get to Lucy Liu and having to cut her way through (literally) a few hundred guys.  Limbs go flying, people are cut in half, tons of blood goes sprewing all over...it's VERY violent.  But it's really not that bad--it's so overdone it's impossible to take seriously...I was always well aware that I was watching a movie.  <br/><br/>The acting is great--Thurman is just perfect as The Bride.  You know precious little about her but I really felt for her and cared whenever she was hurt in battle.  Fox is great and Liu is controlled but very good.  Also it's great to HEAR David Carradine (you don't see him), see Daryl Hannah and Julie Dreyfuss is just great as Sofie.<br/><br/>One complaint--Miramax cut Tarantino's film into two parts.  The original cut runs 3 hours--they CLAIMED that was too long.  Oh really?  I didn't hear anybody complaining about ""Gone With the Wind"" running almost 4 hours or the two ""Lord of the Rings"" movies each running over 3.  Miramax is just making you pay twice to see one movie--a REAL cheap stunt...I guess they're taking lessons from Disney (their parent company).  Still, don't let that keep you away.  This is a violent, bloody and absolutely fascinating movie with great acting and a good script.  What more could you ask for.  Also it's among IMDB's top 100 films...that should tell you something!"

All the characters are just wonderful, and it has some wonderful OTT violence! plus Uma Thurman is simply amazing in this!. The opening is quite grim and disturbing, and the fight scene involving Uma and the crazy eighty eights is jaw dropping!, however I wish the main fight between Black Mamba(Thurman)and O-Ren Ishii(Lucy Liu) was a bit longer, it was still cool though!. I loved the animation and all of the black and white sequences! and the scene where The Bride 1st wakes up from her long coma is quite emotional, plus all the characters are extremely likable!. The music in this is great! and the fight scene between Fox and Uma was awesome as well, plus I loved Chiaki Kuriyama's (Go Go)character!. I would rank this as Tarantino's 3rd best right behind Kill Bill 2 and Pulp Fiction! and this is extremely well written and made as well, plus you may find yourself rooting for Uma's character as I felt sympathy for her character!.<br/><br/>Michael Bowen's character Buck was absolutely despicable he truly deserved to get his head bashed in! and sometimes the violence is so OTT it's comical! plus the fight choreography was really well done!. I felt that what happened to O-Ren Ishii's parents was really sad, and I just loved the ways on how The Bride got revenge!, plus this movie deserves its place on the top 250 in my opinion!. The dialog is really cool, and the scenes involving Uma and Sonny Chiba(Hattori Hanzo) were just great, plus the swords in this movie looked so awesome!. I loved how creative and unique it was and Quentin Tarantino's direction is flawless in my opinion! plus the character development is excellent for the most part!.

This is another masterpiece from Tarantino, its one of his absolute best! with a wonderful story and top notch performances, and if you haven't seen it what are you waiting for? do so immediately! you shouldn't regret it.<br/><br/>The Direction is incredible! practically flawless for the most part. Quentin Tarantino does an incredible job here with amazing camera work, outstanding angles, great use of colors and lots of other great and stylish shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!.<br/><br/>The Acting is amazing!. Uma Thurman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always, she gives one of her best ever performances is very likable is all business, kicks that ass did fantastic in her emotional scenes was really into her role and I just loved the way on how she got revenge, she was amazing! (Uma Rules!!!!!!!). Lucy Liu is hot and had one wicked character, she was wonderfully evil but at the same time you feel for her, she can also kick that ass with the best of them! I loved her. Daryl Hannah is way hot, and also had a wicked character, I just wished she had more screen time because she was awesome!. Vivica A. Fox is very good in her scene,she is a good fighter and was menacing I liked her. David Carradine had some good dialog but we hardly ever see his face.

"Takeshi-K","Null","1","3","14 September 2017"," A mean spirited descent into cinematic sadism.
","I like violent films as long as the violence is justified. Revenge in films need to follow that same rule. The revenge in Braveheart is justified. A man kills the man that murdered his wife. An eye for an eye. The revenge in Jaws is justified. William Wallace and Chief Brody deserve our respect, because they take revenge at an equal proportion to how they and their community were wronged. The Bride in this film does not and that's why its a poor film. <br/><br/>This film goes far beyond an eye for an eye. It takes a nose dive off the sanity cliff and plummets toward a soulless sadistic endeavor made by a sadist to titillate other sadists. It advances the notion that we are meant to admire a sadist for taking out several eyes for the loss of just one eye. Its most sadistic crime is where the film attempts to actually justify forcing an innocent child to witness her own mother being butchered. The scene ends with the murderer cooing at the child as though the kid could care less what her mother's murderer thinks about anything. Kill Bill Part 2 ends with the avenging sociopath walking off into the sunset with her own daughter unscathed like she earned that ending. Yeah right.<br/><br/>In case you didn't notice, this movie is about revenge. We know this because the main character played by Uma Thurman constantly whines about deserving it. This is not a character to be admired. This is a petulant child throwing one manically violent tantrum after the next. If this film were a book it would be titled a sociopath's guide to revenge. Anyway while she was clearly wronged, the loss of just one life does not justify going on an insane rampage and killing dozens of people.<br/><br/>Let us think of the classic crime film The Godfather. A film that handles violence and revenge with complete class. The first scene introduces the code by which the mafia live by. The scene shows a man demanding revenge for his daughter being assaulted. She is still alive, but her father wants the two men responsible to die. The Godfather gives the man justice, but not to the extent that he wants. This is logical, revealing the mastery of wisdom a mafia crime boss needs to maintain his position. In Kill Bill the bride deserves revenge, but not to the extent that she wants. <br/><br/>To round out the weirdness, Uma Thurman was apparently preferred by Tarantino, since her face reminded him of the famous horse Trigger. No really.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this film is good. You have to give credit to the crew that completed their work with technical mastery. The work though is directed by Quentin Tarantino, so the real credit for his skill, lies in the artists he steals from. Go watch Thriller: A Cruel Picture (1973), which was released as They Call Her One Eye in America, which is the basis for the Daryl Hannah character (the lady with the eye patch over one eye). Or watch Lady Snowblood to see where Tarantino stole the snowy fight scene or the several Sonny Chiba films that have better fight choreography. While you're at it, ask Bruce Lee fans how they feel about his most famous costume worn by a person who cant fight, whose lack of martial skill is hidden by fast cutting, like cheap perfume hides stink.<br/><br/>No wonder Tarantino makes a film about a sociopath supposedly deserving respect for reaping much more than they sow. He has made a very successful career out of it. In an America that has teenagers committing mass murder in high schools and in a world where death cults fueled by sadistic revenge threaten to destroy us all, movies like this should never be made."

","This review contains spoilers Kill Bill Vol 1 (2003) is a genre-spanning feast for the eyes, ears, and sensibilities of film buffs as well as fans of many specific genres. At its heart it is a tale of cold revenge taken in a cause than is not really just. Killing killers who tried to kill you because you didn't want to kill people anymore doesn't exactly compare to being Robin Hood. The charm of this film is seeing how Tarantino creatively, lovingly, and nearly expertly handles his tributes to Italian westerns, Chinese martial arts films, Japanese samurai films, Brian De Palma and more. This film features all the violence that Quentin Tarantino has become associated with but in this film it is so over the top that it becomes surrealistic, easy to detach from, a simple guilty pleasure. Once you drag yourself past the notion that there could be an elite squad of female assassins all highly trained in martial arts you never again consider that fact that martial arts training would be useless to real assassins in this day and age.<br/><br/>Let's just break this film down by the numbers and let the chips fall where they may: A) Plot -- a strong revenge driven story with great character back stories succeeds well -- 9 B) Characters -- forceful, fully realized, if fanciful characters -- 9 C) Acting -- Superb and believable characterization, great action acting -- 9 D) Script -- an action driven piece rich with the now famous Tarantino dialogue. -- 9 E) Direction -- a excellent job showing mastery of western, martial arts, samurai, anime, and Brian De Palma -- 9 F) Cinematography -- stunningly captures each genre to create an artistic whole and organic feeling -- 9 G) Editing -- concise and efficient while conveying the action in a perfectly understandable manner -- 9 H) Production Design -- strong design elements lend touchstones to the various genres and give the film a natural look within highly stylized designs -- 8 I) Costume Design -- distinctive costumes enhance the characterizations in this film and a very well done despite being unobtrusive -- 8 J) Stunts -- Wire-Fu abounds as does sword and knife play; all masterfully handled -- 10 K) Special & Visual Effects -- The special effects achieved on camera are impressive when considering how many limbs must be removed and how much blood made to flow; a good job, if gruesome -- 7 L) Music -- Original music by The RZA and songs by The 5, 6, 7, 8s as well as other little known compositions work brilliantly to create and sustain moods -- 8 M) Sound -- Good level sound with no too subtle effects, balanced and clean -- 7 N) Entertainment Value -- 7 Average 8.384, call it 8 stars out of ten.

","Fans of Quentin Tarantino's unique brand of exploitation-cinema- worship were forced to wait six long years for his next movie after his underrated love-letter to blaxploitation, Jackie Brown (1997). The result was intended to be a 3 hour 'roaring rampage of revenge' but instead, thanks to the unenlightened head honchos at Miramax, Kill Bill became Kill Bill: Volume 1, a 110-minute half-movie that forced cinema-goers to pay again to see the following instalment four months later. Despite this money-making scheme that I'm sure Tarantino wanted no part of (he still refers to Kill Bill as one movie), Volume 1 is still quite brilliant.<br/><br/>Taking inspiration from the kung-fu and spaghetti western genre movies Tarantino no doubt indulged in during his time as a video store clerk (although Vol. 1 focuses mainly on the former), Kill Bill is, at times, a montage of shots, scenes and music from other movies from the 1970's. Yet Tarantino doesn't so much simply copy these films but play on our genre expectations while making it fun to test your own knowledge as a cinephile in the process. The tale is one of revenge, and a simple one at that. Tarantino has no qualms in staging Kill Bill as a one-by- one ticking-off of the bastards who wrongs our heroine, known simply as The Bride (Uma Thurman), who even carries a list of her targets and boldly strikes out their names as they fall.<br/><br/>A massacre at a wedding chapel instigated by Bill (David Carradine) and his Deadly Viper Assassination Squad sees everyone inside murdered apart from The Bride, who is shot in the head and put into a coma. Waking up four years later, she quickly sets about gaining her revenge on Bill and his four cronies - Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Budd (Michael Madsen), and the one- eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). Travelling to Okinawa in Japan, she approaches legendary samurai sword-maker Hattori Hanzo (genre legend Sonny Chiba) and talks him out of her retirement to forge her weapon of death.<br/><br/>Told in chapter form, scenes are either extremely talky or outlandishly action-packed. The quieter moments bristle with Tarantino's now- iconic dialogue, while the extended climax, taking place in a two-floor restaurant that is quickly turned into a blood bath, displays the directors then-unseen eye for action. As The Bride takes on O-Ren's gang (dubbed the Crazy 88) and her Meteor hammer-wielding bodyguard Gogo (Chiaki Kuriyama) she hacks and slices her way through them all in a moment that evokes The Matrix Revolutions of the same year, only with real people and an eye for action cinema. Its all backed by another terrific Tarantino soundtrack that is routinely pillaged by TV shows too lazy to find their own music. The ending leaves you hanging without feeling ripped off, and eager to see the final three names crossed off the list."

","Films number four and five of Quentin Tarantino's, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and Kill Bill: Vol. 2 are his most racy and daring, and easily my favourites. It's a revenge story at its greatest; Uma Thurman's The Bride (her real name's undisclosed for reasons unexplained) has a list, to kill those who've done her severe harm, starting with the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (who she was a part of), and finishing with their leader, Bill. Nothing will stand in The Bride's way, not even a mother's love for her daughter or hordes of the Yakuza. Blood is shed (lots of it), many lives are lost, all for our entertainment. The story is delivered with panache. Every character is phenomenal, Thurman's being the only we can (and want) to relate to. Vol. 1 is also a homage to Asian martial arts films. It's dark humour and outrageous gore takes the edge off what could be a serious film. Vol. 2, on the other hand, takes a different turn."

","Quentin Tarantino's action/drama Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is an edge-of- your-seat movie about love, revenge, and retribution. Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) plays the role of a bride who was wronged by her former ""friends"" and ""co-workers"" by being gunned down in the middle of her wedding in the middle of El Paso, Texas. Beatrix, known by her former team members as Black Mamba, wakes up out of her 4 year coma, realizes her child is gone, and sets out on a bloody path of killing and revenge.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a confusing battle between two people that seemingly know each other, all while being interrupted by Vernita Green's (Vivica A. Fox.) daughter. The back story of the movie picks up after this scene to bring the audience up to speed. This also reveals the ultimate prize intended at the end of this rampage, Bill (David Carradine), but not much in the way of details as to what happened, and why it happened.<br/><br/>This style of production is common throughout the film, Tarantino would show a scene or two ahead of time, and the next ""chapter"" would be the back story on what led up that specific event. Tarantino made special efforts in his production to leave story lines and plots easy to decipher, and easy to follow, but leaving out specific details to leave the viewer in suspense and wonder. This brings answers to many questions in the particular scene, but would often raise more questions.<br/><br/>Tarantino also ensured the lighting throughout the film was clean, clear, and even. In the fight scenes the lighting was not dimmed or shaded to hide flaws in the fighting, or bring mystery to scene, but was ensure to be bright and vibrant with distinct colors to being the audience's attention to the action carried out in each scene. In the final fight scene with O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), the scene was dark, but well-lit at the same time. The scene was an outdoor terrace in Japan, with a thick blanket of snow covering the ground. The elements in this scene were minimalistic, but it brought a ""clean"" feeling to the entire sequence. The overhead lighting outside was distinctly low, but also enough to bring light from the snow, and accentuate the actors and their positions. The high contrast removed distractions from the storyline.<br/><br/>The storyline had its own uniqueness, but the classic story of coming back from the (almost) dead to seek vengeance is a common theme. This reminds me of the recently released movie, The Revenant, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Tarantino did not develop a completely new storyline or theme, but his production and direction to this movie definitely made it distinct, and very fun to watch."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","1","3","10 November 2015"," One of the finest revenge movies ever made
","""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is an American action movie from 12 years ago. Now, action is usually not my favorite genre at all, but there is so much more to it. But let us start from the beginning. The writer and director is Quentin Tarantino and at 110 minutes, this one is much shorter than his more recent works. However, you could of course also see this one and the sequel as one movie and then it would be a 4-hour watch. I am truly surprised this film here did not score any Academy Award nominations, especially in categories such as Cinematography, Art Direction or Costume. It's top-notch in these areas and same goes for Thurman as lead actress. I am generally not even a big fan of her really, but she was amazing in this one. At least the Globes and BAFTAs did not overlook her.<br/><br/>This movie actually starts with the ending of the film if we take a chronological look at it with The Bride vs. Vernita. We even see in her list that she had already killed O-Ren at this point. But that is not a problem at all. This film is not about if she will succeed, but how she will succeed. We all know she won't be stopped on her path to revenge. We probably already know as well that she will kill the other guys on her list in the sequel. This was pretty interesting as the division in chapters made this a very clean-structured film, but the non-chronology messed things up again. Pretty smart move by Tarantino. I am usually more a fan of chronological films, but here it works very nicely, especially on rewatches.<br/><br/>It's obvious Tarantino had a great time making this movie. not only was he working with his muse Uma Thurman, but he could also make this a tribute to all the films and genres he loves being a film nerd himself. And there are some pretty gimmicky scenes occasionally, such as O-Ren's last words and camera shot, the one in which the Bride sends the young fighter back to his mother or when she acts really dumb before disclosing her real intention with Hanzo or the Charlie Brown joking. There are really quite a few memorable characters in here. It's not just the Bride, it's also O-Ren, Sofie Fatale, Gogo Yubari and others... This should also put an end to those criticisms saying Tarantino is not good at writing female characters.<br/><br/>The heart and soul of the film is probably the entire chapter featuring O-Ren. Everything before is good too: Vernita, the church scenes, the hospital scenes... but the Asian part of this movie is the best and the snow fight sequence at the end is a thing of beauty. Tarantino also truly managed to go out on a high note with which he made people very curious about the 2nd Kill Bill movie. I quite like that one too (and I will certainly review it at some point), even if probably not as much as I enjoy the first. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is a mesmerizing watch: great characters, excellent story and a blessing in terms of visuals. Highly recommended."
"SquigglyCrunch","7","1","3","24 October 2015"," An Excellent Action Movie
","Kill Bill is, as you can clearly tell by the title, is an action movie, mostly focused around killing Bill. It's clear with just one look at this film that it's going to be a action-packed, bloody thrill ride. And boy, it sure is. <br/><br/>Kill Bill, although somehow managing to pull off a 2 hour run time, feels too short. Not too much happens, and that's where it seems to suffer the most. It is a two-part series, so that did leave hope for more development. Still, it felt like the productiveness of the movie was lacking, and although we certainly got to witness some amazing fights, that was really about it. <br/><br/>The fights themselves, however, are great. Their bloody, fast, and very cool to watch. Fun Fact: The movie actually received an X rating (above R) for violence, and one of the final scenes had to be toned down. Tarantino did this simply by taking away the color and making the whole scene in black and white. Color or not, this was still a great scene. The action is all so over-the-top that it's actually funny, yet still so cool to watch. <br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill Volume 1 is very entertaining, and a whole lot of fun. It lacks in story and development, but if you like violent movies as much as I do, then this is certainly one you need to see. It's easily one of the best action movies out there."
"dexter-vane","10","1","3","17 May 2015"," Absolutely Love it!
","I absolutely love Tarantino's movies, so I like his style and this movie is so full of Tarantino-isms you can't even count them. This movie manages to not take itself seriously and be totally ridiculous in one scene, and then get incredibly deep and serious in the next. One of my favourite scenes is the sudden anime-part, which is absolutely beautifully done. It is incredibly fun to watch and one is still intrigued by the story, which is brought to the screen with a great cast. For me this is the perfect ""movie-night with friends"" movie, because it's also great fun to watch. All in all a must see movie, especially for any Taranino fan."
"kenyonwg","7","1","3","27 April 2015"," Tarantino blends beauty and carnage to create something just short of genius
","In Kill Bill vol. 1, Tarantino uses amazing artistic technique and cinematic skill to create some of the most poetic moments in film. However, Kill Bill is shockingly violent. Unlike Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill's violence does not always contribute to the movie's greatness. At times, the movie's carnage adds to the art, increasing the visual and emotional power of the movie. At other times, the viewer must wonder about Tarantino's intentions, as the director pours bucketfuls of blood on shiny floors. Kill Bill floats in and out of the realm of greatness, the opening scene is a symphony from Beethoven, yet occasionally Tarantino gets caught up in the carnage and the movie temporary loses everything else. That Tarantino can masterfully juxtapose this violence with his artistic ability is only half-way redeeming. The dialogue, usually good, sometimes stunning, sometimes passable, reflects Kill Bill's tentative grasp on greatness. Kill Bill is overall, a great movie that fell short of greatness, yet definitely worth the watch."
"luke-o-small","8","1","3","10 July 2014"," Another classic from Quentin Tarantino
","I have always admired Tarantino's films. I love his style of mixing engaging dialogue and melodramatic violence in producing interesting films. But for some reason Kill Bill has always been bottom of my list to watch, but I eventually got around to watching it and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Tarantino does not wait to get this film started with a very dramatic opening sequence. It opens with a fight scene, followed by a conversation that slowly reveals the plot to the viewer but keeping many things hidden, like the protagonist's name. <br/><br/>The film ends with a great fight scene, with Uma Thurman taking down hundreds of Japanese fighters with her samurai sword and eventually getting her revenge on Lucy Liu. Another thing I have always loved about Tarantino is his use of strong women to play the lead roles in his film. It is not done enough by the big Hollywood films and it's refreshing to see films that reject the clichÃ© characters of the popular movies.<br/><br/>The thing I loved about this film the most was the anime scene midway through the movie. It was done really well, with a great art style and managed to capture the violence that Tarantino captures with live action. It was a great addition to the film and shows Tarantino's love for all different types of film.#<br/><br/>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and look forward to the second instalment."
"tziembo","10","1","3","20 June 2014"," Beautifully Directed. Filled with Symbolism.
","Summary<br/><br/>This review contains **SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Kill bill Volume 1's plot can be summated simply as an assassin (Uma Thurman) who wanted to taste a life of normality. But unfortunately for Uma, she never quite developed the means to taste it. The desire was there and all the pieces fell nearly into the right place, but she just wasn't cut out for it. In a rash attempt for normalcy Uma breaks free from the team of assassins and sets out for marriage instead. Bill, who raised Uma from relatively innocent to world-class assassin, doesn't quite approve of the marriage. Bill orders the remaining of the assassins to murder her and anyone else during Uma's wedding ceremony. Bill takes special attention to finish the bride himself and somehow fails in the process after firing a bullet straight into Uma's skull; ultimately leaving her in a comatose state for six months. Upon regaining consciousness Uma sets out for revenge to murder the remaining assassins and ultimately Bill. <br/><br/>Theme From a young age Uma was trained to be a human killing machine. She was trained by Bill day in and day out teaching her everything he knew. Uma looked up to Bill and saw him as a father figure of sorts, which is something she lacked before meeting Bill. From the day Bill met Uma, or simply and often referred to as The Bride Bill has always thought of her as a natural born killer. While The Bride was trained to be the absolute and best killer on the face of the planet, at least with a sword, she no less has a conscience that struggles with who she is. She whole heartily rejects the notion of being a natural born killer, something Bill seemingly repeats to The Bride. She makes a heartfelt attempt to bail on the assassin lifestyle to seek a life or normality. But even then The Bride struggles with what and who she is: a killer, or a woman- a bride?<br/><br/>Motif and Texture It's said that a sword represents the soul of the person who carries it. Throughout the film a sword, a Japanese Katana is displayed almost as a trademark for the film. The sword carries symbolic significance in the film as it represents The Bride's dualistic nature as two sides of the blade. One side of the blade is dulled while the other is sharp, carrying its trademark sine wave pattern engraved down the sharp edge of the blade. The sharp end of the blade represents The Bride's mind; sharp and keen, but dangerous and quick to kill. The duller side represents the smooth consistency of the life she wishes to obtain through marriage. The sword being a blade represents the dualistic nature of The Bride and also her internal struggle of who she is: a killer, or a bride?"

","Action and Tarantino are essentially synonymous. You can be certain that Kill Bill: Vol. 1 has a lot of fighting and adventure in nearly every scene, even when you least expect it. <br/><br/>Waking up out of a coma for years is an immense task for anyone. Waking up out of a coma for years and then going on a rampage to seek revenge is superhuman. We follow the journey of an ill-fated woman in Kill Bill, known as the Bride, who lost everything on her wedding day including her husband, her unborn child and herself (almost). Killing people is not easy. Killing assassins...well, let Tarantino explain that. <br/><br/>Although I love Tarantino and his unique style, there were definitely moments where the filming was just not up to par with the rest of his works. The Bride is definitely an interesting character with a rich and mysterious past that we, as viewers, are constantly trying to puzzle together. The enigmatic theme surrounding this film definitely adds to its suspense as well. With all this taken into consideration, I would have to say that Tarantino made a fine action film. <br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill is a solid movie. If you're looking for a fun film and want to fill the next two hours of your life with intense yet comical fighting, this is the movie for you."
"wiseguymattt","8","1","3","21 September 2013"," Another Favorite from Tarantino
","This was the film that got me on the trail that I've been on for a few years now. And that's understanding how Tarantino comes up with such clever dialogue and crafting villains that we both despise and cheer for. I found myself sympathizing with O-Ren. Her story was a sad one. Even more tragic that she was dragged into the whole fiasco with the Bride. If it wasn't for that O-Ren Ishii would still be ruling over the Crazy 88's. Then again, that would totally change the story and interrupt the purpose of the film. <br/><br/>Considering there are two Kill Bill films, I felt this one set the stage perfectly for the second. In this film, we really get to know The Bride and discover the atrocities committed against her. As an audience, we discover why she is on such a blood-thirsty rampage. You will find yourself at the edge of your seat cheering for the woman in the bright yellow track suit. Her exceptional skills with the blade are left unexplained--which should make you more curious. Do they reveal that in the second? What is her past with Bill? <br/><br/>Back to Kill Bill Vol. 1... Watch as the warrior within grows and the attitude goes cold towards killing. The Bride is out for blood. And she'll be damned if anyone gets in the way of her revenge."
"videorama-759-859391","9","1","3","20 August 2013"," Bad Bill rocks, and so does this movie
","This movie is something of an event, a precious masterpiece, a revenge driven tale. Compared to number 2, you wonder why this one's so violent, but lovers of gore will lap it up here, as there's plenty. Quentin has sprung back from his Jackie Brown failure, leaps and bounds, which apparently got him depressed, and for many reasons I can see why. In this dynamite violent movie, extravaganza, violence in abundance, he should have a lot to be happy about. Again it's first rate story telling, as our surviving heroine, Thurman, exacts revenge on her bunch of operatives, led by her husband Bill, (Carradine, who unfortunately you'll only see in Volume 2), responsible for shooting her down and killing her baby. We have elongated scenes, essential to the story, that QT knows how to make interesting, including that insignificant CU shot on a cup of coffee. The characters of this elite squad are larger than life, better than the super heroes you worship. Like Carradine, Michael Madsen almost ceases to exist here, seen briefly in two, three shots, bringing one memorable and inspirational line to this explosively exciting flick, a cinema must see. The sword fighting is great and going on Beatrice's (Thurman's) quest of vengeance as if riding alongside is an experience itself. I love revenge tales, but this unhurried one is so well told, where we're never see another genius story teller like this, at least for the next hundred years. Oh, did I forget to mention the QT humour, yes it's back, in check. This movie is such an impressively, colorfully violent tale, which makes nights at the movies what they really should be. The great Parks, playing his From Dusk Till Dawn character, makes an appearance, while in Voulme Two, he plays a Mexican brothel owner, really showing us what character's acting about. The music's great in this, with QT borrowing an old classic in it's opening after Thurman's execution, where an old proverb precedes this. The final fight scene, in the Chinese snow garden, is just typical of Tarantino, and his classic wit, in a film, void of any dull moment."

Plus when she was talking about the head of the Oran. The Fight scene at the end was not the greatest ever, but this was an OK film.

At the time, the gore and violence was a bit extreme (not unheard of, just not as common as it is in films today) and it took awhile to get used to. I had to watch it several times to come to love it the way I do now. Tarantino is a genius and one of my all time favorite filmmakers on earth. His mind is simply genius. <br/><br/>Kill Bill is about an ex assassin who had a formal love relationship with her leader, Bill, that resulted in a pregnancy. To protect the baby, the Black Mamba fled the team and was about to get married to a safe guy when Bill shows up on the night of the rehearsal dinner with the team and they kill everyone.

The soundtrack is also notable, mainly for its strangeness. Stylistically it's goofy as heck, but it's that zany Tarantino humor that truly makes the audience laugh out loud. There are a couple of issues I have with writing here and there, but it's easy to forgive these faults for the rest of the adventure is nutty and incredibly entertaining. <br/><br/>It's safe to say that it is one of the most entertaining flicks (if you don't mind gallons of red paint) ever crafted, one that confines itself to no boundaries and leaves no stone unturned in The Bride's quest for revenge."
"charlessmith702210","9","1","3","8 April 2013"," If you love the ""Death Wish"" movies, you will like this movie-spin off saga
","The way I see Uma Thurman play ""The Bride"" in this action-packed, martial arts movie was not exactly clear-cut. But thinking about all of the Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish"" movies, I think ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" was a definite allusion to the ""Death Wish"" movie saga.<br/><br/>The gist of the story focuses mainly on The Bride, who survived a mob hit by several members of an assassination squad which included Cottonmouth, which killed 9 members of a wedding party at a church, with the Bride being a sole survivor.<br/><br/>After waking up from the near-death attempt by this killing squad, she recalls all of the names of the five people involved, including Cottonmouth.<br/><br/>Then, the focus goes right into The Bride's main death wish as revenge for the murder attempt on her by this squad--more specifically, to make a hit on the character, Cottonmouth, also known as O-Ren Ishii. The rising tension of this focus on three main thoughts by The Bride.<br/><br/>1. The Bride narrates a bit of the past on O-Ren, who grew up in a nasty Japanese culture of the Yakuza mob, and was able to kill off some of her family members by surprise when they caused O-Ren trouble in the past. Then the Bride said that she went up to the ranks to become one of the top assassins, and then was accepted into the 5-person death squad later on who almost killed her.<br/><br/>2. Next, the Bride then heads off to Okinawa to meet up with Hattori Hanso, at his sword-smith's place, and even with her not-so-perfect Japanese, she was able to get from Hanso the weapon that will also be a focus for the sequel, Kill Bill vol. 2--a long sword hand-made by him called a katana, which was used in both samurai and ninjitsu martial arts in Japan.<br/><br/>3. Then, just before the showdown at the House of Blue Leaves as the Bride comes to Tokyo, where O-Ren was, the Bride narrates the main people in O-Ren's mob, like Charlie Mo and his Crazy-88 fighters, and Gogo, O-Ren's bodyguard. Also mentioned is Boss Tanaka, who mentions O-Ren's translator, Sophie, about being a half-prostitute during a mob council, just before O-Ren quickly decapitates Tanaka for mentioning that..to tell how evil O-Ren is.<br/><br/>To set up the end of O-Ren, The Bride kidnaps Sophie, presents her to O-Ren, and then, slashes one of Sophie's arms off to provoke O-Ren to the Bride's final series of fights. With that, the Hattori Hanso sword is her angel as she kills off about 15 fighters, almost get killed by Gogo's markiri (spike-laden meteor attached with chain) but still gets a chance to finish off Gogo, and kills off or maims 80 more fighters, including Charlie Mo.<br/><br/>Then, the final duel between O-Ren and The Bride takes place. O-Ren sees the Hanso sword the Bride has, and says that sword was a fluke. As the fight starts, O-Ren's katana was good enough to slash the Bride to a near kill...but the Bride then gets up, and then, the Bride finally slashes one of O-Ren's legs. O-Ren then says sorry for persecuting the Bride, and then the fight continues, and then, the Bride finally kills off O-Ren with a slash that cuts off half of her brain. O-Ren realizes, as she falls and dies, that the Hanso sword was real after all.<br/><br/>Then, the Bride stands in a redemption prayer pose as snow falls in what was O-Ren's big yard of the house.<br/><br/>The final part focuses on the Bride's warning to Sophie--if you do not tell all of the information on the rest of the assassination squad, Sophie will end up like what happened to Cottonmouth. The Bride then takes a jet out of Tokyo and revises the death list, marking off Cottonmouth to indicate that she was killed, and targeting the main person on her death list for the movie's sequel--which is Bill."

","Do you like references? Are you a fan of martial arts films from the 70's? Do you like blood and gore? If yes to all these, then you have probably seen this film. If no, then this isn't really a film for you.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino has a tendency to make non-linear films, and he does them very well. 'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is no different to most of his films. It features heavy amounts of gore and a very, very interesting story. I don't know what it is about the story in this film which makes it different though. Maybe it's because, unlike his other films, the non-linear aspect is very straight forward and links beautifully to the character's own development. <br/><br/>Talking about character, my god this film has beautiful characters. Uma Thurman is actually rather striking. Although the film starts with her more innocent side it quickly morphs into her violent, no mercy side. Such dynamic emotion is very well done and written. Also, the cold- hearted nature of Bill is creepy yet you feel empathy for him when he communicates with the assassins. <br/><br/>Cinematics now; the 1970's martial arts style taken on actually adds beautiful comedy to the otherwise very serious mix. For instance, whenever The Bride sees one of her assailants the screen goes red, klaxons go off and it cuts to a flashback. Moments like that just make me wanna go ""F*** YEAH!"". The use of ""swooshy"" and ""punchy"" fighting sound effects sound so cheesy yet so satisfying. My favourite sequence: the end massacre, when O Ren and The Bride fight in a snow covered Japanese garden.<br/><br/>The shortcomings are the same as the things which make it brilliant. At times it just feels like the gore is overdone plus the comedy sometimes ruins the pacing of action sequences. Although easy to overlook, these can ruin the experience for some.<br/><br/>So, 8/10 overall. Good-looking, good fun and good god with a bit of a ruined experience at times. Good show!"

","Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a Quentin Tarantino film that is filled with violence and bloodshed. This film begins with the bloody massacre at wedding in a church. In this massacre the pregnant bride Beatrix Kiddo played Uma Thurman, is shot in the head by a man named Bill, played by David Carradine whom is not shown. Kiddo then awakes in a hospital four years later to with no child. Kiddo then kills the attending nurse and begins her hunt for the person responsible for the massacre at her wedding. It is then learned that Kiddo was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and she begins to hunt and kill the other members and the employer of the Squad named Bill, whom was the father of her child.<br/><br/>The theme of this film is that a mother will avenge the death of close family and that of her child if they are taken from her. Throughout the film the theme is recurring because the film progresses through the journey that Kiddo takes to avenge the death of her child. Bill had ordered the massacre because Kiddo had left him and tried to secretly marry another man. Bill had ordered the massacre because of Kiddo's betrayal. In the beginning of the film a scene shows that Bill had intended to kill Kiddo if she only awoke from her coma. <br/><br/>The fight scenes in this movie have similarities to kung-fu with highly choreographed actions. The violence throughout the films is also similar to other Tarantino films such as Pulp Fiction. The editing of the film plays into the lineage of the plot because it shows the movie progress and answers questions that arise throughout the film. Shifting from time lines past, present and future show the progression of the film while showing understanding of the plot. <br/><br/>In one of the out of sequence killings Kiddo is shown slaying Vernita Greene played by Vivica A. Fox. Kiddo kills Greene in front of Greene's daughter and tells her that she could seek revenge if she wanted when she became an adult. This plays back into the theme because it shows the true devotion of revenge of a mother to kill another mother in front of her own child. This scene personifies the theme and shows the true meaning of ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."""

","The most visceral, nonstop, gladly wanton orgy of violence I've ever seen, not to mention one hell of a stylish compilation of influence and homage. Like a cinematic Wanderlei Silva, this is an action picture that just does not stop throwing haymakers until it's finished, and I love it for that simple-minded dedication to its own nature. Uma Thurman is surprisingly well suited for the role of the double-crossed professional killer on a blood vendetta, as she rampages from one gory smackdown to the next without lifting her icy mask for more than a wink and a nod. The plot is simple enough, with Thurman literally carrying a list of the five heads she's out to collect with her from scene to scene, but doubles down on thick atmosphere and detailed dossiers on every major player. Though it's sliced in half with all the abruptness of a katana slash, the story's split doesn't bother me a bit; in a way it's an appropriate intermission, as the two very different halves are able to stand on their own without getting in each other's way. Masterfully orchestrated chaos, it's impossible to turn away from the Bride's classic exaggerated fight scene with the Crazy 88s."

"HohesC","7","1","3","17 December 2011"," Neither masterpiece nor trash, but great pop-art-entertainment.
","Kill Bill. I just watched it again, maybe with not enough time having passed by since my last viewing, because i could not enjoy it as much as i thought. But i was well entertained and remembered why i liked the film in the first place. So i went on to have a look at the ratings and reviews on IMDb and i was confused. There almost seem to be only two very different opinions to Kill Bill Vol.1. Whether People praise it as a masterpiece and a rating of 10/10 or they hate it and describe it as an awful movie. Neither one nor the other i can fully comprehend.<br/><br/>I think that Kill Bill, as a whole, is not exactly Tarantinos best film. In terms of putting together details, homages etc. Pulp Fiction may be better, and if it comes to good filmmaking i would always say Jackie Brown is his best film. In my opinion one major mistake was to split the film into two parts. That is probably the reason why so many people complain about Vol.1 lacking a real ""plot"". To me the two parts only make sense as one film. And i can imagine that it even would have been way better edited if it had been released as one. It could have been a great TV-series of 5 to 10 episodes, too, though. However the more serious and ""epic"" feel of the second part is a great compensation for the endless crazy-88-choreography, that really bored me to death this time.<br/><br/>Watched back to back this is still a pure Tarantino-explosion, with a great comic-book-like story. Despite all the obvious italo-western and kung-fu influences it feels like Tarantino making a graphic-novel adaption of a graphic-novel written by himself. And that's great - because it seems that this is exactly what it wants to be. And this is by far better than most of the real comic-book-movies, especially the ""gritty"" ones. I do not really understand people who claim to be fans of Tarantinos earlier work and totally dismiss this one, because it's pure Tarantino. It is pulp and it is fiction. The only difference is it is not about gangsters and idiots, it is about a straight-forward-revenge. So there is less dialog and more blood. But therefore it is bigger and splashier and you can see, that the director did not do that because he is not capable of good writing, he did it because he had great fun with it.<br/><br/>The two different kinds of reviews on Kill Bill Vol.1 reflect the two main views on Quentin Tarantino himself displayed in the comments on this site. While many people praise him to be a genius, others accuse him of having stolen all his ideas from other work and being uncreative. I grew up with his movies. Pulp Fiction was my introduction to more serious, adult and ""independet"" films. So, i loved it when i was 13. And i still loved it when i was 18 - for different reasons. And when i was 23..you get the idea. So i saw all his films, and the ones he is related to a couple of times. I can say, that i ""know"" him as a filmmaker. I know what to expect. I know that he's not a genius or a wunderkind. He's not as well educated in terms of filmmaking like a Polanski for example. He never went to a film school, so i think he ""steals"" from other movies, just like other directors ""steal"" from their teachers. He makes only the movies he wants to make, and when he has a vision he realizes it in the way he learned it. I do not see him as the visionary-super-clever-genius who is the only one who can deliver great homages to genre-cinema and film-history, but i also can not see how someone can call him uncreative or unoriginal. He is obviously a passionate, highly-creative, uncompromising filmmaker, with great technical and stylistic skills ( By the way, if you think a certain Mr. Avary was more important than Tarantino for Pulp Fiction, just look at the mess that is ""Killing Zoe"" ) and Kill Bill is another proof for that. <br/><br/>Kill Bill is not as decent and smooth floating as Jackie Brown. And it is not the reinvention of its genre and new found template for hundreds of imitations like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. But it is a great fantasy-tale about a woman, who wants nothing more than revenge until she finds out that there is something else she needs to have. And it is so great, so big, so well-made, that it is much more than just a genre-homage. That is what all the other zombie- and gore-filmmakers do. Here you have more than that. And a certain amount of quality and style. You do not have to be a die-hard-Tarantino-fan to like it, you do not have to praise him at all. You only have to like what he likes and let him have fun, so you can have fun, too. Then Kill Bill, recommended by me as a whole film, will be a great ride."

","Kill Bill Volume 1 is a really good action film. Clearly Quentin Tarantino loves martial arts films particularly the ones from Bruce Lee. It has great action scenes and amazing choreography.

"jsellers822","9","1","3","29 April 2011"," A Modern Swords and Revenge Story
","Many people who watch the film Kill Bill Vol. 1 will see it as nothing more than an action film with no artistic value. However, anyone who has ever taken a film class or who has a genuine appreciation of the artistry and thought process which goes into the making of a film will quickly recognize that Kill Bill Vol. 1 is more than a simple action film. From the very beginning the film hooks the viewers' attention. This is not accomplished with elaborate fight scenes, car chases, or explosions. Rather, a simple blank screen and a few sound effects get the viewers attention in a way seldom accomplished. <br/><br/>After the film's opening, the story proceeds in a nonlinear structure (in medias res) and tells the tale of Black Mamba a.k.a. The Bride (Uma Thurman,) thought to have been killed in the opening scene, who goes about getting her revenge on those who sought to kill her. Black Mamba spends a significant portion of the film seeking a sword which will not fail her in her quest for revenge. Almost as if she were King Author seeking the Holy Grail, Black Mamba travels to Japan to obtain a master crafted sword. <br/><br/>The theme of swords being an ""honest killer's tool"" is seen over and over as Black Mamba walks through airports, and gets on plains with hers, and no one seeming to mind. Although a sword may not be a practical weapon for an assassin, they do have a period neutral feel that coincides with many of the film's period neutral costumes. Through a series of flashbacks, information is gradually filled in providing the viewer with the story leading up to the untimely demise (or so we thought) of Black Mamba in the film's opening scene. One by one Black Mamba gets her revenge on the individuals who sought to kill her, while at the same time, seeking information as to the whereabouts of her former lover and attempted murderer, Bill.<br/><br/>The film is a period piece set in the late 1970's, or early 1980's which allows the film's creator (Quentin Tarantino) to give the film a very unique look. Many of the vehicles in the film are vintage to that time period; however, most of the character's costumes have a rather period neutral appearance to them. The occasional placement of an item from that time period provides interesting accents to the film without distraction from the films story. <br/><br/>Costumes and props aside, Kill Bill Vol.1 has many artistic traits that make it more it appears. Some viewers may not care for the film's cliff-hanger ending; however, the climatic last question posed by Bill at the film's end allows the film to end on both a high and low note. Even a person who may not be interested in action movies should view the film and try to appreciate it for its artistic value, if not for its sword-fights.<br/><br/>John Sellers"
"youngh02","8","1","3","6 February 2011"," Angry Woman
","Kill Bill Vol. 1 offers anyone who is anxious for high drama films that offer a character based theme, lots of action, and little twists along the way. Uma Thurman portrays an Bride with a vengeance throughout this film. She does not have a name throughout the whole movie. The Plot includes her attempting to seek revenge on many of her fellow assassins for trying to kill her and taking her baby. The Producer, Director, and Writer, Quentine Tarantino does an excellent job at not only offering a great single idea plot but also includes great sound effects, scene selection, background effects and lighting. One example is the angry sirens that seems to go off in the Bride's head as her anger and killing attitude begin to flare. This gives the viewer the awareness that a huge action scene is about to take place. As Quentin Tarantino did an excellent job within the same genre with Pulp Fiction, this movie will offer the adult looking for some way to vent their frustrations, a way to get out through Uma Thurman's character in the movie."
"jusco15","8","1","3","24 December 2010"," jusco's review: Kill Bill: Vol. 1
","Quentin Tarantino is one of the greatest and most consistent film directors around (don't forget eccentric). This film is no exception of the high quality expected of his works. It is easily one of his most accessible films and an exciting cinematic piece of art. The premise is simple: The Bride undertakes an epic journey of revenge, having to defeat four professional assassins before reaching her ultimate prey, that is, Bill. You have to understand, Bill had his heart broken by her, and thus he had no choice but to slaughter her fiancé, her fiancé's family, and of course, her as well (conveniently done by putting a bullet through her head). However, she miraculously survived and thus the stage is set for an ultimate tale engorged with spiteful vengeance. Honestly, I seriously doubted that I would derive any pleasurable enjoyment from this. It didn't quite sound like my cup of tea. But if you put morals aside (kids, revenge is bad), Kill Bill is a highly engrossing action-packed flick that never ceases to entertain.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman delivers a spot-on performance as the main character, angst-filled and extremely frustrated, but equipped with fierce determination. This lady means business and you know better than to get involved when she starts wielding a samurai sword, chopping limbs and heads off as if it were second nature – no, it's probably more like first nature. In Vol. 1, she faces two of the four assassins; but it is the second assassin, O-Ren Ishii played by Lucy Liu, which the majority of the film involves – an anime-style flashback sequence of her childhood is ingeniously crafted.<br/><br/>The highlight of the entire film is a lengthy fight between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii's henchmen in a Japanese-style night club, reminiscent of The Matrix Reloaded's battle with multiple Agent Smiths. It is epic. Beautifully choreographed and shot, I was unable to draw my eyes away from one of the most spectacular fight sequences I've seen. Unfortunately, The Bride and O-Ren Ishii's showdown at the end was overshadowed by this sequence; extremely disappointing but considering the rest, forgivable.<br/><br/>This is also easily one of the top three most violent, bloody and gory films I've seen. For those with weak stomachs, stay far away from this one. It is a film that glorifies the aestheticization of violence from start to finish; I wasn't able to appreciate the violent extremeness as much as other viewers or critics – which I suspect is a good thing; I haven't been fully desensitised yet – but I do understand the reason it is called stylish art. Despite being unnerving, at times it was very pretty to watch (ah, what has our generation come to, describing excessive violence as 'pretty' and 'stylish'?).<br/><br/>The film pays multiple homages to different film genres and cultures, the most apparent in Vol. 1 being Japan with samurai swords and Japanese dialogue prevalent. Tarantino's films always contain the right music, the soundtrack never failing to invoke the particular emotion he wants to draw from the audience, usually nerve-wrecking suspense, thrill and shocking excitement. When the credits came rolling on, I was a bit thrown off at the abrupt ending, even feeling rather cheated; that's it? Then I remembered this is just Vol. 1. Needless to say, I was ready and eager for Vol. 2. Bring it on, Tarantino."

"KineticSeoul","8","1","3","8 September 2010"," Stylized violence and it works
","The first vol in Kill Bill, is basically a stylized violence with a mix of many styles Tarantino is inspired by. But it's still well crafted although it doesn't have much substance and the dialogue isn't THAT great, which Tarantino films are known for. It also follows Tarantino's trademark of not going in the chronological order, which makes the film better because it gets more anticipating to find out how Uma Thurman's character got to those points. The first vol starts out with a bang, literally and metaphorically, it's action packed with a lot of blood and fighting, mainly in order to get the audiences attention. I also liked the mix of Asian cinema style in this, but gives it his own style a bit. The visual and the style is the main highlight of this movie, and it's mainly the reason I enjoyed this movie. Not one of my favorite Tarantino movie, but it's still a pretty good vengeance film.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Kill Bill, is an amazing movie. The acting and direction is perfect, and it couldn't have been any better if it weren't for Quentin and Uma. I can't imagine ANYONE else directing this, or ANYONE else playing The Bride they way both did, respectively. I know when any person first hears a movie where it's like ""okay, we've got a hot chick with weapons and she's gonna kill fifty-something people"" they think ""that sounds stupid, and predictable"" which sure, the ending may have been a little predictable, but when a movie is this good, that doesn't matter. They way Quentin puts in such tiny details yet every single one fits in with the plot somehow, and the way the fight scenes are choreographed, and how there's always a few funny lines of dialogue here and there such as the little classroom scene where The Bride's name is revealed, and how it has mixed elements of almost every different type of movie genre out there, and, ah, I don't know just everything about this movie is AMAZING, and should definitely be seen by anyone who loves these types of movies."
"gigan-92","9","1","3","24 March 2010"," Another Very Well Done Tarantino Film
","I had always heard great things about this movie, but for a long time I was hesitant. I was born in 1992, so I'm kind of back tracking threw film history so to speak. Seeing as ""Pulp Fiction"" had been so well done, I decided that this film should be just as exhilarating. And to my pleasure I must say what audiences get is a very different type of movie, let alone martial arts film. So many movies today lack any real style, this was just awesome to watch for that reason alone.<br/><br/>This movie tells a revenge story that is obviously heavily influenced by 73's ""Lady Snowblood"", and to very good effect. Tarantino shows a clear deep respect for the film, especially threw Lucy Lui's character O-Ren Ishi as well as Uma Thurman's ""The Bride"". The characters here are much better drawn out and are played very well, each with their own interesting story line. The opening fight is amazing and manages to sum up all these different emotions into the first few minutes of the film. It's quite frankly impossible not to enjoy the rest. Uma Thurman plays a character known simply as The Bride, who will have to face down some of her former allies who apparently double-crossed her for leaving the DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad). Among her foes are great actors including Vivica A. Fox and Michael Madsen, all leading up to the final confrontation with Bill, played by David Carrdine. And although you have to wait till Volume II to see that, this film sports some heavy-hitting action. It reminds you of those classic kung-fu and samurai movies done with a fresh twist that leaves you amazed really. The violence is cartoonly overdone, in the same light of many of those epic and very bloody classics. It's a factor I actually enjoy and the Crazy 88 battle is for sure one thing among many: crazy!! The music, some of which is provided by the RZA (!!), is original and I must say our director has an odd but well placed taste for this department. Along with the humor, Tarantino also does his usual out-of-sync time line gig, which is a tad distracting in this film upon first viewing, but you'll appreciate it more every time. The thing about this film is that it pays much deserved tribute to a category of films that are so under appreciated these days, to see it in American cinema done so artistically was just fresh, involving and unique. way to present"

"lewiskendell","10","1","3","13 March 2010"," Impressive Style and Substance
","The clearest indicators for how much I like a movie are these two things; how many times I can watch it in a short time period, without it losing its appeal, and the number of things in a movie that I think could be changed or removed in order to make it better. The first volume of Kill Bill does better in those aspects than any other movie I've ever seen. <br/><br/>This is the best representation of what I feel are Tarantino's best qualities as a writer and director, with not a glimmer of the (admittedly minor) problems I can have with him. The soundtrack is stylish, cool, and fits every scene like a glove. The action shifts tone from brutally realistic, to gloriously over-the-top, while always perfectly complimenting the story being told. The cast is perfect. The characters are memorable. The story is simple, but effective, and the manner in which it is told only serves to enhance it. <br/><br/>There's no other way to say it, I simply love the movie. Others may not agree, and I certainly acknowledge that Kill Bill Volume 1 may not appeal to everyone, but I don't think I'll ever be able to get enough of it. This is my favorite movie, ever."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","1","3","21 January 2010"," Tarantino Introduces One of Cinema's Most Unforgettable Action Heroine
","Tarantino gives us one of the most memorable action heroines in the history of cinema. She goes by the names Black Mamba, The Bride, Beatrice Kidda...and more. While the first movie sets up the scene, offering plenty of awesome action sequences, the second movie takes the time to develop the character (but more on that later on). While 'Kill Bill Vol 1' follows the similar 'trademark' that made Tarantino popular, that is, mixing moments of clever and amusing dialogues with sudden action sequences (e.g. 'Pulp Fiction', 'Deathproof'), one of the many reasons why I think he's a great filmmaker is because, most of the time, he stays true to the characters. At first glance, some of them might appear formulaic but then the viewer notices that there's more than what meets the eyes. His films often have strong female characters and 'Kill Bill' is no different. Uma Thurman is an excellent choice and she immortalizes Black Mumba by making the character unforgettable. Darryl Hannah and Vivica Fox are just as convincing as her badass nemeses. Lucy Liu is good too but I thought she could have breathed more fire to make O-Ren Ishii more convincing. On the technical side, the soundtrack has almost always been a plus in Tarantino's films and 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' has some great music. The cinematography, animation and editing are top notch. The director was clearly influenced by various kinds of cinema (Japanese martial arts, Italian cinema, Brian de Palma's thrillers and many Western classics) and with 'Kill Bill' he pays homage to those filmmakers. All in all, this is one kickass film with a lot of action, emotion, violence, humour and culture. What more can one ask for where entertainment is concerned. Now I'm off to watch Vol. 2."
"thesar-2","9","1","3","26 November 2009"," You and I have some unfinished business
","There are so many things right about Kill Bill Vol. 1, but let me focus on one of the best aspects: Tarantino makes you so enthralled, you want more. So much more.<br/><br/>One of my biggest complaints about movies is the length and not knowing when to shut up. (Rarely, will I say the opposite, though Children of Men needed to be so much longer, or a series.) Heck, I've even complained about other Tarantino movies being too long. (Inglourious Basterds) But, Vol. 1 is just perfect in pacing and longing. He masterfully made us wanting more, or, Vol. 2. And I'm not just talking about the absolute spoiler in the final few seconds. The whole thing seems quick enough with barely a down minute and gives enough background to know there is so much more to this story line.<br/><br/>Plot line: ""The Bride"" is immediately ""assassinated"" in the opening and immediately reveals her unborn baby is the ultimate killer, Bill's. Then the movie moves fast-forward, reverse and in-between, much like Tarantino's other work, i.e. Pulp Fiction. It's not easy for the average movie-goer, but I felt he made it a lot smoother, and easier to follow this time around.<br/><br/>Tarantino gives enough background on what led her to the El Paso church where she ultimately ""died"" and why she eventually wakes from a four-year coma to seek revenge on the five responsible for her and her unborn child's attempted murder.<br/><br/>In Vol. 1, you get to see her vengeance on Green (Fox) in front of Green's daughter – spoiler alert, this is supposedly the setup for a Vol. 3 in years to come, and Ishii (Liu.) In between, she kicks some ass on bystanders and loyal gang members.<br/><br/>This movie is Tarantino at his best. The best he wants to be: a Grind-House voyeur. An excellent story-teller. You can't take this movie seriously. It's silly in a lot of ways, but that's the Grind-House in Tarantino. And this leads me to another fantastic quality of Vol. 1: Thurman.<br/><br/>Despite the foretold silliness, Thurman as ""The Bride"" does an excellent job, and in my opinion, at least an Oscar-Nominated acting job. She brought extreme realism to an otherwise campy character out for revenge. And, you wanna know another perfect quality about her? Tarantino makes you root for her despite her being a ruthless assassin. A real bad-ass-gal.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much about the plot, subplots or scenes in the movie, but almost everything works in this movie: Music, score, style, acting, originality, suspense, action, cinematography, dialogue and uses of both color, B&W and anime. This is Tarantino at the top of his game.<br/><br/>To expand: I loved this movie. The action was tight; the movie was extremely well paced. The music, both score and soundtrack was wonderful. The choreographed scenes were fun to watch. The twists exciting. The dialogue and writing was pitch-perfect. I would say this was his best work, if not for his even better earlier works (Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs) or movie to come: Vol. 2.<br/><br/>Just remember the origins of this movie: it's basically an explicit Japanese exploitation martial arts/revenge movie and you can get past the silliness, the plot-holes, such as how she always seemed to have money and no one ever investigated her murders, i.e. Buck during her multi-hour recover scene (speaking of which, why were her upper muscles so accessible while down-below were so, well, weak?) Word of advice: don't look too deep, enjoy the master Tarantino and sit back, have fun and look forward to the (so-far) conclusion in Vol. 2."

Non-stop pounding, sword dicing action that only here to please you one thing for you viewing pleasure.... The Art Of Action! Kill Bill Vol.1 contains a simple but yet very complex tale of revenge themed movie that sets out what it sets out to do. To Kill Bill. And yes. Violence everywhere. Guts spilling off. Limbs flying god knows where. Swords swooping. A** kicking on every scene. Every shot, every scene are executed extremely well. Incredibly stylized visuals and camera movements that honors every influence that Tarantino watched when he was learning how to do films on his own. I mean not just taking stuff from the West but from East as well. Marrying together to make a well crafted action film though with slightly depth in the story telling and plot.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman eventually did an amazing job playing the character of the no nonsense ex-assassin on a mission bloody violence and revenge for the one he loved the most. The other rest of the cast also did very well in their performance. Lucy liu should be credited too. Angela Basset was really convincing in this role as both a mother and a assassin which to me spells as a no brainer but delightfully it did balanced well. While not much to say about this part of Kill Bill, there are a few scenes where the movie reveals some details and backgrounds of some the characters. Though I've said there's not much we can talk about in this part. Its more action driven and a feast for the visuals. All I can give you based on what I felt, revenge is best served cold fellow audience! <br/><br/>Rated 8.5 out of 10"

","The Kill Bill movies are two of my personal favorites for the simple reason that they are FUN to watch. All of the characters are well-developed and likable, and the acting is great. Uma Thurman was perfectly cast as ""The Bride"" and the late David Carradine does an excellent job as Bill (At least, for the few times we see him).<br/><br/>All of the assassins that go after the main character in this all have their own personalities and characters, which is something you seldom see in an assassin/revenge film. Most of the time all the assassins are virtually identical, maybe with a few minor differences. But in the Kill Bill movies, that's not the case. There's Budd, who is basically a stereotypical redneck, Vernita, a very aggressive vixen who looks like an innocent stay-at-home mom at first sight, Gogo, a seemingly sweet little school girl with a nasty weapon, and many other unique assassins.<br/><br/>From everything I have said so far, this sounds like nothing more than a normal old revenge action film that just so happens to have good acting. But believe me when I say that there is a lot more to this movie (and the next) than that. I could type much more to convince you of this, but you need to see the movie for yourself. You won't regret it."

"Prestige_Never_Pride","9","1","3","25 April 2009"," Kill Bill...and kill him good!
","What a spectacular, dazzling piece of cinema genius! I had known about this film for years, and I regret that I waited so long to watch it! One of the first of its kind, taking samurai flicks, adding a hint of secret agent assassin into the mix, clash cultures between America and Japan, famous director Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), and this is the result.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a woman who is referred to as ""The Bride"" (her real name is not revealed in this movie) because the lethal hit-man (and hit-women) league known as ""The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"" killed the pregnant former-assassin at her own wedding, led by Bill: the insane, yet mysterious leader of the Squad, which The Bride was once a part of. Instead of killing her like they thought, she instead went into a coma, not reemerging until 4 years later, when she vows for revenge for her and her unborn child, which she assumed had died.<br/><br/>So, The Bride makes her way down (or up, if you like) her hit-list, starting with the gorgeous yet deadly O-Ren Ishii (played by the dazzling Lucy Liu): a Japanese-American who took down almost the entire Yakuza gang in her ultimate quest for power. Slowly, she works way up the list, which continues in Kill Bill Volume 2, until the final showdown with her ex-boss and former lover, Bill. <br/><br/>The cast was stunning. Only Uma Thurman could've played the beautiful but deadly hit-woman who takes it upon herself to brutally slaughter every last one of her betrayers. Lucy Liu was fantastic. Beautiful, graceful, and exceptionally frightening in terms of swords. She pulled off the Japanese Goddess of Swords very well. Vivica A. Fox, who we first see as ""Copperhead"" (her real name was Vernita), isn't seen very much overall, but the way in which she is seen is exceptionally good. She has a great sense of humor and intelligence, and is the queen of surprises (see the kitchen scene for clarification). <br/><br/>The plot and story were divine. Only Quentin Tarantino, master of Pulp Fiction, could've crafted this wacky, martial-arts-gone-samurai movie, adding tributes to old slasher films, Japanese anime, and spy movies. I was so disappointed when it ended, I wanted it to keep going on, but I suppose that's what Volume 2 is for. <br/><br/>This movie certainly isn't for all audiences, as one person noted in their review. It is exceptionally bloody and gory, though it is often exaggerated so it really isn't that disgusting, and very graphically violent. The name suggests some type of gratuitous something or other, so it obviously isn't a film you would show to your kids. But if you love samurai movies, or any other films in general, then this is certainly one you don't want to miss. I can't wait to see Volume 2, and I hope Bill gets just what he deserves. <br/><br/>9/10, an instant classic!"
"grandpagbm","7","1","3","3 November 2008"," I'm Not a Tarantino Fan, But This Is Intriguing
","I am definitely not a fan of Quentin Tarantino. The only films of his that I have seen are the two in the Kill Bill series. I was interested in seeing them primarily because Uma Thurman and David Carradine (in the second one) were the leads, with an interesting supporting cast.<br/><br/>Tarantino has a thing about blood in these movies, with the red fluid being sprayed copiously around the sets. He also enjoys showing an outlandish amount of violence and the after-effects of it. I am not impressed by these features. However, there is something oddly intriguing about these films. The drama, the off-center dialog, the action scenes (even with the blood), and the storyline are fascinating. The weird assortment of music enhances well each segment. He also has a penchant for odd things such as using a sizable chunk of Japanese anime, flashes between color and black-and-white, inserts of titles for various segments, off-and-on foreign language dialog with subtitles, unexpected flash-backs and flash-forwards, and an other-worldly presentation in general. The cast members do an excellent job in their roles, and the makeup and costumes add a nice touch. Finally, it is easy to sympathize with the main character and her quest for revenge.<br/><br/>I saw the Volume 2 film before I saw the Volume 1. Normally, I would never do that on purpose, but I had heard that the second one was the best, and I had the opportunity to see it first. I agree that the second in the series is better than the first, but I was curious to see Volume 1, anyway. It appears to me that the first one was more bloody than the second, although it is probably a close call. I think Tarantino is weird, but I have to admit that he makes an interesting film, even if it's not really my cup of tea."

"johnnyboyz","9","1","3","12 October 2008"," Tarantino delivers another devilishly good film experience and proves he can bring his own style to a revenge film that purposely cuts back on substance.
","Yes, Kill Bill Volume 1 is a definite exercise in style over substance, but this isn't just anybody's style, this is Tarantino's style and what a style to possess. If his preceding film, Jackie Brown in 1997-98, was all characters and attention to detail spanning over two hours then Kill Bill is him letting his hair down and giving us an out and out visual-fest of colour, effects and violence delivered in double quick time; well, double quick compared to Jackie Brown and its brilliant study. But Tarantino had proved his worth when it came to out and out substance in films. His attention to a love story and character development in Jackie Brown came after Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, two of my favourite films told with such confidence and in such an entertaining way, the latter of which has since embedded itself into modern folklore, is stone wall proof that he can do it when he wants.<br/><br/>It's not that Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is an example of Tarantino not wanting to do what he can do, but more so a relaxation of complicated and developed films with narratives about realistic people. Yes, you can deem Pulp Fiction complicated even though it has inspired countless other films because there are some people even now that, on a first viewing when not familiar with the genre and influences, cannot fathom how one character can be alive at the end even though he shouldn't be.<br/><br/>On first view the film does come across as a flat out adventure, a one lined journey about one person in a routine revenge narrative driven film. But it's this familiar template that Tarantino's uses to place his own unique touches that he is so able to bring to a piece of text. If Pulp Fiction was so memorable, it was so for bringing life into an old genre full of stereotypes as noted by many. Here, Tarantino brings his own breath of fresh air or style to the well worn start revenge flick. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 begins with the sort of introduction you might not expect from Tarantino, certainly not from the very opening. There is no long tracking shot of a static woman on a moving walkway or guys calmly sitting around a table discussing Madonna. Instead we get black and white, panting and a bloodied woman whose image is juxtaposed by the calm and methodical speech from a man named Bill (Caradine). A few lines of dialogue pass and the woman is shot in the head.<br/><br/>What develops is a revenge film as told from this woman's point of view, The Bride (Thurman), a nameless (for now) antihero on a mission that will see her have to undergo a process as she plots her way to the ultimate goal of revenge. What's great about the revenge process from this position and similarly so in one of my favourite films entitled Payback, is that the antihero lead has just about nothing to loose and thus, they go about their mission in just about the most ruthless and unforgiving way possible. Their enemies think they're dead; they accept they've been to Hell and back and nothing else could be as bad as their prior tragedy and they go hell for leather in trying to attain the status of 'even'.<br/><br/>The Bride visits Vernita Green (Fox) after treading through some child's toys on a lawn, mise-en-scene that leads the audience to realise it is a house that inhabits a child. Vernita opens the door and there is a flashback (a Tarantino trademark) before a fight erupts immediately placing the audience in another juxtaposed situation: this woman whose been shot in the head and has been through Hell versus one of her enemies who it now seems has a young child. There is a brief fight before Vernita's child's bus stops outside and, echoing the tactic in Reservoir Dogs during the ear scene, there is a break in proceedings further plunging the audience into a realm of either frustration or unfamiliarity. How many other films would have finished the fight and ignored the 'pit-stop' routine? Tarantino re-announces his style from here and continues throughout in a barrage of memorable scenes.<br/><br/>But Kill Bill is really a furtherance in feminism. The entire assassination gang, bar Budd (Madsen), are female and the sexually active male nurse in The Bride's hospital wing gets his just deserts from said strong, independent female lead who takes no prisoners. A similar scene happens during a flashback scene involving the female Japanese character of Gogo (Kuriyama) who asks the question 'who is penetrating who now?' as she kills another potentially sexually active male in a similarly nasty manner.<br/><br/>The film builds to a climax that certainly delivers but not after delivering flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks when introducing Lucy Lui's O-Ren Ishii. The character of Bill is kept out of shot alá Marcellus Wallace and talks Elle Driver (Hannah) out of killing The Bride while she's still in a coma because it's not the 'honourable' thing to do; while clutching a Samurai sword which of course epitomises the ideal of honour amongst ancient Japanese warriors. Volume 1's final fight scene is all guts and gore but the images are juxtaposed with pinball noises and ten pin's clattering as the light and colouring changes brilliantly and dramatically, although my favourite touch is Sophie's (Dreyfus) ringtone which is 'Auld Lang Syne', a song that includes the lyric 'Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind?'. The Bride's reply would probably be a resounding 'No'."
"aleclemlij","10","1","3","26 September 2008"," anime fan heaven
","Well I reviewed this title on my website some years ago, here I paste my original review because I think this movie deserves it: This movie is like watching a Live-Action Japanese animation. And no, I'm not just talking about the animated sequence by Production I.G (Ghost int eh Shell). I'm talking about the ENTIRE movie. I strongly recommend Kill Bill to everyone, both movies but mostly volume 1 and mostly to anime lovers. Besides the samurai feeling and the Japanese animation tribute, there are many reasons why an otaku may enjoy this: <br/><br/>1) Character names: Curious little detail. Tarantino is taking some names right from a well known Japanese Video game company called SNK. First, when the movie is about to begin and the credits are rolling, we see one of the producers ""Goro Daemon"" (Goro Daemon is a character from the popular video game King of Fighters) Then at the movie we have ""Hattori Hanzo"" (Ninja from the ""Samurai Shodown"" video games)<br/><br/>2) Uma Thurman's yellow outfit is obviously a tribute to Bruce Lee. Great way to honour a Kung-Fu legend if you ask me, very well done.<br/><br/>3) Gogo Yubari: Teenage schoolgirls with powerful weapons that become fierceless warriors? Come on, THAT was invented by Japanese animators. Name any manga or anime you want, you'll have at least one of those girls. Tarantino you earned an A+ (btw, Tarantino contacted Chiaki Kuriyama for the role after watching her at battle royale, cult cinema film) <br/><br/>4) Sword fights, positions, movements, Samurai honour. A visual delight for people that enjoy watching traditional samurai movies and animes like Rurouni Kenshin 5)The blood and ""violence"": If you like Gore (Perfect Blue, Genocyber) You'd like Kill Bill. Blood in the movie looks fake enough not to become disgusting, but at the same time real enough not to become ridiculous. Perfect balance.<br/><br/>So as you can all see, I really liked this movie and think that no otaku should miss it. I love Japanese culture and I'm an Uma Thurman fan. Luckily, Tarantino is fan of both things as well so this movie just rocks.<br/><br/>Not an anime fan?? don't care. Watch it anyways, this movie is so fantastic that it has a little bit for everyone. One of my favourite films, if not THE favourite one. Don't miss it!!"
"bobsgrock","10","1","3","12 May 2008"," Outrageous bloody entertainment.
","Uma Thurman kicks butt and sprays blood all over the screen in yet another gem from writer/director Quentin Tarantino. Here, Tarantino pays homage to 1970s grindhouses, old vintage Chinese martial arts and Japanese samurai movies, as well as throwing in a little mix of Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns. Mix all together, and you have one of the most outrageously entertaining movies of the decade that keeps you watching from the shocking opening shot the cliffhanger ending. Even if you aren't a fan of Japanese anime or Chinese martial arts films, don't watch it for that. Watch it for the great acting by Thurman, Lucy Liu, Vivica A Fox, and Darryl Hannah, the breathtaking choreography during the crazy fight sequences, and the mind-blowing story that Tarantino has put together to entertain and shock us. Vol. I was excellent and I cannot wait to watch Vol. II."
"pyrocitor","10","1","3","8 May 2008"," ""You can tell by the cleanliness of the carnage...""
","Few directors have established such an instantly recognizable style as Quentin Tarantino. Despite having only released a handful of works, any of them can be immediately marked as a Tarantino film by any of his trademark cinematic traits: the stylized dialogue, the edgy cinematic techniques and the macabre yet perversely entertaining violence. Having remained under the radar for a few years after having shaken the film industry by storm and spawned countless imitators in the early 1990s, in 2003, Tarantino was back with a bang with arguably his most visceral and gruesomely entertaining work to date - Kill Bill: Volume One. <br/><br/>Using the simplest of story lines as a template for his latest bloodbath, Tarantino paints his story of an assassin gunned down at her wedding seeking revenge against the perpetrators with an operatic splendour, utilizing all of his usual trademarks with pitch-perfect intensity. With a stylized script providing some of the most quotable lines since Pulp Fiction and coy experimentation with narrative form, taking note and paying tribute to his usual multitude of nationalities and genres, from 1970s Japanese Samurai films (which the entire film is structured in the mould of), to convoluted classic french narrative, to continual innovations and experimentations in cinematic technique (with use of ""chapters"", freeze frames, eclectic cinematography and interludes to Japanese anime or black and white) Tarantino is at the top of his masterful game. The film's typically quirky musical score, making use of everything from classical samurai film themes to Nancy Sinatra to original works composed by independent artist The RZA proves an odd compilation that exquisitely captures the bizarre and endlessly captivating essence of the film. <br/><br/>Similarly, no film would pulse with the essence of Tarantino without copious use of violence, which Kill Bill: Volume One delivers in spades. While the mayhem is overdone to an almost comical extent (with dismembered henchmen spouting torrents of blood oddly enough harking back to Monty Python) several moments evoke such brutal and visceral intensity that even the most jaded viewers are likely to cringe. However, Tarantino similarly displays his uncanny talent to draw dark humour out of the most unlikely situations, wonderfully counterbalancing the very real emotional tension with unlikely humour, such as a room full of maimed bodies moaning in a zombie-like dirge. In the midst of the mayhem, it is easy to forget how hilarious the film can be. However, the superb fight choreography (in particular the staggering half hour final showdown) is breathtaking and astonishing in its intricate bloody splendour, crafting some of the most elaborate and intensely engaging sword fight scenes in cinema history. <br/><br/>Despite the jaw-dropping technical work and masterfully crafted script, Tarantino's film really comes to life through the incredible performances of his cunningly assembled cast. Giving a career best performance, Uma Thurman is nothing less than flat out mesmerizing as the initially nameless Bride. Diving into her performance with such raw intensity and extracting every last iota of emotion from the part, Thurman's powerhouse of a performance is the beating heart which keeps the film throbbing with life, carrying both the audience's sympathies and enthralled enthusiasm with her every step of the way. Similarly, Lucy Liu is enormously impressive as a smoothly psychotic assassin turned mob boss, and watching her calm veneer melt into a captivating pillar of exposed fury is one of the film's most terrifying moments. Daryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox each enthrall given their moments to shine as two of The Bride's former fellow assassins, as does Julie Dreyfus as Liu's oily second in command. Character actor Sonny Chiba is a delightful yet dignified presence as a mysterious retired swordsmith, and Chiaki Kuriyama resonates with power as likely the deadliest 'schoolgirl' ever beheld on celluloid. Seen only in a brief cameo setting up his role for the sequel, Michael Madsen nonetheless makes a strong impression as an introspective assassin, and David Carradine is spellbinding as the never seen Bill, his silky voice winding itself around his lines like the deadly viper his assassination squad is named after - one of the most effective villains never to expose their face. <br/><br/>Easily Tarantino's strongest, most visceral and ceaselessly stylish work since Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill: Volume One's dialogue, truly stunning cinematic style and technical work and myriad of tremendous performances (especially the astonishing Thurman) cement it as one of the most effortlessly innovative and impeccably masterful films of the decade. The effect of Kill Bill is truly astonishing; even after multiple viewings, the initial reaction of gut-level shock and awe at Tarantino's tremendous daring and perverse genius never wanes. Stylish, sadistic, cathartic fun - not for the faint of heart, but for those capable of stomaching it, Kill Bill is near peerless. <br/><br/>-10/10"
"addicott","10","1","3","23 March 2008"," Tremendous fun!!
","Let me just get one thing out there: this movie kicks ass!!! That thought repeated through my head many times as I leaned back in my seat, eyebrows raised, and took in the film for the first time.<br/><br/>There is little in the way of emotional attachment. That might be for the best. While you can certainly empathize at times, Uma Therman's character ""The Bride"" (a.k.a. Black Mamba) seems mighty grim as she pursues a quest of revenge against her former colleagues.<br/><br/>The plot, like the title, is laughable. Black Mamba gets ambushed on her wedding day. She survives, drafts a hit list 5 names long and sets out to get her revenge.<br/><br/>So how could such a simple storyline with limited emotional involvement turn into 3 hours worth of sheer movie bliss? Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it, that's how! The genius is in the details. There's an abundance of nasty surprises that will challenge your tolerance and keep you wide awake. The slower interludes are loaded with tension, intrigue and humor.<br/><br/>No one's lovable, but everyone is memorable. Uma Thurman is terrific in the lead. You see her character from a few different aspects. Usually she's nasty and pitiless. Occasionally she's cute. At one point she has an outburst of grief that's pretty riveting. Lucy Liu is great as O-ren Ishi, the boss of the Tokyo underworld. While obviously lethal, she somehow maintains this beautifully elegant, almost fragile presence, all decked out in her kimono. Her henchmen are colorful and imposing, like the earlier James Bond heavies. Bill (David Carradine) is genuinely mysterious, all the more so because they haven't shown his face yet.<br/><br/>And then there's the action. The combat is phenomenal in its execution and mind-numbing in its scope. Just when you think that has GOT to be it, they keep piling it on. One sequence is the new Mt. Everest of Kung Fu. Seriously. That alone is more than enough to keep this film on the map. Be warned: it's not harmless Jackie Chan-style slapstick combat. The blood and gore is overwhelming.<br/><br/>As you would expect, the music selections are devastatingly cool, and they come from all over the map. There's '70s funk. Pan flute w/ orchestra. Tex Mex. A Japanese schoolgirl power trio. You name it<br/><br/>It's not just the music that's eclectic. Kill Bill is a very vivid fusion of American, Chinese and Japanese genres. (At least these are the most visible elements  bear in mind that Tarantino seems to have seen every movie ever made anywhere.) The Japanese settings are stunning, and there's an entire segment beautifully done in a Japanese animation style called anime. This degree of savvy and reverence for the region is extremely rare among Western filmmakers.<br/><br/>All these elements are combined with great virtuosity to form a supremely entertaining movie thrill ride. You never know what's going to hit next, but whatever it is, it is likely to saturate the senses and challenge the brain. I didn't want for it to end, but I must admit: that level of intensity for 3 whole hours would be a bit much. So I can understand why they split it into two installments. Some people bitch about the severance, but I enjoyed volume 1 enough to see it twice and I can't wait to go shell out more dough and see volume 2.<br/><br/>Most American action films indulge in their gratuitous carnage behind a veil of contrived morality. This has come to irritate me enough to turn me off the genre. One thing I find very refreshing in Kill Bill is the absence of such pretense. It's all thrills and spills; no apologies, no disguises, no lectures.<br/><br/>Critics who object to this film seem to do so because it fails to pander to their various expectations. Here's a little news flash, people: it's Quentin Tarantino. If you go in expecting a repetition of his previous work or a movie that is in any way conventional and/or predictable, you're going to be disappointed  and you deserve to be. I went expecting something bold, exciting and original, with plenty of violence and a few surprises. I couldn't have been more delighted."
"ProfessorFate","6","1","3","17 February 2008"," What's wrong with ""Kill Bill""
","I actually enjoyed many aspects of the film, but it fails for the following reasons: <br/><br/>*******WARNING*****SPOILERS******<br/><br/>-While I think Lucy Liu is a pretty good actress (I loved her on ""Ally McBeal"") I think she is totally miscast in this role. At no time did I believe she was an assassin, and I never felt she was a threat to Uma Thurman's character. This role cried out for someone like Michelle Yeoh, an actress with a history of martial arts roles. Vivica Fox and Daryl Hannah both conveyed the necessary physicality and menace, but Lucy looked small and weak in the final battle vs ""The Bride"" <br/><br/>-The cartoonish squirting blood and unrealistic mayhem in the Crazy 88 fight. I know, it was meant to be cartoonish and unrealistic, but there has to be a certain amount of believability for an audience to buy into a movie, and this scene, with Uma mowing down henchman after henchman, just blew all credibility for the film.<br/><br/>-Filming out of chronological order. I know it has become a Tarantino trademark, and it works brilliantly in ""Reservior Dog"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", but here it's just confusing. Why not just present the saga of ""The Bride"" as it happened? The plot has enough drama without playing with the time line, which brings me to my fourth point . . .<br/><br/>-Style over substance. Tarantino is one of those directors who feels the need to constantly remind the audience, ""Hey, look over here, I'm directing this movie!"" There's enough camera movement and fast edits in this film to give you motion sickness. It's like a 2 hour music video. A well told story with some cinematic style is one thing - In ""Kill Bill"" the style over-whelms the story."
"The_Void","7","1","3","20 January 2008"," Makes up in blood what it lacks in substance
","I saw this film upon its release in 2003 and have to say that I wasn't impressed by it. While the film definitely has entertainment value, it lacks substance and didn't do much for me. Since then, however, I've seen a lot of the sort of films that Tarantino took influence from when it came to this film, and upon a repeat viewing of this first instalment of 'Kill Bill', while my niggles are still there; I enjoyed it much more this time around and have to say that Tarantino definitely achieved what he set out to. The film is an amalgamation of the sorts of films that Tarantino loves, all strung round a revenge theme. Clear influence comes from the martial arts, pinky violence, exploitation and western genres. The plot is exceptionally simple and focuses on a wedding day massacre at the hands of a group of people known as 'The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad'. The only survivor of the wedding day massacre is the bride, who despite getting shot in the head, was not killed. Four years after the wedding day, she wakes from her coma and vows vengeance on all those who spoilt her big day...<br/><br/>Tarantino does his usual trick of not telling the story in a linear fashion, and here we get a segmented chapter method of getting it across, which works fairly well. I would say that I am a fan of Tarantino's style, but at times he can be a little too 'quirky' and it does his films no favours. Take the first fight scene in this film between Uma Thurman and Vivica A. Fox - the idea of having the two women fight each other with household items is great...but then the kid comes home from school and the whole thing is too unlikely to be believable. The fight scenes are obviously the most important thing in a film like this, and the aforementioned scene is good in spite of the mentioned problem. Other great fight sequences in the film are good too; the bloodbath at the end being the most spectacular part, with the preceding fight that sees Uma Thurman pitted against a ball and chain wielding Japanese schoolgirl being the most interesting. Tarantino usually does casting well, and this film is no different. We also get a good soundtrack that fits the film well. One of the bigger risks in this film is the animated segment, and for me it's not a good thing. However, despite my problems with the film; it's hard to deny its entertainment value and the amount of blood on display (so much that certain scenes had to be shown in black and white!) is definitely a bonus too. I won't say that this is a big favourite of mine, but I am glad that I gave this film a second chance."
"dj_xand325","9","1","3","10 August 2007"," Kill Bill is a masterful audio-visual nirvana. Tarantino has crafted a truly inspired piece of entertainment
","Quentin Tarantino's, 'Kill Bill' series, is a roaring revenge story about a trained killer (Uma Thurman) picking off the assassins group who brutally massacred her future family, including her unborn baby. The story is simple but don't be fooled, Tarantino's dual epic is a masterpiece of cinematic art, beeming with visual vibrancy, stunning cinematography and spine-chilling music.<br/><br/>Tarantino is renowned for his vivacious love of obscure cinema, most notably kung fu and western cinema. In that context, 'Kill Bill' is by far his most inspired picture - the film in its entirety is a rich homage to Bruce Lee and Sergio Leone. Tarantino describes Kill Bill as his spaghetti western, his gritty saga of deceit and gore. That would sum up the atmospheric power of the films.<br/><br/>As mentioned before, Kill Bill is a dual epic. Split into two films for the interest of having a sensible film length. Yet the difference between the two volumes isn't just the name. They differ hugely in style. Volume 1 is a more stylised orgy of violence and black comedy with simply chilling show-downs and minimal exposition. Where as, Volume 2 is a more mature piece of cinema, telling the full story of 'The Bride'. In this way, we as viewers get the best of both worlds, boundless entertainment and a smiggen of story.<br/><br/>Volume 1 was always going to be a film that polarised critics. Style over substance was evident and unless a stuffy critic was willing to let his hair down and enjoy himself then he would have hated it. That is what you have to do, relax and admire the art of the film. Everything from the astonishing shot where we see Vernita's daugther's bus arrive through the window to the final showdown between O'Ren and The Bride is shot with depth and passion. Tarantino is meticulous in his direction, like 'Pulp Fiction', he pays attention to detail. The music is thrilling; Tarantino opts for Funky music types matched with aggressive Morricone scores, a combination you wouldn't think would work but it's invariably pulled off.<br/><br/>What's great about Volume 1 is that it doesn't take itself seriously, some of the scenes are just so outrageous that we know it's meta-cinema, we know we're watching a film in another world. Cinema is one of the finest forms of escapism and Kill Bill embraces that quality to the maximum! This is presented both subtly and boldly resulting in a satisfying film to watch multiple times (which I have).<br/><br/>'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is awesomely entertaining, cinematographic art and marvellously inspired.<br/><br/>Absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>9/10"
"matlefebvre20","9","1","3","15 June 2007"," ""Kill Bill"" is absolutely extraordinary...
","""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" <br/><br/>Almost everybody knows this proverb. But not necessarily its origin. That's alright, because nobody really knows where that famous phrase comes from. Not even the well-read Quentin Tarantino. In the case where you wouldn't have noticed it, Klingon is the name of a race in ""Star Trek"". But seriously, do you really think that I'm writing a review to discuss the origins of an expression that every school kid knows? <br/><br/>So, it's supposedly a dish best served cold...<br/><br/>Yet, Tarantino, perhaps unconsciously, strikingly makes that proverb lying. Because revenge in ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is not served cold, but rather dangerously hot, with flavors so explosive that sensitive stomachs will assuredly throw up their dinner.<br/><br/>Even well before he made ""Kill Bill"", Tarantino was already known for his skillful conjugation of extreme violence and aestheticism. We only have to think of the ear-slicing scene in ""Reservoir Dogs"" or too-many-scenes-to-give-a-specific-one in ""Pulp Fiction"". Tarantino completed his violent scenes with numerous references to popular culture in other scenes. Here, Tarantino puts popular culture aside and concentrates almost only on grape juice scenes.<br/><br/>The simple story of revenge is complex nevertheless. Uma Thurman plays 'The Bride'. She is a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, a team of assassins composed of herself and four other members. Their boss is named Bill (David Carradine, whose face is never revealed in this episode).<br/><br/>The Bride seems to have left the organization so she could marry and have a child, but her former colleagues show up at her wedding and kill everybody. They think they've also killed The Bride, but she miraculously survives after being shot in the head, even if her assailants cruelly took her baby off her body.<br/><br/>You would have guessed it, The Bride then wishes to get revenge upon her former colleagues by killing them one by one, and Bill as well, hence the title (surprising, isn't it?). This first episode shows The Bride attacking Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).<br/><br/>Faithful to himself, Tarantino presents his story in a fragmented way, just like if there was simply no other alternative to his methods.<br/><br/>The Bride quickly liquidates Vernita and we learn at the same time that O-Ren has already been killed. So the rest of the story is presented as a flashback and we know what will be the final result. What we don't know is that Tarantino is about to provide us with a breathtaking show of martial arts fights and extreme violence like nothing ever shown before in the history of cinema.<br/><br/>Tarantino really is a living encyclopedia of violence and ways of presenting it. For almost two full hours, the child prodigy from Knoxville, TN shows an exhibition of violent scenes and practically each one is different from the other ones. With such an amount of violence, naturalism quickly lets devolves into surrealism and, at some moments, shock and disgust become laughter.<br/><br/>Volume 1 is almost completely set in Japan, so it's without any surprise that Tarantino takes benefit of the occasion to pay tribute to Japanese film genres and popular culture. Just by seeing what he had done before with other well-known genres, it's not very surprising that QT concentrates on that kind of genre. I'd even say that it was only a matter of time.<br/><br/>And for a fan of Japanese culture like myself, I had a gorgeous feast. It all begins with the short anime, as surreal in its violence than the rest of the film. A superb homage.<br/><br/>The scenes where The Bride drives her yellow motorcycle towards the streets of Tokyo wearing a yellow suit are an homage to Bruce Lee, but it also strangely reminisces the famous anime feature ""Akira"". And the suit seems to come from the 'sentai' sub-genre, which gave us the already-forgotten ""Power Rangers"".<br/><br/>We also have to remember that we cannot dissociate Japan from video games. The spike ball linked to a chain used by the young terror Gogo (Chiaki Kuriyama) seems to be a reference to the early titles from the ""Sonic the Hedgehog"" franchise.<br/><br/>But how could we forget the Japanase sword fights? This amazing spectacle provokes incredibly high thrills during minutes that fly away as fast as the heads of The Bride's victims. Tarantino shot nearly all of the fight scenes in the famous Shaw Bros. studio in Hong Kong and called upon many action choreographers and martial arts specialists to re-create the atmosphere of old Hong Kong movies.<br/><br/>It's true that all of this stuff can shock. Tarantino is aware of it and even takes pleasure from it. How then would you explain the final fight between The Bride and O-Ren? Why would it be shot in a cute and innocent Japanese garden covered with pure white snow? Seeing this natural beauty, we could almost shout out ""Sacrilege!"" when Tarantino soils the snow with red blood.<br/><br/>But QT is pitiless. He fully trusts his own skills and those of his crew. We have to say that he really is prodigious. He never slows down, even if his last movie has been made in 1997.<br/><br/>For QT, everything in his movies is a question of appearance. It's still true here. Besides the examples already mentioned, we can add the mega-fight that suddenly goes from color to black and white and another one which takes place in a room plunged into darkness except for a blue screen in front of which fighters only look like dancing silhouettes.<br/><br/>With such a beginning, expectations are very high for the following. I must confess that I'm barely able to wait."

"JimmyMcCool","9","1","3","31 January 2007"," Bloody Good
","I just can't say enough good things about this movie. A real high octane thriller of a movie. Uma Thurman plays the Bride who after sleeping in a coma for 4 years after being left for dead, seeks revenge from her killers. Tarantino offers a visual feast leaving subtle clues in each scene to tell the story; Bills hanker chief with his name on it but you can't see him, Death list 5 already has a name scored off it. Nice wee touches like that. Its not as dialogue driven as his previous movies Its his bloodiest movie yet, more action orientated but its done so well and so blatantly over the top. There's also a Manga style cartoon to tell the origins of one of The Brides Nemesis' very over the top and violent and when it comes to the real life action, its just as over the top. The music is well picked and accompanies each scene perfectly. One of the tracks used was a piece of music Tarantino heard in a hotel lobby in Japan. Only Tarantino could choose so wisely. The movie is a homage to Japanese action movies; like Reservoir Dogs its not 100% original nonetheless it doesn't stop it being a relentless action packed treat."
"brown_bread","Null","1","3","20 January 2007"," Where's Peter O'Donnell when you need him?
","Tarantino is supposed to be a fan of Modesty Blaise. He put a Modesty Blaise book into the hands of his John Travolta character in Pulp Fiction and is rumored to be trying to make a Blaise film.<br/><br/>But Modesty Blaise author Peter O'Donnell never let his characters dodge danger by blind luck. Although I admire the slick styling of Kill Bill, the plotting is a disgrace.<br/><br/>His sick heroine kills a hospital orderly, wheels herself to his truck and drags herself inside, then lies on the back seat for hours willing her paralyzed legs to work. Like the cops wouldn't think to look at the dead man's vehicle in the hospital parking lot.<br/><br/>And she arms herself with a magic sword which is so good she can defeat dozens of swordsmen by dancing around waggling it.<br/><br/>The look of this movie is stunning. The idea of switching to manga-style animation to handle the sensitive subject of child abuse is brilliant. If it had been given a clever, disciplined plot, this could have been one of the best films of all time."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","1","3","27 October 2006"," The cold, brilliant recipe that is Kill Bill
","Revenge is a dish best served cold, after all.<br/><br/>For the recipe that is Kill Bill, consider Quentin Tarantino as a multi-million dollar blender who mixes the best of styles in his deep pool of talent: take Hong Kong action, Bruce Lee movies, nostalgic 1980's ninja movies and mainstream highlights, pour them into the blender and sprinkle the product with Tarantino's own trademarks and rapid-fire dialogue. Also pepper with film with homages and references. Finally coat the film in a rich glaze of adrenaline-pumping, decadently gory and heartstopping kinetics. Oh yeah, and serve with a killer soundtrack. Cold.<br/><br/>Needless to say, style alone cannot carry a film  no matter how sprawling with flair and fury it is. Kill Bill therefore tells the compelling story of one woman's revenge against her former assassin-colleagues who, on the day of her wedding, marched into the church and killed everyone there, including the bride's fiancée and her unborn baby. However they botched their way through their most important task: killing the bride. Now she wakes up from a coma four years later with one thing on her mind: killing Bill and the deadly viper squad who did this to her. 'Kill Bill vol. 1' thus tells the first half of the Bride's long, bloody, brutal and heartfelt journey for justice as she seeks out her enemies in parts of the world.<br/><br/>First let me say that this is my favourite Quentin Tarantino film, simply because it is a perfect amalgam of everything I like in both style and substance. The colourful format mixed with black-and-white visuals, the brief anime sequences, the chapter format, the atmospheric and eerie soundtrack and finally the fantastic story of cold, calculating vengeance  none of these components work on their own in the sense that their sole inclusion could support a film  but Quentin stirs and melts them together with with a bafflingly good skill that completely floored by non-existent expectations. On top of this, he applies an incredible kinetic energy to every part of 'Kill Bill' which makes the occasional slow-paced and introspective pauses all the more poignant.<br/><br/>The whole film is due to the aforementioned poised on the brink of overkill. It needs to be said. Ideas and visuals are bottled up under a lid but bubbling to come up at all times. It is enjoyable madness. However 'Kill Bill vol. 1' is not devoid of faults. These are no overriding or fatal shortcomings, but rather a small collection of scenes that simply do not work. The detective scene with Michael and James Parks going into the El Paso church after the massacre is incongruous and redundant, serving little more purpose than to give Tarantino's long-time friends their token cameos. Another scene that does not work for me is the dialogue-driven piece between Thurman and Fox in the kitchen after they've got their bitches on in a world-class cat-fight in the beginning. Their conversation feels staged, long-winded and purposely plot-propelling not to mention far too formal given the context and the histories of the two characters.<br/><br/>But indeed these are minor slip-ups and with the amount of good weapons in Tarantino's directorial arsenal, one can hardly hold it against him. Even the uneven pacing of 'Kill Bill vol. 1' is immediately forgiven when he plunges into to spinning martial arts violence and homaging goodies, all filtered through his own creative (...and sick) mind. Enjoy the coldly served dish.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"lambiepie-2","9","1","3","15 September 2006"," A Female on the trail of Revenge
","I had every intention of skipping this film when it was released. You see, movies with Martial Arts have never been on the top of my list, regardless of who does it. BUt this film came to me through word of mouth and once I saw it in the theater, I could not wait to see Kill Bill Volume 2! This is not your typical Martial Arts film, but then again, yes it is. It's humorous, fun, action packed and its lead character is a woman who's trying to piece her life back together after an unfortunate instance - the death quad she used to work for, thought they killed her. By all intents and purposes, she should have been dead. But she survived, which is bad news for each of them because she is hot on the trail of finding them and her main bone of contention, Bill.<br/><br/>Her travels to get to the elusive Bill is not without it's fair share of pain and destruction for the heroine. But this is what I like about films by Quesntion Tarrentino - there isn't a straight path to anything. You're not quite sure of which of the events you're watching happened first, but you are engrossed in watching to figure it out.<br/><br/>And on top of that, you never know what era you are in when you are watching. You have all of pop culture in your face and this film is no exception. There is plenty here for the die-hard martial art fans (with cameos from some of the most known in the traditional martial arts films) and for us that know a bit here and there (okay, I saw a few of the traditional Bruce Lee, Jet Li and Jackie Chan movies), there is stuff for us too -- but even more creatively speaking, it's all here for those aren't marital arts adapted. The story is quite the woman's story and the heroine meets up with some of the most strongest women ever ...along with the dirtiest of men.<br/><br/>You'll want to know 'what the deal' is about the heroine and you begin to piece it together in this installment. It's not very pretty, and you'll have questions...Why did her group turn on her? What happened to the baby she was carrying? Who is Bill really, and where is he? And why is she driven to Kill Bill? I just fell in love with this film. It's Tarrintino at his top form, and that is what makes it good entertainment."
"modjohnston","9","1","3","6 September 2006"," attention to detail
","in the scene where copperhead and black mamba first meet from the viewers standpoint, there is immaculate attention to detail that goes beyond accurate to the point of comedy. i.e., copperhead fires a gun from the inside of a cereal box. the name of this kids cereal you ask?... ""kaboom"" 'nuff said! who else in this world can pay enough attention to cinematic detail, that there is enough room left for a little bit of appropriate artistic license? granted Tarantino isn't in the same league as Scorcese, but thats just the point. My only qualm with the entire movie is the close up shot of the gun firing, anyone with even remote firearm experience knows the striations of the barrel cause the bullet to spin to maintain a straight trajectory, thats the entire basis of bullet-forensics... other than that this film is a visual splendor"
"squadmp","8","1","3","3 June 2006"," Great Movie, but fails in its intention
","What can be said about Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill? Some consider it a masterpiece, others don't. The only certain thing about this movie is that it loses its original intention. In this movie, Tarantino tries too hard to make a sort of replica of the classic Japanese samurai films combined with the well-known martial arts movies. This can be easily seen from Uma Thurman's clothing, the yellow suit with the black line is featured in ""Game of Death"" featuring Bruce Lee. The problem that this film represents is that in virtually every Japanese movie of the types mentioned above, you'll never find massive, senseless slaughtering because the fighting is actually NOT the main idea of those movies, but the preservation of honor along with the demonstration of courage and skill. Certainly this movie has Tarantino's style well-engraved in it. I believe it's been highly regarded by many because it has the name of a well-known director, and most supporters fail to find the true meaning and intention of the film. <br/><br/>*Just for reference you should watch a couple of Akira Kurosawa's movies , see which style you like best."
"Justin-Kamal","5","1","3","29 March 2006"," Wait a second... I didn't know that we had power hoses in our bodies!
","Remember those old movies where what happens on screen can possibly happen in real life? Well this is not one of them. Quentin Tarantino emerges from no where to establish himself as a well-known director. In his pursuit to become a film making legend, Tarantino proves to everyone how the mere sight of blood, something that made us cringe in years past, has become a must see in modern film. Unfortunately, instead of utilizing this ticket-selling obsession in proportion, Tarantino completely goes all out and overuses it.<br/><br/>The Japanese style film with a story that does not make sense shows that this film was targeted at violence-hungry knuckleheads with a craving for blood. I never knew it could happen, but it did. A story about some pregnant super-agent bride who loses her baby and vows revenge turned out to be one of the top selling movies of the year.<br/><br/>If Tarantino meant for this movie to be a sarcastic comedy, then he did an outstanding job. If he meant it to be a respectable action film, boy... does he need to go back to film school.<br/><br/>Regrettably impressive fight sequences are the only savior for this lost cause. The special effects were overdone and the acting performances were laughable.<br/><br/>If you do decide to see this movie, make sure you wear a rain coat and carry an umbrella, because considering the blood hits just about everything, it just as well can hit you.<br/><br/>My rating: 5/10 in General 6.5/10 for an Action Film"
"Markmainwaring","7","1","3","9 March 2006"," Overrated but as its moments.
","When I first saw this I thought it was great. But since watching it again I see its short comings. Along the way there are some great moments and some great references.<br/><br/>But the references are what also causes the films downfalls. There are way too many and the film eventually becomes just one big in-joke. Thats not to say that the film is complete rubbish and when the references work they really work. It was great to see characters like Earl Mcgraw from From Dusk Till Dawn again. And the action scenes are usually great. With plenty of over the top gore. Some great dialogue and a brilliant soundtrack. But all in all a lot of it falls flat.<br/><br/>Some of the fights also let you down. The fight against Lucy Lui and Vivica Fox feels uncompleted.<br/><br/>Worth watching when its on telly."
"PIST-OFF","9","1","3","18 February 2006"," can't these flies just leave me alone?????
","Although not as great as Tarantino's early work this movie has plenty of frenetic energy that makes his movies great. The first half of Kill Bill seems to be a meditation on the highly underrated Chop Socky films out of Hong Kong during the 60's, 70's and 80's. In fact the whole film serves as a tribute to eastern culture with a slight nod to the westerns and blaxploitation. Despite it's length the movie rarely slows down and manages to make one interesting scene after another. The amounts of spilled blood (along with the joke that the corpses of defeated foes don't simply disappear once defeated) make this movie stand on it's own as a true Kung Fu film. The appearance of Sonny Chiba will have extra weight for fans of Tarantino. What emerges isn't so much a movie with emotional depth as much as a popcorn movie that doesn't stoop to jerry bruckheimer clichés. As usual black comedy and in-jokes can be shifted through the carnage and most everything falls into place. my only complaint would come from the choice of music during the winter garden fight. I know it would probably be more clichéd, but i would have preferred a dead soundtrack punctuated only by the water spigot to the jarring 70's roller derby music. Other than that I have few complaints.<br/><br/>9 out of 10. not a romantic film."

","It has been quite some time since 'Pulp Fiction' made me adore Tarantino in the 90'ies, and even if Jackie Brown was sort of disappointing (despite starring Robert De Niro, my favorite actor), I could hardly wait Kill Bill Vol.1. And this time, i was delighted. Just the Bride's fight against the Katana-armed boy group was worth going to the movies twice. Actually, even the greatest Tarantino fan will have to admit that there are some minor weaknesses (O-Ren saying her last sentence with half her brain chopped off, or the Bride recovering way too quick after an endlessly seeming coma...come on, she should be unable to move for days, considering her not having exerted a single muscle for years...), but if you ignore them and don't take the whole thing too seriously, it's just great fun. It's another of those ""love it or hate it"" - movies, this, if you enjoyed Pulp Fiction and/or Reservior Dogs, you shouldn't miss this one. The sound track is, as usual for Tarantino, very well fitting. By the way: I favor Vol.1 over Vol.2, probably because of the lack of blood shed in part two."
"Pookyiscute","8","1","3","18 January 2006"," Flippin' awesome!
","I just saw this last night, and loved it! I was expecting something like, 'Jackie Brown', which I hated. Something, slow and dry and bloody, from what I'd heard of it. But, I was really surprised, and in a good way. The film leaves you guessing, and a little tense at times, and more importantly, hanging at the end! Uma Thurman and Lucy Lui, duke it out in this four-star blood bath dedicated to old Japenese and slaughter films. It's a definite Tarintino film, and it's hard not to recognize his determination to achieve a sickening result, that will leave you numb and grossed out from what you've just witnessed. But, that doesn't go without saying, that his talents almost supercede the acting abilities shown by Thurman and Lui. Both, learned Japenese to play the leading roles, and both obviously went in for some training, to be able to fight in certain scenes of the film.<br/><br/>It's far too bloody for anyone under seventeen, and my recommendation is that you not eat before viewing. It's one of the most violent and bloody films, although I have to admit, there are some horror films which are a bit more disturbing and violent, this left me feeling just a little bored seeing all the killing. However, I still loved it."

I also like it at the end where she fights the boss. She slices her head and its really good effects. I also like it where she is fighting all of those men and all the blood on the floor is really cool. It is just a really good film to enjoy and no one can really pull this down it is a true 10/10 and i know the second one is just as good but this one is excellent.

"diac228","8","1","3","28 October 2005"," Review of Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2
","One of the most acclaimed movies this decade is Kill Bill, Volumes 1 and 2. Both movies made over 60 million dollars each in the United States (over 330 million dollars worldwide in total) and has gotten so much praise one would wonder why is it that this doesn't have its own star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame yet. Directed by the unique and creative Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill mixes bloody gory violence with a lot of beautiful imagery, excellent music, and a well-rounded cast of zany characters. Sounds great doesn't it? Well, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a very good movie, but it is not as good as people say it is. As for Kill Bill Volume 2, now that is a spectacular movie. These two movies in actuality is one film, but for marketing purposes and because the finished product is so long, Miramax decides to release it as two separate films. Despite the rather slow start, Kill Bill finishes so strong you know why Tarantino is as popular as he is today.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is about a woman, whose name is not revealed throughout most of the film (known as The Bride), looking for revenge after the gang of assassins she used to be with attacked her during a wedding rehearsal, killing every single person except for her. But before she goes after the man that started the massacre, she wants to get rid of the four people that were involved in the bloodbath first. Much easier said than done. The first Kill Bill basically is like an action flick, not concentrated too heavily on plot, but more on action. Kill Bill Vol. 2 does contain its amount of intense action, but also sinks deeper into the personalities of not just The Bride, but of the assassins, and Bill himself.<br/><br/>The first part of Kill Bill is advertised as a massive action flick full of intense sequences of sword fighting and action. The truth is, there is only two massive action scenes, and both are good, don't get me wrong, but there is a lot of fluff in between the two action scenes. They range from several scenes of chatter, to an anime sequence, to a long sequence of The Bride trying to wiggle her toes. Talk about slow-paced. To add to that, it took 10-20 minutes before the final fight was finally set up. In other words, she was at the scene of the major fight, yet it took forever for the fight to begin. This first part of the movie would be much shorter if it was Robert Rodriguez editing the film.<br/><br/>Tarantino also does this one-take shot that just can turn a potentially short moment into a very stretched and prolonged scene. And this happens twice. The movie is good, there is a good storyline, two jaw-dropping action scenes, good cast of characters(I fell in love with Gogo Yubari, and also the top assassin Elle Driver) and a shocking twist in the end, but overall I find Kill Bill Vol. 1 rather overrated. If there is one thing I love about the first part though, it has got to be the music, especially the credits theme and also the now famous theme to the hotel where the final battle takes place. Now enter part 2.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 2 is everything Vol. 1 wanted to be. Volume 2 perfectly mixes suspense with action, humor, excellent music, brilliant acting, and a very good ending. Volume 2 basically fills all the holes Volume 1 created, and also answers all of the questions as to why the events took place and how The Bride became so skillful. Volume 2 concludes the entire ordeal, as the Bride has to deal with Budd, Elle, and of course, Bill, but gets a little more than what she bargained for. Elle Driver makes an even longer appearance the second time around, and Daryl Hannah (well-known as the mermaid in Splash) gives the best performance of the movie, as she portrays the ruthless, clever, unpredictable, and rage-filled rival assassin of The Bride. Her battle against the Bride stands in my opinion as one of the best fights within the past 10 years.<br/><br/>The second half of the movie also has several flashbacks that helps weave the story together, and the flashback themselves were very entertaining and offered its share of foreshadowing. This was the pure filming brilliance that I was expecting from Tarantino. Very few flaws in the movie, and there never was a sense that the movie was dragging too long, and it is clocked in at over 10 minutes longer than the original, but it did not feel that way. There is not much more to say about the second part, except for the fact that it really picked up the slack and delivers one of the best movie experiences this decade. Kill Bill overall is a great film, overrated, but a superb film nonetheless. Not the best I have seen this decade, but has an entertainment value that is much higher than the usual films within the past few years. Kill Bill: packs a violent punch, a truly entertaining roller coaster.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 1 = 7/10 Kill Bill Vol. 2 = 10/10 Kill Bill overall = 8/10"

Kicking off with a harrowing introduction that is sure to haunt you in your sleep, Kill Bill vol. 1 pretty much makes you want to be on The Bride's side doing some killing. While this one doesn't fixate itself much on the story or the background history of what happened to The Bride, the movie doesn't really need to. Rather it straps you down for a roller coaster ride of pure action. The material arts is top notch, especially at the big show down at the end. The comedic parts are actually funny. The animated history of Oni-wan is dazzling. Sure they over-do it on the blood but so what? Half of the stuff they do in here can't be done in real life anyway, so just sit back, enjoy and turn your bullshit alarms off. This is the first installment of a movie that is going to dazzle you.

Will she have the guts to take out the deadly assassin squad who had thought they killed her on her wedding day 4 years earlier but what they don't know is that she is still alive and the only thing she wants is their lives for what they did to her. Uma Thurman blew me away with her performance as the ""Blood Spalttered"" Bride and i was actually quite moved because i could understand her pain of 'losing' a child and that everyone you loved was dead. Uma has a big range of emotions and she can go from killing the crazy 88 to being upset about losing her daughter over some heartless assassins. i was also very surprised by Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii because i saw her in Charlies Angels and i wasn't that impressed because the acting wasn't that great anyway. I think that she is a very sexy Asian and she brings some spice to the role which makes her great. All the acting was amazing and i think that Quentin Taratino is a genius for making this excellent film. i recommend this to fans of Pulp Fiction or any other Uma or Quentin Film."

","Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the cinema, the master of decadent violence is back. Quentin Tarantino returns after a six-year lull with Kill Bill, his homage to kung fu revenge flicks from the 1970's.<br/><br/>The plot? Not too taxing for those of you who were left reeling by the non-chronological approach of his previous three films.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman, looking gorgeous in tight fitting outfits throughout, plays well, I'm not really sure who she plays. For some, inexplicable reason whenever she is referred to by name there's a high pitched beep on the soundtrack. Anyway, I digress. Ms Thurman is credited as being The Bride. Probably because the movie opens with her assassination on her wedding day. She's left for dead after being viciously attacked, kicked, beaten and shot several times by a team of 5 deadly (well, nearly) assassins lead by Bill. She survives and, after regaining consciousness from a 4 year coma, embarks on a mission of revenge against the 4 team members and, of course, it's leader, Bill. Get it? Kill Bill. Well, come on, Kill 4 Assassins And Then Bill is a bit of a long-winded title, isn't it? So is the much-hyped 4th movie by Quentin Tarantino any good? The straight answer is I don't know.<br/><br/>Let me put it this way. Take Richard Burton. Not a bad actor but had an outstanding voice. My old grandmother used to say that if they ever released a record of Mr Burton reading from the telephone book, she'd be the first in line to buy it. Well, I was one of the first in line to see Kill Bill and I saw the movie equivalent of the Greater London Residential Directory A to D.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a stylish treat for the eyes. Black and white, animation and a visually stunning blast of colour during a night drive through Tokyo all used to great effect; but the movie is empty. We care about The Bride's motivation and need for revenge. She lost everything at the hands of these 5 people; her unborn child, 4 years of her life and presumably The Groom. But the way she goes about it is hollow and unengaging.<br/><br/>The nonlinear style to storytelling that worked so well for him in his other films lets him down here. The climatic showdown between Uma and Lucy Lu is rendered dull and unsuspenseful with the revelation (in the first half-hour of the film) that Lu's character has been killed! Some parts of the fight scenes were excellently choreographed, others weren't. Some of the humour was used to great effect, some of it wasn't. But lacking most of all was the razor sharp Tarantino dialogue that slices through each of his previous movies. There were glimmers of it there but it was vastly over shone by the glimmers of light of sword blades.<br/><br/>You really do get the feeling that this film might've worked better had Tarantino stuck to his original plan of a 90-minute revenge flick. But instead he's been talked into splitting the flick into two volumes, doubling its original intended length. Sure everything might make greater sense once Vol. 2 is released but I resent having to pay twice to see what was always designed as a single film.<br/><br/>This is by far Mr Tarantino's most violent movie. The violence is comic book like in parts and gritty and unnerving in others. Tarantino fans won't be disappointed so long as they don't expect too much. This film will disappoint if you're expecting the next Pulp Fiction but with added Kung Fu.<br/><br/>If you don't like blood, and gallons of it squirting from severed limbs and heads, this movie is not for you. Save your money and go and rent Quentin Tarantino's first two movies on DVD. You'll have a great night."

","The bride(Uma Thurman) was shot down along with the rest of her wedding guests on her wedding day. She was shot in the head by a man named Bill(David Carradine). The first problem was that survived from the coma. The second problem was that she was one of the world's top assassins! Now, she is mad and want's revenge on everyone that betrayed her(Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen), leaving Bill for last.<br/><br/>The movie is Quentin Tarantino's 4th movie and is the first of two parts. The movie was so great, that it is second to only one of his movies: Pulp Fiction. The fighting scenes are the best fight scenes since The Matrix, if not better, and the writing is amazing. The music is awesome, the acting is great, and did I say the fight scenes? Honestly, this is the most entertaining movie I have ever scene. Overall, the movie is flawless. One of my Top Ten greatest of all time.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."

"yes_i_am84","6","1","3","14 July 2005"," There is something to admire. But...
","""Either you'll love him or you'll hate him"", has everybody told me about Quentin Tarantino. No other alternatives. His style is an extreme, unrealistic, grotesque one, and you can't help but adoring it or hating it. (In my circle of friends, actually, there are much more people feeling the first way.) <br/><br/>Well, I have to say that I disagree. My feelings were actually disappointment, some boredom and a touch of admiration for some aspects of this over-discussed movie, aspects that I will point out later. Let me tell first what I found disappointing.<br/><br/>After having watched ""Pulp Fiction"", I kept wondering about what people was so enthusiast about in that mess of violence, if it wasn't for one thing: that the gore was coupled with a witty script that, as regards dialog, was reached by very few films I ever saw in my entire life. As a lover of words, I found a lot to enjoy on this side. But what about ""Kill Bill"", at least about Volume One we are talking about here? If you take a look at the ""Memorable Quotes"" section here on IMDb, there is the totality of the dialog in the film. The strength of the movie doesn't lie in the use of words. <br/><br/>But there is violence. So much that, in half an hour, you find yourself laughing out loud at the screen as heads and limbs are cut off, leaving only rivers of cartoonish blood coming out from everywhere. Well, as I was laughing, I told myself - Is this really a healthy thing? Is it good that so much people enjoy that much watching a hour and a half of tomato juice - because the director's style wants to remind us every single moment that this is what we're dealing with, tomato juice? Is it good that a supposed masterpiece is made up of a pregnant woman beaten up to a near-death, then shot, then raped throughout her 4-years-long coma; a mother killed in front of her daughter; a pre-teen girl seducing the pedophile killer of her family and having her revenge in bed with him; and so many, so many, SO many limbs cut off? I don't think that this is a healthy thing, and this is why I'm angry every time that I find a Tarantinophile telling me that there is no greatest director in the world. Because all these people will watch the movie with their 6-year-old children and think ""oh, no, my God, there's no problem! Even a kid could easily tell that this is fake!"" <br/><br/>And so? What is the positive point then? We can turn around this as much as we want, but in the end, what we have here is a non-existing story filled with pointlessly over-acted acts of violence from the beginning to the end. And we find excitement and pleasure in watching them, because they are well-presented, skilfully told and nicely directed, with every right camera angle you need. I'm not sure that this is enough to make ""Kill Bill"" a masterpiece. <br/><br/>I promised that I would later have pointed out what the interesting elements of the film are, in my opinion. Of course, there are some. The last thing you can say about Tarantino is that he suffers from lack of originality! And this originality lies precisely in his ability of ""putting the puzzle together"", adding to the mix of citations and past cinematic references the quality of vision he undoubtedly owes at the highest level - and that you can't help but admire, whether you approve him or not. <br/><br/>For example, and this is to be found not only in ""Kill Bill"" but in all his production, he's the man of the soundtracks. You can sense it since the opening sequence when you're hit by the voice of Nancy Sinatra with ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" - in this movie, he makes perhaps his best soundtrack achievement to date. The best evidence of it is that it is totally unsuitable to be turned into a Cd compilation, and in this form it is very hard to listen to, but if ""married"" to the images, it perfectly suits every movement, every glance, every breath. Music provides also the only few moments of pause in the entire movie, like the simply adorable ""Lonely Shepherd"" by Zamfir which accompanies the already-classical words by Michael Madsen ""That woman deserves her revenge, and we deserve to die."" Brief but wonderful musical gems are to be found throughout the film and add a lot to the visual experience.<br/><br/>Another good thing is what I couldn't describe in any other way than a ""touch of magic"" that you can feel, here and there, in some moments of the movie, despite all the gore and all the violence. The moment in which The Bride, after the furious and oh-my-God-how-long fight with the Crazy 88, goes to the final battle with O-Ren, is one of them. The scene changes abruptly and all the blood is cancelled by the snow, in a white Japanese garden surrounded by a dark blue sky. For a brief moment, you experience peace, and this sensation is without a doubt provided by the director's talent. And this is not the only noteworthy moment - even in the overlong fighting scenes, which I am not a fan of, there is something ""more"" than an immediate level to find.<br/><br/>The man definitely has a thing for imagination, and he knows he has. He also knows how to let the public be part of his imagination. I can only warn this public that he also knows - more than any other director I've watched in my life - how to manipulate the audience. When you watch a Tarantino film, ""Kill Bill"" in primis, admire his talent, but try to be aware of this."
"nowhereman86","7","1","3","10 July 2005"," What A Rip-Off
","I used to adore this film. If you would have asked me six-months ago, I would have given this movie a 10. Then I got educated. After watching films by Akira Kurosawa the lines in this movie became almost laughable. I can picture Quentin pounding his fists on the coffee-table screaming ""I wanna make a samurai movie!!"". Kurosawa's films had a certain nobility to them, which is sadly something that Quentin has yet to master. I think the problem was that he tried to hard to replicate the ""cool"" feeling of ""Pulp Fiction"". The redeeming thing about this movie is that it almost feels original. Only in a few spots did I roll my eyes at his corny dialog. Lucky for me, I hadn't seen the stinking pile of garbage that became known as ""Volume 2"" yet."

"no-skyline","8","1","3","8 June 2005"," A Roaring Rampage Of Revenge or A Damp Squib ?
","How do you review a film that's a montage of so many others? You can look at Tarantino's works one of two ways either as a maverick genius re-cycling popular culture into exciting new forms or as a talent less hack ripping off the real masters of the form. I tend to be in agreement with the first, yes kill bill consistently references (and in some cases downright steals) from other movies but it is melded into something fresh and exciting. Who can fail to be exhilarated by the showdown at the house of blue leaves? Or raise a laugh at the dead pan humour? The other question mark is this a complete film or simply half of one? I would tend to view them as separate films with their own unique styles and feels with Vol 2 drawing more on Leone westerns than Vol 1's Shaw Brothers etc.<br/><br/>Taranatino's visual and narrative tricks are brought to the fore, long tracking shots, some strange POV shots (through a bullet exit wound, the usual car trunk shot etc.) although the fetishistic shot of Uma Thurmans feet I could maybe have done without. The story is told in the non-linear segmented form that Tarantino has made an art of since reservoir dogs. The soundtrack is reminiscent of the variety of Pulp Fiction, he recognise sound as such an important part of the medium. The brides entrance to Tokyo is met by a theme that will surely now be remembered only for Kill Bill rather than its original TV series and is as an inspired choice as his choosing of the Delphonics for Jackie Brown and Dick Dale for Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>There are some drawbacks though there is very little of the razor sharp dialogue in this first instalment which before has always been a highlight of his films i.e. The banter between Jules and Vincent in pulp fiction or the Madonna discussion from Dogs, nothing here matches that but there's a reason for as this is a roaring rampage of revenge and in that it succeeds on every level. 8/10"
"SpookyPie88","9","1","3","2 June 2005"," Tarantino just gets better and better
","Quentin Tarantino has always claimed to love Japanese films and watching his prior works reflects this, only now has he completely taken the genre he loves and given it the Hollywood treatment and it really works. The Japanese cartoon sequence, in particular, showing the history of O-Ren was beautifully done and a lovely tribute to the culture that Tarantino owes the influence for the film. Throughout the films are various other acknowledgements and references to the Japanese film industry.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman, whom I never really have liked much, completely won me over with her performance as The Bride. She was all too aware that she had been cast as the 'superhero' and relished in it and clearly had fun living up to all stereotypes.<br/><br/>The fight choreography in this film was amazing, totally convincing and thrilling to watch. The scene in which The Bride takes out the entire Crazy 88 is breathtaking, the choreographer must have spent ages working that out and the final product is worth the price of admission in itself.<br/><br/>Someone who caught my eye in this film was Chiaki Kuriyama; she was amazing as O-Ren's bodyguard GoGo Yubari. For someone who was handed a ball and chain and told to master it in just three months she looked completely at ease with it and used it with great confidence. I hope to see more of her in Hollywood.<br/><br/>I have to mention the use of blood in this film too. The way it sprays out instead of trickling is pure Tarantino at his best."
"swetster","6","1","3","26 March 2005"," Sooo............What.....
","I feel schizophrenic about this movie. On the one hand I thought it was well directed, cinematic ally clever and beautiful. I thought Uma Thurman was terrific along with the rest of the cast. <br/><br/>I saw both I & II back to back which is probably the best way to see them. I kept looking for a reason for the madness and I came to the conclusion that the madness exists purely as a clinical and stylized exercise. It reminds me a little of surgery, however, in surgery there is at least a purpose or hoped for outcome-to save the patient. This movie is obviously not interested in the patient only in the clinical exercise<br/><br/>By the time we are supposed to care it is way too late. This movie is a pop intellectual experience, not unlike a video game. It has all the right moves, music, camera angles, profanity,etc. Once the game is over, no one cares....The package is glittery and seductive but empty. I give it six stars for style and acting."
"slokes","5","1","3","19 December 2004"," Too Cool To Rule
","""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is so cool it hurts. Really. It's so cool, the coolness gets in the way of it being a good film. Instead, we get an empty stylistic spectacle with cardboard caricatures, lame segues, and a weird snuff-porn schematic. How on earth Quentin Tarantino went from this to the solid cinematic achievement that is ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is beyond me.<br/><br/>A bride is left for dead in a Texas church with eight or nine other victims after a visit from her former comrades in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. After a four-year coma, she suddenly recovers and sets about getting her bloody revenge.<br/><br/>It's cool the film opens with the Shaw Brothers logo, telling us this is a homage to the chop-socky films Tarantino grew up with. It's cool Tarantino manages to stick in so many obvious homages to directors legendary and otherwise. But copious epigramming don't make for high achievement in film any more than in literature, and after a while the exercise becomes more obvious and annoying. There's no glue here, just a lot of winks and nods in scattered directions.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman does a serviceable job as The Bride, but she presents nothing close to the nuanced, sensitive character we see in ""Vol. 2."" She just runs around in a Bruce Lee jumpsuit killing people. David Carradine, who gives ""Vol. 2's"" best performance, is mostly MIA, and quite a different personality in his little voice-over bits here. The villains seem to do things for effect, rather than reason. One assassin allows her minions to get creamed by a single attacker without jumping in to lend a hand, perhaps thinking about the pension savings but hardly helping herself down the road, when she must fight her attacker all by herself. Another sequence has an assassin being called up at the last possible minute to cancel a murder, because he feels he owes it to the comatose victim not to be a ""rat"" about it, though that didn't stop him before from shooting her while she lay defenseless on the floor. Beautiful people merrily subject themselves to dismemberment, disembowelment, and assorted mayhem, because it's cool.<br/><br/>After a while, it all just feels like a massive put-on, something to go with the cool music and cool costumes and everything else. Even the dialogue, which usually shines in Tarantino films, seems perfunctory. Everything is subsumed by image.<br/><br/>There are some good moments. Sonny Chiba delivers a funny and poignant performance as a retired katana maker of great repute from whom The Bride seeks help, in a rare sequence not belabored with blood or film references. There's some laughs amid the violence that show Tarantino hasn't lost his gift for balancing action, suspense, and comedy.<br/><br/>But the fights go on too long, and feel pointless. Can anyone look at The Bride's battle with the Crazy 88 after watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" worked on by the same fight coordinator, and not see how hokey the former looks by comparison? The anime sequence is also overlong and bloody, not to mention self-indulgent.<br/><br/>Maybe it was intentional on the filmmaker's part to have such a comic-book introduction, with broad strokes galore, and leave the human dimension for ""Vol. 2."" If so, it certainly works. ""Vol. 2"" is a terrific film, perhaps more. But ""Vol. 1"" is so cool, it left me frozen."

So I was really looking forward to watch the new Tarantino. I wanted to read all informations and news about this Kill Bill almost two years before it actually started. After this long waiting time I was disappointed when I watched it. I missed this special humour of Tarantino which made me laugh so many times in Res. dogs and PF. This movies have been violent and funny at the same time. Kill Bill wasn't funny for me. It was a good action movie ,even a great movie for a fan of martial arts . But if you liked Tarantinos style in his earlier movies you might be a little bit disappointed. (6/10)"
"mentalcritic","5","1","3","21 September 2004"," More overrated Tarantino self-indulgence...
","One has to constantly wonder what would happen were Quentin Tarantino put in a prison cell with Mark Brandon Read for a day or two. Given that the latter really has had his ears cut off and knows what happens during such impromptu surgery, I think the conversation alone would be rather interesting to say the least.<br/><br/>But this is a digression. Tarantino at least had the honesty to come out and say that this opus was a work of pure fantasy. This, however, does not save it from falling prey to Tarantino's trendiness. One has to hand it to him for being able to make something seem hip in an era where nobody seems to know what is ""cool"" anymore. Nonetheless, Kill Bill revels in its own supposed hip-ness to such an extent that in twenty years' time, it will no doubt be viewed with the same kind of contempt reserved for the likes of The Brady Bunch rather than the admiration films like RoboCop get as they near the age of twenty years.<br/><br/>Speaking of that august piece of true ultra-violence, Quentin Tarantino only serves to prove in this effort that in spite of all his pretensions, he is no Paul Verhoeven. In spite of his efforts to pull the same literal crucifixion of his hero, no emotional connection to The Bride is ever offered. The Bride is simply a loud bitch who kills people in front of their families or sadistically chops them apart. No good reason is given to want to see the bad guys dead, and thus the emotional impact of their death is non-existent.<br/><br/>To its credit, Kill Bill part one is very entertaining when one doesn't know what is going to happen next. The weird Kung Fu-style mentoring scenes with the swordsmith and the hospital scenes certainly stand out. The problem is that once you know what is going to happen, it just gets incredibly dull. The House Of Blue Leaves is probably one of the worst examples of music in a film I've seen outside of a blaxploitation effort. I would have given real money for that band to shut the hell up. Obviously, Tarantino was never told about what an impact the right music in a given scene can have upon the dynamics of a scene.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman was also a poor choice for the heroine. Someone like Lucy Liu, I could believe doing all these things, but Uma comes off as being too homely and sedate. Not to mention that she looks like she's from another planet, although that might have been an intentional aspect of her casting. In the end, I wanted to see Julie Dreyfus in action.<br/><br/>I gave Kill Bill, Vol. 1 a five out of ten. It is excellent proof of that old saying about first impressions being the best impressions. It is worth renting once, and once only."

The action is not that good, takes too long to get into it, to realize that hey, there is nothing else here besides violence. What looks great in anime (myself being an anime fan) translated poorly into Kill Bill. The animated part is pretty good but that's it.

In every scene one can just see Tarantino pulling off his scanty hair, trying to figure out how to titilate the juvenile, how to top the nonsensical with the ridiculous. There are big holes in the plotline that just seem to make no difference as long as blood is squirting just high enough.<br/><br/>The thing has weak plot, flat characters, mostly awkward score and is rampantly incoherent in style.The mix of ripped-off films is just so transparent at the hemline that the storyline wiggles in despair and there never really emerges a film as a whole- only separate scenes of bad dialogue and bad acting.<br/><br/>I wish someone in Hollywood  slapped some humility and that loudmouth Tarantino.

","Alright. I just got back from seeing the latest Tarantino offering, Kill Bill. From the very first frame of the film, I knew I was in for a treat. The opening production credits sent me back in time, to when my mom and dad would take me to see kung fu B-movies. Dusty, dirty, film footage, accompanied by a scratchy, wonkey soundtrack (a la Godzilla) Then the first 10 minutes of the movie had me wondering if I would be walking out, because it is going to be too graphic. But it was nothing like Reservoir Dogs, where I almost did do so. This movie was stylish, sexy, funny and sad all at the same time. The fight scenes were remarkable. Especially one that takes place between Uma and a sexy little Japanese Schoolgirl. Though there were a lot of limbs and heads lopped off, Tarantino made it gory, but ridiculously funny at the same time. This movie is definitely one of the best I've seen this year. Obviously not for everyone (a few people walked out), this film is best not taken too seriously. If you are a fan of old Chinese kung fu movies, and have some knowledge of Japanese animation and the like, you will love all the subtle intricacies in this film.

"MF210","10","1","3","8 June 2004"," My Second Review of Kill Bill Volume 1
","My Rating: **** out of ****. <br/><br/>As I said in my first review of Kill Bill Volume 1, I would write a second review after I saw Kill Bill Volume 2. When I reviewed it I said that I really enjoyed it, yet I had a few complaints about how Tarantino wanted to rip me off and that this was an incomplete film. I said that Volume 2 would have to fill in the holes for me to change my rating. Well Volume 2 filled in the holes and it did brilliantly. However, after seeing Volume 2 in the theater, I had the urge to buy Volume 1 on DVD. So I did and I finally watched it tonight. I must say after seeing Volume 2, it strengthens Volume 1 in an astonishing way. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I would still like to see the films edited into a whole. Volume 1 is an exhilarating masterpiece on its own and Volume 2 brilliantly fills in the backstory, while adding an emotional resonance to the story. But together they might make a masterpiece to challenge Tarantino's top two films: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. There is an advantage to cutting Kill Bill into two films, which has to do with the different tones of the films. However, I think Kill Bill could really shine as one film. We shall see when Tarantino decides to release the DVD. <br/><br/>Some people complain that Kill Bill doesn't have the great dialogue that was in Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and to some extent, Jackie Brown. Well it is true that this is not the brilliant, snappy dialogue that Tarantino penned in his other films but the dialogue here works. It's not the dialogue I delight in hearing in Dogs and Pulp but it fits here. I do not feel it is a flaw like some other reviewers have thought, I think it's an asset. <br/><br/>On the DVD, it is said that Tarantino and Uma Thurman came up with the idea for Kill Bill on the set of Pulp Fiction. Well you can definitely see that here. Volume 1 is their movie (maybe another reason for the split), more people get involved in Volume 2 (David Carradine, Daryl Hannah for example) but this is Tarantino's and Thurman's movie here. You clearly see that in the movie. <br/><br/>Uma Thurman dominates the screen like never before. She carries as much screen presence as any action star and shes got more than enough acting talent required for the role. Other actors in the film, such as Lucy Liu, Sonny Chiba, have supporting roles. From an acting standpoint, this is Thurman's movie and she makes that perfectly clear. Her performance in Volume 2 was the more accomplished one but she is terrific here. Thurman developed the Bride into more of a person in Volume 2; here she is more of an icon. However, that being said, I thought Thurman added some humanity to the role in Volume 1. She is a woman bent on revenge, but I did sense the Bride was a real person. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast offers their support. Lucy Liu is effective as O-Ren. Sonny Chiba should be given credit, he makes Hattori Hanzo into a memorable character for not much screentime. Vivica Fox does a good job in her limited screentime. Daryl Hannah makes a brief appearance and makes an impression. Michael Madsen and David Carradine show up in Volume 2.<br/><br/>This is also clearly Tarantino's film. Volume 1 is packed with style. Tarantino's stylistic techniques here are all creative and don't seem excessive. The slo-mo scene of O-Ren and her crew walking toward us is memorable. The split screen technique is used perfectly in one scene (a homage to Brian De Palma). The most unique technique Tarantino uses is an anime sequence to tell the backstory of O-Ren. The sequence is incredibly violent and beautiful in a deadly way. From a stylistic point of view, Volume 1 maybe Tarantino's most memorable film (although Volume 2 is certainly a contender). <br/><br/>However, it's the action scenes that prove that as a director Tarantino is in peak form. The smaller battle between The Bride and Vernita is handled well. But the showdown at the The House of Leaves is a tour de force. It's just an exhilarating fight scene that bests any fight scene I have seen in years. In fact, the only fight sequence I have seen recently that comes close was the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver in Volume 2.<br/><br/>The fight sequence between The Bride and O-Ren really deserves mention. It was a beautifully photographed and expertly handled scene. It was the most beautiful moment in any Tarantino film. I read a review of Tarantino's Jackie Brown that said Tarantino was not a great visuals director, well I bet they would change their mind after watching that scene. I also credit cinematographer Robert Richardson for making that scene look as great as it did (How he did not receive an Oscar nomination for cinematography, I will never know). <br/><br/>In the end, Kill Bill Volume 1 is just an exhilarating film that is technically brilliant in every area. It does not have much depth (more of that comes in Volume 2), but it's the kind of film that does not need to be incredibly deep. It's the director's work that is masterful here and the leading actress deserves a tremendous amount of credit too. With Kill Bill Volume 1, ""Q and U"" have given us a masterpiece and it is sure to be come a classic."
"danielviam","7","1","3","25 May 2004"," A triumph of style--over substance.
","I'd like to keep this short--so I'll jump straight to the meat. The term originality, so often used in any review of Tarantino's work, should never be applied to this movie. There is nothing NEW here--but such is Tarantino's excellence that even this hackneyed material seems new. The revenges story is as old as Greek tragedy--maybe even older. He even throws in the old, clichéd mother/child motif. Let's face it, revenge drama, even with female protagonists, is nothing new at all. Worse, let's just face it. It's a BAD plot--because we know the outcome. The protagonist might suffer. Might get beat up. Might even fall into a coma for 4 years. But eventually they will WIN--this is never in any doubt. Perhaps this total predictability is why I don't much like this type of film.<br/><br/>The use of continuity in this film was as usual, confusing and jumping through time. The first big fight, killing Vernita Green comes AFTER the climactic death of O-Ren at the end of the film. Hate to tell you Quentin--Brilliant in ""Pulp Fiction,"" boring here. It was new ONCE. Just once is all you get.<br/><br/>Where this film shines is the usual strengths--Quentin's use of Mise-en-scene, character, and of course music. Only Quentin Tarantino can take a scene of O-Ren and henchfolk entering a bar, and make it as heartstoppingly cool as the scene is in this film. THIS is brilliant movie-making--I wish the rest of the film lived up to that level. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the creativity stops there--in endless Homages to all the different fave movies of Tarantino. Spaghetti Western, Hong-Kong Grind, Anime--all here. Unfortunately, I feel that the uses of all these other styles--ultimately leads to no real style of his own.<br/><br/>I realize that Quentin Tarantino did NOT intend this film to be original--it is rather an affectionate nod to styles that have influenced his own style. Unfortunately, I'd rather watch ""Adaptation"" and see something completely new. Perhaps when he finds his own unique style again I'll return to his fold. I can only give this movie 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>PS to Quentin--Good Job At Cannes."
"autumnshowers","3","1","3","11 February 2004"," A very poor effort.
","This is a meandering and tawdry film that keeps you wondering why you are watching it at all.  The director had some good films previously...naturally that is the reason, faith.  But the strengths of his other films are absent here: there are no colourful characters (most are downright implausible), no quirky dialogue (almost no dialogue, actually); there is some action but no suspense; it is like watching a video game played very well from over someone's shoulder.  <br/><br/>I don't know if the few semi-serious scenes are meant to be sincere, because they reek of falsity and dreadful cliché.  Poor Sonny Chiba, he looks like he's doing a Pepsi commercial!  There is a *great* amount of gore, and in fact almost every scene has a particularly nasty element to it; this is much more in the vein of 'Natural Born Killers' than 'Pulp Fiction.'  But story, where is the story? <br/><br/>What story there is, is terribly full impossibilities, too many to list. After a while you just have to guess that it is a kind of dream that doesn't adhere to any reality (except the director's indulgence).  That's rarely a good time.<br/><br/>Did it really take him nearly a decade to make this?  If so, Quentin really should learn to make better use of his time.  Much of this film could have been shot in a weekend (with all the contrived title cards and video effects wrapped up in a month).  Much has been made about choreographed fight scenes, but later I read the script was discarded and much of it was done freeform.  This seems very likely, as most of the fighters just look like stunt men standing around waiting to fall when Uma taps them.  There's just no skill here; no discernable authentic martial arts being done. <br/><br/>
Overall, an insipid and unsatisfying film."
"toocoolo","4","1","3","17 December 2003"," Did I miss something or this movie actually sucks?
","I was quite excited to see Tarantino's 4th movie. I love his previous work! But this movie really sucks, big time. Here's why:<br/><br/>I guess the script can fit in one or two sheets of paper, cause besides from the fight scenes, there's nothing left but a bride trying to have a 'revange' for her murdered wedding day, husband and son. SO? That's not enough to make a decent story; not a 90 minutes one!<br/><br/>Fight fight fight, blood blood blood, swords swords swords. Big deal. Millions of japanese and chinese filmakers have been doing that since who knows when! But even when first Bruce Lee's movies sucked, it was really stunning to see him move and fight. That was the magic! But why did I payed to see this blonde chick fly with cables attached to her waist, fighting against 88 'Katos' at once? This movie just don't make any scence!<br/><br/>Now the good part, here is why its not the worst movie i 've seen: a very small portion of that dark-humor Tarantino's got... its always appreciated! The actresses are really gorgeous! The photography is quite nice with all those bright colors and contrasted combinations. It has some interesting colorfull scenes and camera movements (very creative! but a movie's not made out of that). And the music is great.<br/><br/>The only part that's amazing n' great is the Anime scenes. Those are really great.<br/><br/>But more amazing than the disappointment of this nonsense, bloody, stupid movie, was to see the ratings it got in this website. Whats wrong with you people? Will you applause to everything the media tell you to applause? Or is it just me, who didn't get something? maybe Its not that Tarantino's trying to make a fool out of us; maybe the whole movie was actually a dark joke and its just me who didn't get it."

","OMG! I was incredibly bored watching this two hour cut'em'up film which is the long awaited 'fourth film' for the beloved pop-director Quentin Tarantino. I did get blown away by Pulp Fiction and equally impressed by Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown. But where as his previous films build a lot on excellent characters and their makeshift relationships (for instance), I found nothing of that in Kill Bill vol.1. What is this film about?? Apart from a (unlikely) samurai blonde and her misunderstood misguided search for revenge, this film tell nothing of who these people are or what they do for this 'mysterious' Bill. No plot what so ever! There is a scene where Uma Thurman kills some 50 sworded men which probably goes on for 40 minutes, where I desperately hoped for that bloody scene to end - just because it was so extremely tedious. I felt nothing for any of the characters in the film. A two hour show off from QT who seems to have run out of stories to tell. It is so disappointing since Jackie Brown seemed to be such a mature film in QT's collection, and hoping he would evolve more towards this direction. Off course we must take into consideration that hyped films bring strong criticism, BUT that does not forgive that Kill Bill vol.1 has no story or plot. If you fancy watching some bizarre cut'em'up-gore-samurai film, why not watching the real Japanese thing (or something). Neither does Tarantino bring us something new, nor give us a story or characterization worth watching. The only thing that can forgive QT is IF Kill Bill Vol.2 is so ingenious that it brings the two films together is some new revolutionary body of film. Lets hope so.<br/><br/>P.S I love Battle Royal"
"lastcaress","9","1","3","23 October 2003"," Flawed, but loved it anyway (spoilers ahead)
","So anyway, I went in2 the cinema frankly expecting to be let down by a director who had nothing else to say - hence his exile since '94 (I'm not counting the woeful ""Jackie Brown"" since I can't stand Elmore Leonard anyway, so NOBODY could've made a good job of his material IMO). However, days later I'm thinking obsessively about this movie in a way I haven't experienced SINCE ""Pulp Fiction"", so I guess it blew me away - but with some pretty big ""but""s thrown in there too, so I'll get those out of the way first (and lest I rant and rave overly long, keep in mind that I basically thought that this film was awesome):<br/><br/>First, the whole ""one-long-movie-cut-into-two"" thing. In this respect I agree with most of the critics who didn't like the movie; James Berardinelli bemoans it as ""half a movie that goes on too long"", and he's bang on. From what I can gather, QT wanted to make an unashamed ""grindhouse"" movie, so the simplistic plot, stylised action sequences and campy grue can all be fully justified, yet I'm positive that some sterner editing could've squeezed the entire thing into one three-hour long movie that would've been much closer to QT's vision. In particular, the Sonny Chiba scenes could've been cut down to maybe a fifth or sixth of what they were (and it seems I'm in a minority here; everyone else appears to be hailing Chiba's scenes as the best in the movie). Basically, the plot for these sequences is: The Bride goes to Japan to get a kitana sword from a master craftsman. Now, it's okay for these scenes to play out for a while if what I just described is no more than a basic synopsis of what is actually a much richer tapestry (you know; girl goes to get sword, but then THIS happens, then THAT happens, and so she now has to do THIS, THIS and THAT just to get back to the sword etc. etc.), but there is no more depth to it (and rightly so in a film of this nature). ""The Bride goes to Japan to get a kitana sword from a master craftsman"" is not a basic synopsis of that segment of the film, it's ALL THAT HAPPENS. Yet it goes on and on and on and on... why? I suspect because of QT's naked adoration of Sonny Chiba. The first scene from these sequences is apparantly a ""comic relief"" moment, with The Bride pretending to be no more than an innocent tourist, Chiba and his partner arguing at length in Japanese about who gets to cut the sushi and who gets to make the tea. Yet given that a) The Bride makes her true intentions clear before this scene has ended (thus making her ""disguise"" utterly redundant) and b) the ""comedic"" exchanges between Chiba and his buddy were about as humourous as being run over, this entire scene was a waste of time. It felt like one of those deleted scenes that you see on DVDs all the time. Another scene that could've easily been cut at least by half and probably by considerably more was that whole anime sequence. Now, it could be 'cos I'm just not a fan of anime, but I doubt it since I also understand that that sequence wouldn't have gotten past the censors if shot ""live"", and it's an interesting enough back-story, but still, for my money, it was WAY. TOO. LONG. There are also a few other smaller scenes that could've done with some more prudent snipping - The Bride crying (and crying, and crying, and crying!) upon waking from her coma and realising her baby was gone; yes, very traumatic, and I'm sure worth every second were this a real-time project, but it isn't, and WE GET IT ALREADY! MOVE ON!, and the whole ""Wiggle your big toe"" bit. Snore. The more worrying problem with this precedent for turning one film into two in order to protect the integrity of the director's original vision (so Miramax's blurb goes) is that now every1 will do it, and we'll all forever be paying £13 to watch rough cuts of movies that could've been much tighter and half the price (if the integrity of Tarantino's vision is all that mattered to Miramax,  why didn't they give free tickets to ""Volume 2"" away with every ticket sold for ""Volume 1"", and compensate the cinemas out of their own pockets, hmm?)<br/><br/>Second (and last, actually - remember, despite my ranting, I actually LOVE this film) - the subtitling. Now, I have no problem watching a foreign film, I'm not bothered that half the movie is in Japanese with subtitles; in fact, for the purposes of authenticity, I hate any other option BUT subtitling (you know, like in ""Hunt For Red October"", where all the Russians talk to each other in English, but with Russian accents. Dreadful, shameful). However, in this movie, half the subtitling is entirely UNnecessary. Consider for instance the Sonny Chiba sequences mid-movie; Chiba's character establishes early on that he speaks fluent English, yet as soon as The Bride reveals the true nature of her visit, they speak from that moment on in Japanese. Why?!? I suppose that one could argue that since it's also established that The Bride speaks fluent Japanese that it's just as likely that they'd speak Japanese as English (although I'd have believed more in a Han Solo/Chewbacca-style dialogue in which each person speaks in their own tongue), but consider also that this is a western-made movie which will make most of it's money from English-speaking audiences, and it would've been perfectly acceptable for these scenes to be spoken in English. Worse still are the exchanges between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii. Both protagonists are apparently American, so why are they speaking to each other in Japanese? Personally, I'd have been perfectly happy - given that QT was trying to replicate about a billion chop-socky b-movies - if he'd replaced ALL the foreign dialogue with some deliberately bad dubbing, though I admit that's not so much a criticism as a personal thing that would've been okay by me.<br/><br/>All that said, I thought the rest of the movie was a blast, exceeding my expectations all over the place. The blood is NOT over-the-top and it is DELIBERATELY unrealistic in order to fit into the genre of films that QT is paying homage to. Ditto the sometimes-jarring, quite often too-loud soundtrack, the eye close-ups, the pauses to introduce each principal bad-guy (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad Member: Vernita Green a.k.a. Copperhead), or the obligatory Japanese schoolgirl, Go Go Yubari (some reviewer who just didn't get it was wondering what perverted mind thought that character up; personally, I can't think of any piece of modern Asian pop-culture that DOESN'T include a schoolgirl. And anyway, isn't she just the best thing in the film?)... God, I thought that waiting for ""Matrix: Revolutions"" or, more pertinantly, ""Star Wars: Episode 3"" was bad enough; I'm finding myself having to fight the urge to have a churlish hissy-fit of foot-stamping and pouting at the thought of having to wait 'til February for ""Volume 2""...<br/><br/>Oh, and I'd forgotten how quickly you can fall in love with Uma Thurman if you allow yourself to get lost in her eyes. Thanks Quentin, now I'm dissatisfied with my lot in life all over again...:-)"

","KILL BILL - VOL. I (2003) ****  Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, Vivica A. Fox, Michael Madsen, David Carradine, Michael Parks, Sonny Chiba, Chiaki Kuriyama, Julie Dreyfus.  Quentin Tarantino's fourth film as a filmmaker is perhaps his most audacious (and hands down his bloodiest) in his homage/valentine to the '70s grindhouses that he frequented showcasing martial arts action flicks that this clearly is a nod to with Thurman (clearly relishing the challenge as a kick-ass action star) as a vengeance seeking assassin who was left for dead at the altar of her wedding by the titular Bill (Carradine shown only in fragments onscreen) - her mentor and lover - and their legion of killers including Liu, Hannah, Fox and Madsen; all on Thurman's 'to-do' list in wreaking havoc on all who have spurned her (and lo beholden to any poor soul who gets in her path).  Flashy editing, camerawork incorporating some gorgeous black and white cinematography by ace helmsman Bob Richardson as well as a kinetic bit of anime, Grand Guignol humor and costume design (Thurman's banana yellow running-suit is a knock-off of Bruce Lee's) add to the frenetic pacing and fast and furious blood-letting at hand make for an entertaining if not stomach-churning experience in its graphic novel trappings for pure carnage engaged (particularly the unstoppable 20 minute fight sequence between Uma's THE BRIDE and the Crazy 88s in The House of The Blue Leaves sequence).

"JAKastner","9","1","3","10 October 2003"," The Moose Hole - Review of Kill Bill (Volume I)
","`Revenge is a dish best served cold.'<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's fourth film and the first one since 1997's Jackie Brown takes the theme of revenge like Hamlet on steroids. It has not been an easy road for this generation's `It' director. Tarantino once worked at a video rental store before writing the script for Reservoir Dogs that he later directed. It was his directorial effort in 1994's Pulp Fiction that catapulted Tarantino, as well as the independent film company Miramax, into the Hollywood mainstream. Unfortunately his next film, Jackie Brown, which, by the way, was not written by him, was not widely accepted and then Quentin Tarantino dropped off the scene for nearly six years. In that time period he took time off to act in some films but, for the most part, the idea for Kill Bill had been bouncing around in his skull. Now that idea has burst out of that skull in all its blood spewing, gut splattering glory reuniting Pulp Fiction star, Uma Thurman, with the acclaimed cult director in a film series that pays homage to the 70's karate films that many us grew up with.<br/><br/>The story centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fiancé, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins. They better watch out because here comes the bride! The story for Kill Bill (Volume I) is probably one of the best scripts of the year despite being only half of the true plot. In a wonderful bit of technique, Tarantino starts the film off in the middle of story then backtracks to the events that start the chain reaction of revenge. He then flashes backwards and forwards in several instances that offer the best insight into the characters the audience is about to encounter. This gives better meaning to most of the fight sequences that take place in the course of the two hour feature.<br/><br/>A relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film. Uma Thurman, who starred in Quentin Tarantino's breakout film, Pulp Fiction, once again works her magic for the talented director in probably her best film performance. Thurman gives a witty and exhilarating go around with her role as The Bride seeking revenge against her former colleagues. She presents a style to the character that makes you clamor for her all the way to the shocking break point. Lucy Liu has another kick-ass character performance as O-Ren Ishi, the leader of a group of Japanese assassins. The only problem with this role is that it makes Liu feel type-casted into this sort of character. Not that she bad at it, she's extremely effective in her performance, but you get the feeling that eventually she may get bored with these roles but if it works for her then ignore this comment. Vivica A. Fox doesn't really get to show much acting ability as her character is killed off in the first fifteen minutes of the film but what she does show is her amazing fighting moves, which is the only evidence needed to prove her worth in the film. This is only a small portion of the full cast, the rest of which will appear in Kill Bill (Volume II) coming February 20th.<br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill (Volume I) is a wonderful kick-off point for Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction, despite only being half of the entire feature. Though that being said, there are a couple of things to pick at including the well-choreographed action sequences. It wasn't exactly the sequences themselves but the rather large amount of blood and gut spilling that occurred during them that had more then one person squirming in their seats. Granted having your arm or leg cut off results in a large amount of blood loss but does that blood spew out like a fountain? The campy style of violence that occurs in Kill Bill (Volume I) may seem disturbing as the feature starts off but by the end, it doesn't seem so unnatural, which says something our culture's customization to violence and bloodshed in films. The pacing of the feature seemed well balanced but definitely dragged near the end as the film wrapped in a spin-chilling conclusion for the time being. But other then those small squabbles, Quentin Tarantino gives an eerie insight into what the concept of revenge does to the human psyche and what it could potential lead people to do if not controlled. It is said in the film, revenge is like a forest. Men (and women) can easily be lost in it and lose track of where they started or where they were going, so caution must be taken when start off on this path. The famous cult director starts off with accelerating beginning; let's hope he can deliver on what the chilling twist promises.<br/><br/>My Rating: **** ½ out of 5"

","'Kill Bill: Vol. 1'is a movie clearly made by a man who has utmost confidence in his capabilities as a filmmaker. Tarantino created a world that was virtually hyperbolic but hid underneath it a movie that portrayed the lives of a set of individuals who were to become the part of the vengeance of the woman they hurt once. The roller-coaster of emotions ensued by the humorous but intricate conversations between the protagonist and the soon-to-be victims are nothing short of marvelous and leaves the audience enough clues on what we should really be focusing on.<br/><br/>Speaking of the protagonist, Uma Thurman killed it. She lived this role and gave us a side seat while she ran her 'errands'. The acting from the cast to the music and the direction by the one and only Quentin Tarantino made this movie one of the most important milestones in the world of films and will very likely stand the test of time."
"erwanongemack","9","1","4","21 March 2017"," Kill Bill's review
","As far as I'm concerned, Kill Bill vol. 1 from Quentin Tarantino is the most accomplished movie that he has ever produced. All the ingredients which make the winning recipe of a Quentin Tarantino's film are in the movie : the passion of revenge as theme, non linear progress, bloody scenes, crude and long discussions and choices of music completely quirky but also wonderfully appropriate to the key actions. <br/><br/>The simplicity of the scenario pushed Tarantino to focus on the characters. That is why the casting is very demanding. In Kill Bill, we can notice lots of actors with whom the American producer has worked before. Uma Thurman is one of the most present in his filmography and without her the movie would'not probably have known the same success. Another power of the movie is its references to a lot of kinds of cinema : from exploitation film to « western spaghetti » and include Japanese cinema. From a more technical point of view, I am really impressed by the farming of certain scenes sometimes completely unexpected and totally in accordance with the piped soundtrack. For example, the fighting scene against O-Ren on the song « Don't let me be misunderstood » should be considered as a cinematic work of art. For my last point, I would insist on the advantages of non linear progress. You can indeed insert strange stories which surprise the spectators and force him to recreate the story which he had imagined beforehand. <br/><br/>My opinion is that Kill Bill vol.1 will remain one of the most appreciate action movie of all time thanks to all the elements I have mentioned higher."

","Kill Bill: Volume 1 is the first half of a two-part epic revenge film that leaves you excited too see the 2nd volume after watching it. ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"". Well, one can truly see where that quote is coming from after watching a film like this one. We all know violence is a big factor in Quentin Tarantino movies. But after witnessing the amount of blood and gore Kill Bill has, Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs or Django Unchained don't seem so violent. Sure, the brutal action plays a major part in this film however; it's not just that. It's the gripping characters, the memorable quotes, Lucy Liu & Uma Thurman's performances, and of course, the storyline that makes Kill Bill Vol. 1 definitely worth watching."

","So, I actually got around to watching Kill Bill. As a martial arts film buff, I scour the internet looking for decent copies of DVDs in my region to watch. And for sometime, I kid you not, there was no copy in my region until now!<br/><br/>So, I watched it. And I have put in a full review. So sit back, relax and enjoy my review!<br/><br/>Kill Bill is your typical Tarantino movie. Not in the fact it is violent to hell, but it is not in chronological order. Straight off the bat, we find ourselves in a house AFTER the events of the film. The main character (whom we have no name for her), played by Uma f***ing Thurman, enters the house and has this huge fight with another film.<br/><br/>This scene sets the tone of the film; bloody, violent and a thirst of revenge from the main character. Throughout the film, we see parts of the main character's past, and find out she was left at the alter by 'Bill' who also killed her unborn child and now she is on a thirst for revenge. But she wants total revenge; against the assassin guild they used to work for.<br/><br/>The character - from here on out called The Bride - travels to fetch a sword made by a master swordsmen to take out O-Ren Ishii; target 1 (this is where we find out the opening scene has not happened yet!).<br/><br/>So, we get to this f***ing long fight scene between The Bride and O- Ren's gang, The Crazy 88. And as Uma Thurman fights, it is bloody, awesome and some of the best choreography ever! Also, fun fact; the blood used is a condom, filled with fake blood that explode on touch!<br/><br/>I won't spoil the ending, but it is awesome! And part two is just even more awesome!<br/><br/>9.8/10"

"williampsamuel","10","1","4","8 December 2014"," Quentin Tarantino's tribute to Hong Kong cinema is a martial arts masterpiece
","Many complain, often rightly, that most movies today are nothing but gratuitous violence and language. And Kill Bill is by far the most violent film I have ever seen. But there is nothing gratuitous about even a single moment. This is blood, gore, and casual ultra-violence used not only to shock and titillate, but to create a work of art.<br/><br/>Never has bloodshed been so spell-bindingly beautiful. As Pulp Fiction was Tarantino's love letter to American popular culture and low budget movies, so Kill Bill is his love letter to the blood drenched cinema of Hong Kong And of course, what better way to pay homage to the shockingly violent martial arts movies and gangster flicks of the Far East than with the ultimate revenge fantasy. And there could sure be no one more deserving of revenge then the Bride, who was betrayed and left for dead by her mentor and fellow assassins on her wedding day. So after four years of recovery, nothing can stop her tracking down the people who did this to her and wreaking vengeance upon them.<br/><br/>By my count, at least half of this movie consisted of fight scenes. And they are some of the greatest fight scenes ever put on film. The speed and skill of the combatants far surpasses anything I have seen. The movements of the Bride and her enemies are like a lethal dance, with each attack, parry, and evasion flowing beautifully and seamlessly into the next with exquisite precision. At times, the fighters circle slowly, gauging each other, testing their defenses, outwardly calm but with every muscle tensed for the coming strike. At others points, they put everything into the attack, launching series of blows too rapid for the eye to follow, or engage in sensuous twists and back flips that carry them just beyond the reach of their opponents blade. To see them fight is to fall in love with them and their art, and to be almost ashamed at having done so.<br/><br/>Nor does the movie ever flinch from showing the sheer brutality of combat. I can't remember a movie with more blood than this one. Blood soaks the clothing of the Bride and her former colleagues as they fight, drips from each cut they inflict on each other. It coats the walls and sprays a crimson mist as limbs are hacked off and bullets find their mark. And when needed, fantastic geysers spurt forth, showering everyone in the vicinity. At times there is so much blood that the only way the film can duck and NC17 rating is to switch to black and white, which only gives it an air of noir. And every drop is shed for a purpose; whether to add grit and realism, or an over the top feeling of unreality, or even a dose of humor.<br/><br/>And humor is something that Tarantino does very well. He is a master of creating situations and visuals so shocking, so filthy, and so completely unexpected that you can't help but laugh, then wonder if you're right in the head. His choices of music are highly unconventional and often comic as well. For instance, most directors would not use Japanese renditions of American pop classics during the build up to climactic showdown. But here sharp counterpoint between what's playing and what's on screen creates a slightly wacky undercurrent that fits very well with the film's tone.<br/><br/>As usual, Tarantino has packed Kill Bill with references and homages to earlier movies, most of which I missed, being neither a film historian nor a martial arts junkie. The film is naturally split into chapters, which are arranged for maximum impact rather than in chronological order, although not nearly to the extent of Pulp Fiction. There are also vast yet intentional changes of pace, with the action heavy segments being interspaced with periods of recovery and preparation. And in a highly original move, the entire third chapter is an anime.<br/><br/>Kill Bill has very little in the way of depth or subtlety. It is not highbrow by any stretch of the imagination, and no-one in their right mind would show this to anyone under seventeen. But it is thrilling, visually stunning, and simply awesome. This is truly a masterpiece written in blood. Pulp Fiction may still be Tarantino's best movie, but this has to be my favorite."

","It certainly isn't for all audiences; it does not try to cater for everyone, if you know this is not your scene then why watch it and why review it negatively? Kill Bill: Volume 1 is classic Tarantino, it is extreme, it is graphic and it certainly does not hold back. <br/><br/>The direction is perfect, the fight scenes are beautiful, this is film making, this is art. Visually this film is nothing short of Stunning. There is one scene where the lights go out and a fight commences against a light back drop and all we see is the shadows of the fighters, no gore, no CGI, just raw martial arts. Beautiful. The scene where Uma Thurman faces the '88' is perfect, it is a long martial arts scene, probably over 15 minutes long and not at one point does it get boring. Tarantino somehow manages to film that and keep it looking uncluttered and not clumsy, it is very stylish. <br/><br/>Some of the sword fights are filmed majestically – the camera shots used and the way the fights are created is truly breath-taking. The settings/environments are great and so much detail goes into every single scene. The fight scenes of course aren't realistic & the blood looks fake – this is what everybody forgets – it is supposed to look like that. This is Tarantino; he made it to be over the top Kung Fu action flick, a tribute to these films, with of course, a Tarantino twist. Tarantino has got to be the only director who could add this soundtrack to scenes of copious amounts of gore and martial arts yet make it feel normal. <br/><br/>Straight from the opening scene it has an atmosphere; it bursts straight into life and rarely slows down for the duration of the movie. Uma Thurman is fantastic, she really shows off her abilities in this, there may not be a strong script for her to work with but she is extremely convincing during her 'revenge' mission – especially in the action scenes. Tarantino is often known for his script and dialogue writing abilities, this is what often sets his films apart from its competitors. In Kill Bill this is not necessarily the case, the film does not focus on this as such, this time he goes for violence, and lots of it!<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like about Kill Bill was the short animated feature about a third of the way through the movie. Personally, I didn't feel it was necessary but I can appreciate that it would appeal to some audiences. <br/><br/>All in all I don't see the hate for his movie, sure if it is not your genre then you will clearly not enjoy it. If you like Tarantino, you like Martial Arts, you like gore & you like well-acted, well-choreographed movies then I don't see how this won't be a hit with you! The ending is great, and certainly keeps me interested whilst I wait for Volume 2 to arrive.<br/><br/>9/10"

"Al_The_Strange","10","1","4","12 July 2014"," ""Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with Samurai swords...""
","Quentin Tarantino channels the manic, ultraviolent, stylized energy of cheesy kung-fu cinema, Japanese anime, and a slight twist of American westerns, and he uses it all like threads to weave one of the greatest revenge stories ever made. Both Kill Bill movies collectively form a coherent, cohesive, sublime storytelling package; ideally, they should be watched back-to-back to understand every nuance of the story and the characters, since there is so much depth to them.<br/><br/>Even if you decide to watch it separately, Volume 1 doesn't disappoint on its own merits. In fact, this is the most entertaining of the two films; it starts off fast and hard and hardly lets up. It focuses a lot less on words and story-building, drip-feeding the audience just enough to understand what's going on, before diving headlong into a gory rampage (Volume 2 is the opposite, so if it is dialogue and storytelling you're after, you might want to follow up on the sequel). There are a number of good fight scenes throughout the first hour, but the film's last act is a host for one of the longest and finest fight scenes ever filmed. It starts off with a number of one-on-one engagements, before busting all out with a massive one-vs-fifty brawl. The katana-wielding Bride proves herself to be a triumphant heroine, as she hacks and slices her way through an army of enemies, gradually honing in on her ultimate target (who is, of course, a dude named Bill).<br/><br/>If you're wondering what on Earth could warrant such bloodshed, rest assured that the story for Kill Bill is sound. This first film does a marvelous job of using strong visual imagery, flashbacks, and narration to establish the groundwork for this revenge plot. You can really get to feel for the character, given all the torment she suffers under the hands of Bill and his assassins; it makes it easy, and dare I say enjoyable, to watch her rise from adversity and get some payback. At its core, the film brings to life some brilliant characters with a solid amount of depth (especially after watching the sequel, which answers a lot of unanswered questions) and lots of personality.<br/><br/>Even by Tarantino standards, Kill Bill stands as one of the most stylish films made. It features excellent photography, some very unique editing, and plenty of strange artistic effects that help accentuate the film's given style. You can expect plenty of title cards and subtitles flashing across the screen, along with some occasional asides and digressions. One of the most notable stylistic choices will be the anime segment, brought to life by Production IG with a style that's sketchy, but visceral. The film overall carries the same tone and style as a 1970s Japanese gangster movie, and it's cool. Acting is impeccable; Uma Thurman puts on her best performance of her career, for she brings the Bride to life in a way that nobody else can (and she endures a lot of heavy physical work in doing so). Lucy Lui plays it cool as the villain, O-Ren Ishii. Cameos by David Carradine and Sonny Chiba don't hurt either. Every other actor fulfills their parts well, no matter how minor. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes. The film uses a varied mix of music, including a rockin' live performance by the Japanese band the 5.6.7.8.s; it's all pretty darn cool.<br/><br/>Out of the two films, Volume 1 is my favorite. It represents everything I enjoy in films: the slick combination of style, action, and storytelling. For me, it never gets old, and I've grown to love all the characters and nuances of these films. If you can stomach the extreme violence, then it comes highly recommended.<br/><br/>5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"

","I have always been a fan of this film. I have watched it many time and it never gets old to me, it interests me and i really enjoy watching it. Quentin Tarantino films are the type you have to get used to, they do a lot of flashing back and forth but if you can handle that easy then it becomes enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>I think this one is the better one of the two, even though i did like kill Bill vol 2 but it just wasn't as good as this one.<br/><br/>Another thing that was great about this film was that Quentin Tarantino didn't put himself into it. I mean yes he does some good films but he can not act for the life of him and should keep taking a back seat, films are better without him in them. Stick to doing what you do best, your films are GREAT but your acting isn't.<br/><br/>I think this film deserves a 8 out of 10 at least."
"OllieSuave-007","8","1","4","22 February 2014"," Artistically done action movie.
","This is director Quentin Tarantino's action epic, an intriguing story about a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad called ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman), who discovers that she is pregnant with her lover Bill's (leader of the squad) child. The Bride decides to escape her life as a killer, and fled to Texas to marry a young man she met. Raved with jealously, Bill (David Carradine) and the squad guns down the Bride's groom-to-be and members of the wedding party. The Bride is left in a coma, and finds her baby gone after she awakens. To find justice, she seeks revenge on the five members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who destroyed her life.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is based more on artistry rather than substance, as Chinese and Japanese martial arts are heavily emphasized. To exact revenge, the Bride attempts to learn the skills of martial arts, wielding swords and throwing knifes and punches, to carry on her mission. Instead of a flowing plot, this movie is divided into chapters, with each section delving into one of the Bride's mission or trainings and the background of assassin O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and/or her cohorts, which I thought were tastefully done.<br/><br/>The filmmakers really capture the tension and sensitivity when making each chapter, making the audience aware of the danger of the assassins and the Bride's hunger for revenge. Each action scene is thrilling and the part where the Bride and O-Ren Ishii's top bodyguard Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama) is my favorite - extreme, intense and suspenseful. Gogo's character is devastatingly beautiful but mercilessly evil.<br/><br/>One of the most intense action movies I've seen, this film also has a large supply of bloody action with explicit gore, so, there is a huge warning label or disclaimer for people attempting to watch this.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

","Considered as one of Quentin Tarantino's best movies, ""Kill Bill: Vol.1"" is the first volume in a series of two movies, starring Uma Thurman as the Bride, a woman seeking revenge on a past lover, portrayed by David Carradine, for losing her pregnant baby, while ending up in a coma. The entire 111-minute motion picture is filled with well-choreographed martial arts sequences. They perfectly help tell the story in such a visionary fashion, and let's all be honest with ourselves, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is exciting as hell. After her excellent supporting performance in Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", Uma Thurman brings yet another excellent portrayal as a woman seeking revenge to those who ruined her life. Besides Thurman and Carridane, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, and Julie Dreyfus provide excellent supporting performances to add more enjoyment to this motion picture. Filled with creative anime sequences, graphic killing scenes, and scenes filled with blood, ""Kill Bill: Vol.1"" is probably a lot of fun, that you forget where that 111-minute run time went. The first volume of Kill Bill is more seen as a tribute to the classic martial arts movies of the modern era, such as Hong Kong martial arts films, spaghetti westerns, and revenge flicks. Then, we have our movie, and it's awesome! Quentin Tarantino is one of cinema's finest directors, and now he has made another masterpiece after the next. If I had to make a ""favorite movies of all time"" list, this movie has to be around here somewhere. ""Kill Bill: Vol.1"", in my review, ""a thrilling accomplishment, expertly-made fight scenes""."
"Steffi_P","9","1","4","28 April 2012"," ""God will be cut""
","Over the last twenty years cinema, and culture in general, has had a thing for retro chic. In particular, we have developed an appreciation for the charm that lies in things that, even in their day, were considered cheap and shabby. Hence Quentin Tarantino can make a living through the renovation and glorification of the exploitation movie. And also hence he can find some pretty amazing things to make out of it. Having been bolstered by the successes of his first few movies, he was now able to indulge himself in this pure homage.<br/><br/>Much can be made of the scintillating gore and graceful violence in Kill Bill, but Tarantino's direction is marked by both its simplicity and humanity. Unusually, given its subject matter, the visual style here has a lot less emphasis confrontation between two characters (as was the case in the continuous stand-offs of previous Tarantino movies) and more upon individuals and quiet detail, as when Uma Thurman inspects her hands after awakening from a coma or catches her reflection in a Hattori Hanzo blade. And this is all very much to the purpose of the story. Whereas there are no clear-cut heroes or villains in Pulp Fiction, in Kill Bill Thurman's is a character we are really supposed route for.<br/><br/>Strong characters are brought to life by a strong cast. Thurman is able to portray the cool and collected killer, but on top of that she displays both a feminine softness and likable humanity, exemplified in brief moments like that cheeky twitch in her face as she talks about getting the other little piggies wiggling. The best supporting part is that of Sonny Chiba, humorously charming at first, then displaying a calm dignity. Quite impressive for someone who was for the best part of his career a Japanese Steven Seagal. David Carradine, a favourite actor of mine even before cameras had rolled on Kill Bill, is only seen here as a glimpse of gnarled hands, but he packs enough character into those digits to make his presence felt throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Mention must be made of the music in this picture. Tarantino has always picked and chosen diverse pre-existing tunes for his soundtracks, but for Kill Bill the magpie is at his most manic and eclectic. Most of the selections don't make much cultural sense (for example ""The Lonely Shepherd"", which underscores the sword presentation on Okinawa, was performed by Romanian Gheorghe Zamfir) but each fits the mood of the moment, which is what's important. In terms of timing and choreography, he's moulded the scenes around the music and not the other way round, which is a legitimate way of doing things. He's good at it too, selecting images that complement both rhythm and tone. He should make a musical one day.<br/><br/>But above all it is a sense of playfulness that make Kill Bill what it is. All the time Tarantino seems to be giving sly winks to the audience, and such self-reference is made acceptable by the exaggerated comic-book nature of it all. The line ""So you understand how serious I am, I'm going to say this in English"" makes no logical sense, but it does mean that Lucy Liu's coolest speech can be delivered without subtitles. Appropriate meanings abound, like the phone ringtone that plays ""Auld Lang Syne"" (old acquaintance, indeed!). Tarantino has utmost respect for those old exploitation movies, but he recognises their limitations when it came to logic and credibility, magnified here as he tries to cram in one B-movie trope after another. In light of this, he simply has fun with the format, and allows the audience to have fun with it too."

","When this movie was about to be released, I thought about the title - ""Kill Bill"" - and how weirdly cool it sounded, and how effective it was as a mission statement for Uma Thurman's character. Simple, to the point, and right on target - 'get the ba----rd who f----d me up'. Tarantino pays tribute to a wide array of his favorite influences in the picture, and it's a twist to see him in action parodying martial arts and spaghetti Western flicks of the Seventies with more gore and violence than either of those genres ever offered. Did you notice the cereal box that Copperhead Vernita (Vivica A. Fox) used to stealthily ambush The Bride (Thurman) in her kitchen? - it was Kaboom! How great was that? <br/><br/>Tarantino's all over the place with clever nuances like that, in fact he threw in not one, but two references to the Sixties TV cult classic 'Star Trek' with the opening tag line 'Revenge is a Dish Best Served Cold', a favorite Klingon proverb, and later compared Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus) to a female villain from ST. The passage of time only makes these references better for fans who grew up with the same affections as Tarantino himself.<br/><br/>Obviously ""Kill Bill"" won't appeal to everyone, but then again, what picture does. The caveat here would be the sheer violence, decapitations and bloodshed done in a matter of fact style, but oddly appropriate for the story. There's also a sick mentality attendant to the character of Buck and the creepiness of The Trucker in The Bride's hospital room, but without them, the pent up years of revenge wouldn't have been as sweet.<br/><br/>Of course, much of the story is just too fantastic to be believable, but that's probably beside the point. By going for an over the top sword fight at The House of Blue Leaves, the action justifies itself as relentless and vengeful, satisfying the viewer's desire to see The Bride get her due justice. If anything, Part II does even a better job of fulfilling that goal; together they rank as a couple of the best action revenge flicks ever."

","In this fourth production by Quentin Tarantino, viewers are treated to a violent display of Kung Fu and action. The story follows Beatrice (Uma Thurman), a fallen assassin, as she attempts to seek revenge on her former co-workers. After being nearly assassinated and left for dead, she slowly regains her strength and dedicates her days to hunting down the people responsible for her injuries. Not only is does she personally have reason for revenge, but she also believes the members are responsible for the death of her unborn child. She slowly finds the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad; Vivica Fox as Vernita Green, Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii, Dary Hannah as Elle Driver, and Michael Madsen as Budd. As she slowly eliminates the members, she grows closer to her ultimate goal - Bill (David Carradine).<br/><br/>This revenge themed film contains an abundance of action scenes, accompanied with good acting. Those expecting to see a typical action movie will definitely be surprised. However, some may view the combat scenes as over the top and even comical at points. The level of gore is far more than most movies, and could be easily compared to Tarantino's earlier vampire film, ""From Dusk Till Dawn."" As most of Tarantino's films go, this is not your average movie. He always surprises his viewers by implementing interesting cinematography such as his camera angles. During the film, he often uses unusual film angles for effects. For instance, during the first fight scene with Vernita Green, he uses an high, overhead shot during a conversation in the kitchen. Not only does he use this angle, but he chooses to cut off the top of the house to show a view of the walls from above and the full layout of the rooms.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, the Director chooses to use multiple different forms of delivering the story. He begins with black and white format, but later changes to color. Later in the film, the Director even chooses to add cartoon animations into the film. All these different formats offer an interesting viewing experience for the movie-goer that is not typically found in other movies.<br/><br/>This film is definitely not for everyone, but those who want to watch a trained killer hunt down her attackers in an over the top revenge film, then this movie will not let you down."

","Since the first second, this movie will capture you and won't let you go until the equally shocking end. There are not five minutes without a charge of extraordinary elements that shows you the genius mind of the Writer/Director Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>This tribute to the old Asian martial arts movies is without a doubt a modern piece of art. It has a very exquisite photography, one frame describes one thousand things. The Soundtrack like in every Tarantino's film has an important role and fits perfectly. And the performance of Uma Thurman is brilliant.<br/><br/>If you don't like violence or fighting movies you won't be that thrilled, but this isn't any random fighting movie. This film includes an anime sequence which shows in a better way the emotions, feelings and even the souls of the characters, just by looking at their faces. It has a black and white fight scene worthy of an epic movie and a big amount of blood that for some people is not necessary but it is there to create the visual impact that the director wants.<br/><br/>Watching this movie is an experience for every cinema addict and it will makes you think about how revenge can become an obsession and if it is justified."

","Kill Bill is brutally bloody and thrillingly callous from first to last. Waking up after four years in a coma, an assassin (Uma Thurman) wreaks her revenge on the colleagues who betrayed her.<br/><br/>Director Quentin Tarantino's homage to 1970s 'wuxia' martial arts flicks is little more than a slew of dazzling choreographed fight scenes, but his virtuoso technique is constantly in evidence. A self-described 'roaring rampage of revenge', Volume 1 makes good on the promise, barely pausing for breath.<br/><br/>The overall storyline of Kill Bill — a woman seeks revenge on a group of people, crossing them off a list one by one as she kills them — is adapted from Lady Snowblood, a 1973 Japanese film in which a woman kills off the gang who murdered her family. The Guardian commented that Lady Snowblood was ""practically a template for the whole of Kill Bill Vol. 1"". Lady Snowblood was adapted from the manga of the same name written by Kazuo Koike."

Than we have Michael Madsen, who only seems to really act, when Tarantino directs him (yes there is the small role in Thelma & Louise, but apart from that?). We have Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox. Great women, that Tarantino let's loose in this movie. Chiaki Kuriyama (of Battle Royale fame) and Sonny Chiba round up a pretty great cast.<br/><br/>This first chapter of Kill Bill (which originally was planned as one long movie, but was split up into two) leaves you with quite a few questions. One of them being, what is the name of the main character. It seems to be a big mystery and there was a big fuss about it. We only find out in part 2 if it really was worth it.<br/><br/>Jumping a few times in the time-line (past/present), we get a back story and why Uma is doing what she's doing. Still the promised long cut (Vol. 1 and 2 put together as one movie), is still absent and might never see the light of day. It's a shame, because quite a few things were promised.

She goes to Japan, gets Hattori Hanzo sword, and is ready to begin the slicing and dicing.<br/><br/>This is an AWESOME movie. Great Cast (Sonny Chiba? AWESOME!!!!), and great music.

","Again Quentin Tarantino takes on a wild ride where the twists and turns of the movie we believe we can anticipate, but Oh No. True to Tarantino's form the movie twists showing different time frames in the movie for different periods of the the movie. Just like Pulp Fiction, Tarantino causes you to have to watch his movie at least two times to really grasp the flow of the movie. All the while using smart characters and deceptive plot lines. This is a true action movie but unlike most of the traditional Japanese and Chinese movies that showed unrealistic, over-exaggerated moves and weapon play, Tarantino mixes non stop action of say a Die Hard movie with the oriental elegance of a movie on the scale of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Tarantino not only showcases extraordinary sword play and weapon skills but also the tradition and history of the craft of sword making and the passion in which the craftsman make their trade. Again, Tarantino takes his movie to many levels. An absolutely wonderful movie with very few flaws. A Must See. As a fellow Tennessean, it makes me proud to see a person such as Tarantino, who was born in Knoxville, TN., take away the Redneck-Hick stereotype associated with us. Some of us may be Rednecks, but even rednecks are skillful and smart."
"Corsten","10","1","4","13 November 2003"," This film is a frenetic, plotless and overly long mess
","In return for dragging along my best friend to Matrix Revolutions on Monday, I went with him to see Kill Bill yesterday.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I wasn't keen on going; I had expectations of bad filmmaking and low-rent garbage on the menu, since Tarantino was at the helm of this particular project.<br/><br/>But the film I saw was even worse than I had anticipated. Kill Bill is typical Tarantino TRASH, and pretty much without any merit as a piece of cinema.<br/><br/>For starters, it has NO plot. The story is so lame that I find it difficult to believe that it would satisfy ANYONE whose age counts to double figures. Concurrently, I shall skip discussing the 'story', for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>The acting - WHAT acting? What acting are we talking about? The only role given any kind of decent screentime was the part brutally played by Thurman. I don't know, perhaps I'm being a bit harsh - Thurman being a Hollywood star rather than an REAL actress, perhaps it's a little unfair to expect some kind of meritable acting from her? Yes? No? Whatever - either way she delivers a lazy and one-dimensional performance throughout.<br/><br/>Of course, her conspicuous lack of real talent isn't the only reason her part seemed like a cardboard cutout. There's the fact that she plays a stick-thin character - it has NO depth, no backstory, nothing to help you form any kind of attachment with her. She's basically a zombie prototype who delivers her dreadful lines straight from the lousy script with mundane predictability.<br/><br/>And to think that she has the MOST developed character in the film! Everyone else - well, they were nothing more than extras wheeled in from the Hollywood crowd who've yet to hit the big time. There really is no point in discussing their contributions, because, chances are the slipshod props and the poorly designed scenery furniture add more to the film than them. And not just because they have the substantial advantage of not having to reiterate the childish script.<br/><br/>Again, perhaps I'm being too harsh? I mean, what can one seriously expect from a script that reads like it was written by an over-ambitious seven year-old? As ever, Tarantino gives us a screenplay that lacks ANY real depth or talent, but instead gets by on cheap gags and contemporary slang, all dressed up in the guise of ""Cool"". Much like the similarly fatally flawed Pulp Fiction script, the lines themselves are moronic and without meaning in the extreme, but people en masse try to force themselves to like them because ""they're cool.""<br/><br/>I'm sorry to say, but just having a ""cool"" script doesn't mean it's a GOOD script. It is certainly poorly-written and fails to generate any real kind of emotion: no humour, no comedy, no meaning in the slight. It fails to educate, it fails to move. It is just BAD. That means that ANY actor would struggle to deliver a performance that is even half watchable. And the fact that there is NO plot, and only ONE character with more than 15 minutes of screen time only compounds to what we knew all along; to the inevitable conclusion that as before, a Tarantino flick is merely a tyre-worn vehicle for over-the-top and pointless gore and low-rent, throw-away lines.<br/><br/>As for the 'action' in the film, the fights are dubious at best, and sadly the choreographer (who is also responsible for the lauded martial arts in the Matrix trilogy and the mighty Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) has obviously grown exceedingly LAZY in his old age. Time he collected his pension, methinks. Much like the hack (sorry, director) of this regrettable excuse for a film.<br/><br/>Too long has the overrated HACK that is Quentin Tarantino survived off the ill-gained reputation as a real director and someone who knows how to put together a decent film. It's time he  - and his mindless army of fans - woke up to the fact that he knows less about filmmaking than that other HACK responsible for the Star Wars flicks.<br/><br/>In conclusion, what do we have with the first Volume of Kill Bill? A film without a plot, a one pony (sorry, character) led narrative, NO credible performances, a predictably diabolic script, lazy cinematography (thought the snowy garden scene at the end wasn't too bad), a typically out-of-place score, some lame sequence of animation midway, over-long and boring fight sequences (in fact the last 40 minutes comprised totally of one long fight, apart from the laughably conspicuous CG plane) and a film with no conclusion or denouement. There really is NOTHING going for this film, certainly nothing cinematically. But people pretend to like it because it's a Tarantino flick, and because it's ""Cool.""<br/><br/>Please, get a grip. This film is a frenetic, plotless and overly long mess - a real train wreck of modern day cinema which makes Kangaroo Jack look a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Tarantino is still a HACK, never a proper director, and he's a total idiot to boot. If I were to rate this on this site, I'd give it a 1/10, which again begs the option to rate films (like this) a naught out of ten - a score of one is far too generous for a pile of trash like this. Avoid at all costs."

","Quentin Tarantino is one of the five greatest American movie directors alive. Period. His raw talent was never too easy too hide and it simply bursts with the accumulated self confidence in his greatest homage to kung-fu and Hong Kong movie creators, the Kill Bill"" saga. The thing about Quentin that is so seductive is the fact he makes quality movie directing easily understandable to the average viewer. His use of camera lens, his mix of short and long cuts, lighting and flashy colors will overwhelm even those who despise the fight genre he adores so much. The revenge story will be just one step away from parody, casting the Tarantino's trademark dark humor and gore, as well as some great fighting scenes. The one in the Japanese restaurant will just represent the masterclass in action directing. Everything else, the great casting, acting and quality soundtrack will go along the path well lit by the man behind the camera. Kill Bill"" is the best directed movie Tarantino made and one of the best directed movies on the turn of the centuries."
"Leofwine_draca","7","1","5","10 August 2016"," Sit back and enjoy the expertly-choreographed mayhem
","Tarantino's fourth effort and what a build-up; I hadn't seen a film this hyped up and over-covered since the release of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. It's a good movie and even better for those who are fans of the same type of cinema as Tarantino: enjoy pretty much any '70s exploitation movie, from Shaw Brothers kung fu to Japanese samurai, blaxploitation and more, and you'll doubtless enjoy this one. However, this is not up to the level of Tarantino's previous offerings: the plot is wafer-thin and the dialogue is far more sparse than we're used to. His witty repartee is gone, instead replaced with plenty of black humour and more simplistic dialogue. The plot, which feels stretched (perhaps splitting the film in two wasn't such a good idea), involves Uma Thurman working her way through a hit list in a simple revenge drama. Tarantino's idea was to make just the kind of overblown trash movies he loved watching when younger, and he ably succeeded with this frenetic outing.<br/><br/>The movie is packed with action, and very violent action along with it. Japanese cinema is referenced in excessively bloody demises, where arterial fountains are the norm and limbs are chopped off like nobody's business. Elsewhere, you can't help but cheer as Thurman batters and mutilates her way through various killers, rapists, and hired help, and it helps that the actress puts her all into the film, especially physically; I don't think many actresses would be willing to undergo the punishment and unpleasant-looking stuff that Thurman suffers here. Of the other cast members, Lucy Liu makes for an ice cold villain whilst Vivica A. Fox has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it role. Asian film fans will enjoy seeing cult cinema icons Gordon Liu and Sonny Chiba pop up in welcome cameos. Plus there's an endless slew of film references, my favourite being the music taken from MASTER OF THE FLYING GUILLOTINE! The infamous House of Blue Leaves massacre is easily the highlight of the movie, a twenty-minute action set-piece of outrageous proportions. Effects are purely basic, like those used in the '70s, with thankfully no CGI, and it pays off in spades. This film looks bloody and brilliant. It's just a shame that characterisation is so thin; Thurman has a cold heart which makes it impossible to identify with her at all. It's best just to sit back and enjoy the expertly-choreographed mayhem. Oh, and keep an eye out for the excellent anime sequence which fits perfectly rather than being out of place, which I feared it would be."

"FairlyAnonymous","10","1","5","22 November 2014"," An incredibly entertaining movie that is also ingeniously shot with amazing cinematography
","When I first watched Kill Bill I didn't know what to expect. However, upon seeing it I must admit that it is simply ingenious. Kill Bill Vol. 1 does just about everything right. The action is smart, intelligent, and beautifully shot, yet the movie still has bits of humor here and there. What makes the movie entertaining is that it is fully engrossed in the concept that it is a romanticizing martial arts movies throughout the years (and several other genres). This means that the movie can get away with a few things because it is a slightly cheesy movie.<br/><br/>The movie follows the tale of a woman who will simply be known as The Bride. She loses everything at the hands of a group of assassins (whom she was a part of). What makes this movie work compared to most revenge movies is that she LITERALLY LOSES IT ALL. She literally doesn't have anything left except revenge. In some movies the revenge seems extreme, but in this movie it only feels logical in the cheesy world that the film takes place in. <br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of this movie is its camera work. A lot of the shots in this movie are incredibly well done and they really add a lot to the stylization of this movie. The soundtrack is also very good. While there aren't any real ORIGINAL pieces in this movie (like a standard Tarantino movie, it is a stitch work of other soundtracks), they all work very well with the movie's themes. Naturally one would think that having multiple different pieces in one battle (all of different moods) would break the suspense of a movie, but it works here. <br/><br/>A good majority of this movie is simply one giant action set piece... however this action sequence is done perfectly. Just about everything one could want to happen does happen. You have a specific villain in this movie, you have waves of minions, an identifiable right hand man to the villain and other subordinates who are equally as evil as the villain... all die at the hands of our hero. This movie is literally one giant build-up. Everything in the movie builds up to one of the most perfect action sequences in martial arts history.<br/><br/>I will say that I'm glad that they chose a tall female heroine because rarely in movies do you have an interesting female character who ISN'T sexualized AND is also intimidating. In a lot of movies where the female heroine does martial arts, it always looks like the female isn't really that intimidating. She might beat up a bunch of people, but it generally looks like the people she is beating up are just playing stupid to allow her to win. HOWEVER, this movie does it right. Not only is she tall, but she looks stern and determined. She genuinely looks like she could kick-ass. <br/><br/>Overall, a very enjoyable movie. The one stereotype that I don't like in this movie is that it has the classic ""Tarantino rapists"" that are generally southern hicks/truckers and are basically asking to die. It worked in Pulp Fiction, but it is a little annoying in this movie because it didn't add much other than show how much The Bride has gone through."
"alindsay-al","8","1","5","5 November 2014"," A great addition to the Tarantino collection
","Quentin Tarantino is quite a controversial director but I really believe that he is one of the best ever and I love his style with Kill Bill vol 1 being another great film. The story sees a woman called the Bride waking up from a coma with revenge on her mind after she was shot in the head and her unborn child dead from the attack. Now Uma Thurman was attempting to recover from the horrible thing that was Batman and Robin and she was great in this film. She was one of the biggest bad asses ever and really used her acting ability to get across why she id looking for revenge without much info on why. Lucy Liu is the main adversary and she does a good job with the action scenes, and her and Thurman's chemistry was good. However, apart from her the rest of the side characters looked good for the small time they were in the film but they weren't given a lot of screen time probably setting up more screen time in the future. The story is quite basic with her looking for a quest of revenge that was cool but also quite basic, I did really like the twist also that happened at the end of the film. But as I said before there isn't a lot explained and also I hated the anime scenes as I thought they really took me out of the film. The script is just like all Tarantino films with it being fun and witty with the dialogue being great between everybody. The style is also something that is considered controversial but I love it because it is over the top but all the action and story are over the top so it fit perfectly. Overall I don't think this is one of Tarantino's best films but it still is a great film to his library."
"jwxjoel-95-754862","8","1","5","31 August 2014"," Excellent Action Film
","An intelligent style, graphic fighting scenes and an entertaining story make this film a must see. The story mix modern society with ancient martial arts in a fast pace full of adrenaline race to find Bill. The sword fights is an important part of the movie as we see in the past director Tarantino uses sword and Karate/Kun-Fu reference almost in every film he have (In Pulp Fiction's store scene Bruce Willies can pick any weapon but instead choses a sword).<br/><br/>This is a movie with a unique screen write and a story that goes back and forward so we can get the picture when necessary in a way that we understand her reasons to hate Bill so much that will not stop until killing him."
"madventuring","8","1","5","2 May 2014"," Violence.
","Tarantino often reluctantly muses on how violence can be enjoyable in cinema and I don't disagree with him. This film is only improved by its dialogue because the real film experience lies within the well choreographed and exciting fights, battles and scraps that are occasionally broken up with scenes of plot. Of course, the plot itself stands its own ground and doesn't detract from the powerful and exciting sword play. Not Tarantino's best work but certainly not his work, this is enjoyable and not at all childish. Tarantino shows his diversity from his other heavily plot driven titles such as Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>I think an 8 out of 10 is fair."

I don't exist in the ""realities"" these movies present. I don't particularly love Tarantino's everything, and yet, for several years, I consider both Kill Bill-s absolute masterpieces. And yet, this film is about me. It is a story, a dramatic one, artistically put it, exhibiting inner selves and imminent domestic fights, to an absurd level. The level of Irony. And the main reason I'm so excited with these two movies is the fine and subtle irony of violence itself, a violence explaining and contradicting itself. It's like a theory of violence, how to use it in imagines and words, how to exploit it, how to exaggerate it so that one, OF COURSE, will not believe it, how to change it into an answer to... love?, how to transform each part of this chaos of fine ""art"" of killing into a sweet, normal, average family scene and so on. I'm sorry, there is only one movie, one Kill Bill, this double thing is just another trick. We have only one story, with one part, told differently and distinguish."

","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 starts as the pregnant Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) is shot & left for dead in a wedding chapel, however she is not dead & after spending four years in a coma she awakens. She was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad code named Black Mamba, she had decided to leave & her boss Bill (David Carradine) wasn't happy about it so he sent in the other members, Vernita Green AKA Copperhead (Vicica A. Fox), Budd AKA Sidewinder (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver AKA California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah) to kill her. Now she is hell bent on getting revenge for herself & her dead daughter, her first target is O-Ren Ishii AKA Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu) who since become lord of the Tokyo underground...<br/><br/>Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a tremendous film for martial arts & action junkies & is much better then Kill Bill: Vol 2 (2004) in my opinion. The homage heavy ultra violent script moves along like a rocket here unlike it's sequel & contains in abundance everything that lacked. It's excessively violent, it's packed with some fantastic martial arts set-pieces, it has a good story about cold blooded revenge & is just utterly cool in virtually every regard. The character's are good with some over-the-top bad guys, the dialogue is alright & Tarantino has thankfully cut back on the profanity a bit. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 doesn't have any great meaning, it has no message, isn't realistic in the slightest & isn't interested in 'saying' anything as it's main aim is to excite, entertain, show Thurman running around killing lots of people in spectacular ways & pay homage to a variety of genre films. In fact there are more homages & nods to other films in Kill Bill: Vol. 1 than maybe any other film I've seen, you'll never get them all though. How can you not like a film where the entire last twenty minutes is nothing more than a blood filled massacre? That's right, you can't. A top film that is proud to be what it is, mindless violence filled martial arts fun & nothing else.<br/><br/>Director Tarantino turns on the style here big time & again it's so much better than Kill Bill: Vol. 2 in that respect. There's a little animated segment which is in the style of Japanese Anime which looks great, Uma Thurman in her yellow tracksuit with samurai sword will surely become an iconic image, there's loads of poetic wonderfully choreographed sword fights & violence with huge amounts of blood spurting & spraying everywhere in Shogun Assassin (1980) style! There's decapitations, peoples legs are sliced off, wood with nails stuck in it is used to kill, arms are graphically sliced off with with the victims rolling around in agony, people are impaled on swords, sliced up by swords, someone has their eyeball plucked out, axes are thrown & hit people in the chest & forehead, someone is cut in half vertically (Shogun Assassin again), someone has the top of their head sliced off, a mans head is bashed with a door, someones lip is ripped off, there are over-the-top amounts of spurting blood that resemble fountains, lots of sword & knife fights & the body count has to be somewhere approaching the 100 mark. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 delivers the goods but I don't like it when it switches to black and white, I just found it annoying & unnecessary & why didn't they release the full colour version throughout the rest of the world since it was just the American censors that had a problem?<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Kill Bill: Vol. 1 looks great with slick cinematography, great effects, fantastic set-pieces & high production values. The music is very good as well & Tarantino uses it to great effect. The acting is OK but then this isn't really about acting, David Carradine is never seen during this film which I thought was odd.<br/><br/>Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a classic & there's no doubt about it, I love it for it's excessive violence & bloodshed along with it's style & cool revenge plot. It's not very deep or meaningful but who cares? If you don't like violence then stay well away but for anyone else this is a must."

","An elite assassin (Uma Thurman), after waking from a 4-year coma, takes bloody vengeance on those who wronged her. Said assassin had given up her wild ways before being brutalized by former comrades (with friends like these, you don't need enemies, ha-ha-ha). Quentin Tarantino creates a violent tale which might just as well be a fable taking place a hundred or even a thousand years ago, the actual events perhaps slanted or exaggerated by the passage of time. In a sense, this could be a series of incidents taking place now, being told by storytellers in the year 2100, yes? Isn't this what Tarantino is doing - creating new legends for us to talk about and ponder? The characters in these tales do not behave so much like contemporary citizens as they do mythical heroes and villains; they're more like archetypes than real people. They seem more like ideas of how classic figures in a modern setting would act. How about the daughter of the first villain we see our heroine kill? Would she really just stand there expressionless, upon seeing her mother dead on the floor? In the Tarantino universe, she's just a future heroine or villain, destined to exact more vengeance in a never-ending cycle of bloodletting.<br/><br/>The key to making this particular film work is for the audience to buy into the capability of the main character, a female, in dishing out such an impressive revenge. This is not as simple as it seems, even in today's modern film world, if going by box office returns (I'm thinking of ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"" from 1996 with Geena Davis, which should have been a surefire hit; then move ahead to ""Elektra"" this year). It's not that women can't be as mean as men in this regard. They just haven't been able to tap into that sensibility on screen so that audiences can go along for the ride. Tarantino doesn't appear to have a problem conveying that sensibility with his female actors. It may also help that The Bride character here is acting on her maternal instincts, rather than having them work against her, as in other movies. There's nothing quite so primal as fighting for your child, whether for vengeance or protection.<br/><br/>I could go on about the various cinematic tricks Tarantino employs here, such as sudden black & white footage and anime, but the one that really impressed me was his use of music. He plugs in previously known musical bits into his own visualizations and you come away with a new appreciation for the tunes. Though the general thinking is that volumes one and two were originally intended as one film, another masterstroke is having the Bill character faceless and mysterious throughout this first volume. It teases the audience with what's coming in the 2nd volume, especially with that revelation in the last few seconds."
"jpschapira","8","1","5","16 June 2005"," Ladies and gentlemen...It's Quentin Tarantino
","You wouldn't believe the excitement I had as this movie started. You wouldn't also believe why the excitement was: I was going to watch a movie by Quentin Tarantino. I love movies and there must be someone great behind a film when it is promoted as ""the 4th film by Quentin Tarantino"". Already a legend with three films, Tarantino is known for his way of writing (I got to see ""Pulp Fiction"") and above all, his original, if not unique, directional style.<br/><br/>I had the chance to see all of this in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", and more. I don't know why I hadn't bothered to look up for a Tarantino film before; it didn't call my attention. Well, ""Pulp Fiction"" called my attention indeed, as did ""Reservoir Dogs"", but not this movie. Anyway, the thing is that I saw Uma Thurman in black and white, covered in blood, saying some phrases as being massaged by a tissue with the name ""Bill"" in it.<br/><br/>Then there's color, and I realize there's a lot of visual style in the piece. Credits roll, giving us every name except the one from the writer and director (you know who that is), who will appear after the whole ride, so you get is 'his' film. Just to pump things up, we get chapters in black screen (""Chapter one: 2""), and by chapter a blonde woman has killed a black woman. Names are not so precise; when a little girl asks the blonde woman her name, she says it, but we can't hear it because it is muted by a sound effect. The fact is, the movie is not about characters entirely, so it makes no point for us to know the name. However, the blonde (that's of course, Quentin's favorite, Uma Thurman) was known as ""Black Mamba""; but later, when in another chapter we see she could have died at her wedding we accept her as ""The Bride"". Going back, the black woman is Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), and is now dead. She's now a crossed number 2 in a list The Bride has, butThe camera shows a number 1; O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu)What happened to her? And we go to the past.<br/><br/>The script provides a narration by the main character, which will encounter many people and tell us their stories. Tarantino takes the job of letting us know not only The Bride, but everyone involved in what she's doing, of course, in her own words. What is that she's doing you're wondering? She's avenging the people that literally ""took away her life"". There's nothing else you need to know about it. This script doesn't probably contain the refined dialog Tarantino is known for, but he's not going to use that dialog in a film like this; he'll take another elements. Always making references about real life with his unreal characters, Quentin lets you know that he's having fun at the same time he's being serious. He gives freedom to his actors, and that's how they triumph. His beloved Uma is on the perfect note for her character, as is she was made to play it; and I'm just talking about her, because if I name actors, I'll name characters, and I don't want to spoil the interesting story.<br/><br/>In the end, you could consider the movie merely an action film; and even when it is that, it is beautiful. I'm not fan of action, but this has got everything it needs, with personality of course. Tarantino is crazy about violence, letting the blood out of heads, arms and legs. With a lot of intelligence, in a scene where there's a lot of killing, he passes the image to black and white, I think probably because he knows he'll show a lot of blood, and tries to make the journey less painful for us. Until The Bride blinksEverything is colored again. And we enjoy the fights, the environment, the locations, the performances (they used real Japanese actors for the shooting in the country of Japan), the details of a director that doesn't rush time, because he wants the viewer to see how real it can all actually be, in his fantasy; his fable. When he puts ""4 months later"", it's because that time doesn't fit in the final cut; but I think he'll shoot the entire four months if he could.<br/><br/>Don't even talk about vengeance, and The Bride's rage, when Vernita Green apologizes while she's about getting killed, and proposes something like ""getting even"" if she could. ""Don't tell me about getting even"", The Bride declares. ""To get even I wouldn't have to kill you alone; I would also have to kill your daughter, wait for your husband to come back from work and kill him too""."
"spacemonkey_fg","10","1","5","15 June 2005"," Tarantino at his most Tarantinoesque
","Title: Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003) <br/><br/>Director: Quentin Tarantino <br/><br/>Cast: Uma Thurman, David Caradine, Lucy Lu, Vivica A. Fox, Darryl Hannah, Sonny Chiba <br/><br/>Review: <br/><br/>For those of you who have been waiting for Quentin Tarantino to make his big come back after Pulp Fiction look no further because its here! Kill Bill is Tarantino at his most tarantinoesque. Incredible dialog, mundane situations and lots of blood abound. Strap your kimonos on tight because your in for a martial arts flick like no other! The main story concerns Uma Thurma who on her wedding day, and for reasons yet to be explained (on Vol. 2) was shot, beat up and left for dead by her fellow gang members. Not only that but this all happens to her on her wedding day and she is pregnant! She ends up in a comabut four years later when she finally wakes up, all she can think of is REVENGE! In a big freaking way.<br/><br/>What follows is violence and carnage like you haven't seen on any other film. Even by Tarantino standards Kill Bill is very, very damn bloody. Any one cringe at the ear slicing scenes on Reservoir Dogs? Well get ready for some eye-gouging on this one! Remember that scene in Gigli (for those of you unfortunate souls who saw it) where J LO explains that technique for ripping off someones eye with your index finger? Well your gonna see it here it. There's lots of decapitations, chopping off peoples legs, arms or any other appendage for that matter, the grand finale is a blood fest that's worth being recorded in movie history.<br/><br/>Tarantino uses a lot of techniques on this film, that make it more beautiful to the eye. Yup, aside from the fact that this movies themes are downright dirty and violent (hey its Tarantino!) the film looks gorgeous almost in direct contrast to what the movie is about. This is a movie about revenge, killing, ultra-violence and chopping heads offyet it looks sooo beautiful you cant take your eyes off of it. I will go down and say that this is tarantinos best looking film. The movie goes from using Japanese animated sequences to using black and white sequences and then some. There's some very imaginative use of colors in this film.<br/><br/>Have you ever seen one of those Japanimation films that deal with Samurais and ninjas, kind of like ""Ninja Scroll""? Where one persons limb is chopped off and a stream of blood starts to pour out like a water fountain? Well your gonna see exactly that here..only thing this is not animation. Which brings me to my next pointthis film is like a very violent samurai/ninja anime come to life! Its obvious Tarantino is in love with the 70s, that was evident even on Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill is no different. Here Tarantino has made one of those ultra-violent karate movies, where the good guy battles a hundred other bad guys and wins. Also Taratinos love for all things Bruce Lee is there, from Uma Thurmas yellow suit with black stripes (like the one Lee wears on Game of Death) to some of Lucy Lus henchmen looking like Kato (from Lees character on the short lived The Green Hornet TV show), its obvious Quentin worships Bruce Lee and his films.<br/><br/>Then we've got Uma Thurman as 'the bride', all I can say is...she kicks major booty in this role. Sorry but there's no other way of putting it. She is revenge personified! She will go through any obstacles to get what she wants! Even if it means going to Okinawa to get just the right sword and training to get her revenge. She does a great job as The Bride. Lucy Liu is one mean mother as the head of the Yakuza. She is merciless and cold and has one really good and shocking scene in the movie to prove it.<br/><br/>Pour in the usual Tarantino dialog with its flare and pop cultural references and you got yourselves one heck of an interesting film that shouldn't be passed up by no one out there. If your tired of the same-o same-o films with tired plots and dialog, do yourself a favor and see this, because its as fresh and innovative as films get. And for horror fansyou'll love all the blood and guts, trust me the rivers of blood flow on this one! So go check it out! <br/><br/>Rating: 5 out 5"

","Always enjoy a film that is written and directed by Quentin Tarentino, and if you live in El Paso, Texas or have friends living there, you will instantly become interested in a poor bride who appears to be killed along with the entire wedding party and even a poor old organist/piano player from way back when. The film starts off with plenty of flashbacks, scenes from the past and then the future and it seems that everyone is after a mysterious character named Bill played by David Carradine. Bill is not seen very much in this Vol. 1 picture, but he sure hates people and just can't seem to find love, it very well could be the fact that he never found his true love or did find her and she was not feeling the same way about him. Well directed film and a very interesting film which is full of action with plenty of sword action when you least expect it. Enjoy"

"jgusw","6","1","6","18 July 2004"," Disappointing! Don't believe the hype!!
","I'm going to get to the point: Kill Bill is a let down.  I heard & read great things about this movie, so I was very disappointed while watching it. The story is nothing special.  Lady wants revenge on the people who ruined her life.  But, the story isn't the problem.  No, the problem with this movie is the same thing that the hype is about; the action!  Bottom line: the ACTION SUCKS!!  I've seen a lot of action movies (I love japanese samurai & chinese kung fu movies) and Kill Bill is not great!  Hell, is barely good!  Everything is so exaggerated!!  The action gets so bad that its laughable.  While watching Kill Bill, I would say to myself, ""This is so ridiculous!  It's like watching a bad samurai anime!""  The best part about the movie was the anime part.  That was tight!  I could watch that part over and over.  I don't know what people see in Kill Bill.  Maybe there are millions of people who're just ignorant to the fact that thousands of movies like Kill Bill are out there, that have the same kind of story & action, but do it a hell of a lot better.  If you like Kill Bill, then you are in the majority.  But, for those out there who have seen lots of martial art movies, Kill Bill is a nice movie to make fun of!! Score: 6/10.  Not terrible, just not good neither!"

"Coventry","9","1","7","22 April 2004"," This was definitely worth 6 years of waiting!
","Quentin Tarantino took his time to come with a follow-up for his 1997 Jackie Brown, but the patience of his fans is widely rewarded with this film! Kill Bill is, without any doubt, the coolest film I've seen in a long, long time. It's more than just a film; it's a truly refreshing experience and an almost complete encyclopedia for cinema buffs to admire. How can you tell a dreadful, déjà-vu tale of revenge and still look innovating and original? Only QT knows the answer to this He saw the change to extend a seemly repetitive plot (a woman awakes after a 4 year coma and avenges herself) with loads of tributes to `dead' film-genres, such as Martial Arts-movies, exploitation and Spaghetti-westerns. The results of this are absolutely amazing and Kill Bill is a film to watch over and over again, without EVER growing tired off. On the contraryit'll only get better with repeated viewings. The characters are typically Tarantino, which means delightfully eccentric and criminally insane. The main characters are the very ingenious `Deadly Viper Assassination Squad', led by Bill who's given image to by David Carradine! He's a 70's Kung-Fu legend and Tarantino more or less did the same for him as he did for John Travolta and Pam Grier. Some of the side-characters are highly memorable as well. Gogo, for example! She's a 17-year-old schoolgirl who makes up in madness what she lacks in age. Kill Bill contains less memorable dialogues than previous QT films, but this is widely made up by an overload of terrifically over-the-top violence. The absolute highlights to this being a grotesque finale and a brilliant Manga-tribute. <br/><br/>I simply can't give enough praise to this film. If you like cinema and all of its history, you'll love Kill Bill and that's all there is to it. Every tiny detailed aspect about this movie is worth mentioning. From Daryl Hannah's eye lap with a little red cross on it to the extravagant Pussy Mobiel.  And than I haven't even talked about the brilliant soundtrack!!"
"jboothmillard","8","1","9","23 June 2005"," Kill Bill: Vol 1
","This first part to the two-parter martial arts thriller is very good, especially from writer (also writing is the female star) and director Quentin Tarantino. Basically it is a mixed scene story showing why a bride wants to kill someone called Bill. BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Uma Thurman is The Bride, she has a death list for five people, before she faces main target, Bill (David Carradine). This film focuses on her hospital coma, and killing Vernita Green (Independence Day's Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) with her army of masked swordsmen. Also starring Splash's Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, Michael Madsen as Budd, Julie Dreyfus as Sofie Fatale, Chiaki Kuriyama as Gogo Yubari and Michael Bowen as Buck. There is a fantastic Anime cartoon sequence about O-Ren Ishii's assassin past, with blood splashing everywhere. Even the live fight scenes are like a cartoon, e.g. flying to landings, heads being chopped off, and just as much blood! See it for the violence, its almost hilarious. What also makes it a great film is the multi-genre references. It was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for RZA, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Editing and Best Sound. Uma Thurman was number 95 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Very good!"

I also loved Chiaki Kuriyama in the role of the sadistic teenage schoolgirl Gogo Yubari; she practically steals the movie, no offense to Uma Thurman. Otherwise the recipe for this Tarantino cocktail includes a blend of many things, all of which undoubtedly tickle the director personally - samurai, anime, and martial arts films, along with a generous amount of campy American cultural references, lots of creative dismemberment and blood spray, and some foot shots besides.

"carbuff","6","0","1","27 May 2019"," Too much blood for me--I've got a high tolerance for the stuff, but I'm not a vampire.
","First off, I'm not writing a review for each ""Volume"" of ""Kill Bill"". I'm guessing that most people are going to be like me and watch the whole thing straight through, since it's really one continuous movie. Second, this is the second time I've seen both of them together. If I would have rated it after the first time I watched them, I would have given them a 4, but now I'm upping it to a 6. Disturbingly, I'm probably just getting inured to violence in our world (both fictional and nonfictional). There is absolutely no denying that ""Kill Bill"" is an ultra-stylish film. If you're not such a fanboy that you can't divide Tarantino films into good ones and bad ones, this would definitely fall on the good side of the ledger. But you can never forget that this is a Tarantino film, and it's the bloodiest one that I can think of off hand. I don't mean buckets of blood, I mean Olympic-sized swimming pools of the red, gooey stuff. I know that to some degree, this film is tongue-in-cheek, and, also, that it is an homage to certain films of the past, but for me personally, the gore eventually drowned everything else out. Tarantino likes to claim that he isn't out to glorify violence, but this film puts paid to that nonsense. This is 4 hours of nearly non-stop, bright neon-lit, high-decibel, advertising advocating violence. Nobody is going to be convincing me that Tarantino doesn't have some serious psychological issues, although I'll leave that to others to speculate what those might be. Still, if you want to watch Tarantino at his bloodiest and in near perfect form, you should add this one to your ""must-see"" list (as opposed to misfires like ""Django Unchained"" and ""The Hateful Eight""). I wouldn't be surprised if my stomach is just a bit weak compared to the average movie watcher, and this film won't bother most people at all, which kind of bothers me."
"GiraffeDoor","3","0","4","22 March 2019"," A video game adaptation that skipped making the excellent game
","This is exactly the kind of movie I like. But I struggled to get into this.<br/><br/>I think Tarantino made the error of thinking that a tragic heroine was the same thing as a sympathetic one. I don't know if it's the curt script or Thurman's smug, complacent performance but I found the bride to be a deeply unlikable character. I didn't want to root for her but almost did for the final battle because her opponent was even harder to like. I don't love to hate them. They just annoy me.<br/><br/>This is definitely a pretentious movie in my opinion. Stylized is good. But this movie seems to have no lucidity about itself, it's deadly serious for the most part despite its bombastic plot and content. The few moments of humour just feel jarring and out of place, not because they feel crass but because it makes you wonder why they had the tone the way they did.<br/><br/>So there's stuff like a sudden animation sequence, that's fine. But you can't just shove that in our face as if it's no more expressionistic than just doing a montage. You need to sort of gag your way into it.<br/><br/>This could have been amazing. But the style and the videogame violence (I do really want to play a game with this kind of violence) just fall flat because I don't feel in on it. It's so full of itself and annoying that, no, you certainly CAN see one without the other.<br/><br/>I keep taping Volume 2 but I keep putting off watching it because I have such low expectations for it."
"brettepictale","4","0","3","5 March 2019"," Good but extremely flawed in many ways.
","Before you write to me angrily saying I gave this film way too low of a score, just let me explain my reasoning for the score. Quentin Tarantino is considered a masterful director and one of the best of our time. When I sat down to watch this film I had already heard loads of people praise this movie for its action scenes and linear storytelling. When I finished this movie if I'm being honest I was genuinely disappointed in what I watched. Yes, it was well done, the filming was extremely well done with a great assortment of shots and transitions that as a film student who has studied shot composition and filming techniques, his filming seemed quite impressive. But my big problem with this film is not the filming, its not the actors, its everything he did in the post/editing phase of the film.<br/><br/>Tarantino was obviously going for a stylistic feel for this film but in my opinion, there is a difference between stylistic and just completely random. For example the fight scene at the end that I've heard so much about, and everyone praises and says Its one of the greatest fight scenes in film history was just ruined for me because the film for no reason at all changed the screen to black and white while she fought the giant group of people. I completely understood it for the scenes that were flashbacks, like the scene with Bill shooting her in the head, but this was completely unnecessary in my opinion, in fact, it took away from the fight to make it less awesome to me. The scene was masterfully filmed and choreographed but it was extremely distracting that the screen just went black and white for no reason!<br/><br/>I'm sure there is a reason behind Tarantino doing this and he's explained it later but that's what's wrong with that kind of decision, If you make a decision like that that is confusing, it should have some plot relevance or at least be explained in the film. If I'm confused about a lot of things in the movie but not in a good way, then it isn't a well-written movie, simple as that. There are movies that do that in the industry but it's on purpose to make the viewer think. This was nothing close to that! It was extremely confusing and I still don't have any explanation for why he did it that I can think of. It wasn't just the random black in white scenes that bothered me though, there were the random post effects in the movie that were extremely unnecessary and it also seemed like the film couldn't pick a song and stick with it. I was watching the film with subtitles on and it would tell me whenever they changed the song in certain scenes, for some of them they let the song play for like 20 seconds then switch it to another one especially in the fight scenes. A perfect example is a song: ""Nobody but me"" by the Human Beinz which is a really good song and they started playing it in the final fight scene and I was really getting into it because of that song, then it just changed and threw me as the viewer completely off.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong this is NOT a bad film by any means, the film has some very good parts in it, my personal favorite was actually the animated sequence with the backstory of O-Ren Ishii. It was extremely well animated in an anime type style and was very compelling, it made me feel for the girl extremely, not many films accomplish that from me nowadays and no it's not because I'm a soulless monster. Its because a lot of films skip parts like this, the parts that make you somewhat care for the characters, I'm not saying I cared for the characters extremely in the movie but this scene obviously was there to strike a nerve in the viewer about the main antagonist of the film, and before you come screaming to me: NO! BILL IS THE MAIN ANTAGONIST! I'm gonna say even though this movie is literally named KILL BILL, the main antagonist is not Bill in this film. Bill might be the higher up bad guy in this film but he's barely in it and there is no scene where Uma Thurman's character interacts with him on a face to face standpoint besides in flashbacks. The real antagonist of the story, in my opinion, is O-Ren Ishii. She's in the movie for basically over half of it and the movie literally ends after Uma Thurman's character The Bride kills her. I honestly enjoyed Lucy Liu's performance in this movie as O-Ren Ishii, I couldn't help to laugh at the scene were she cuts of the dudes head without hesitation and then becomes all sweet afterward to the remaining people in the room, she gave me a sweet but extremely sinister feel.<br/><br/>One thing people have found out about the film was that Tarantino had based a lot of it on the 1973 Japanese film Lady Snowblood from director Toshiya Fujita.

"andrewroy-04316","6","0","3","4 March 2019"," A fun, badass action movie with no thought provoking elements
","Kill Bill certainly isn't anything remarkable, but it feels like unbridled Tarantino, with minimal backstory and unnecessary dialogue and lots of blood and action. I like the segmentation of the plot, and the premise is a fun one, if a pretty standard revenge narrative. Some of the choreography in the action sequences is really impressive and a joy to watch, and there's something to be said for watching a dominant heroine carrying the story. It's difficult to get invested between a simple, uninventive revenge plot and no character development to give us reason to connect with and root for the bride. All we know is that this group put her into a coma and she comes out aggressive and intent on revenge, and we don't really get any other character traits beyond merciless determination. Even as the action was well choreographed, of course Tarantino added gratuitous and laughably inexplicable gore, like arms being cut off and spraying blood like a sprinkler. The ending, while dramatically written, lacked any tension as Tarantino's use of nonlinearity was ineffective in showing crucial information early and then the climax is just providing detail of an event that we knew about. I also am cautious of judging volume 1 too strongly as they were filmed and intended as one movie, so the second will have a significant impact on how I view this one. It was a fun action ride but didn't have a creative plot or any character development, rendering the movie flat."

"EddyTheMartian007","7","0","2","3 February 2019"," An extremely entertaining action movie, which could've focused a little more on character development. (Minor Spoilers)
","(Minor Spoilers) Kill Bill is one of the classics from Quentin Tarantino. Honestly it's a little overrated in my opinion. It's not a bad movie at all though, I really enjoyed it. Kill Bill feels like one of those style over substance movies. Not to say there isn't any substance. There are some great character moments, but not enough. In a fast paced action movie there wasn't enough time to fully develop The Bride's character.<br/><br/>The action is absolutely amazing. I mean there isn't much to say, it's just so good. It can be silly at times, but it's shot very well, with barely any shakey cam, and tons of creative shots. It's definitely the best part of the film. I can't praise the action enough. The choreography is great, and there's a ton of style to keep the action looking fresh. There's an anime section in the movie, which was beautiful, and honestly my favorite part. It sets up one of the O-Ren's character very well. I thought her chemistry with the bride was great. You really feel like they were friends, and there's almost sadness when they fight. What is so great about this film is how entertaining it is. The pacing is great, and it barley slows down. There's so much memorable moments and it's so quickly paced the movie feels like a breeze. It's one of those rare movies you could rewatch and not get tired of. This isn't to say the film doesn't have any flaws. I think it does.<br/><br/>My big issue with this movie is how silly, convenient and unrealistic it can be. Obviously this isn't meant to be a realistic film, but there's only so much disbelief I can suspend. I mean she gets out of a populated hospital without being able to move her legs, so she's dragging herself through the hospital, all the way to the parking lot. Also The bride wins most of her fights because of luck. There's 2 times where she was shot, or a knife was thrown at her, and they just happened to miss. A character gets her arm chopped and she stays there for at least 10 minutes without any medical care and survives some how. Also you're telling me that everyone has swords instead of guns? I mean if you're really trying to kill her get some guns. The bride just does things that are humanly impossible, and as far as I know she's a normal human. Also you're telling me that a public place gets attacked and the police never comes?! A person who's supposed to be in a coma, ran away from the hospital, killed some guys isn't being pursued by the police and is able to book tickets to fly to another country. Did she bring her weapons on the plane?! It just doesn't make sense. There's only so much stuff I can ignore, eventually it starts to annoy me. Also I have to mention that some of the sound editing isn't very good. A lot of the sounds are clearly re-used. I mean they used the Wilhelm scream twice. I'm not saying every sound has to be different, but it shouldn't be noticeable.<br/><br/>My final problem with the movie is lack of character development. We just barely know anything about the bride. The beginning actually sets up the plot very well and very quickly, and we don't really need to know much about her, but she needs more character development, and history. I mean how does she know all these martial arts? There's only 2 characters who are set up, the bride and O-Ren. O-Ren was literally shown in a flashback. That anime sequence was seriously amazing though.<br/><br/>I do have to complement the film thought for being so violent and actually really dark. The violence is just glorious. The blood fountains are unrealistic, but it's so great to see. The Action is just amazing, some of the best in all cinema. The fight with the Crazy 88?! Wow. Even the fist fights are great, ripping through walls, breaking everything, grabbing furniture and throwing it at each other. I do have to say the ending was underwhelming though. There's also a ton of hidden dark themes in the film. I'm sure they wanted to delve deeper into them, but the MPAA Ratings wouldn't allow it. That's actually why some of the fights are in black and white or hidden. I did wish they could've delved more into the psyche of the characters.<br/><br/>Anyways in conclusion, I think this is a very flawed movie, it's silly, has a ton of plot convenience, it's hard to believe at times, and there's barely any character development, but I would be lying if I didn't enjoy this film. The direction, sound track, fight choreography, cinematography is just all amazing. The movie never gets boring, and you're always on the edge of your seat. It also has some surprisingly dark moments, and the violence is just glorious. For the last time, that anime sequence was amazing. Kill Bill is a good, but very flawed action movie.<br/><br/>7/10"

","12 October 2003 (revised January 25, 2019). This sometimes innovative, sometimes, daring, sometimes amazing martial arts-revenge thriller comes off as a stylistic choreography of fighting complexity. Uma Thurman, though, seems to escape death more by accident than by skill or talent. The retro-violence is so much over the top that it becomes a reflection of the comic-book and graphic novel version Japanese samurai movies. The flashbacks and animations, the emotional and cute comedic scenes are great. How does Uma Thurman survive her first encounter and how does she accidentally find a weapon in the second encounter and then how does she really fend for herself in a somewhat less than brilliant sword fight in the third. Overall, this was an amazing movie with great blending of some excellent flourishes for old movies with a consistently prominent soundtrack to heighten the whole independent cult film feel, but it misses the perfection mark by a few notches. Eight out of Ten Stars."

"turnssteven","Null","0","1","22 January 2019"," Good film but hampered by the presentation
","Kill Bill commits the cardinal sin of giving the audience only a half baked story and it hurts the film. Throughout Kill Bill, I got the sense that Tarantino thinks he is being more clever than he actually is. This is easily the worst of Tarantino's four features (the other three being Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown). At this point, it's difficult to tell whether the story as a whole is worth telling - that judgment will have to await the release of Volume 2. But, based on what's available for the time being, I can only recommend Kill Bill for die-hard Tarantino buffs and Hong Kong action junkies. Everyone else would do better to stay away and avoid the bitter disappointment of seeing how the greed of a distributor can degrade the movie-going experience. The action scenes are, as expected exciting but the dialogue(Tarantino's strong trait) aren't much to sneeze at."

","The assassination of a wedding rehearsal and it's party makes for one unhappy bride in this acute reprisal story.
If you're into a gritty, action packed revenge tale, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill duology are the films for you. Set in a world where assassins are off the hook and vengeance is a common snack, Kill Bill tells a story of ex-assassin Beatrix Kiddo and her journey to avenge the six members of the deadly viper assassination squad - and at the top of her list, Bill.<br/><br/>The film first opens with the quote: ""Revenge is a dish best served cold."" - Old Kingdom Proverb. And in this fast paced feature, revenge is served on an alluring icy platter - exceptionally glamorous somehow. Tarantino brings a comfortable sense of normalcy to the table when projecting savagery. He didn't fail to keep me wanting more. With eyes casually being plucked out and heads flying through the air, Tarantino does it in such a stunning way that makes it feel customary.<br/><br/>Casting though for this film deserves a worthy award. Uma Thurman's performance as the retributing Beatrix Kiddo was meant for her. Uma Thurman is Beatrix Kiddo. Packed with violent combat scenes and what seems like acrobatics, Uma performs at an olympic level. I was impressed to know that she did most of the stunt work herself. Bill, played by David Carradine couldn't have been played by anyone else. He brought a healthy combination of cynical ruthlessness to the film. As the perpetrator of the plot, Carradine took his role to new heights, tastefully placing monotone language where it fit perfectly.<br/><br/>This high energy two part series were the first movies Tarantino came out with in six years back in 2003, his last film before that being 1997's Jackie Brown. With some similar themes of violence, Kill Bill definitely bit the bullet and pronounced itself with a bang as his new debut film. Kill Bill brought back some of that same colorful sadism we saw in his 1994 crime film Pulp Fiction. His use of eccentric camera angles and saturation made for - I think - his best film(s). The script was as usual, outstanding and the visuals took me on a trip. Tarantino once again has captivated us with his especial film and directing work. I was not disappointed. Even the music throughout the film was tastefully picked out and placed. I was particularly entranced by the placement of Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang"" during the credits, and it's station in this spot of the feature was exceptionally attractive.<br/><br/>Kill Bill hit all the marks in what makes a good action film. Tarantino did an outstanding job keeping viewers captivated and invested (for me at least) in the story. With an exceptional cast, moody filmwork, and a hell of a script, Tarantino executed this story with grace, fiber and healthy barbarity. I was not despondent, I'm a fan."

","I was first turned on to Kill Bill by someone mentioning that Kill La Kill's name was a reference to it. I was instantly interested by the cover, which promised at least one bad-ass girl. What I didn't expect, though, was an absolutely astounding animated backstory sequence and some of the best action choreography I've seen in my life. The movie starts with a fight between the main character, The Bride, and one of her former colleagues. It absolutely blew me away with how enthralling it is and how each part of the house is used to the women's advantages. Later, a massive sword fight of The Bride vs practically one hundred nameless swordsman similarly astounded by the creativity in the action. Each attack seem to be more impressive than the last. The movie tries to maintain no illusions that it's a movie, even having the main character talk to the audience at times and having giant text appear to introduce each character. This allows you to accept more of the insane action to be believable, which is good, because it's some of the most entertaining I've ever seen.<br/><br/>If you enjoy action movies at all, I highly recommend you watch this movie. Personally, I would give it a 9.5/10, maaaybe a 10/10 if a rewatch it and still love it."

It's an awesome artistic work with many cringe moments and interesting plot.
Moreover, music is brilliant and Uma Thurman is truly superb as The Bride. I can honestly say that this is her best role out of her career. Also, really superb in her role is Lucy Liu as The Bride's opponent, O-Ren Ishii. Again, also her best role yet. Daryl Hannah also gives an impressive performance, even if she only appears in one scene. Additionally, the final moments of the film and the build up are quite remarkable. Tarantino utilises his devices including typical Japanese slashers and even spaghetti westerns to culminate in a massively colourful fight scene, but the final confrontation between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii is a beautifully crafted scene and a true powerhouse in filmmaking. Unusual, over-the-top but strangely intriguing, entertaining and overall brilliant."

I am almost certain that Tarantino, during his various works, he tried to gather all the world's experiments in his films, such as his film Inglourious Basterds, Where he made his way out of history, and in this movie he moved to history of Asia to the fighting industry with his violent perspective of the cinema.

","'Kill Bill: Volume 1' is a violent and stylish masterpiece from Quentin Tarantino. From it's opening scene, Tarantino is quite clear with his intentions with this film and tells his audience from the get-go that they are in for a bloody ride. Led by the amazing Uma Thurman, who plays the unnamed role of The Bride with perfection, the first part of Kill Bill consists of glorious fight scenes, excellent screenplay and a compelling, non-linear plot line. Despite the film feeling a little muddled at times due to it's blend of different genres, it ultimately is solid and consistent enough to still consider it as a great film. Tarantino's effective use of soundtrack contributes greatly to the film, with highlights being 'Bang Bang' by Nancy Sinatra and a great cover of 'Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood' by Santa Esmeralda. While many viewers may be repulsed by the over-the-top and gory violence, others can appreciate the glory of it. It can be quite excessive at some points which can seem unnecessary, but this is Tarantino doing what he loves best. The final scenes at the House of Blue Leaves is a breathtaking sequence of fight scenes that is masterfully choreographed and a perfect ending to Volume 1. Tarantino ends this film on a perfect cliffhanger that will have it's viewers immediately wanting to delve into Volume 2."

I have seen all his films and this so far is my favorite dish from him ( including the second volume) . Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and Co. are all memorable and exciting to watch. But the combat at the restaurant is the most mental scene one has ever seen on a movie.

","Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one of the best action movies I have ever seen. At it's core, it's little more than a typical revenge flick. Our protagonist survives a brutal attack and after waking up from her coma, proceeds to go and kill two of the five people on her list. It is admittedly cliche, and Tarantino doesn't even provide us with the full background of what happened to the protagonist and why (at least, not in this volume). But what's remarkable is that Tarantino is able to give meaning to the action even without providing us with the full backstory. This is because of the characters; Tarantino spends enough time on the actual backstory of the villains and the protagonist for us to actually be emotionally invested. <br/><br/>But what really sets this movie apart is how impressive it is in execution and style. Tarantino really perfects style in this movie and makes the action almost like art. Almost every bold move by Tarantino pays off here, and it helps set this movie apart from all the revenge and action movies. You really get the feeling that you are experiencing a master at work, even if the master is doing nothing other than reveling in style and cinematic delight. <br/><br/>The music deserves a special mention, it really does drum up the excitement for the action scenes beautifully and is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a movie."

Indeed, it is the masterpiece of director Quentin Tarantino, who made $180 million off the movie, that keeps people glued to their seats, anxious on seeing the fate of the tale's heroine. For a euphoric 111 minutes of limb chopping, heads flying, and sword clashing, you're in Kill Bill for a once-in-a- lifetime experience. The movie starts with our pregnant protagonist being attacked on her wedding rehearsal by a band of assassins, who used to be her co-workers. The later half of the movie focuses on the bride in launching her revenge, after being comatose for 4 years. The highlight of the movie, I mean besides the non-stop action packed plot, is the actress. Uma Thurman plays an incredible job as a no-mercy bad ass who won't let anything get in her way. In her journey of murder, she encounters several characters, whose actors nonetheless deserve credit. Lucy Liu, the antagonist who acted as salt and pepper to the story, played an outstanding job as a female, Chinese-American boss of the Yakuza. Of course the Yakuza boss had to be a Female Chinese American, I mean, it's Quentin Tarantino, throw all wishes of the ordinary out the window! The cinematography of the movie is no-less than superb. Quentin Tarantino employs a mix of black and white shots, conventional color crisp shots, and a short scene of anime versions of the characters. The background and details are exquisite, with scenes in a big metropolis in one moment, then a traditional Japanese eatery in another. The mixture of different approaches towards the scenes really made the movie unique. Who would've thought from a glance, that a blonde southern US girl is a master of the katana? Kill Bill is a feast for the eyes and mind."

","Nothing in ""Kill Bill"" is original, and this is wonderful, we have Italian and French horror, Chinese kung fu movies, Japanese cinema, trash and even western movies, besides we have at least 15 films referenced here, among them; ""THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE"", ""THE Chinese DRAGON"", and especially ""LADY SNOWBLOOD"", and even ""GHOST IN THE SHELL"", that is, we have a film about movies bringing a Aesthetics and incredible direction and a unique soundtrack. The script even has its surprises, but is very common in its essence, it brings a history of revenge with typical endings of Mexican novels, but the legal one here is not the script that tells the history of the bride who was ""dead"" in its marriage and Which now seeks revenge, but the way it is told, mixing narrative lines, and in this volume 1 we do not have the beginning or the end, we only have the medium with little background's. We do not have a moral treated in the movie, and if we had it it would be cut in half spouting 27 liters of blood in a stylized way playing the only music possible to give perfection to the moment. The high point of the film, besides the references that Tarantino used to compose his work, references that create scenes and makes Kill Bill a movie of scenes, and therefore his separation in chapters is perfect, Tarantino plays with the camera, makes plans Spectacular sequences, makes 360 °, plays shadows, leaves the screen in PB, changes the photograph, changes the graphics, uses against light, does against plongée and plongée, it makes such a great mixture of techniques, that in the end we have a style completely Kill Bill is an unimaginable movie because all these features are used because they are inspired by several completely different films among themselves, in addition to their optimum sound mix and an amazing assemblage-The scene setting of the arrival of the bride to Japan is Incomparable - and all this gives a rhythm and dynamism in the movie that makes the 2 hours look like 15 minutes and make the viewer beg for more. And of course, we can not fail to mention his magnificent soundtrack, where we have from Bernad Hermann to Ennio Morricone, to Nancy Sinatra, the music is a character in the film, because she is always there, present and screaming, besides participating The rhythm of the long, characters and interact with the action, in addition to being wonderful, Kill Bill has one of the best movie soundtracks for me, even if not original. We do not have major highlights in this first volume, but even so, Uma Thurman is fine and holds the role. Tarantino abuses all his expertise in various areas of the film in this film, and proves that film is learned is watching film. Finally, ""Kill Bill"" is a movie that many, many will hate, find it coarse or even silly, but its beauty is intrinsic to the eyes of moviegoers and moviegoers and even those looking for something different. ""Revenge is a dish that is eaten cold"" - old Klingon proverb."

","This is the movie he made after Jackie Brown. I thought I might just point that out. A big budget, larger scale action blockbuster. This is the one that would change the direction of Tarantino's films. And honestly, it might be my favorite besides Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>This movie oozes with style and beautifully choreographed action. This movie has an anime section akin to Japanese anime. That's some cool stuff. Even the non-action parts are some really good stuff. Like the guy from the old Street Fighter movies as Hatori Hanzo and making the Bride's sword. And the fantastic soundtrack. The great opening scene where the Bride gets shot and then the somber ""Bang Bang"" by Nancy Sinatra plays.<br/><br/>But of course, the amazingly choreographed action makes this movie. A lot of it is showcased in the Crazy 88 fight and the few fights before it. It has some brilliant uses of the style. Of course, there's black and white which was actually used to avoid an NC-17, but works very effectively. And the beautifully shot battle between the Bride and O-Ren. No music really adds a lot to it. It's quiet and oh so effective compared to the loud blood fest of the Crazy 88.<br/><br/>But there's also the opening hand to hand fight scene with Vernita Green which is also very well edited. Very surprising scene as it is interrupted by Green's daughter coming home and then they talk. And it starts back again as quickly as it began and then ends once again with a knife to Vernita's chest. What a brilliant tension filled scene.<br/><br/>The movie also never takes itself too seriously. That's for the sequel. But the fun action and style leads the whole way. Also along with Buck, and other fun scenes. Lest we forget other great scenes like the whistle scene as Elle Driver comes to kill the Bride in her sleep. Or interrogating Sophie. ""These will be things you will miss."" I love it.<br/><br/>Honestly, it might be the best action movie of the 2000s, at least for me. And Tarantino has a lot of my favorite movies. Maybe I enjoy his movies a bit too much. But even with that, it's one of the my favorites. Kill Bill Vol 1 gets a 10/10"

","Kill Bill is the fourth entry film from the writer-director Quentin Tarantino. As for a fan of Anime or any Japanese related chattels, this film illustrates these themes thoroughly. This film is radically popular for its hardcore bloody violence that seems as a disturbance for the foretime but diverts into a huge laughter for it's over the top bloody violence. It's passably aware that this violence aren't realistic and a positive is, it knows. Not only does this film make for an enjoyable blood ride, it makes up for a distinctive action flick.<br/><br/>Kill Bill follows a tale of the Bride (Uma Thurman), who was ruthlessly violated, harmed and shot in the head by a bullet from a gun, her baby was vigorously removed from her unconsciousness. After 4 years of coma, she wakes up to seek revenge to all the relatives of Bill, her former husband surrounding an outright of five criminals. Additionally, this plot synopsis may seem undoubtedly familiar as it semblances same cycles from its genre. However, the direction that was prevailed, made a frequent revenge plot very different and alarming. It is separated into two volumes as it is detailed into casual plot points and uncommonly well-written in order to give sympathy for our main hero's success and an intimacy for all the personage. It could be regarded as a pop culture action flick as it has one of the best movie scores that is very commonly and popularly used in most of all action flicks. The Bride sets off a journey to these two enemies O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) who were one of the violators of the five and have a clear relationship with Bill. As we've come to expect in a Tarantino film, there is doubtlessly over the top violence with supreme blood. It may lead the audiences incredibly disturbed, but as the film lunges, it makes us laugh with uttermost laughter for all the bloody violence and gore. It may leave us a feel of oddity and bizarreness and the outcome of being sickened by the absurdness, but it is truly self-aware of its absurdity and extraordinary. In addition, this film has a major appreciation towards Japanese culture, especially its location and a strong usage of 'anime'. Tarantino uses the location very energetically in Japan at a temple like a mansion. Action films nowadays tend to use 'shaky cam' to intensify its tension and hide poor stunt coordinates. In the other hand, this film is the complete diverse of these camera industries. It has a sense of steadiness so we can observe all the action that is proceeding in the scenes. Instead of shakiness, sometimes it has a taste of fast cuts and edits in some sections but handles this professionally. Plus, the movie contains one of the best duel scenes with only Japanese swords with The Bride and the Crazy 88's. It is a jaw-droppingly remarkable sequence that never tries to hinder. Robert Richardson uses the cinematography immaculate with saturated colors and a taste of archaism. Uma Thurman is terrific as The Bride progressively and is splendid to a harmed female character that may empower female roles in movies. <br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill is a very different film compared to mainstream action flicks these days. It may be controversial but the action sequences are filmed marvelously containing tons of bloody violence that may not be for everyone. However, one cannot deny the fact it is immensely entertaining and riveting to watch as a standard action flick and a light-hearted dramatic film. <br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","It's no wonder I fell hard for Uma Thurman when ""Kill Bill"" first hit the scene; The camera is extremely flattering and her sex appeal fits very well in the exploitation film mold.<br/><br/>To me, ""Vol. 1"" is Tarantino at his most watchable. The scrambled narrative, eclectic soundtrack and excessive violence all work together with unparalleled harmony. The characters are as colorful as the palette. But it all really comes down to the revenge angle, and this movie's got it everywhere it counts. The Bride is wronged in the worst way, and her fury is surprisingly satisfying (wasn't sure this would hold up, but it does exceedingly well). Between the bloodsprays and the fight scenes, there's an electrical charge coursing through all of this. That final showdown at the House of Blue Leaves is insane. I used to think that Vol. 2 had a leg up with the character development, but it's hard to compete with something this exciting.<br/><br/>9/10"

I loved the inclusion of Ennio Morricone's ""Death Rides a Horse.""<br/><br/>On the downside, there's an overlong lame anime sequence and the characters lack substance and realism, but who can deny the film's pizzazz?

"Icarus_prime","9","0","2","9 September 2016"," Tarantino dishes out the coldest revenge flick of them all
","I was reminded once again throughout watching this movie of Tarantino's apparent ""foot fetish"", like all his other pictures with those close-up perversions. I'll be like, ""Say what!?"" No matter. It only seems like his idiosyncrasies only serve proof to his leaps of genius towards his ""all-style"" approach. <br/><br/>But he is more than that. <br/><br/>At the same time when those scenes happen (very few luckily), I was reminded yet another thing that Tarantino confidently strikes away the convention that most movies seem to have to choose between action or ideas, style or substance. It is rare for a great movie to do both but it's even rarer that a great movie can balance it with clarity and equilibrium. That elevates a ""great"" movie to a ""masterpiece"". Take for example of those brief scenes where the ""Bride"" sees in viewing distance of her target for vengeance after a quick cut into an overshadow flashback with urgent sounds of the importance and the actions of that target in the past. This is an action flick after all and the general audience doesn't want to waste time with stagnant, regurgitated exposition dialogue to sacrifice the pacing and momentum of the film's kinetic rhythm. Tarantino respects the audience and hence respects their intelligence for films. This intelligence is matched by the man himself. There's without question that he loves and knows the movies, and he exuberantly indulgences those classical homages and tropes as a celebration of the medium; but it always comes second to his classic Tarantino 'flavour' style. We always get a sense of his auteur; his personal creative vision that he's willing to transcend those references into something new and true. And that's the heart of where Kill Bill lies in. Just like so many of his other films, every scene sequence is so meticulously crafted with a sense of purpose and relevance the story and plot while at the same time, being polished to look as vintage as the Bride's ""Pussy Wagon"" vehicle, to give a childlike curiosity and enthusiasm for the movies-lovers to say ""Hey! I know this reference and where it comes from!"" Here's another example of how Tarantino loves to toy with the audience through creating and alternating subversive film expectations: the climax scene of the movie where the Bride fights off the Yakuza bodyguards at the restaurant. Notice how in the first sequence, Bride is only fighting one opponent at the time in a gauntlet-like fashion. There's absolutely no sense of logic in that (why not have all of them fight her at the same time?) which unsurprisingly is found in most action flicks but Tarantino makes us waitonly to spectacularly unleash us the remaining army soon afterwards with a proper sense of logic and purpose. <br/><br/>Tarantino isn't afraid to indulge in experimenting a multitude of styles in respects to the Japanese setting of the movie such as an- anime inspired sequence of O-Ren's backstory; an origin so violent and hyper-stylised that it's almost a disservice if it was live- action as it would dampen its aesthetic appeal. While the previously mentioned fighting climax scene at the restaurant incorporates a black-and- white photography and blue silhouette in order to maximise the ""rule of cool"" formula. But it's simply because it had to get pass the censors (unfortunately). <br/><br/>Above all, a Tarantino movie wouldn't be a Tarantino movie without the use of non-linear narrative. He uses it to great effect in the beginning with the circular narrative going forwards and backwards to add a human element to ""The Bride"", her motivations and a reason why we want to see the ""revenge"" part from the revenge flick in the first place. I'm sure actual ""revenge"" in real life is wrong itself. If we disregard the argument of ""genre"" preferences, sometimes it is how the movie is about and not what it's about. As said before, he doesn't forget the story because he believes an action sequences work better in the service of and around the plot; not the other way. Otherwise, having it backwards gives the illusion of fight- scenes as ""stiff"" and scripted. It's not a coincidence there's chapter titles within the film in the first place.In worst case scenario, Tarantino's over- indulgence might've been too apparent and the story (and structure) would've been nothing more than a technical exercise. Remember, even with most action movies, there's more minutes spent on the non-action scenes than the actual action scenes. Hence, the pacing and effect of the action scenes would be more effective if it had a coherent context in the first place. <br/><br/>Ironically, Tarantino's greatest achievement from this movie is making us forget about this in the first place. That is the sensation he creates. Isn't that why we go to a movie in a first place?"
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","2","10 July 2016"," Not his best, but stylistically impressive.
","This is a great example of how emotional appeal allows us to root for a character. The Bride's murders and mutilations, while they are rather gruesome and cruel, are more acceptable to us as an audience because of her desire for vengeance. But in some ways, you might be able to flip the story around and make the Bride the villain, and have the protagonist be O-Ren. It could almost be an origin story for some kind of last student of O-Ren's dojo that goes after the Bride ten years later or something in an attempt to reinstate the order to its former glory. Or something like that. It might not turn out as good, but it's interesting to think about.<br/><br/>Of the Tarantino movies I've seen (Django, Pulp, Hateful 8, Resivoir) this is the easiest to follow next to Django, which in some ways make it the least interesting to watch. However, that does not keep it from being an entertaining experience, with the constant soundtrack, artsy style, and way over-the-top fight scenes. If you want to study Tarantino for screen writing, you can probably skip this one even though there is some good voice-over and flashback use. But if you want to be a director or DP, you have to see this for educational purposes.<br/><br/>Even by today's standards, this is a pretty amazing action movie. Now we have some grander scale and more visually impressive action movies like Avengers or Kingsmen, but this is still quite a different action movie experience even if its novelty has worn off some in the past decade. Some of the fight scenes are actually funny with their implausible decapitations. In some ways you want to sympathize with the Bride's victims, but you don't really have time to. However, its visual appeal comes through more than just action as it gives us an anime-style flashback scene exposing the childhood of O-Ren. Also, the shot in which the Bride picks up the samurai sword was so powerful that I could almost feel it in my hands.<br/><br/>There is some controversy over the excessive brutality shown throughout. I wouldn't say this should automatically deter you from watching it, but if seeing a lot of blood makes you sick then by all means find something else. How you interpret the portrayal of violence is your deal, and hopefully it works for you, but I don't think it's fair to say that Tarantino is a sick person for making extremely bloody films. For all we know, he's doing it to reduce the violence in the world rather than to promote it.<br/><br/>If you like Tarantino's directing style, you'll like this, but it might be a bit disappointing if you're more interested in his narrative style. It's great if you're looking for an action flick, but not if you want an intriguing story. If you're unsure, watch a couple of chapters and then reevaluate. Just don't expect it to be an emotional experience. Overall Rating. 7.6/10"

","This is a ""timeless"" movie in the sense that director Quentin Tarantino is like a lyrebird, drawing from sources covering different eras in pop culture. The introductory credits reek of 1970s Asian martial arts movies (in fact, the movie seems to represent itself as being the product of such a company) and text on the screen stating that ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"" is attributed to an ""Old Klingon proverb""!<br/><br/>Soon we see what looks like the final moments of a battered bride, just before she is about to be murdered, for some mysterious reason, by a gang of unknown thugs. Early on in the film we can hear Nancy Sinatra sing ""Bang bang (my baby shot me down)"". Having just searched that song, I see that it was initially a song recorded by Cher and Nancy Sinatra covered it in the same year! Tarantino's pop cultural references here are both apt and illustrative of his eclectic approach and ""borrowing"". <br/><br/>Anyway, Uma Thurman's ""The bride"" is not one for dying and we soon embark on her backstory and thirst for revenge. I say ""The bride"", as her name is not revealed to the viewer in this movie. It's odd hearing her name bleeped out when it is mentioned by characters. My attempt at lip reading made me think that her name was ""Patricia"".<br/><br/>Presented in chapters, the movie has The Bride seek all those that would have killed her, in order to return the favour to them...but this time more successfully. As per the title of the movie, ""Bill"" is the one that The Bride must ultimately confront.<br/><br/>Another way that the movie is a fragmented collage is demonstrated when an Asian sounding man takes on the narrating duties for a short stint. Who on Earth is he? Mixing up the temporal sequence/information like this is one way that Tarantino get the viewer to ask questions like mine (that character sounds like he says ""Engrish"" at one point in time and ""English"" just a few seconds later). The order of the movie's chapters isn't even chronological...when The Bride has visited the first thug the viewer sees, we later see her cross that name off her list...but another name has already been crossed off her list...and we did not see that confrontation with The Bride. Also intriguingly, one hears The Bride using the phrase ""does one""...a peculiarly English (toffee) figure of of speech. The Bride also flits between referencing Shakespeare and Star Trek...from eyebrow culture (as Kath & Kim would say) to lowbrow culture.<br/><br/>Patently playful, Tarantino indulges in a backstory for one of the thugs that The Bride is pursuing. That backstory makes use of the cartoon form to inform the viewer, instead of live action flashback. Other times The Bride seems to have access to her would-be killers' personal histories which she should not have (perhaps). It seems to me that Tarantino also has The Bride walk past an actual poster of Uma Thurman at a Tokyo airport! I'm assuming that Uma actually did paid work for that poster before the movie was ever conceived.<br/><br/>Since this movie is ""volume 1"", it's not spoiler to say that by the end of this movie, The Bride has crossed some names off her list. The end credits are also interesting to read too. There's an ""RIP Charles Bronson"" as well as the more mysterious ""Dustbusting David Geoghegan"". Huh? Perhaps most interestingly, the actor Sonny Chiba (who plays Hattori Hanzo in the movie) is later credited with being the movie's Samurai sword adviser. Maybe I'm a bit reticent, but I suspect that the credit stating that the character of ""The Bride"" was created by Q & U refers to Quentin and Uma...but I haven't bothered verify that. <br/><br/>Some puzzles for me: when The Bride wakes from her coma, she looks at the lines on her palm...what's the signficance of that? There's also something weird going on when the perspective on a sniper shot seems to change.<br/><br/>If you're watching this movie on video, maybe check out what The Bride has written on the soles of her shoes! It's near the end of the movie, where there is a glass floor in a restaurant."

Solid, original plot, good character depth, cool dialogue (as you would expect from Tarantino), good action scenes. Good use too of time-jumps, a Tarantino trademark.<br/><br/>Good performances too.<br/><br/>Of the two movies, I preferred Vol 2 to Vol 1 (though there is not much in it - Vol 2 is a 10, Vol 1 a 9). Vol 1 was more about action, with a massive fight scene towards the end. It had plot, but was more the start of a plot, with many loose threads.<br/><br/>Vol 2 had plot development and character development and was less about action (though there was still enough of it). Thus more substance in Vol 2, more style in Vol 1, and substance beats style."
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","26 December 2015"," The Most Ideal Blend Of Quentin Tarantino's Filmmaking Trademarks.
","The 4th film by Quentin Tarantino arrived in two volumes and of all the films that this auteur has made in his filmmaking career, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 remains his most precise blend of riveting story, fascinating characters, pop culture references, wonderful homages & gripping action, all of which is seamlessly brought together by just the ideal incorporation of existing music, to deliver an immensely enjoyable, wildly entertaining & thoroughly fulfilling cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Based on the character of ""The Bride"" created by Q & U (as in Quentin & Uma), Kill Bill: Vol. 1 follows a former member of The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad who, while pregnant & about to marry, is brutally assaulted by her allies and falls into a comatose state. Waking up after 4 years & discovering that the baby in her womb is gone, this deadly assassin goes on a killing rampage to unleash vengeance upon the five people who destroyed her life & killed her child.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill is his homage to numerous film genres, like spaghetti westerns, kung fu flicks, Chinese wuxia, Japanese samurai cinema & even anime, and Vol.1 is simply a revenge bloodbath. The entire picture is expertly narrated from start to finish, makes excellent use of all his trademarks, and is jam-packed with compelling characters, each gifted with a distinct quality. From the beginning to the end, Vol. 1 is one bloody affair that comes loaded with both style & substance.<br/><br/>Vol. 1 is covered in five chapters, each strong enough to stand on its own, and is engaging from the first frame to the last. A particular highlight is the anime sequence which provides the backstory of a prominent character and just about everything in it is perfectly executed. The set pieces are in accordance with the location where its plot is unfolding, even camera is exquisitely employed and makes splendid use of long takes, silhouette shots, greyscale photography, different angles & wide ranging colour tones.<br/><br/>The action is highly stylised, brilliantly choreographed & goes totally bonkers in the blood- splattered sequence before the final showdown and is incredibly fun & amusing to look at. Editing splits the plot into five segments which is then narrated in non-chronological order yet the transition from one chapter to another is absolutely smooth. And finally there is the use of existing music to drive its story as well as viewers' emotions, and in my opinion, it's the best set of tracks Tarantino has put together plus it just works.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 features a terrific cast in Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Julie Dreyfus, Sonny Chiba, Chiaki Kuriyama, Vivica A. Fox & others, in addition to brief appearances from characters that are dealt with in Vol. 2. Leading from the front is Thurman as the Bride and it still remains her career-defining work for she's electrifying, charismatic & flamboyant in the given role. Liu plays O-Ren Ishii, the first on Bride's revenge list and chips in with fantastic performance while Kuriyama easily steals every moment she's present in.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is the most harmonious blend of Tarantino's filmmaking trademarks and is a cinema that works on all levels. Although it only covers the first half of the Bride's blood-soaked revenge saga, it effectively paves the groundwork for the next in line, and succeeds as a standalone movie too. There isn't really much to complain about it for even its over-the-top action & exaggerated blood-filled violence only end up working in its favour and the film as a whole is a pure exemplification of a cinephile's own enthusiasm, passion & love for the cinematic medium. One hundred percent recommended."
"cartesianthought","7","0","4","22 December 2015"," Flashy, provocative and action packed.
","This marks the beginning of Tarantino's shift from crime to revenge. Kill Bill is a lot of things: funny, corny, emotional, action-packed, colorful, avant-garde. It's very indulgent and provocative from the gory action scenes to even dedicating a 15 minute portion of it as an animated comic-book backstory for one of the characters. It definitely takes on provocative subjects.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman gives an amazing performance, beautiful and tough as steel. It's not as high IQ as Tarantino's previous films. But when you have an assassin frantically taking on 20 ninjas in a Chinese restaurant with the 5678's singing the Woo Hoo song, you're having too much fun to care how silly the story is."

","Kill Bill: Volume 1 (2003): Dir: Quentin Tarantino / Cast: Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Sonny Chiba, Julie Dreyfus: Exhilarating action film about revenge in its most determined state. Uma Thurman plays ""the Bride"" who is left for dead by the assassins she worked for. She awakens from a four year coma and trains herself to avenge the death of her unborn child and the betrayal. Extremely graphic with stylish direction by Quentin Tarantino who is quoting from various genres. This adds to Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown among his grand achievements. Thurman is fantastic handling the sword play with skill and grace but ultimately out for blood. Vivica A. Fox plays an assassin with different priorities. She now lives in a suburban neighborhood as a mother, which complicates the emotions of viewers particularly when the daughter arrives home to witness her mother's mistake. Lucy Liu is a great presence whose power in Tokyo is highlighted by animation involving the murder of her father. She is fronted by the Crazy 88's bodyguards as well as the reality that she must face consequences. Sonny Chiba plays a sword craftsman who vowed never to make another sword until Thurman mentions that one name; Bill. Julie Dreyfus plays Liu's lawyer who pays a lethal price for her association. Brilliantly crafted and demonstrates the fueling ugliness of revenge. Score: 8 / 10"
"robsta23","9","0","2","4 December 2015"," Tarantino's Return to Violence
","I have been watching Tarantino's films in chronological order by release date in preparation for The Hateful Eight. After the intricate drama which was Jackie Brown, Tarantino returns to the use of violence with Kill Bill Vol. 1, and he adds so much more violence to the film than any of his previous 3. We have Kill Bill Vol. 1 using violence as a spectacle in many ways, especially in the climactic ""chapter"" of the film.<br/><br/>Like Jackie Brown, Tarantino decides to go with a female protagonist to portray the powerful woman in modern society. Feminism is a large motif in the first part of the whole bloody affair. Yes, The Bride fights men in this film, but the film's main antagonists are strong women who have worked alongside The Bride in the past. The battles are no longer fought by men, guys; the women in this film put men in their place as they are intelligent, maniacal, but above all, simply bad-a**es.<br/><br/>Whereas Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown were more ""intelligent"" films, this one is probably one of the most fun Tarantino movies to watch. It also has a simple premise/motivation which we have seen often before: revenge. But revenge has never been done quite like this. The blood effects in this film are ridiculous beyond any form of rationality, making certain deaths gruesome but at the same time, somewhat pleasing in a twisted fashion. Not only is anime employed to highlight the background of Lucy Liu's character - Tarantino gets away with huge uses of blood in a more ""appropriate"" manner than if he were to form these scenes as live action segments. It also adds to the idea that the movie is supposed to be fun and cartoonish.<br/><br/>Whereas I have discussed that Tarantino uses dialogue in his first three films to build characters, there is not much ""interesting"" dialogue in this film as much as narrations by The Bride, but this film doesn't seem to need the witty, clever dialogue we are so used to in Quentin Tarantino films.<br/><br/>With an astounding cliffhanger of an ending, this film makes you crave for more as the credits roll. This is a fun piece of feminist film to say the least, even if the film is desperate for flashbacks and narration at certain moments.<br/><br/>3.5/4.0"
"isaiahwilson15","9","0","2","30 August 2015"," Quentin Tarantino once again proves why he is one of the best directors of the 21st century!
","For me, Kill Bill was the movie that put Quentin Tarantino on the top of my list for favorite directors of all time. I mean this movie has it all: a brutal revenge story, perfectly choreographed fight sequences, and LOTS of blood. <br/><br/>The movie literally starts out with a bang, and from that point you know your in for a treat. The movie starts out with a great fight sequence that shocks you just 10 minutes into the movie. From there Tarantino effectively uses his nonlinear storytelling to piece together The Bride's back story, and helps provide a reason for her motives. The flashbacks help establish The Bride as an excellent main character, who really connects with the audience on an emotional level. Once the story returns back to the present, the audience feels such a connection with the Bride that they feel compelled to root for her as she hunts down each of her adversaries. But a hero is only as good as its villain, and luckily, Tarantino doesn't forget to include a formidable, and equally dangerous villain. The main villain even gets her own back story leading up to the climax of the film which also ends with bang. <br/><br/>However, Kill Bill Vol. 1 does suffer from a few problems. The pacing of the movie seems uneven at times, as it spends so much time in the past explaining backstory that you get the feeling that by the end of the movie, The Bride really hasn't done much. Also in typical Tarantino fashion, the movie does contain a number of scenes that sometimes proved to be a little too weird for my taste, but hey, thats just his style!<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 1 has it anything and everything you could expect from a Tarantino style samurai movie. Looking past the few flaws of this movie, the viewer really gets to see the raw talent of Quentin Tarantino."
"raginglizardht","Null","0","1","4 May 2015"," Kill Bill Vol. 1 review
","The story of Kill Bill revolves around the female character, Kiddo, played by Uma Thurman. The film starts off with the main character, Kiddo, waking up in a hospital. The viewer can deduce that she has been in a coma for a long period of time. The theme of the story is the vengeance ans cruelty of mankind. That is the focal point of Kiddo's existence at this point and she sets out to avenge herself and her unborn baby. She creates a list of people she knows were involved in her unborn baby's death. Her main goal is to find and kill a man named Bill played by David Carradine. Her first agenda is kill Bill's henchmen, the assassins that tried to murder her at her own wedding. In this film Kiddo confronts two of the assassins, Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii played by Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Lui respectively.<br/><br/>It is a unique film in that the story is broken up into 2 parts and both Kill Bill I and Kill Bill II were created together. Tarantino created this film as a tribute to the classic seventies kung-fu style films. The imagery and art direction are beautiful and have that cheesy style seventies look. This film is over the top and exaggerated but it was what Tarantino was going for. Every character in the film is extremely violent, aggressive, and cruel, with a dark and violent past. This was Tarantino's commentary on the state of the world today. He is not so much promoting violence, but showing the viewer that violence and aggressive behavior is in all of human kind, one only needs to be part of the under belly of society for the aggressiveness to be let out. For example, a scene about the character Gogo Yubari played by Chiaki Kuriyama shows a sweet innocent girl who witnesses the brutal murder of her parents. From this point, she evolves from her innocent stage into a cold-blood assassin who seems to have no conscientiousness at all.<br/><br/>The homage to the classic martial arts films of the seventies can be seen throughout the film. One amazing scene, in which a sword fight is played out in silhouette, shows Tarantino's artistic style, and one feels almost as if he is watching Bruce Lee in action. Another amazing scene is the sword fight between Kiddo and O-Ren Ishii. The setting is beautiful, with a snow-covered landscape. This battle is a direct recreation of the classic martial arts films. Kill Bill also has some memorable stand-off scenes, similar to the classic stand-off scene in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and the remarkable stand-off scene in another of Tarantino's films, Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>Although the film is an ultra violent gore fest, using gallons of blood, it is more of Tarantino's warning to humanity. If we allow the sadistic vengeful side of ourselves to be released, our life will be consumed with hate and a never ending need for revenge against those we feel have wronged us. It is a reminder to all of us, that w have the ability to become like any one of his characters, if we are not careful with our thoughts and behaviors."

O-Ren Ishii (Played by Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Played by Vivica A.Fox) Elle Driver (Played by Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Played by Michael Madsen).<br/><br/>The film shows how revenge is a dish best served cold and how the old saying is true that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned because the Bride is armed with a samurai sword that she gain from Hattori Hanzo (Played by Shin'ichi Chiba)<br/><br/>The film just does a super job with telling a great story with top notch taunts and awesome action scenes. Quentin Tarantino is one of those directors he could touch stones and make them gold.

"shirc","10","0","3","28 March 2015"," The Bride's quest for revenge
","This movie is the story of the Bride, played by Uma Thurman, and her quest for revenge against the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DVAS). The DVAS consists of Bill played by David Carradine, O-Ren Ishii played by Lucy Liu, Elle Driver played by Daryl Hannah, Bud played by Michael Madsen, and Vernita Green played by Vivica A. Fox. The reason that the bride is seeking revenge plays out in the opening scene of the movie when during her wedding rehearsal, the bride and the entire wedding party are gunned down in cold blood. Even though she is left for dead, we quickly find out that the Bride has survived, but she is now in a coma. <br/><br/>The main theme of this movie is the quest for vengeance. The Bride, as well as every other member of the DVAS, seeks vengeance for some wrong done to them at one point or another throughout the movie. As the main character, the Brides quest for vengeance is well established throughout the film. In addition to her revenge, there are many scenes which help to enforce that belief in the Brides ability to exact that revenge. <br/><br/>To help reinforce both the necessity of the Brides quest as well as her ability to complete it, Tarantino uses many different techniques throughout the film. Tarantino uses his tried and true non-linear storytelling method which helps to establish both motive and ability. The flashback scenes, most often done in black and white, give a great sense of past events that have shaped where the movie is heading. In addition to black and white, Tarantino uses animation to help establish other characters motives. Tarantino is also masterful with his use of music. The music through this film helps to set the mood of each scene perfectly. From intense, ominous music when action scenes are impending to more reserved, revelatory music when milestones in the Bride's quest have been achieved, the music that was used in the movie was spot on. <br/><br/>For anyone that is a fan of crime fiction as well as action movies, this is a movie I would highly recommend. This movie is a great example of a person's quest for revenge and the lengths that they will go to in order to achieve it. Obviously, in order to get to the end of the story, I would highly recommend watching Kill Bill Volume 2 after Kill Bill Volume 1 in order to get the entire story as Tarantino intended it to be."
"paticula1135","8","0","2","19 August 2014"," A Brilliant Film (For Tarantino Fans)
","For those of you who have not yet seen this film, I must say that I'd recommend Quentin's other films over it. Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, I feel, are superior pictures, but that's not to say there's nothing in Kill Bill to see. If you've already seen Quentin's other films and love every second of it, Kill Bill is very much in the same ballpark, it's even the same league, it's even the same sport. For those of you who don't like his other films, don't bother with Kill Bill, because it's unlikely to tip you into favouring it.<br/><br/>Now that the shortest part of the review is over, we can move onto the meat of the review. I could give you a brief summary of the plot, but I feel like writing any single bit of it down would almost spoil the movie, because it's not really in chronological order. Instead, I'll talk about a few aspects of it I like. First and foremost, the lead character. Yes, the yellow suit and sword have become quite iconic over the years, and for good reason. She's oddly believable, in a world full of unbelievable things. This is perhaps the biggest joy of Kill Bill. It's full of all these sort of real characters who do unbelievable things, and somehow marries the two things into a seamless whole that somehow crushes one's suspension of disbelief, though Quentin does seem to jump and try to snap that cord in half as he tight walks his way across it. It took me until Vol. 2 to think about how silly some of the things happening were. But I let it slide, because at that point, I knew that I wasn't supposed to be bogged down by realism. This film is meant to be full of ridiculous gore. That's one thing you simply have to understand if you watch Kill Bill. Whether you can detect it or not in the film is crucial to your reception. Normally, I leave people to make their own interpretation of why something is in a film, but in Kill Bill, it's so pivotal that I can't emphasize it strongly enough. There are too many reviews and opinions about Kill Bill that all hinge on the insanity of the violence.<br/><br/>There's a reason for this kind of blood spurting out in five feet high geysers. This entire film is very much a mocking of how we glorify violence, but it's also about honour codes, and to get both of these across, it draws in references to all kinds of older films, particularly kung-fu and samurai films. As well as that, with the samurai sword that the bride makes so much use of, there's a clear indication of the honour code, as the Japanese lords were famous for their zealous following of this code. Furthermore, Vol. 2 draws in Chinese honour beliefs, also very strict and well-known. There's even undercurrents of more western honours, with of course the bride's heritage as American, but also the soundtrack's prominent use of trumpets, bringing to my mind fond memories of the infamous shoot-outs so often captured in Sergio Leone's films, who I very much adore as a film-maker. Now, the glorification of violence comes in with the hugely fascinating usage of blood and gore in the film. It's so ridiculously over the top that it becomes almost funny. And yet, it's still death. And that is perhaps the idea. Death is death, and no matter how you look at it, it's not going to be funny in the end, as demonstrated by the second film, but I won't spoil that just yet. However, it's very close, because there's not a lot more I can talk about with spoiling the film in some regard, or at least in my opinion. So, if you want to jump to the end to read my usual closing statements, feel free to do so now. Alternatively, if you've already seen the film, or don't care about plot (though I think one should endeavour to have surprises in films), then read on.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is about revenge. Specifically, the revenge of Beatrix. Beatrix is the aforementioned bride. She's a former member of an exceptionally well trained group of female assassins, lead by a mysterious Bill. However, we learn that she has tried to leave this behind to marry another man and raise her child, conceived with Bill, outside of the world of murder and violence. This is perhaps what redeems Beatrix for us. She's a considerate mother, and yet a deadly killer. If it hadn't been for Quentin Tarantino's brilliant structuring of the film, it would have been very difficult for us to like Beatrix. All of this stuff is learned piece by piece as the film goes on. Never enough for our appetites for answers to be sated fully, but neither too little so that we lose interest in the film and track other prey instead. He hits the perfect balance in that respect, very much like he does in many of his other films.<br/><br/>There is one small issue I have with Quentin Tarantino's pacing of the film. The Crazy 88's Fight, which is about as fantastic of a finale as you could possibly get, with blood absolutely everywhere, nearly a hundred amateur samurai up against lone Beatrix, and crazy moves galore, this is how the second film should have ended. But after this fight, the second film never reaches that same peak. This somewhat spoils my opinion of the second film, but I stand by the belief that they both have to be watched, even though the first film is definitely superior."
"eeishaan","9","0","2","18 August 2014"," Style does matter
","The movie is essentially a story of revenge of a bride referred to as the 'Black Mamba'(played by Uma Thurman). A church full of wedding guests is turned into a slaughterhouse by a gang of international assassins. A bullet is put through the Mamba's head but unfortunately for them, that only puts her into coma. Four years later, the bride wakes up and realizes that her fiancÃ©, her friends and the child in her womb have been killed. She then embarks on a journey to seek revenge against the people who betrayed her. She first goes to Hatori Hanzo and convinces him to make the famous sword depicted in the movie posters. Having armed herself, she goes on about killing the gang members one by one and saves Bill for the last. Her journey is full of action and not easy, but one enjoys the adamant attitude of the lead character as she fights her way through various challenges. Quentin Tarantino is a genius director and need no certification. The monochrome shots are perfectly placed and give a classic look to the film. The close-up shots and direct narration used in the movie lend an altogether different feel to the movie. One sequence which stands out from the rest is the depiction of O-Ren Ishii's revenge. The whole sequence is an anime flashback and depicts gory details of Ishii's revenge in a beautiful way. The style of the movie is way different from anything you would've seen in a long time, and that's for the best. The movie catches your attention really well and just when you are about to drift away, pulls you back. Many a times, you would doubt whether the bride is really going to achieve her objective or not. The movie speaks volume about style, and movie watchers looking for some different style and great direction should definitely consider this for a weekend watch."

","""Kill Bill Volume: 1"" is awesome in every sense of the word. It's ""Lady Snowblood"" (1973), mixed with other famous exploitation movies such as ""They Call Her One Eye"" (1973). All blended into Quentin Tarantino's talent of taking 1970's or 1980's cheese, and making something unique with his camera skills. The fact that he also continues to execute non chronological storytelling so well, whilst also using both the Quincy Jones's theme from TV series ""Ironside"" (1967-1975) and Bernard Herrmann's ""Twisted Nerve"" (1968), further solidifies my love for this picture.<br/><br/>One thing that really frustrates me to no end, is that this film came under heavy fire from feminists. I understand what the commotion is to some degree, considering the picture is a dark, gritty rape and revenge movie. However, that's kind of what really invested us in The Bride's quest and somewhat fuels our desire to see her succeed, as throughout both volumes the character slowly became regarded as a Cinema icon through the early 2000's for her strengths and independence. Regardless, if it was a man chopping up hundreds of woman, I'm sure we'd hear complaints about that as well. I guess there's no way to win them all, and for those people it remains their loss as they miss out on some really good genre mash ups.<br/><br/>For everything good I have to say I feel that some scenes intend to drag on, but then again that's personal preference. There's something for everyone who's a fan of Yakuza, Samurai, Blaxploitation, Spaghetti Westerns and hey, even Anime. In the end, I'm more than willing to watch through them all just to see how well done those action scenes are choreographed.<br/><br/>The casting is also done extremely well. David Carradine (Most notably from the 1970's cult TV series ""Kung Fu"") is Bill and it's super pleasant to see both Sony Chiba, whose renowned for his Martial Art talent and Chiaki Kuriyama again straight after the success of ""Battle Royale"" (2000), Tarantino's favourite movie since he became a director in 1992. Some of Tarantino's regulars show up, yet hands down the performance from Uma Thurman is what keeps you watching. Recently I looked up a list of female action heroes, and no doubt Tarantino and her input have created a character that would be well within the likes of Sigourney Weaver in ""Alien"" (1979), or Anne Parillaud in ""Nikita"" (1990).<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Tarintino's story of a woman's quest for vengeance is told and shot beautifully. It just gets better with every viewing. 9/10."

","Even if you've never seen a 'Tarantino movie' before, the only thing you need to enjoy this film (and its second part, obviously) is a sense of fun.<br/><br/>'Kill Bill vol 1' centres on the mysterious 'Bride' who is one fifth of a team of assassins. Only the other four, plus mentor 'Bill' doublecross her and leave her for dead. Not a good idea. So... four years later, she begins to get her own back on them.<br/><br/>Like I say, this film is never meant to be taken truly seriously. Yes, it is strongly 'adult' in its content, but everything is beautifully (and knowingly) over the top, creating a comic-book style adventure (for those adults with strong stomachs).<br/><br/>Obviously, Uma Thurman as the central character carries the film on her own, but you won't find a dull or disappointing performance from anyone here.<br/><br/>If you like Tarantino's other work, or just martial arts, adventure or action films in general, you should love this. The only people I can see not liking the 'Bill' saga are those who want a 'hyper realistic' film with its roots based firmly in reality. This is not real. This is fun. And fun is sooo much better than real! Perhaps its only real downer was that it was split (by the studio?) into two parts. This makes both halves just slightly longer than you feel they ought to be. Yes, it certainly forces the cinema-going public to pay twice to watch the story, but there are places where scenes feel they could have been left out in favour of making just the single story."

","When it comes to film making and cinematography this film is a masterpiece. However I cannot give high rating to this movie as the biggest flaw in this movie is casting Uma Thurman. This is suppose to be a martial arts cheesy flick and no matter how you see this movie. It is a fact that casting someone with out any martial arts experience will not look authentic in the end. If you look at her movements through out the movie in action scenes. She was ""soft"". Many of the scenes in which she moving really well is actually her stunt double Zoey Bell who is a black bell in martial arts and also does tae kwon do. Its like casting Justin beiber to do a Van damme movie simply he looks pretty. I am not able to understand Quentin Tarantinos fascination with Uma Thurman and also his Festishes with feet and other things (which are quite evident in all of his movies). If you want to enjoy a cheesy movie with no common sense or continuity then this is the movie for you to watch. If you want to see a genuine martial arts flick, this is not the real thing."
"iyer-shankar1979","8","0","2","25 December 2013"," When the serious and the non-serious rub shoulders with each other
","When the serious and the non-serious rub shoulders with each other in a close borderline fashion, we get to see a certain rare quirkiness. The film Kill Bill as a finished work , simply put is eccentric. Now the serious is not as serious in actuality even within the context of the plot while the action is unfolding, as we seem to assume at first then drop it and then again pick it up only to drop it again. Both alternate in so rapid a manner for us to miss seeing the borderline between the two. So it brings a sort of relief in us from a fiercely farcical tension. Now this is obviously a film without any substance, without a soul so to speak. Or at least the aesthetic is too much on the face for us to see even a semblance of substance in near vicinity. It is for the most part our senses that revel in viewing the action while we are allowed, rather forced to put our finely cultivated sensibilities to rest thankfully for the stretch of the movie. To be sure, the deeper chord it touches upon by being referential to cinematic violence as portrayed in western flicks, martial arts or kung fu films (B grade cinema) does bring a nostalgic feeling of yesteryear cinema-viewing when we were in our schools and were not too serious about matters concerning soul and substance but instead believed innocently in all seriousness with our friends about myths, legends and stories. But then that's a kind of nostalgia we smile away and not hold it for long as what the film portrays or refers back to is such a non-serious, unreal and superficial aspect of our juvenile stage of lives, which is cinema itself. Such aesthetic works presents itself as light as a bird. It flees away with a mocking smile the moment we stare at it with our serious adult killer looks. The technique to achieve this effect is quite clear: which is to go a little over the top, but only this much and no more. The ultra-stylized barbaric scenes of violence portrayed in the film sheds the grossness inherent in any form of real violence instead transforms it to a pulpy something for us to consume and savor. The action moves just about exactly over the top, to make it appear stylish and appealing to our senses. Not just that it also manages not to fall in the pit of appearing all too ridiculous and comical or overtly cartoonish. So we neither could possibly take offence of the kind of violence portrayed nor dismiss it as ridiculously cartoonish. It hovers in the middle somewhere between the two for us not to grasp it firmly.The stylish killer woman warrior and the compassionate creator mother ; The sophisticated don of a violent squad and the father on the floor toddling with his kid. All In a single instance. And that is something eccentric about the film. And as if all that is not enough we also get to hear lines and dialogues delivered in a manner, churned and treated out of a theorized and pseudo-scholarly sort of text, a sublimated-something in contrast to the pulpy-something we find in the action scenes. This is not the controversial & heavy 'profane & the sacred' or even the 'ridiculous and the sublime' but the fair and light 'stylized barbarism & the sublimated prose' (The deadly don treats the childish concept of superheroes with a personal metaphysics!). So much for originality. The film escapes from the eye of both the adult and the child. Instead it appeals to the infant inside every adult, the long forgotten boy or girl inside us which likes to hear mythologies, glee happily to distant-world stories and legends. So we learn that the adult needs to be mature enough to bring the child over to the surface and glee & chuckle childishly while viewing the film."

","Finally spent the time to watch this from beginning to end. I thought the first half of Vol. 1 was great, especially the scenes at Vernita Green's house and at the hospital. So far, so good. Everything was believable and within the confines of reality. However, Vol. 1 really took a turn for the worse once the scene shifted to Japan. It began with the animation sequence which lasted for several minutes. It was several minutes too long. Should've just used some real actors. But what was really disappointing was the whole battle against the 50 to 100 stooges of O-Ren Ishii. That's when the movie became no longer believable. Are we really supposed to believe that one person can take out 50-100 guys? I'm pretty sure even Bruce Lee wouldn't stand a chance against those odds. And all the gravity-defying martial arts stuff was ridiculous too. Therefore, I give this a 7 out of 10. Solid movie that's entertaining enough to make me want to watch Vol. 2, but the animation and the unrealistic fights were a turnoff."

The increasing paranormal activity in their suburban home has you on edge as bangs and screams will be unlike any other horror film out there.

"zardoz-13","8","0","3","6 June 2012"," Carnage a la Tarantino
","Quentin Tarantino's blood-soaked revenge thriller ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" differs from anything the ""Pulp Fiction"" director has ever attempted. Unlike his previous crime movies, ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" doesn't flaunt his distinctive way with dialogue and the characters are nothing like those in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" and ""Jackie Brown."" Tarantino still uses titles to establish locations and he divides this narrative up into several chapters. Although he plots the gritty action out of chronological order, this movie isn't as fractured as his earlier films. Furthermore, ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" isn't as referential as his earlier work. Indeed, the characters don't mention other movies. Nevertheless, ""Kill Bill"" contains other kinds of reference. Spaghetti western aficionados will recognize his use of musical selections from two Lee Van Cleef horse operas, Luis Bacalov's ""Grand Duel"" and Ennio Morricone's ""Death Rides a Horse."" One character whistles the ""Twisted Nerve"" tune that Alfred Hitchcock composer Bernard Herrman wrote as well as Quincy Jones' ""Ironside"" theme. The closest that Tarantino comes to visual cinematic allusions is the yellow outfit the Uma Thurman wears; this is a reference to Bruce Lee. Celebrated Asian stars Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu have cameos. Michael Parks, one of the most underrated of all Hollywood actors, reprises his role as Texas lawman Earl McGraw that he originated in ""From Dusk Till Dawn.""<br/><br/>The first half of this two volume film set features tall, slender Uma Thurman looking for the evil dastards that crashed her El Paso wedding ceremony and butchered nine people, including her husband. Our pregnant heroine was left for dead on the floor at the scene of this blood splattered massacre. Miraculously, The Bride survived this slaughter, spent four years in a coma, and only through the intervention of the man who very nearly killed her, the eponymous Bill, wasn't killed as she lay in her bed when one-eyed assassin Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah of ""Splash"") visits her. The recovery scene in Coma Ward RM 402 of the hospital is similar to but not as suspenseful as a similar scene in the Steven Seagal thriller ""Hard to Kill."" <br/><br/>The first volume follows The Bride (Uma Thurman of ""Batman & Robin"") as she searches for those homicidal maniacs who changed her life forever. She confronts the first in California and has it out with her, Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox of ""Independence Day""), until Vernita's daughter arrives home from school. The two women call a truce just long enough for Vernita to try and shoot her through a cereal box with KaBoom on it. Afterward, The Bride flies to Okinawa where she meets Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba of ""The Streetfighter"") and persuades him to forge her samurai sword like no other to take on O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui) and her army of swordsmen. Reluctantly, Hattori fashions a sword for her, the first sword that he has made since he took a vow 28 years earlier to stop making swords. Part of the reason is that The Bride tells him that he is responsible in part for what has happened to her. Silently, Hattori uses his finger as a pen and scrawls the name Bill on a window pane. He takes a month to create an entirely new sword from scratch.<br/><br/>Basically, ""Kill Bill"" is a duel between The Bride and O-Ren. Tarantino stages some impressive battle sequences, specifically the non-stop fight in a restaurant between The Bride and O-Ren's army of Yakuza killers. You've got to have a strong stomach to handle the gory action as well as some of the unsavory characters, principally a hospital nurse named Buck who allows his friends to have their way with the unconscious Bride until a mosquito awakens her from her coma. Tarantino doesn't something else that he has never done. He has our heroine narrate the rise of O-Ren in the Japanese underworld and depicts her emergence as one of the top Tokyo criminals in anime. ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" concludes on a surprising note."

","Plot Summary<br/><br/>The entirety of the plot in Kill Bill is simplistic. I think it lies within the title itself, ""Kill Bill."" Bill (David Carradine) is obviously a main character. Uma Thurman (Black Mamba) is another main character in the movie that desires nothing more than to kill Bill because he shot her in the head. <br/><br/>The plot involves numerous acts of violence and murder inflicted by Uma Thurman on all her betrayers. Some of these betrayers are Michael Mattson, Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu. She has a sequential list of all the people to take revenge on and Bill is the last one. Theme<br/><br/>I am of the belief that the theme in Kill Bill is plot driven. The actions of the characters are maliciously violent. The violence between these characters is being committed for the simple reason of revenge."

","The part of the film I have chosen is chapter 5: Show down at the House of Blue Leaves. After the Bride (Uma Thurman) wearing a yellow motorcycle jump suit has tracked down O-Ren (Lucy liu) after killing dozens of the crazy 88, the two have a spectacular sword fight in a snowy garden. After crossing swords numerous times, O-Ren is scalped by the bride with her Hanzo sword.<br/><br/>I would say the method of montage used in this scene was metric, as the shot keeps being cut no matter what is happening within the image. By doing this it elicits the most basal and emotional of reactions from the audience. It does also have rhythmic montage in it as well though as when they are fighting the cutting is based on time using the visual composition of the shot. The pace of the scene is really fast going as each shot is not normally more then a seconds this makes it feel like a more of a fight like you are there as in when you are in a real live fight it all happens so fast so this is what I think they were trying to active here.<br/><br/>My opinion of the use of montage and the overall affect and styles is that it works really well from the start of building up the tension to the fast flowing action of the fight that gets your blood moving. I think if it did not of have as many shots in it the effect they were trying to portray would not have worked.<br/><br/>I would describe the links from one shot to another focusing on composition, viewpoint, colouring and narrative as a job well done, it s nicely flowing and it keeps you there. You always know what is going on but at the same time it keeps it interesting, and unpredictable.<br/><br/>I have selected this particular montage scenes as I think it is the best one of its kind, and more importantly it keeps this up al the way throw out the film so you never loss interest and it keeps you wanting more so you are upset that it has ended as it keeps you griped so well."

","There's something not quite right with this film and its hard to put a finger on what it is. The dialogue is sometimes clunky and seems 'copy and pasted' like in the kitchen when the two girls are talking. Then there is the music towards the end of the film when she has the boot open, it's clunky, it seems amateurish and it's deliberate but it detracts greatly from the scene and the dialogue Uma speaks is no better. it's supposed to be tongue in cheek but after repeated viewings its annoying that it's not taken seriously. <br/><br/>Aside from that the story is just non existent. It plays out like a series of set pieces, which is fine, which is in-fact great because many of them are spectacular, funny and very well done. What it loses is real depth, tension and a sense of progression such that when you watch this film again you'll be waiting for your favourite scenes to come up and be annoyed with some of the less stellar ones, like the totally ridiculous and boring hack and slash extravaganza with the 86 gang. having said all that it's well worth watching because a lot of works gone into it. It's original, it's different, it's entertaining and it has a quality to it that is rarely found in most films. But still, it's a little patchy, uncoordinated and flawed."
"Jonathon_Natsis","7","0","1","1 February 2011"," Style over substance: not always a bad thing.
","Before even beginning this review, I think it's important to note that you can't review both volumes of Kill Bill in the same document; the films are just too different. So instead, just like the films themselves, this review will come in a two-part series. For Volume One, individualist director Quentin Tarantino reunites with his Pulp Fiction muse in Uma Thurman for a film that seeks to tell its own story as much as it acts as a self-reflexive work, drawing influence from the kung-fu exploitation genres popularised in 1970s cinema.<br/><br/>The plot is nothing more and nothing less than a straight-out revenge story, as admitted to by the director himself. A former assassin (known only as The Bride) decides she's had enough of the life, changing her name and getting married in a desert town with intent to begin again under a new identity. Naturally, this dosen't sit well with Bill, the head of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad and The Bride's former lover. And so, surviving Bill's deadly ambush at the wedding chapel, our heroine swears revenge against Bill and his minions who can't stand the thought of her retiring.<br/><br/>The film is definitely a case of style over substance, in contrast to Volume Two. Where the sequel offers the majority of the backstory and character development, Volume One documents The Bride's efforts to cross two of the five names off her death list, and is relentless in its depiction of violence and reference to the Eastern genres it imitates. <br/><br/>On that front, Tarantino has done his homework. Basic character models, visually indulgent cinematography (wait for the epic fight scene between The Bride and The Crazy 88) and the very casting of David Carradine (who made a name for himself in television series Kung Fu) shows a genuine adherence to the conventions that are almost exclusive to that genre. <br/><br/>Positively, QT does retain many of the filmmaking techniques that have defined his films as well, including expertly executed tracking shots and a partly non-linear flow to the story. For a film with Tarantino's influence stamped all over it, one area where it is noticeably lacking is the dialogue. Usually very creative in giving his characters 'cool' interplay to work with, there dosen't seem to be as much urgency in this film to give meaning to trough scenes, instead putting all its focus into pure cinematic grandeur. Of course, the unique nature of this film in just about every other category sets it apart from other action-driven blockbusters, but keeps it from being truly great.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is, first and foremost, an exploitation film. Occasionally, you do get the impression that, in an effort to showcase his abundance of film knowledge, QT is limited by the need to adhere to the conventions of the respective genres he is re-imaging to suit a contemporary Western audience. And sometimes, you can't help but sit back and wonder how much more imaginative his films could be if he played more towards the raw, less-operatic qualities featured in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. That being said, this remains a solid film for its duration, succeeding in its goal of both entertaining the audience, and generating interest in Volume Two."

","As far back as I can remember, Quentin Tarantino's movies have always failed to impress me. He is a formalist film maker, with action moves that seem to defy the laws of Physics, Probability, and the US Constitution. However I was really surprised when I saw Kill Bill Vol. 1, because it was the first time that I began to gain some respect for Tarantino. Never before have I ever enjoyed Uma Thurman in a role where she kicked so much ass before. Lucy Liu was good too, but to me it didn't make sense that she would be speaking English to a room full of people who speak Japanese. From beginning to end the film was action packed, serious, and at the same time very funny and well photographed.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I still have trouble watching Quentin Tarantino's movies, and even this one still defied the laws of physics, probability, and U.S. Constitution, but that last one doesn't really apply because the film primarily takes place in Japan, and also the film is so well done that even I as a Film Critic found it very hard not to enjoy myself.

In addition to that, the movie also sets up the next Kill Bill, and it does not give you everything at once.

Striking up a death list of five, she sets off for bloody retribution.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarrantino writes and directs what is in all truth, a homage to all the cinema conventions close to his heart. Think an amalgamation of chop-socky, sexploitation, samurai, spaghetti Westerns, anime and cop shows of years past, and you get the heart of Kill Bill. A film that was so epic in scope it had to be cut into two films. What it lacks in Tarrantino dialogue dynamite it more than makes up for with action and astute visual flair. And it's bloody, very bloody. Thurman is great as the avenging Mamba/The Bride, while the inclusion of Sonny Chiba & Lucy Liu adds a touch of class as QT revels in his East meets West berserker narrative. It could have been trimmed down, particularly in the middle section where Tarrantino deals in a calm before the storm ideal, but Volume 1 was one of the most exciting movies of 2003, and most notably it shows Tarrantino to be adept at action directing. His action skills perhaps explains why the script doesn't crackle with the wit and panache of his previous offerings?

This is one of those films that in my opinion just oozes class.

I don't look for hidden meanings or messages I am not that bright or indeed interested. I have seen various films with less violence in them which I have not liked for all sorts of reasons mostly they are simply not very well made. Therefore I can simply say that for me the violence is in context with the storyline and because it is clear that the cast and crew have given a high level of care and attention to its content I consider it to be a very good film.

","If 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Fight Club' are referred to as the glorious wet dream of the 14 year old community then 'Kill Bill' is certainly the 15 year old equivalent. For the record, I have enjoyed all aforementioned movies, though to certain extents. 'Kill Bill' was released in two volumes but is essentially one movie so it should be judged in that way. It is an action movie that pays homage to; (lets just use wikipedia here) - The movie is an epic-length revenge drama, with homages to earlier film genres, such as Hong Kong martial arts movies, Japanese Chanbara films, exploitation films and Italian spaghetti westerns.<br/><br/>Now apparently the more of the films 'Kill Bill' pays homage to, the more you enjoy this movie. I am not a fan of this particular theory. For example, I had seen all the films in which the 2007 feature 'Be Kind Rewind' had made short rip offs of. However despite understanding where the entertainment was meant to be coming from, that did alter the fact that it was not enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>I have viewed 'Kill Bill' a total of two times now. First when it was originally released and I was not such a big fan of movies and again after I had a much more extensive list of movies under my belt. What had changed? Well, I appreciated the editing, cinematography and music more but my overall feeling was ""good movie"". Never did the movie have the effect on me where I immediately wanted to rave about it to everyone in a one mile radius. Never was it intended to be the next 'Citizen Kane' with performances that caused Oscar buzz. What was actually scripted to occur was the viewer going on a roller coaster ride though the nearest fun land. This feature just does not stir me in that direction. All you really do is catch reference upon reference and bare witness to a notable amount of violence and if that is the best that 'Kill Bill' can offer on its menu, then I severely doubt, I'll be staying for dessert."

","I found it hard to write a review for this film, due to the fact I write them as I am going along whilst watching the film. This is so I can get everything down that is in my head onto paper. However, I couldn't take my eyes off this film to be able to do that. It hooks you in from the very beginning and doesn't let you go until the end of Vol. 2.<br/><br/>It opens up with the attempted murder of a pregnant bride (Uma Thurman). The audience only know, at this point, that the killer is a man called Bill who apparently is the father of her unborn child, though; he still tries to kill her after finding out this information. After being in a coma for four years, she decides to begin her revenge on those who were involved her attempted murder. This begins with Vernita Green (Vivian Fox), but not much is told about her, other than she regrets what she did and she is now a changed person because she has a daughter. It then goes to tell the story of what happened to Uma's character from the time she was in a coma, introducing the other characters of the film and a bit about their back story.<br/><br/>One back story which is presented beautifully is that of O-Ren Ishii, (Lucy Liu). It is a dark, disturbing tale that is shown through the means of anime. The images are amazing, but yet so wrong to watch. The story then progresses to find The Bride wanting a specific Samurai Sword to kill one O-Ren Ishii and her infamous Crazy 88. Whether she succeeds, well you will just have to watch the film and find out.<br/><br/>The cinematography, throughout the film is spectacular. Every shot looks like it is something out of a painting. This is particularly shown in the scene which contains the House of Blue Leaves. The type of image changes in different scenes, whether it is colour, anime or black and white, but each as amazing as the next. There is a huge exaggeration on the image of blood, it is bright red and the amount is huge. However, this does not make it seem comical or weird. It fits in with the story perfectly and gives it that special unique quality the whole film endeavours.<br/><br/>The acting is also something incredible. Uma Thurman creates a power within her character that lets the audience capture the true emotion she is going through. She is the definition of girl power. Lucy Liu's performance shocked me a little. She has an innocent look about her, but manages to create an absolutely terrifying character. I haven't seen her in a role like this before (her character in Charlie's Angels does not count) and her acting abilities shine through. I think the best performance though came from Chiaki Kuriyama who plays the character Gogo Yubari. Her character is a sadistic teenager who sends a chill down your spine each time she smiles, though she also creates a feeling that you should be slightly sorry for her even if she is crazy. The character is portrayed perfectly by Chiaki Kuriyama.<br/><br/>Another thing that gives this movie that something special is the music. It sets the whole tone and setting of the scenes. Credit also goes to the choreographers of the film who trained the actors to perform the amazing fighting scenes.<br/><br/>The final compliment I have for the film is that of the director and writer of the film, Quentin Tarantino. His imagination and skills have created something truly magnificent. It is a classic film that will be remembered in many years to come.<br/><br/>With all these compliments, there has to be some complaints and right now I can only think of one and it is a pretty pathetic one at that. The true identity of The Bride is kept hidden from the audience. They are not to learn her name until the second instalment when the audience learns the reasons on why she deserves the revenge she is giving out, only then does she deserve to have the right to a name. Until then though, it will be beeped out every time it is said in the most annoying way possible. If it was done in a slightly more subtle way it would have been fine, but it wasn't, so it is the only flaw in the movie that I have to write about.<br/><br/>Overall, fantastic movie!"

","Excellence is the only word suitable for this movie and story it is telling.When i first saw this movie, to me it was the bloodiest movie i have ever seen until then. Tarantino was under strong influence of Sergio Leone and his ""spaghetti westerns"" and Japanese violent cartoons which is obvious throughout all of the film. One master of cinematography used the best from another one and combined that to create such an excellent artistic masterpiece. There is some combination of action music from 1960s and 1970s movies mixed in unique style which is addition to almost perfect tale. Story about Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) who decided to quit with her profession of assassin after she discovered that she is pregnant. She left the gang of assassins led by her former husband Bill (David Carradine) and tried to live ordinary life in some small place in American south-west,but Bill did not forgive her that, and when she was marrying another guy he came to wedding with his gang and killed everyone present. In that massacre she was so injured that she spent next four years in coma. She could be killed by Elle Driver (Deryl Hannah) while she was in coma but Bill changed his mind and ordered Elle not to kill her because his regret of what he and his gang did to her. He understood that he made such a terrible mistake and decided to give her a fair chance to have her revenge if she can. If he ordered her murder while she was in coma that would be against their warrior code and honor. When she wake up from coma and escaped from hospital her revenge began. During both parts (vol.1 and vol.2) we see personnel stories of all members of the gang-O Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica .A.Fox),Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus),Budd (Michael Madsen) and other people. We see what led to events that eventually became conflict between Black Mamba and rest of them. We see bloody revenge as one by one all gang members get killed except Sofie (left alive with hands cut-off) and Elle-blinded when Manba chopped out her second eye (first was chopped out by Chinese master who was their instructor,Elle later killed him by poisoning him) which is the most shocking scene in both volumes ( i had to turn my head off when i saw that). We see bloody fight in Japanese restaurant with lots of people killed (also shocking) and clash between O Ren Ishii and Mamba. By the end there is a final clash between Mamba and Bill. What a scene. Excellence in simplicity. Before that she discovered that her daughter is alive and with Bill. They both tell her a story for good night before their final clash. After Bill is killed, she leaves with her daughter. Story about one thing called Revenge. And it is served cold."

People complain that his pieces are unoriginal... which, if you fail to take into account what he does with the material, I suppose is a legitimate observation. But as a point of criticism? The man has not claimed that he sets out to create something in no way seen before, when he directs. Anyone who claims that their own work is in no way inspired by someone else's is a liar or in denial. This one makes no secret about where he gets his ideas. Show me a single film of his that does nothing more than remake anything recent and/or mainstream, and I shall consider changing my opinion. He makes homages. Tips of the hat to the genres and the flicks he loves the most. This one is another, and yet again, we are in for a treat. He's got us in such an effective grip, that for a lot of this, we viewers are at his mercy. And he delivers fantastic shocks and surprises. You'll never know exactly what will happen, or when or, for that matter, how. This is undoubtedly the bloodiest and the one with the strongest brutal visuals of what he's done. It has absurdity, and has definite funny moments. The choreography is excellent. All in the name of doing 'wuxia', or Chinese martial arts on the big screen of the 1970's. Not having seen one myself, I can't comment on how he does. Nonetheless, I can imagine he nailed it. He fit some Western influence into it, as well, without it ever feeling out of place. The dialog is marvelous, and the delivery spot-on. All of the writing is masterful. As a story about getting back at those who have done the greatest evil against the protagonist, this is incredible. The acting is perfect. Editing and cinematography are tight, and sharp as a Hattori Hanzo. The story-telling is smooth, with the usual non-linear time-line working impeccably well. This and Vol. 2 are quite different, and both are fantastic in their own way. In this one, the action is plentiful and awesome. The music is beyond reproach. On the DVD is a half-hour or so featurette that I will review on its specific page, five minutes of uninterrupted performance by the 5-6-7-8's, and finally, a trailer for each of the following: Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, this and its other half. I recommend this for any fan of his, Thurman's or of the craft. 10/10"

","Kill Bill, after watching it I was stunned, my jaw hadn't left the floor since the company intro. It's a vile and discussing (should have been)X rated mess with all the subtly of a 70s exploitation flick. It's just too gritty, very few of the scenes are free of blood, fowl imagery or vocals, said vocals also tend to be wildly offensive. The use of dirty racist and sexist language is done without any restraint and rape scene while showing almost nothing still manages to leave a bad taste in your mouth. One of the most screwed up lines is particularly stupefying ""Luckily Boss Musumoto was a pedophile"". How is being a pedophile lucky?! Sad, yes! Scary, absolutely! But luck! At points I honestly felt I was watching a cheap shock porn minus the nudity. Over all the writing is lazy making the actors, such as they are spout aggressively stupid clichéd lines you'd expect to see in an early crime drama. One major problem is how one dimensional and archetypal the characters are. The Bride had some spat with her boy friend, Bill. Bill gets his assassins to kill her, they mess up, so she hunts them down and kills them all, Bill last of course. All the depth of a wafer, unfortunately the radical shifts in plot and tone are bound to leave any viewer very confused at what is a very simplistic plot. The music and sound effects are horribly outdated not to mention out of place. Said music seems to be more at home in a bad western then a terrible marshal arts movie, possibly a black & white one as in places, plus the sound quality was so bad an eight track would blush. Still these points are not enough to call it one of the worst things ever made by man, I reserve that blame for the near constant ultra violence. The fighting isn't as stylized as it is brutal and bloody. Chunks of human beings fly through the air, detailed make-up shows grotesque wounds and red gets on everything. There are so many shots where you can just feel the pain, especial the ones with broken glass or anything else not directly intend to be a weapon. One truly horrifying shot has a bit of wood with nails sticking out of it in a sixteen year old girl's head with blood poring from her eyes! The camera angles actually seem bent and hesitate to show maximum gore and near endless blood fountains. Despite the focus of the visceral nature of battle the actual fights are imposable; one woman vs 88(or so) Yakuza killers in a ""sword fight"". Forget how unlikely it is that she would survive the first nanosecond, why do none of them have guns? The Japanese mafia had been using guns since their founding in the forties, what kind of terminal shift would cause them to consider sharp metal sticks as their entire weapons array? For that matter when did a unisex tuxedo and ballroom mask become the uniform of organized criminals? Most of this movie's action is just a string of physical impossibilities. It's one of the biggest ham n cheese movies I've ever seen and yet it's so disturbing that any one who can be offended will be. Movie like this should be banned, it's so bad, so insulting, so terminally stupid that I loved every second of it. It's so far removed from anything I've ever seen and yet it's a living tribute to everything 70s, marshal arts, exploitation, art house film. It's terrible and shocking yes, but it stands completely alone as a very self-aware action film with the actors delivering both epic and corny lines with chilling skill. It combines humor, drama, action and even a tear or two like no other movie I've ever seen. It comes in two parts the first bombastic and action packed and the second dialogue heavy and incredibly dark. Which one you'll prefer is pretty dependent on you're love for wanton violence vs you're love for brilliant writing, but they're both stellar. I highly recommend Kill Bill if you have a love of camp and gallows humor and if not it just might convert you the weird side, just know that whatever your expectations, they're wrong."

","""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is a Quentin Tarantino movie about a bride on a quest of revenge. What she plans to do is kill all of the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Club, all the way down to the leader, Bill.<br/><br/>Overall, this was very well made. There were parts in it that were a little on the edgy side, but it's all done to pay homage to all of the grind-house movies, which were about exploitation. Uma Thurman does a really good job as the Bride, as well as actors like David Carradine and actresses like Lucy Liu as the Deadly Viper Assassination Club. The choreography in the movie was very much like what you're use to seeing in all of those old kung fu movies, even though I don't watch a whole lot of them.<br/><br/>Now, what's the catch? Well, this movie's not for everybody. It contains a lot of blood and some deviancy, but that doesn't really overpower the film. I overall recommend it to people who are able to watch this all the way through, but if you at some point become overstimulated by the violence, then this won't be the one for you."
"CandidlyCandid","Null","0","1","22 March 2009"," Violence And Villains
","Kill Bill is defiantly my favourite from Quentin Tarantino (behind Pulp Fiction). It certainly is just a fast-paced, off-your-seat action entertainment that can be watched over and over again. Mastermind Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman re-meet after their grueling success of Pulp Fiction to deliver a well-based movie of revenge, belief, strength and human spirit. I can guarantee all, you'll never see the awesome sword fights and material arts anywhere else but in Kill Bill. Once again Tarantino comes up with a genius script about a Women who suddenly wakes from a Coma, releasing she has just lost her baby she goes out for revenge using her ridiculously powerful sword and material art skills. A must-see for each and every action fan. There's plenty of blood, loads of disturbing violence and a terrific ending."

","This film was a relative letdown for me. Unlike Kill Bill: Vol II, Vol I has little by way of substance. It's an incomplete chapter of a revenge saga and doesn't fully satisfy. Indeed, after watching Vol II, I felt that Vol I was overlong and superfluous, and could have been dispensed with entirely. However, the film is VERY stylish. The fight scenes are impressive and Uma Thurman looks cool as she dispatches hundreds of men to their deaths with a samurai sword. David Carradine's role is severely limited which is a pity. There is a long anime sequence which is hyper-violent but works. Watchable.<br/><br/>Overall 6/10"

","Okay,i don't get it.How come that Kill Bill is on IMDb's 250 list an Dances with wolves or Legend's of the fall are not.It just don't makes any sense.I think Kill Bill is a great action movie.It has a large amount of fun followed by good directing,production,choreography and dialog but it just can't be as good as Dances with wolves is.It's far from it actually.Or let's say Gandhi.Gandhi is on 165'th place on 250 list an Kill Bill is on 136'th!It's just not possible.I mean it obviously is but Gandhi is a real masterpiece an it has a lower rating than Kill Bill.I can't say that Kill Bill don't deserves this place or this rating in his genre but comparing to Gandhi or Dances with wolves or Legend's of the fall it's nothing but a piece of crap.Some people will say that i don't like Tarantino because i wrote this but actually it's absolutely opposite.I am a big fan of Quentin Tarantino.I really like his movies.Especially the older ones such as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir dog's.Those were the real masterpieces but Kill Bill...You can call it a masterpiece if you want but i can't believe that his rating is higher then rating's of the movies i mentioned earlier.Especially than the one i didn't mention an that's The Deer Hunter...Or for example Ben hur,Gone with the wind,Manhattan,Mystic river,Barry Lyndon,Doctor Zhivago,Life as a house,Meet Joe Black,Seven year's in Tibet and so on...and so on...<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a movie that guarantees you'll have fun watching it.There is no doubt about it.But comparing to some other movies it don't deserves rating this big.That's why i think that IMDb's 250 list is a bit idiotic.You can't put Drama and kill everyone you can see kind of movie on the same list.You just can't! Anyway it's a fun movie and you should watch and enjoy but don't expect anything more than fun!!!"
"evoid","7","0","1","11 January 2009"," An Expressionistic Masterpiece of Art
","To me 'Kill Bill' is an example for why the medium 'film' is a form of art, just like paintings or literature. The plot of 'Kill Bill' is quite simple, but the way it is staged is unique, and I am not talking of bleeding-edge special effects. I mean the co-action of soundtrack and visuals, effects achieved by camera positioning and/or moving, certain scenes being shown in black and white, others in color, and finally the Quentin Tarantino typical stylistic devices. A naturalistic painting may be beautiful but still boring. The same motive drawn in an expressionistic way can be much more exciting. A true artist is capable of making even a boring motive look interesting. I think it's exactly this point that differs Tarantino from other directors. To me 'Kill Bill' is a masterpiece of film art. Nevertheless I give it only an 7 of 10 because of the average plot and the flat characters."
"info-12279","10","0","1","27 December 2008"," Sublime !
","An outstanding movie from the mind of one of the best modern directors ever. Tarantino had always wanted to do this type of film, a mix of film styles from movies that he liked in his youth, presented in his own way. He even went as far as including Sonny Chiba in the movie, or Gordon Liu in Kill Bill 2, a few of his favorite actors from his favorite films.<br/><br/>Anyway, in short, IMHO, he succeeded in sharing his vision, brilliant ! <br/><br/>This movie, as well as Vol 2, is not for everyone (just like any other movie anyway), and will probably be more easily understood by viewers from Tarantino's generation who had enjoyed the same type of movies that he weaved into this masterpiece. <br/><br/>This is an action film, and I rank it among the best of all time (together with Kill Bill 2)."

After i saw the film with my friends i started to inquire more deeply about films etc. This film opened a door to me. This is what it represents to me. Compared to the other films of Tarantino Kill Bill is the best one. It has a high level of photography, pure action(it should alway be so) and a simple but great story. The direction is perfect, it conveys a sort of lyrism in some scenes. to me the whole package is ""complete"". BUT, Quentin, we're still waiting for the case!

"sashank_kini-1","9","0","1","9 November 2008"," Who wouldn't want to watch a tall, beautiful woman kicking some butts?
","'Kill Bill' is an action packed, adrenaline-driven, enthralling, violent, over-the-top, bloody, merciless, exciting, stylized, funny and an extraordinary movie which seems to show no compassion to any person. Therefore, people are shown bleeding to death, though the blood seems to be like water, gushing out of the body in an unnatural yet very wonderful way that makes the movie so good. <br/><br/>Uma Thurman is perfectly cast as the bride, who swears to get revenge against the people of her gang who betrayed her. She is tall (yeah, 6 feet is perfect for an action movie actress), beautiful and very stunning as she shows to remorse in killing her former members and their people. <br/><br/>Lucy Liu too is very intimidating as Cottonmouth. Her anime sequence was probably one of the best I have ever scene. It is so demeaning, petrifying when it is shown that her parents were killed right before her eyes and she too, like bride, gets her revenge. The showdown between her and Uma was really good, especially the end result of it.<br/><br/>All the fight sequences were great, for example 'Bride vs the other lady member in the beginning' was really a blast, especially the very disheartening consequences, 'Uma vs Lucy's members' at the party. The latter was one of the bloodiest scenes I have watched till now. But the thing that didn't make all these scenes too gory and shocking and fun instead was the apt background music that made the scenes sound as if they were just made to be over-the-top and exciting.<br/><br/>The story unfolds in a very beautiful manner, with instances from the past shown in between to give it the look of a story being told by someone, the bride in this case. I'm going to go with a 9 for this one. Kill Bill doesn't have much of a message, and it isn't meant to have. Kudos Quentin!"

","This movie is different from other Quentin Tarantino movies because it's more entertaining (at least the first part). There is much more action and violence and it's fun to watch. It's a mix of black humor comedy, martial arts and some elements of crime movie. It looks like all the good stuff from different Chinese and Japanese martial arts movies was put together in one movie. Like all Quentin Tarantino movies this one is very stylish and has a great soundtrack. There were many colorful characters so this movie looked like based on comic book.

The greatest thing about it, though, is how beautifully everything comes together, and how astounding it all looks, whether it be the silent snowy garden at the House of Blue Leaves or the red and yellow-leathered back seat of Buck's truck. The first time I saw it, I was just so captivated by everything it held that it was truly the first movie I saw that really made me want to get into film production. I know how messed up it sounds to be influenced by such a stylized, violent flick, but I couldn't imagine it without the ever-flowing amount of blood. To me, it's like Tarntino's painting a picture with the bloodshed, and it is so beautiful to look at."

The quirky action sequences, the primary colors, the so-simple-it's-genius script . . . it's unlike any live-action movie ever made. Period. But don't expect a gorefestevery trick in the book is used to make sure there isn't much blood on screen at one time. The black-and-white sequences literally turning the blood into water are the biggest example. I wasn't impressed with the gore, but I was impressed with the style.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the best followers of the punk over-the-top style.

Although slightly bizarre and cheesy at times, Tarantino cleverly incorporates cartoon, humour and unreal fight situations to deliver this absolutely awesome movie to the audience in a clever yet slightly obscure way! Kill Bill, for me, is more of a flourish of pure creativity than a film in the traditional sense.<br/><br/>Tarantino has constructed a witty . And sometimes the interchangeable infusion of styles and influences that shift from scene to scene take time to bed down in the mind and can be slightly overwhelming.

","This film by far, is excellent. The whole plot had me staring at the screen wanting more till the very end. The main character (Uma Thurman)was extremely awesome in the way she willed herself to take revenge on the people that attacked her. The ultimate tell of revenge with kung fu action and gore...lots of gore. Every visual in the film was fantastic! The fight scenes were impressive and well choreographed. The chapters of the film were amazing. Each and everyone. Witty dialogue and some funny moments lightened the tone of the film but not losing the context. The anime part of the film, was very well drawn and animated. I love the way it broke the film apart and you had a little ""break"" to catch a breather before more action commenced. What I thought was one of the best parts of the entire film was the soundtrack. Every single song was chosen for a purpose and they fulfilled that. The opening song set the tone for the scene that followed. Every bit of music was excellent and made the whole experience much more enjoyable. One of my favourite scenes was with the Crazy 88s. When the Bride took on every single one of them. I was just in awe of amazing that scene was. It shows amazing directing and choreographing. The roles must of demanded a lot of training and teaching, and it showed with every stunt and fight scene. <br/><br/>I cannot express how much I love this film. Both volumes were amazing and I recommend them to anyone who isn't so easily offended by gore. This is truly a masterpiece of film making and will always be one of my favourites."
"blackasp98","10","0","2","25 August 2008"," awe inspiring film
","I watched this film with my mother one night, and she doesn't exactly take to the genre of martial arts films except where Bruce lee was concerned. But Kill Bill had to have been the greatest story i have watched for a long time. I understand that uma Thurman learned to use the katana from the legendary Sonny Chiba himself who had a role as a sushi bar chef. For over six months uma learned the art of wielding the sword like a pro, and my own mother was awed by her use of it as well. I said after the film, that this was the greatest display of swordsmanship i have ever seen in my life. To which my mother agreed in reply your not kidding where she gasped for breath at the end of the scene. Never in my life have i ever sat with my mouth open during a battle like that, the carnage was unbelievable in a artistic way as well as historic. The katana has always been revered as the most civilized way to solve disputes in warring clans of the sho-gun and samurai. This was no different where the blue leaves café was concerned, warriors fighting to the death with honor and accepting defeat in the long run, with no honor lost in the process. And the final scene o-rin and kiddo, that was something to behold, where two female warriors facing off in the traditional manner until one is left standing. Unlike any other film i have watched containing martial arts, this one held my breath, and tarentino captured it perfectly giving us the broadside view of how the sho-gun lived and died with honor. But just to let you all know, in the second film where we see kiddo train with pai-may, using kung fu was excellent, but it would have done more profound impact if they used the old world martial art where the sho-gun were trained with an art which was forbidden to outsiders until about 65 years ago. The art is called Hwa-Rang-Do, and with this art the sho-gun were the most unstoppable force walking the earth, which is why even the roman empire never tried to conquer because of the fact the sho-guns always won every battle. Kung-fu uses about 800-950 moves and techniques white to black belt, but hwa rang do when learned is over 4000 moves and techniques making the art the deadliest art on the planet. Tarentino should have used that as a good plot for the scene, not relinquishing a strict and hard teacher, in fact using a true hard teacher from Korea in the art would have given the excuse to showing why she used the katana, because the sho-gun or samurai was the ultimate masters of the weapon. Still we both thoroughly enjoyed Kill Bill, fantastic display of traditions."
"francesco_guazotti7","10","0","2","29 July 2008"," Good entertainment, bloody, funny film
","Kill Bill is a hilarious film, which makes the time pass fast. The non-stop action and lines make them an incredible film. I love the fights, and they start at the beginning of the movie (great fight). They are enjoyable, and for the people that love watching insane and lots and lots of blood, you should watch this. And also I think that the director makes the part of anime because it was very violent and bloody, as same as the figth in black and white. So although is bloody and all, the director realize it and put on some boundaries. What can I say? It's a Quentin Tarantino movie, and Quentin Trantino movies are always black, fun, well done scripts and characters. This movie should become a classic. Remember my words: Classic."
"sc8031","6","0","3","17 July 2008"," It ain't no Fujisaku, but it has its own flavor
","I feel like Tarantino (kinda like Takashi Miike) likes to cast certain actors/actresses as B-movie-esquire novelties. I.e. the female roles in this one: Darryl Hannah, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox and Uma Thurman are all laughably terrible actresses (particularly in these roles). Perhaps they DO actually accentuate the comical stripes of this movie, but I think a lot of people won't get this element. I think this is fair enough (movies are often exploitative by nature) but I thought the female lead should have been a better choice. The way these female leads are cast (as opposed to the male leads) makes this seem kind of chauvinistic. <br/><br/>My main gripe was the presence of Uma Thurman. I don't think the woman can act or fight her way out of a paper bag -- and it shows. I know, this film is a fantasy. I'm not criticizing this from an ""academic"" or professional perspective. It just made the whole experience kind of unenjoyable for me; it distorted the sense of immersion the experience was trying to fulfill.<br/><br/>Tarantino left out several of the fundamental elements found in classic '70s martial arts and gangster movies that other fans like him really appreciate. Here I didn't find the characters to be remotely memorable or believable. I mean, I didn't really notice anyone but the repulsive but attractive character of Chiaki Kuriyama. Most of the other characters struck me as kinda uninteresting. What's weird is that his stuff is actually a little grimier than the earlier movies he takes inspiration from. <br/><br/>I did appreciate the camera work during that epic battle scene, and the cinematography was pretty decent. The sets were impressive and the costumes and aesthetics all very distinct and colorful in the line of Yakuza and chambara flicks Tarantino likes. The choreography was not so much to my liking, but a lot of this was because Uma Thurman is the focal point of the camera and yet she cannot move efficiently enough for the scene to be convincing. Let's just say, it's not a display of athletic prowess, hee hee... Of course, that kind of swordplay is hard to do, it's just weird someone so clumsy would be doing it.<br/><br/>I can't tell if it is cool or annoying that Sonny Chiba appears here. It's interesting that he appears not as an action star, but as a sword-maker. And why ""The Bride""/Beatrix needs a sword is beyond me, honestly. I guess it's just an excuse to provide a scene with sword-making? I found that whole scene to be a bit much - B-movie camp presented with the budget and lack of experience to make it pretentious. It's no ""Makai Tensho"" sword-making scene, that's for sure! <br/><br/>Ah, I guess the problem I have is that all criticism of this stuff can be written off by Tarantino and his advocates as being B-movie fun, or an homage to past flicks, or ironic, or intentionally un-serious, or just a fantasy universe he cooked up. Which all proves that this stuff is mean-spirited or gratuitous for the sake of gratuity. There is not much in the way of plot or likable characters to warrant watching this, but just a penchant for mindless violence and suffering. But I guess the characters aren't supposed to be real since their suffering is not necessarily supposed to be affecting? <br/><br/>Here I didn't see the same level of substance hidden beneath the violence in stuff like ""Cops Vs. Thugs"" or ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" (hee hee presuming those had it). But I suppose this isn't entirely bad, since Tarantino has carved out a niche that is entirely his own: B-movie camp with an A-list production and hollow, hip dialog -- as well as the freedom to do whatever he wants with his artistic vision."

"Red_Identity","Null","0","2","15 July 2008"," The Masterpiece of action Entertainment!
","Well, I saw Kill Bill completely, and I have to say, it is a top-notch, action, martial arts extravaganza! I usually don't see films that are just of action. I like films that have something more, and aren't just for brainless entertainment, and Kill Bill was something sort of like a popcorn flick, but it was so much more than that. The film's opening is totally haunting. We are able to see a tortured human being, The Bride(played by Uma Thurman). The first fight sequence involving Thurman and Vivicia A. Fox is AMAZING, I mean that with the most emphasis I can give. It ranks up there with the best openings I have ever seen. The film grabs you, and never lets go. All of the martial arts fights are amazing. I have never seen a film that has so much entertainment, yet it is also because of the way they are done.<br/><br/>The reason why the fights, and all the other elements of this film work is because of the screenplay by Quentin Tarantino. I have seen Tarantino films, classics like Pulp Fiction, and while I was watching this film, I could totally tell it was his film. It has his sort of prints in it. His screenplay tells a lot about morality and humanity, and the script ha s a lot of gags and so-called 'cheesy' dialogues, but knowing Tarantino, this is a factor that I love in his films. He is not afraid to have fun with both occurrences and dialogue in his films, and that is why this film also succeeds. For example, the action sequences all have a bit of emotion to them, especially us seeing what kind of character The Bride is. Her way of sparing young people drove us to see her as a hero, when in fact she is also a very murderous killer. Uma Thurman gives a lot to this character, and that is why we root for her and identify with her, and in an action film, we have to have this. The screenplay only lets us see all these characters, and giving each of them a little bit of humanity, as for us to actually care who dies and who doesn't.<br/><br/>The film is also an artistic achievement. This film is one of the most music-influenced i have ever seen. There is a lot of bits of different music, and the music is perfectly added in scenes, as to give them more excitement and value. Amazing sound techniques to all the fight scenes, and almost every scene! The amount of gore and violence in this film is disturbing to some people, but it really is done in a sort of comical way. All the blood splattering, the heads popping up, it is all fun, and being a Tarantino fan, I love this factor! Overall, Kill Bill. Vol. 1 is a Masterpiece of martial arts/action fight films! It is one of the most enjoyable, entertaining, and in that aspect, quality-filled movies I have ever seen. For what it is, it does not disappoint, and I think it being such an original, refreshing, comical martial arts action film, it will be remembered for a long time! Hopefully, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is just as great!"

","Kill Bill Volume One and Volume Two are both great films and I love them both. Kill Bill Vol. Two is the better quality film, but Vol. One is the more fun.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a simple revenge film, influenced by material arts and samurai films. It tells the story of the Bride/Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) who is beat-up and left for dead. She was pregnant at the time and she wakes up four years later in hospital and she looks for revenge against her attackers, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), Budd (Michael Marsden) and Bill (David Carradine). The film starts with a regular Quentin Tarantino trait, starting the film in the middle and showing getting ready to attack Vernita. It then tells the history about what happened with the Bride and then shows how see went after O-Ren, simply because she was the easiest the find. This was because she became the head of the Yakuza in Tokyo. This leads to the Bride going off to the Japanese capital and taking on O-Ren's whole private army.<br/><br/>This film works on a number of levels. It is good on an action-adventure/material arts level, with a great fight against the Crazy 88. Like all of Tarantino's films they is good dialogue, he is able to get good actors involved and is deliciously violent. There is great music, Tarantino is one of the best soundtrack directors around, a fun violent anime sequence and they are good moments of humour. The film also looks at some dark aspects of human life, including revenge, rape, family lost, paedophilia, the list goes on. Tarantino is a good filmmarker and Kill Bill is new territory for him. Kill Bill is very enjoyable."

","It must be said at the start that this film is a triumph of style over substance so if you don't like the style it won't be the film for you. That said I really enjoy watching it, from start to finish it is pretty gripping.<br/><br/>As I'm sure most people will know by know, Uma Thurman plays ""The Bride"", a former assassin who is left for dead after being shot in the head by Bill, her former boss.<br/><br/>The film is not shown in chronological order so when we see her first fight it is actually the second person on her hit-list. We then see in flash back that she has been in a coma for four years and has apparently lost her child. Once she has awakened we are shown a brief history of her first target; the Yakuza boss O-Ren Ishii. This section is animated was made by people who have worked on some of the best known anime films so is understandably quite impressive.<br/><br/>Before she can fight O-Ren she must get a new sword from retired sword-smith Hattori Hanzo. Initially he refuses to make it as he had sworn never to make another deadly weapon but as soon as he knows who The Bride is after he not only makes her a new sword but states that it is the best he has ever made.<br/><br/>When she finally finds O-Ren she uses her new sword to dispatch a vast number of goons before the climactic fight with O-Ren. Much of the fight sequence is in black and white, I believe this was because the censors might not have likes the screen to be awash with bright red blood. While the scene is obviously violent it is so over the top that it isn't really disturbing.<br/><br/>If you want a stylish action film that has plenty of re-watch value then this could be the film for you. The acting is solid and the action is all stunningly choreographed."

","I first saw the opening entry of the ""Kill Bill"" series theatrically, and under sour circumstances stemming from some personal problems. I was also in the midst of my own disillusionment with Quentin Tarantino (but more so his over-exposure and over-hype)a backlash had been in effect ever since the release of ""Pulp Fiction,"" and the debacle of ""Jackie Brown""though still heavily-praised by criticsdidn't help matters much. So, by the time ""Kill Bill"" came alongwith, again, the predictable amount of critical praiseI was ready to see if Tarantino could put his money where his big mouth is.<br/><br/>The verbose auteur announces that this is his ""4th film,"" and immediately puts a sour tinge of smugness over the proceedings (though I feel the same way about the ""From the Visionary Director of..."" tag that pops up frequently these days)who does this guy think he is? I don't think directors of any caliber or experience would ever be so pretentious as to draw attention to their work as if it's the Holy Cinematic Grail all us anxious spectators have been anticipating for years. No matter how bombastic a director's ego may be behind-the-scenes, most have the simple modesty to let their work speak for itself.<br/><br/>And, factoring in my preexisting attitude, I was left less than impressed with ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1."" Granted, I had never been too keen on the Samurai-assassin/chopsockey potboilers Tarantino was directly quoting, but didn't think he did a very good job making the grindhouse aesthetic of the film accessible to the general viewing public (as he did with ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" a decade earlier); in my view, his ode to Japanese-style swordplay and literal fountains of blood could only be relevant to the audience members who had already established their fanfare for that genre.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, I recently decided to give both volumes of ""Kill Bill"" another look. I've calmed down in regard to Tarantino's off-camera persona (especially now that QT crony Eli Roth is an easier whipping boy), and am surprised to report that I had a lot of fun with both films.<br/><br/>On its own terms, Vol. 1 toys with viewer expectations in a variety of waysTarantino lays out his tale in a very literary way, dividing the film into ""chapters"" that free up the chronological constraints, allowing surprise twists from future and past events to manifest at unexpected times. There is a sequence that chronicles one character's rise to the highest ranks of the Japanese Yakuza in hyper-violent anime style. The use of different color filters and black-and-white to emphasize a particularly brutal flashback are utilized to stunning effect. There is a fun nod to Brian De Palma early on (in which Daryl Hannahas one-eyed assassin Elle Driverdons a nurse's outfit to kill our heroine) which utilizes a split-screen. And genre buffs will enjoy the use of a key musical theme from Lucio Fulci's ""The Psychic."" Actors like David Carradine and Sonny Chibawho peaked in such similar fare back in the 1970sare given career-reviving roles here.<br/><br/>Amid all the homages, Tarantinorather than just slavishly imitating the works of otherssynthesizes the elements into a vision that is distinctly his own. There are passages of dialog that ring familiar of his style, clip, and rhythmbut unlike ""Pulp Fiction,"" where conversation became a plot point unto itself, ""Kill Bill"" is far more interested in the storytelling aspect, and progresses with a masterful author's flair. One stunning setpiece (that owes much of its effect to Sally Menke's sharp editing) near the end of the first installment begins with a brilliant, several-minute tracking shot (echoes of De Palma and Scorsese) that lets loose into all-out pandemonium that goes on and on with irrepressible flair, a spectacle of superb framing and stunt work. And it's interesting how Vol. 1 seems to shoot its figurative load in the first installment, making viewers rightly wondereven after the last-second revelationwhere the latter half could possibly go.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Tarantino has more than a few tricks up his sleeve in crafting what could rightly be called his Masterpiece.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10"

","The Quentin Tarantino film ""Kill Bill"" unfortunately never appealed to me. To be honest I was never a fan of his films and I honestly don't think I ever will be which is why I have given this film a poor review. I am not being stereotypical just because Tarantino's name is attached to it I just felt the film was to out there and over exaggerated, as all of his films i have scene are. Although i should add i actually loved Pulp Fiction!!!<br/><br/>The film in my opinion has many flaws which resulted in me giving it a poor review. I personally feel the film failed to engage me, I felt like I wanted to see the film just as how many others (especially on IMDb) see it- as a good and unique film. However I was unable to achieve this. I wouldn't say the film was boring or too quickly paced, if anything the pacing was good but it just felt a little to quirky and weird for me. For example there is one scene were a man is decapitated and the blood pours out like water from a fire hose. I suppose many people would have laughed at this and see it as black humour, but I for one did not. I felt it was just weird. This is a shame as i was hoping to love the film. Aside from the film feeling a bit weird and exaggerated at times, I also felt the characters were too weird and just unrealistic. For example the whole idea of a women seeking vengeance for the loss of her baby among others by hacking them apart with a katana just seemed beyond me. As well as having unusual characters the plot was also quite terrible. I mean don't you think that whole ""GRRRR I WANT Vengeance"" plot has been overused. It just seems to be in way too many films. I personally feel the only film in recent years that has pulled it off well is ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"". Due to the simplistic and cliché plot I honestly feel this film does not deserve a spot on IMDb's top 250. Although I do understand that the film is loved by a lot of people, I accept and respect there opinions but unfortunately can not relate to it.<br/><br/>Aside from having many flaws I have to point out the positives. As always Tarantino films have an amazingly brilliant dialogue, and this film is no different. He manages to pull of dialogue that seems realistic and well placed and occasionally witty. Also another positive point to make is the scenes were shot from angles that I would have to say perfectly matched the mood and purpose of the scene. Unfortunately these positives are not enough to save this film in my opinion.<br/><br/>Summing up I would recommend this film only for people who enjoy Tarantino's unique films and of course fans of anime. Overall I would give this film: 4.4 out of 10. Not good but not awful. If you are a fan of Tarantino, raise my score to 8 out of 10 and sit back for a bloody, fun ride as you will not be disappointed!"

"ereg24","8","0","1","2 January 2008"," A Somewhat overrated, but Easily Underrated, Film
","I am not a Quentin Tarantino junkie, in all truth I find his fan club quite annoying, but I must say this movie (and note this review applies to both volumes) is a good one. The story chronicles a murderous Uma Thurmond (name of character withheld) as she seeks to eliminate the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad (or DiVAS) headed by the titular character Bill. Cue a roller-coaster of blood, betrayal, Bullets and Samurai swords.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is (despite any opinions I (or you) may have on the man) is a good director and a good script writer. The problem in judging one of his films stems from the nature of the writing. The plot for this film is (ignoring what was done with it) cliché beyond mercy, and while comically unrealistic elements can be welcome every here and again, the basic cliché of the film cannot be ignored. Where this becomes a problem in passing judgment is in that all clichés are fully intentional and done to extreme levels. Thus the conundrum that would later be presented by the film Grindhouse presents itself here: If an overtly bad plot element is intentionally overt, is the element still bad? The answer is yes, but a gray pool is likewise created where the movie itself can still be good; this gray pool is what allows Kill Bill to succeed as a film.<br/><br/>How campy is it? Ridiculously. Whether it be Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu quoting the Trix Cereal marketing line, or a fictional kung-fu move that causes the victims heart to explode this movie contains many elements that are really stupid. The fact that the movie (again I speak for both) can suspend your reality to the point where such camp is accepted common place in the world created, marks that this film is an original accomplishment. To clarify: this movie takes what is lame and makes it clever, and that is precisely why the movie is good.<br/><br/>Another problem with Kill Bill, that allows it to keep it's brilliance, is that the film doesn't know what genre it wants to be. It is the Frankenstein of kung-fu, western, generic action, anime, dramatic comedy blood fest. The basic story is the cliché revenge story that one can see in far too many kung-fu stories. The music (while holding a more Asian flair during the more blatantly kung-fu moment) is carried by a spaghetti western through a lot, and many showdowns will carry more than a subtle similarity to films like Fist Full of Dollars or The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (you'll excuse me if I ignore their proper Italian names). At other moments the camera angles and shots seems strait out of an Anime, you have shoot outs that you've seen a million times over with a little bit of overtly comedic dialog in between. Over all these stylistic flairs is an ultra-violent drama of a homicidal woman out to create suffering in her former droogs. Around the sixth chapter (The film being separated in ten chapters (a factor that only finds need to be mentioned now) we are introduced to a bizarre love story between the protagonist killer and her primary target. The movie jumps from genre to genre so much that it becomes accepted; should the shifts from stylistic themes be any less frequent, the film would collapse on itself.<br/><br/>One little element of the movie further adds to its success; Tarantino's trademark of showing events out of sequence pokes its head out in this film. After a prolog with a beat up bride getting shot in the head we just to the first chapter of the film, where in, Uma Thurmond assaults the second name on her hit list; chapter six takes us to a time before the prolog, and later still (in a chapter who's specific number escapes me at this time) takes us back to Uma Thurmond's martial arts training. By the end of the story you will know the all the rationale behind all the characters actions; as for plot wholes (a problem any film like this has to work harder than most to prevent) I couldn't find any.<br/><br/>While this film succeeds on pretty much every level it strives for, it is not a perfect ten. The story does its best to keep the action moving and the story interesting, but the second part does move a little slow near the end. Likewise while the story is a quirky bizarre thrill ride that one won't soon forget, it grabs from so many other films that it cannot be rated as its own original work, so much as the ultimate showcase of under-appreciated film techniques that one doesn't see too often in modern cinema. While not film perfection (or even an all that original story) Kill Bill is a solid film that will entertain most who see it, and will show a new twist on archetypes that have been done to death."
"brando647","9","0","3","25 December 2007"," Sexy, Stylized Ultraviolence
","Quentin Tarantino returns after six years with his fourth film, an homage to the kung-fu/revenge flicks of the 70's. Uma Thurman plays the Bride, an assassin who abandons her murderous lifestyle and tries to settle down into a normal life. Unfortunately, her former boss, Bill, has other plans and turns the wedding into a bloodbath. Four years later, she awakens from a coma and begins the path of vengeance. Tarantino split the movie into two volumes so this movie doesn't present her full quest.<br/><br/>Tarantino's film is a bloody throwback to the kung-fu flicks he grew up with. The story is simple but the film's style more than makes up for its simplicity. The choreography of the fight scenes is phenomenal. Uma Thurman kicks some serious butt, obviously having trained long and hard for her role. I'd have to say my favorite is the Bride's duel with O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). Between the grace of the combatants and the Latin sound of ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood"" by Santa Esmeralda, it feels almost like a violent tango. During the epic fights, blood erupts like a volcano from nearly every wound. It looks ridiculous (but cool) and still people freak out about the amount of bloody violence.<br/><br/>Of course, with the fantastic fight sequences, we get a good dose of Tarantino's writing, with its sharp dialogue. You can tell everyone starring in this movie is having a blast and enjoys playing their roles. One of my favorite highlights of the movie is Sonny Chiba in his role as Hattori Hanzo (a reference to one of his most popular kung-fu roles). Liu and Vivica Fox are fantastic as the Bride's first targets on her 'Death List Five'. There really is a lot to enjoy in this movie if you're looking for a good, hyper-violent time. Tarantino's throwback to the 70's grindhouse kung-fu style is a great follow-up to his previous work and one of the most entertaining films he's put out yet.<br/><br/>There are a lot of complaints about this movie but viewers have to realize, this is what Tarantino wanted. He stayed true to the style of the old martial arts flicks and modernized with his own flair. Yes, there is A LOT of blood but it's almost cartoonish in quantity. For me, this is one of those simple guilty pleasures: check your logic at the door and settle in for some great entertainment."

","Quentin keep surprises me. I've noticed that all his movies got the kick-a*s soundtracks in them.

But i think violent belongs better in movies than on the streets.<br/><br/>Most of Quentin's movies has a very unique style. In some way Tarantino manages to make you feel that you're watching and old classic. Like Pulp Fiction (well about now it is and old classic). It takes place in a sort of 50's town and it looks like the movie was made in the early 70's. Unfortunately i didn't feel the same for this movie, well in some scenes but not very strong if you compare to other movies.<br/><br/>Anyway i think this movie was entertaining and i'm not referring to all the violence, it actually was an ""ok"" movie Since you only can vote with straight numbers on IMDb i will give it an 8. It's a rather weak 8 i have to admit. it would be 7.5 or so.<br/><br/>8/10 It will give every karate fan satisfaction"

","This film shows Tarantino at his best. The film immediately gets the ball rolling when you see ""The Bride"" all beaten within an inch of her life, only to hear a mysterious voice ""Bill"" emphasising that he is not sadistic with his actions. Then before The Bride has a moment to speak ""BOOM!"" she gets shot in the head. The moment has you jumping right out of your cinema seat and has to be one of the most gripping sequences Tarantino has opened a film with to date.<br/><br/>From then on the film is provides an excellent storyline that consists of themes from all types of film genre. The film starts with a bit of Western, which is more the theme in volume 2, but has its good moments. The plot of revenge begins to spark with The Bride fighting Veneta Green (Vivica Fox), which has a bit of martial arts. Tarantino also was able to throw in a bit of Blaxsploitation. You get a bit of thriller thrown in while The Bride remains in a coma and when she wakes up, the theme in this scenes are so dark and it is backed up by an eerie soundtrack that as you on the edge of your seat. The film builds to a climax when you learn of O-Ren Ishii's background and origin, which puts an anime sequence into great use. The climatic part of the film is the whole sequence at the House of Blue Leaves, it is a film sequence that will be remembered throughout cinematic history forever. The whole atmosphere, the music, the characters and the buildup to some of the best fight choreography I have ever seen. <br/><br/>This has to be Uma Thurman's best film, I do not think any other actress could have pulled it off. <br/><br/>Overall, a great film!

","You are never bored watching this film and you are never confused. This film is surreal, fast paced, darkly humorous, dynamic, artfully aesthetic and, and violent. I did not find the violence in Kill Bill to be stark and cold like the kind you find in a blood-and-gore horror flick and, at times, the violence was purposefully humorous in that Tarantino sort of way.<br/><br/>There are at least four scenes that I can think of in this movie which are unforgettable and make this movie a genuine classic. Visually, the movie has just about everything. The cinematography in this movie is absolutely unsurpassable. Quentin Tarentino is a true master and this film may well be his masterpiece. There is some hard violence in this movie while at the same time allowing for fight sequences which almost have a superhuman quality. It should be said that the violence is darkly humorous at times, as is the case in many Quentin Tarantino films.<br/><br/>This film has two volumes, but you can enjoy volume 1 without watching volume 2 on the same day.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Lucy Liu and Uma Therman deliver two of the most memorable and provocative action movie performances I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The think the thing I like most about Tarantino films is that you get all the intelligence, humor and post-modern mayhem without all those boring good guys."

The point is that you should enjoy it for the action, cursing and special effects, not so that you could point out the weird stuff. OK, let's move on.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is really cool, like ultra cool. She is the perfect one for this role, and she plays it good too (not that it's that hard to play). She wakes up after a coma, her baby's dead, and all she wants is revenge. The flashbacks and her way of getting to where she wants to be (with Bill) is awesome. The special effects where like some of the best and coolest I've ever seen. Besides, it's Tarantino, can he ever do something wrong? Lucy Lieu, Daryl Hannah and Vivica J. Fox were all great as members of the assassination team that Thurman wants revenge on. The part where Thurman and Lieu begin fighting is really cool. Beautiful too, with all the snow.<br/><br/>David Carradine is good as Bill, the man Thurman wants to kill more than anyone. He keeps that kind of ""mysterious crazy man"" all through the film.<br/><br/>It's kinda hard for me to picture Michael Madsen in any kind of different role, after watching Reservoir Dogs (one of my favorite movies) a hundred times, except for Mr Blonde, but here he shows, once again, that he was born to play tough guy roles. But for me he'll always be ""the cop-torturing, ear-slashing off "" man. Weird.<br/><br/>Good job Quentin Tarantino, for once again giving us one of the super coolest, most violent movies ever and for picking out the perfect cast to go with this film. It's a good film, and shouldn't be taken seriously, at least not more than it should.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading my comment."

","""In 2003, Uma Thurman will kill Bill."" That's what the tagline was to this critically acclaimed film from cheesy-violence loving director Quentin Tarantino, which sums up the dry attitude of the movie perfectly. Nothing can prepare you for Kill Bill, a movie like none other.<br/><br/>The story follows The Bride (Thurman), a woman who has been backstabbed and nearly murdered by a group of assailants to whom she once associated herself with. There is a lot of background information given out throughout Kill Bill, with most of it told in a very imaginative and mesmerizing way courtesy of Thurman. With dialogue this interesting and gripping, it's hard to be bored at all through the entire duration of the movie. Back to the story: when The Bride was planning on getting married (hence her moniker), the entire church was bulldozed with artillery fire from the assailants. Everyone is murderedexcept for The Bride, that is. She was near death, but her family members, her future husband, and her unborn child are all gone. The Bride is a woman with nothing on her mind now except for sweet (and very bloody) revenge.<br/><br/>Kill Bill, as it should be noted, is a very bloody and violent film. However, most of the violence is presented in a humorous/cheesy fashion, such as gazers of what appears to be a hose shooting out red kook-aid or the like. In telling the background on O-Ren Ishii (Liu), Thurman narrarates through a roughly 10 minute anime scene, showing how Ishii became a serial killer. This is really dumb, with pointless lines and some unnecessary violence that misses the boat completely. Plus, it's anime, which means it is just dreadful (in my opinion). I know some people like that art style and the unique storytelling, but I don't.<br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill is to be missed by no one. The soundtrack varies to nearly every genre of music (with near-perfect results on all). Tarantino has shown that he is a master at his unique craft- the very intelligent yet simple movie."

","Kill Bill was a brilliant movie! perfect for adults! i wouldn't recommend it for children under 12 or 11 depends on there attitude. it is really violent and yucky but it is cleverly done, thrilling and exciting. cool music and good acting although the blood spurts are a bit fake cause it wouldn't happen but still looks pretty wrong. the costumes in it are sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo cool and so are the swords! Uma Thurman is the part for this job. special effects are pretty believable. just try to close your eyes in the gruesome bits because it is pretty fowl! i really recommend watching it because you cant go wrong and then there is the sequel!"

","Amongst the seven films Quentin Tarantino has directed to date, Kill Bill vol. 1 has got to be the most pretentious of the lot. A revenge tale cut into two feature films due to its overlong running time, part one brings us the color and style, whilst part 2, that was released to theaters half an year later, is a much lesser film (in my opinion) that contains more plot and substance, but lacks the fresh and surprisingly stylish cool breath the first installment had to offer.<br/><br/>Talking about style, Kill Bill vol. 1 is all over the place. Tarantino quotes Klingon catch phrases, gives out an outstanding homage to 1970's Kung Fu features, mixes it up with anime and an outrageous non-linear story as an intriguing plot device  and covers it all up with one of the best soundtracks ever heard to date. ""Do you find me sadistic?"", Bill asks our protagonist, a catatonic bride, beaten to a deadly pulp on the day of her wedding. What Tarantino really wants to know is do we think he's a sadistic fellow himself, teasing us with all these genres, jumping from one end of the plot to another, and probably hailing to himself all the while ""I've done it! I'm a genius!""<br/><br/>So yes, Mr. Tarantino, you are a genius. Taking a semi ""been there-done that"" story of a vengeful Bride out on a murderous rampage to avenge her near death experience after spending four years in a coma, and turning it into solid gold, is not an easy task to live up to. There were some Tarantino films where I really couldn't understand where he was going with the story. In this case, the plot is very clear even with all the continuity issues and each of the actors shine in their respective roles. Tarantino created a whole new world of organized crime on screen, carefully crafting the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad from colorful characters, with fine actresses like Lucy Liu and Darryl Hanna giving out gorgeous performances. But all these superlatives can't be enough to describe the extravagant nature of Uma Thurman's portrayal of the aching, humane, vengeful Bride.<br/><br/>Watch out for the training scenes with Sony Chiba's Hattori Hanzo, the Bride's final battle against the Crazy 88 (I've never scene so many limbs chopped off in such an artistic manner; even the horrific sprays of blood seems choreographed right down to the very last one), and the dramatic opening scene, which shows us the Bride taking the bullet that put her into the coma, seconds after confessing to Bill who's the father of her unborn child. Once the credits started to roll and Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"" started playing in the background, I was hooked. <br/><br/>Thank you, Mr. Tarantino."

","I am a fan of Quentin Tarantino, and I must say that this film really impressed me much more than expected. I didn't expect it to be as fantastic as it is. Like all of the Tarantino flicks, it does not go in chronological order, so it did throw me off at first glance, but it was full of action and it really was about redemption and justice over betrayal. It was like a Greek drama, where the emotions and action was pure and exaggerated rather than realistic, which made it even better. Also, Uma Thurman fit the role of The Bride like a glove; there really isn't anybody else who could have played the Bride as well as she did. Uma absolutely rocks in this film and in the second one as well. And if you didn't notice, Sonny Chiba, who played Hattori Hanzo, was from several samurai shows from the '70s. The cast was excellent, the dialogue was awesome and the cinematography was gorgeous. This is Quentin's best yet. Shame on anybody who calls this film overrated or terrible."

","First off, I'm going to tell you that Kill Bill is the most violent movie I have ever seen. It crosses all boundaries. Actually, it beheads, dismembers, and slaughters all boundaries. It is super-violent, gory fun.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman, in my opinion, should have been nominated for an Academy Award for her stellar performance as The Bride, a woman whose entire bridal party was massacred by Bill (David Carradine), her former lover, and his team of assassins. The Bride wakes up after four years in a coma, and finds the baby she once had is gone. So she sets out on a quest for vengeance against all those who wronged her by killing all she cared about. She does so in bloody, exciting action sequences with a nice, big samurai sword obtained from a master swordmaker (Sonny Chiba).<br/><br/>This is a great, ridiculously violent movie filled with the signature, hilarious Tarantino dialogue and action."

","Volume 1 The Bride (Thurman) is introduced to the audience in a blood-spattered wedding gown immediately after a violent showdown at a Texas wedding chapel. She attempts to tell her would-be killer, Bill (Carradine), that she is pregnant with his baby, but he shoots her in the side of the head.<br/><br/>Four years later, The Bride arrives at the house of Deadly Viper Vernita Green (Fox), codenamed Copperhead. Vernita and The Bride engage in a brutal fight, with The Bride eventually killing Green in front of her four-year-old daughter Nikki. She tells the girl that she's sorry for killing her mom in front of her, and that if the young girl wishes to avenge her death when she grows up, The Bride will be waiting. The Bride then leaves in a yellow pick-up truck.<br/><br/>A flashback to the events after the wedding reveals that the comatose Bride is the only survivor of the massacre. Elle Driver, a.k.a. California Mountain Snake, the one-eyed assassin who has replaced the Bride as Bill's lover, slips into the hospital ward intending to inject poison into The Bride's intravenous line. She is stopped at the last second by Bill, who believes The Bride deserves a more honourable death.<br/><br/>The Bride wakes up from her coma in the present and escapes from the hospital after killing an orderly named Buck, who has been selling sexual access to her body as she lay unconscious. She steals Buck's truck, the Pussy Wagon, and hides in the back seat as she slowly works her limbs out of atrophy. In the back of the truck, The Bride narrates the story of another Deadly Viper, O-Ren Ishii (Liu), codename: Cottonmouth. The events are shown in anime form. O-Ren rose to the top of the Japanese crime world as well as working as a highly paid assassin. The segment introduces her personal bodyguard Go-Go Yubari, her friend and lawyer Sofie Fatale (another protégé of Bill), and Johnny-Mo, leader of O-Ren's personal army, the Crazy 88.<br/><br/>The Bride travels to Okinawa to get a katana from Hattori Hanzō (Chiba), a renowned sword-smith, who has retired. Though Hanzo has taken an oath to never make another sword, The Bride is able to convince him of the merit of her mission, and he forges for her the best sword he has ever created.<br/><br/>The Bride tracks O-Ren to a hangout called the ""House of Blue Leaves"", where a band (The 5,6,7,8's) is performing. The Bride arrives wearing a yellow motorcycle jump suit (an homage to Bruce Lee movies), taking Fatale hostage to lure O-Ren from her dinner. O-Ren dispatches Yubari and dozens of the Crazy 88 to deal with The Bride, who proceeds to wage war on her henchmen. The Bride then turns her attention to O-Ren, climaxing in a dramatic sword fight in a snowy garden (which borrows heavily from the Japanese sexploitation film Sex & Fury).<br/><br/>The film ends with the revelation by Bill that The Bride's daughter is still alive, though this is not revealed to her."

","Okay, i watched this movie, i admit, just because a good friend of mine told me to watch it, or i would have never done it. Why? Because from the advert i felt it was somehow a silly movie. Well, i guess i was wrong. IT IS A TRULY INSAAAANE MOVIE! Yes, you know i am right! eh eh<br/><br/>I started watching it (rented it) on night, didn't know what to do, and i wasn't that bothered to watch it, but i was curious to see how it was. So i started the movie in the player and there comes this lady in black and white and i'm like ""what the.... did i just pick the wrong movie or something?"" then i stick ahead to the chapter after and i enjoy the stuff with Vivica J. Fox. I'm like O.O ""whatta hell?"" and after that incredible stuff, congrats to the crew and to Tarantino, i was ""what the hell man!"" so i stepped back into the video shop and rented the other one, the volume 2 and got back home ready to watch them both!<br/><br/>Well... no lies, i was truly amazed at the end of the first. Not because of the end itself, but because of the film all over. It has got this Chapter thing which is insanely enjoyable in the way the movie is laid out. Then the cast, wow, what cast, Uma is simply terrific in her part. The battles are extreme and the other actors know what they are doing. There are basically no bugs i have to point, it was all over perfect. Normally in a movie like this, action, i would criticize the realism, but not in this one, is so insane that it has got a realism of its own, a reality of this movie which doesn't want to be realistic, it just pretends to be a shocking movie, and it succeeds.<br/><br/>Even if it's violent and direct, lots of blood and stuff, i suggest it to everyone who likes action movie, it's really a diamond pick, something those action lovers will adore. But i guess, at this point, everybody would have seen this movie and thinks the same!"

","Kill Bill is perfect.<br/><br/>It achieves everything it set out to do from start to finish , and thats all there is to it. Moreover it is the rarest of flicks: as far as I know it was entirely original- something I thought was impossible in this day and age from a high-budget Hollywood film. The piece transcends the criteria of 'movie' into 'art'.<br/><br/>Tarantino does not attempt to tackle any morally ambitious subjects, critique society or explore human nature- all traits normally associated with great films. Instead he delivers a spectacular four-hour bouquet of martial arts- borrowing from dozens of sources yet copying none."
"vicdragon19-1","8","0","2","1 May 2007"," one hell of a ride...
","Tarintino really has one hell of a crazy brain, but luckily knows how to use it to his advantage in cinema. For those who saw Pulp Fiction and Resoivoir Dogs, this brings back some of his charm, in a more violent way..<br/><br/>I thought the plot is pretty thin, but it is strong enough to stand on its own as a story. Uma Thurman is out for revenge after being beat up to almost near death by her ex-gang members. Next, she is out to kill her enemies one by one, until she can reach the final guy, Bill.<br/><br/>It's a crazy film that sometimes doesn't take itself too seriously but that's what makes it fun. The violence is usually laughable so you forget that its all violent. The music is absolutely amazing. That track that plays when Lucy Liu walks down the restarant aisle is bloody cool! What makes this a good action flick is that the gender is equal: both girls and guys kick ass -but with the japenese, anything goes in this film.<br/><br/>The only letdown is that the substance of the film is a bit lacking. You don't really know much about this character of Uma's entitled 'the bride' or 'black mamba' - you don't' know her name in the film. Yet, you can't help but feel sympathy for her, having lost her baby in a coma and everything. It takes guts to take on a hundred or so Japanese swordsmen.<br/><br/>An enjoyable film, nevertheless."

","At first I wasn't sure if I would like Kill Bill Vol. 1 because I don't watch that many bloody movies (I'm more in to comedies, dramedies, any thing by Charlie Kaufman, etc.). But I watched it and it was bloody- in a funny kind of way. I mean, in the movie, O-Ren (the first person The Bride tries to kill) slices off a man's head and I thought this is going to be nasty then... The man's neck was like a red sprinkler squirting in the sky. Some parts you can't help laughing at how silly the violence is. By the way, the story is about a woman who wants revenge. Sounds simple, right? Wrong. The film sounds simple but you know something is weird when you see CHAPTER 1: 2. You may think it would be hard to follow but the way it is made is that it's in the wrong order but in an order that is made to make SOME sense. The movie is violent, awesome, brilliant, dramatic, funny at times, awesome, awesome, and MORE AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! I really recommend this movie to Japanese film lovers, action lovers, revenge movie lovers, and... well... EVERYBODY! WATCH IT! I give it a 10 out of 10!"
"charchuk","8","0","2","26 March 2007"," A bit too over-the-top
","It's hard for me to pick which of the two volumes I like more, mainly because they're so different in style. I think I like this one a bit more, just because the action is top-notch and it's very fast paced. There's not a whole lot of story here, which works fine, but it does feel like a bit of a letdown at the end, possibly because it's so much shorter than the other volume. I liked a lot of the artistic touches (the massive blood spurts, the anime backstory, the stylized fighting) but I felt it became too much at times; I don't know if 'pretentious' is the right word, but that's what I felt at times. Still, it's a pretty good action flick, if a bit too over-the-top."

","Grew up in New Zealand and have missed 'Kung Fu' since then. Then I saw Kill Bill here in Denmark, and I felt Davad Carradine had made up for being gone so long in such a good role. Had seen him a bit round and about, but Kill Bill, I dunno, just had that cool Zen thing going on. Like life cut up into manageable pieces. I'm not a major film buff, but I did like Pulp Fiction too although I've forgotten already. Remember Uma. Zarantino must be cool. The thing which got me most was the talk at the end of cool action story, human relationships. Like believable. Did he die or did Uma go out and take pity or give up too... Interesting philosophy, capturing of people's ways. Actually felt I could see these people, the actors and their relationship to these aspects. From some form of therapy I do reckon. The old master, what did he say, you traitor?, that was still the point and her, Darryl's, lesson or downfall. And major points for Uma and Hanna together, and for age, and for philosophy. Zarantino just got the right connections? No one can normally be bothered making great stuff? I think the market is way too limited."
"Whiteninjaz88","9","0","2","13 March 2007"," Very Entertaining movie, if u can put up with the violence
","I've been told by some that they thought kill bill was just a ridiculous unrealistic movie. i usually peply with something like, ""if a movie was realistic, do you really think anyone would watch or like it??"" Kill Bill may not have the best acting or story ever created, but guess what? it wasn't meant to. Tarantino purposefully wanted it to be sort of a throwback to the cheezy action/kung fu movies of the 70's. The action in this movie is obviously the biggest draw With it's high-octane no-holds-barred style, it sometimes transcends entertaining and and passes into awe-inspiring. <br/><br/>However, an overlooked facet of this gem of a movie is the music. it is a perfect combination of western and Japanese style with one particular song (the one playing on the main menu of the DVD) that is very catchy. overall i'd give it a 9/10. not exactly perfect, but as close to perfection as i've ever in an action/ kung fu film."

","When I first watched this movie, I was hoping for the best. I got what i asked for. First of all, the plot is great. The Bride (Uma Thurman) gets gunned down at a wedding and looks for revenge in the bloodiest way possible. Quentin Tarantino did some great job doing this movie. I knew that they were originally going to do both Kill Bill's in 1 whole movie, but both by themselves are great. The end, well, it made me definitely want to watch Kill Bill Vol. 2. Oh, and the fight scene in Japanese restaurant. That was filled with blood, action, and I really liked it. It was actually kind of funny, with the fake blood and all. ""You didn't think it was going to be that easy, now, did you?"" ""You know, for a second there, yeah, I kind of did."" ""Silly rabbit."" ""Trix are for"" ""Kids."" I liked that quote. That is what started the fight between Uma and the yakuzas. I think they were called the 87's but I don't remember. Anyway, great movie, great action. Quentin Tarantino, thumbs up, man!"
"mOVIemAN56","8","0","2","27 February 2007"," A step below Vol. 2 but still an excellent film
","The Kill Bill saga will go down in history as two of the bloodiest films ever made. Kill Bill Vol. 1 takes about 90% of the violence for both films. The film holds nothing back in story telling or action sequences, all filmed with masterful sword play. The film is full of fun and quite impressive for an action film.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is the Bride. A seemingly nameless woman put into a coma for 4 years after her ex-boss (who happens to be the leader of a group of assassins) has her shot for desertion, the Bride awakes to seek revenge on the 5 people who caused her life to become a living hell. The first film is more of a flash back to the Bride chasing the first person she is after, O-Ren and her second person, Vernita.<br/><br/>The actors do a wonderful job with the story line and the characters they portray. Uma Thuman is slowly becoming one of my favorite actresses to watch. She is smart, she is cool, and she is hot. She has that air of power on the screen when watching her with the sword and the dialogue she speaks. She has proved herself to be more than just a no-talent actress in it for the looks.<br/><br/>Lucy Lui delivers a strong supporting role as the Japanese gang leader O-Ren. She is silent and powerful. Lucy Lui was able to show the audience real quickly that O-Ren is not someone to mess around with in the film. Lucy Lui isn't well known to me. She was in the failure that was Charlie's Angels so I never knew she could actually act. She changed my mind in this. Her casual demeanor and quick sword play makes her one of the best characters of the two volumes.<br/><br/>The movie makes many homages to past film genres, such as the kung-fu genre of the late 70's. The film is filled with the fighting music from those kind of films and I actually like the little homage made by Tarantine to the late genre. Tarantino is a master of making things work on screen and one of his best achievements is the combination of the corny music with the incredible fight sequences.<br/><br/>Now the film is not entirely believable, that is evidence by some of the things the Bride and a few of the other characters are able to believe, However, the film is not meant to be believable but instead a story being told. The fight sequences are elegantly crafted and filled with spectacular stunts. The last sequence in the film has gone down as one of my favorite pieces of action in film history, right up there with D-Day from Saving Private Ryan and the Battle of Sterling from Braveheart. <br/><br/>Tarantino is a master of dialogue and there is not one dull moment of speech. Te conversations make sense, they're well crafted, and they are easy to follow unlike some films. What Tarantino does is that he does not fill the conversations with big words few understand, but instead makes the sentences short and easy to understand for anyone. The film is very violent, one of the bloodiest I've seen. No one under 16 should see this. <br/><br/>4/5 Stars"

","Had not seen any comments about this movie, except that it was violent. Saw it on the small screen.<br/><br/>First impressions:<br/><br/>Lovely music to start it off. Shocking violence. The setting out of the movie into chapter headings, with narration - that's cool.<br/><br/>Then... Some surprisingly amusing pauses inserted into violent scenes. Little girl comes home from school... very funny. Visual gags. Sunglasses. Hand luggage on a plane. Sniggering now.<br/><br/>These humorous touches, and the cartoony nature of some scenes, help the viewer to take a different view of the violence somehow. Very clever. <br/><br/>Still... watching at home, I could fast forward through some of the fighting scenes. Not because the violence is too violent & bloody but because it goes on so long it gets boring. Maybe this is clever too. Maybe I'm supposed to become bored by the violence and maybe this says something about me. Or maybe it's simply boring.<br/><br/>The black and white sequence probably helped in averting the tedium, in fact; helped avoid ""too-much-red"" fatigue perhaps.<br/><br/>And then, I was disappointed that the story had no ending. Or that the film ended before the story ended. But (duh) it's Volume 1.<br/><br/>But I disagree with some commentators who said it was emotion free. There is some desperate emotion portrayed very powerfully by the lead part. And moments of respect and even tenderness between combatants.<br/><br/>Conclusion: surprisingly enjoyable even for someone who doesn't like violence. Funny, cool, entertaining fight scenes, which become tedious after a while, NOT emotion free, has a clear storyline... which doesn't conclude. What? It's finished?? Left me wanting more."

","I think a lot of people misunderstood Kill Bill for a action/Drama, but what it really is, is a black comedy that uses elements of action, Drama & martial arts. Tarantino has built in several great references to 70's martial arts films as well as some spaghetti western & a brilliant Brain DePalma scene. As a note this film has some of the most inventive & Brilliant Cinematography ever seen on film. As far as the mechanics of the film goes it even beets Pulp Fiction ! Now for the the acting: This is an excellent role for Uma (it seems that Trantino always brings out the best in her) though her role as Mia in Pulp is far better. Lucy Liu shows some great talent as the exceedingly evil O-Ren-Ishii.Vivia A Fox is average in role as Vernita Green. Madsen & Carradine are both equally good in small roles in the first part. But the role that stood out more than the others is that of Dyrrel Hannah a Elle Driver in this pat she only has a brief cameo but she should have got an Oscar for the part 2.Sonny Chiba is excellent in his small but crucial role as Hattori Hanzo.<br/><br/>The sound track is great especially the 'bang,bang' song in the opening credits. People are often outraged at Pulp only winning one Oscar K.B should have won 5 (Best actress in a leading role(Uma Thurman),Best actress in a supporting role(either Lucy or Dyrell), Best Director, best song & best cinematography.<br/><br/>A solid 8/10 from me."

","Quentin Tarantino is a legend in film making. The first time I saw Kill Bill I was shocked. I didn't expect this movie to be as good as his previous efforts, but personally I think he perfected his film making. He pushed himself to his limits. And it paid off. After watching it several times it doesn't get any more dull. It is simply the most entertaining movie I've ever seen. The action, the comedy, the thrills, the action & the action. They all add up to one of the best movies ever created. Some of the scenes in Kill Bill never seize to amaze me. How Tarantino came up with the ideas for some camera angles & movements is beyond me. All throughout the movie are little ideas probably created on set which make the film even more enjoyable - the dialogue included.<br/><br/>The acting was great. Uma Thurman holds the movie on her shoulders, along with Tarantino. She did a fabulous job playing The Bride - it was defiantly a challenging role for her but you could tell she had studied every angle possible for the character and aced it. Great performance by her. The rest of the actors do a great job, I loved every performance.<br/><br/>There's so much to write about this film, I could give a detailed description of every scene but instead of doing that I'll summarise what I think of this film in one quick sentence:<br/><br/>ABSOLUTELY ****ING AMAZING!

"darek-zmigrodzki","10","0","4","17 November 2006"," A+ pure entertainment, this is what 'going to the movies' is about.
","Though bloody and violent on an unimaginable scale, there is nothing serious or realistic about this film. But who says a movie has to be serious or realistic or funny? Kill Bill proves that sometimes all you need is an imaginative idea, lots of beautifully-choreographed stunts and martial arts action, and an impressive dose of cinematography and visual effects to make a brilliant, entertaining piece of art. A twisting (and twisted) plot and constant action will take you on a wild ride that you wouldn't think possible from a moving image on a movie screen. My recommendation? Have an open mind, pick up the DVD's (volume 1 and 2), set aside an evening, and see them together. And do yourself a favor, don't short-change the experience. If you don't have a big-screen TV or a home theater, watch it at a friends house who does. Watching it on an ordinary little TV just doesn't allow you to experience the movie for what it is. Turn on the big-screen and the surround sound, turn down the lights, microwave some popcorn, clear your mind, and enjoy. It really is a wild ride."
"jluis1984","8","0","2","24 October 2006"," Back with a vengeance!
","After the enormous critical and commercial success earned by ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", director Quentin Tarantino found himself in the desired position of being able to do literally anything he wanted. So after the commercial failure of the underrated gem, ""Jackie Brown"", back in 1997, he spent 6 years preparing what would be his ultimate tribute to the 70s and the films he loves so much. ""Kill Bill"" is the name of the movie where Tarantino shows off everything he admires of cinema while telling the story of a nameless character (created by Uma Thurman) in a simple story of revenge spiced up by a retro 70s imagery and countless of references to classic movies. At its core, it's a very stylized action film, but ""Kill Bill"" is also an ode to those films (Westerns, Crime and Martial Arts films mainly) that gave fun to Mr. Tarantino when he was a young lad.<br/><br/>As written above, the plot is actually very simple; four years after being attacked during her wedding by her former teammates, a former professional assassin codenamed Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) awakes from a coma discovering that everyone at the chapel that day (including her unborn baby) have been murdered. Decided to take revenge on those who ruined her life, the Black Mamba (now The Bride) makes a list of the ones that attacked her that day and starts her quest hunting for the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad until she fins the leader. Her former boss and ex lover, Bill (David Carradine).<br/><br/>Many critics have called ""Kill Bill"" negatively a prime example of ""style over substance"" film-making, but I think that those critics are missing the point. In the end, ""Kill Bill"" is not about if The Bride succeeds or not, but about how and what she does to achieve her goal; and instead of being another exercise in storytelling, this film is actually a very graphic love letter to 70s cinema, complete with all its clichés and imagery. From the Kato masks to the Samurai duels, and from the Hattori Hanzo character (played by Sonny Chiba) to Bruce Lee's yellow jumper, ""Kill Bill"" is a gorgeous tribute to all those classic action films of old.<br/><br/>Despite being an overtly visual and stylish action film, Tarantino's strength has always being the dialogs, and so he manages to make the simple story interesting by focusing on the details of the plot, mainly the back-story of the characters. Developing the characters has always been an essential for Tarantino, and ""Kill Bill"" is not an exception. It's really this focus what gives the film heart making it to stand out among other films about violence (as violence seems to be the theme of at least ""Vol. 1"") while keeping the ""70s tribute"" angle of the film. Crafted with a fast-packed style that looks like a stylized mixture of western and martial arts movie genres, that flows smoothly never becoming boring or tiresome.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is really the force that drives the film, and on her shoulders is the responsibility of the film's success. Fortunately, she manages to create a complex character that while very aggressive, its still very feminine and really likable despite the fact that she is a cold blooded killing machine. Lucy Liu delivers a low-key performance as O-Ren Ishii, former teammate of ""The Bride"" and the main enemy in this chapter. Basically an antithesis of The Bride, O-Ren is also quite complex in the sense that is a character that has made a lot of sacrifices to become a top assassin and head of the Japanese mafia. The final confrontation between the two is certainly the highlight of the film. The rest of the cast is very effective, although we don't see too much of them (Tarantino makes the wise move of focusing on the development of the two main characters only). It's nice to see Sonny Chiba, Gordon Liu and Kenji Oba in cameos across the film.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is just the first part of The Bride's Saga, covering her awakening and the beginning of her revenge, as well as the more action-oriented part of the saga. It could also be said that this is the ""70s martial arts tribute"" part of the story, as ""Vol. 2"" is situated in a slightly different context (I even believe they were conceived as two films from the start), although still a ""70s tribute"" film that concludes the story. Overall the film is quite exiting, although it probably won't be too attractive to people expecting a more complex and detailed story. While the characters are very well-developed and the plot is rich in details, the film's focus is highly visual rather than plot-driven, so people expecting an insightful film in this aspect (or even people expecting similar film to ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Jackie Brown"") will be highly disappointed.<br/><br/>While personally I consider ""Vol. 2"" a vastly superior movie, ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is an excellent action film that can stand on its own delivering great entertainment and fast-packed action in high doses. As a beautifully done tribute to 70s cinema, this movie excels. 8/10"
"Ninsen","9","0","2","20 October 2006"," Mentally and intellectually stimulating
","This evening, I viewed this film for the first time and I must say I was quite engaged. This film has much in-depth irony where The Bride (Uma Thurman), seeks revenge by making it her prerogative to murder Bill (David Carradine), her former boss because he murdered her and her unborn child; allegedly her daughter-to-be. Before she is able to avenge Bill, she must murder his 'subordinates' O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). Along the way towards achieving her goal, The Bride has yet to face many obstacles but as she endeavours through her journey, we become educated of the other assassins' personal histories. <br/><br/>Tarantino also appeals to the academic where he places much emphasis on Freud's theories of both the superego and of the id (similar to 'the monster' in Shelley's 'Frankenstien' and to 'Mr. Hyde' in Stevenson's 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'). Hegemonies based on various beliefs such as those of Buddhists and those of samurais are also quite prevalent. This film was well directed and is a must-see for those who wish to broaden their understanding(s) in sociology, psychology, international relations, and various liberal arts related fields as well as for those who wish to enjoy an action-packed movie night."

","OK the version i'm giving a review of is the uncut Japanese version, which is better than the original theatrical cut, the anime sequence is slightly longer & a bit more violent but the main difference is that when The Bride takes on the crazy 88 at the House Of The Blue Leaves its all left in colour with more limbs chopped off, the whole sequence is pure movie heaven just like the film itself, its certainly Tarantinos best looking film thanks to director of photography Robert Richardson, vol-1 has a unique fantasy feel while vol-2 looks like a western in the tradition of Sergio Leone's, Once Apon A Time In The West comes to mind, no doubt Tarantino pay's homage to that, amongst many other films. When you watch both vol's back to back the way it should be seen, it is a beautiful ultra-violent revenge epic, you are truly transported into Tarantino's movie world. A special mention must go to Uma Thurman she holds the screen magnificently, no matter how many films she does in the future Kill Bill will remain her best performance."

","Well, reading some other viewer's comments and their dislike of this movie I have to say for its defense. If you aren't into Shaw Brother Movies/LoneWolf and Cub/The Bride wore Black etc. don't watch this movie. If you are you will have the fun of your life watching Tarantino mixing up popular heroes (Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo) from Asian movies together with a drama-action movie from the sixties. The film starts not with warner Bros. but with Shaw Brothers, which makes clear where this film is going to take you. Many quotes from different movies, figures are placed into the movie for lovers to recognize. Same as the music: using Kinji Fukasaku's Battles without honor and humanity or the title theme of Lady Snowblood : Love Song of Carnage. The violence is typically Japanese style overdone for the comic factor. You can't really take it serious anymore. Anybody who feels offended took it way to serious. Brilliant movie...I loved it...all actors had pure fun....."

","A movie about revenge. That's not something new, but the way that Quentin Tarantino put a story around this oldest theme known to mankind is just amazing! You see the first scene and think ""Oh my god! This cannot get any bloodier!"" And then BAM! it can! Tarantino shows once again his genius as a director! He has lots of fantastic and unique ideas about how a fight should look or how you can show a persons whole life without using three different actors and bringing at the same time the characters cultural background.<br/><br/>And then there is Uma Thurman! Again she shows that she can play any role, no matter if it is a professional killer or a maybe a character you would fall in love with, she can do everything and you she makes you believe it!

","We all know about Quentin Tarantino as a renowned director and writer for violent films including Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and again he uses his talents to create an engaging violent thriller.<br/><br/>Not as interesting as Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown, Kill Bill is more violent, more fast flowing and contains more emotion than his previous films.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction) stars as the central character who knows what she wants out of life and after awaking from a long coma goes in search of those who have betrayed her.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful idea and creates excitement and anticipation at every corner. However a lot of ideas used are blown out of complete proportion e.g. the opening scene and the crazy 88.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I found the 88 scene was a remarkable piece of directing. Shot in black and white it is fast paced and creates an unbelievable amount of tension.<br/><br/>The use of flashbacks is a fantastic technique but might have been slightly overdone as many people I think may be slightly confused.<br/><br/>The Japanese animation is the best part of the whole film  emotional, brilliantly created and tense it creates passion that unfortunately lacks for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Tarantino uses his violent knowledge to create some of the most graphic violent scenes in motion picture history and therefore allows audiences to see how dangerous the games the characters are playing, how serious they are.<br/><br/>Had it none been for a few action scenes then this film would have been perfect.<br/><br/>It is definitely worth watching if you think you have the stomach for a film which is extremely violent, exciting, emotional and loyal.<br/><br/>7/10"

"MartianOctocretr5","7","0","2","24 September 2006"," Interesting, but dragged out unnecessarily
","This movie appears to be a backhanded slap at kung fu movies dating back to the '70's. Certainly a movie with a title like ""Kill Bill"" is not meant to be taken seriously, but then the flick turns around and has large supplies of blood, gore, and mangled corpses.<br/><br/>It's the old story of a woman scorned, but this woman happens to be a Rambo/Governator/Bruce Lee/Jackie Chan/etc type of invincible killing machine (she even dresses in one scene exactly like Bruce Lee did in one his movies). Uma Thurman is appropriately vicious, then emotional in her Jekyl/Hyde style role. She exudes blind hatred and destructive fury one moment, tearful sentimentality the next. Some of these characterizations are played too straight for The Bride, others are over the top. This clumsy lack of consistency disorients the viewer. Are you supposed to fear her? Sympathize with her? Laugh at her campy and overstated persona? There's a lot of one-liner banter between the Bride and her adversaries, and some are quite funny. Having two people who are in a life-and-death struggle mocking each other is an old cliché, ripe for satire, but it's done way too much. It gets old after a while.<br/><br/>As the title implies, she's trying to exact revenge on the twisted sicko Bill (David Carradine doing the evil psycho well), her former lover, who is a trained assassin like herself. What he had done to her is one of the many contrivances of the film, but it's easy to overlook these and give the film whatever suspension of disbelief it asks of you. The action is uncompromisingly violent. Antagonists are portrayed as mindless, cold hearted killers.<br/><br/>Heads are chopped off. Innocents are blasted mercilessly. Body parts get cut off, sometimes pulled off, and mangled. This movie is not for everyone, especially if you dislike ""dark"" humor or relentless violence. Many fight scenes, although magnificently choreographed, drag on way too long, the reason this movie needed ""two volumes."" There are many scenes where the director stretches out two-minutes-worth of information into a 15-minute scene. The two volumes are usually shown back-to-back, so if you've got 4 hours plus commercial time with nothing better to do, this wild mayhem isn't a bad way to spend the time."

","Let me start of by saying this is one of my top five favorite movies in the world.<br/><br/>Things it did well:<br/><br/>This movie had plenty of action to satisfy ANY hardcore ""watch a guy be split in half"" type guys. It had very fluent fight scenes, and even though this was the more bloody of the two volumes it still provided enough plot to give you an okay glance at what is actually happening.<br/><br/>It had a flowing plot, and because of how little information you get, you are more apt to watch carefully which gives a better feel through the movie than just watching through a 30 minute dialog waiting for the next sword scene.<br/><br/>The angle work in the cameras was different and close-ups felt very retro.<br/><br/>Things this movie did poorly on:<br/><br/>This movie is my favorite but if there were anything to say it could have done better, would have been to make the plot more clear the the average viewer. Because of this most people either like it or hate it; it's that simple. Many of my friends left the theater not even knowing who ""Bill"" was. It didn't seem to appeal to a very large audience.<br/><br/>All in all it is a great movie and differently worth buying."
"gavin6942","8","0","3","14 September 2006"," File Under ""Things That Quentin Tarantino Knows How To Do""
","There should be a list of things Quentin Tarantino knows how to do, and a list of things he clearly does not. Perhaps if he examined this list, he wouldn't make any mistakes in the future. The one thing Tarantino should definitely not be doing is getting involved with any horror films. ""Hostel"", while not awful, was talked up way too much. And his endorsement for ""Wolf Creek""? I have no idea what he was on to make him think it was a stellar flick.<br/><br/>But the list of things he can do well is much longer and we see most of those things in ""Kill Bill"". This is the story of a retired assassin who is attacked on her wedding day, and the entire wedding party is killed. When she wakes up from her coma, she decides to take revenge on the man who did this to her: Bill. Yes, she will kill Bill. Or at least die trying.<br/><br/>Things Tarantino does very well: 1. Puts scenes in the wrong order. In ""Kill Bill"", they don't even show her killing her enemies in the correct order. He mastered this in ""Pulp Fiction"" after testing it in ""Reservoir Dogs"", but ""Kill Bill"" really drives home how effective a film can be if you put things in a more climatic order.<br/><br/>2. Incidental dialog. Some people, like Richard Linklater or Kevin Smith, can make an entire film of incidental dialog, thus making the dialog essential and not really incidental. Tarantino only puts a pinch here or there, to flavor the film with off-hand cultural references. Remember the Royale with Cheese from ""Pulp Fiction""? You'll find more of that here.<br/><br/>3. Senseless violence. If you liked the killings in the other films, you'll love this. The killing is gorier, the body count higher. And the influence of old kung fu films is a nice touch. Personally, I'm a big fan of the blood geysers.<br/><br/>4. Music selection. Music played a central role in ""Reservoir Dogs"" (K-Billy's Sounds of the 70s). Again, the music is crucial, giving the film an old-timey feel (with ""Green Hornet"" music, among others). This is very well done, mixing the classic (sword fighting) with the modern (guns).<br/><br/>5. Putting people in suits. I can't explain why, but the suits worn in Tarantino films are the best.<br/><br/>6. Understanding your traditions. This film references so many more old kung fu films tan I will ever see. Tarantino knows his stuff and sprinkles references all over that most people will never understand. A prominent character, Hattori Hanzo, is actually a real character from other sources and even some of the dialog is a throw-back. This homage is touching and well done.<br/><br/>What I'm saying is that if you liked Tarantino before, I suspect you'll be a big fan of this movie. It's dirtier, gorier and more violent. Some scenes are much more crude than in his other films. But Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman are a winning combination, not to mention the flawless Michael Madsen and a well-casted David Carradine."
"deadmanjones","9","0","2","2 September 2006"," intense, exciting, moving, operatic
","Postmodern is a daft concept used by pseudo intellectuals when describing dull films by other pseudo intellectuals. Kill Bill is not post modern. Its few filmic jokes are there because they work not because they reference something. Its obvious hyper reality is coupled with some intensely emotional moments, that work because of the brilliance of the actress Tarantino has employed to star in this violent opera, and because of whichever brilliant anime artist he got to direct the superb animated sequence of the film. It is clear that, irrespective of Kill Bill's Hong Kong / Anime / Karate Film subject and action, this film owes it's greatest debt to Sergio Leone. And it is high praise indeed when I say that this film not only captures the stylish extremes and beauties of Once Upon a Time in the West, it may even surpass them. As with previous films Tarantino subverts linearity; this is once again in order to fabricate a Hollywood narrative NOT to be arty or postmodern or pseudo intellectual. It's done cos we dumb audiences like an emotional beginning, middle and end. So reviewers for God's sake take note; Tarantino chapters his film cos it's cool not cos its arty; he moves backwards and forwards in time cos it's cool and he needs to not cos it's arty; he references other films cos it's cool and it works not cos it's arty. This film works; it's cool and it's an intense, exciting, moving, operatic, finely crafted masterpiece."
"stratcori","10","0","2","19 August 2006"," A fantastic experiment
","Just like Tarantino's previous few movies, Kill Bill has been divided into chapters that relay a small portion of the overall movie to the greatest detail. But for Volume-1, it all ends there and there's little more in common with other of Tarantino movies. A lot of people may question his style of movie making but I'm glad that Tarantino has decided to try something new and prove that he knows what hes doing for sure. If you want a more traditional Tarantino flick, then watch Volume-2. If you want style, action, gore and an out of control fun fest that has been brilliantly implemented, then watch Volume-1. Every scene or every chapter of this movie, irrespective of it having the advertised action or not, is extremely memorable. What you cannot expect from this experiment in movie making, is the actual story and connected explanation of events, which are done only in the second volume."

But it was on the day of her marriage that her old ""friends"" - O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), Budd (Michael Madsen), and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and her boss, Bill, decided to crash the wedding, killing everyone there...and putting a gun to the Bride's head, however she did not die. She is just in a coma, and is about to wake up, and travel to Tokyo, Japan and begin her revenge on the five people apart of the team that The Bride herself was once apart of. <br/><br/>Kill Bill: Vol 1 is about a young woman bent on revenge. But it's also about the screen return of Quentin Tarentino, the most outrageous American filmmakers working today, and one of my favorites. ""Working today"" may be a stretch because ""Bill"" is his first film in over five years, since 1997's Jackie Brown. And it certainly looks like Q.T. has been hard at work, filling every scene of ""Bill"" with meticulous detail and over-directing in his manic style. The writer/director again shows a lack of cinematic originality, while maintaining his genius for action-packed, 1970s Japanese style violence and entertainment.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a lot of fun. Hardly a dull moment goes by. But that underlines the obvious fact that the film is all surface, full of gun-fights, boffo martial arts sequences, and with virtually nothing to think about. It's the proverbial assault on the senses, as you're given a queasy stomach to get you going before Tarentino graduates to repulsion through sight, sound, smell and even taste.<br/><br/>The performance by Uma Thurman is fierce, she is a beautiful, and an extremely talented actress. Lucy Liu and the rest of the supporting cast also give in sharp performances.<br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill Vol: 1 is easily one of my favorite films of 2003, and its also responsible for making me a devoted Tarentino fan (no I hadn't seen Pulp Fiction before this!). The film is a grind house of sharp dialouge, set design and over the top gore which is done so magically, and put together perfectly.

","""One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces"" (Pink Floyd, One of These Days, Meddle, 1971).<br/><br/>I have often written in some reviews on this site that I wasn't a big fan of Quentin Tarantino, a cinema-going filmmaker with a mind-boggling culture. It's true that I have never been very taken with ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994). As for ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", I had deemed it as ""violent and hollow"". I maintain the first epithet but I jettison the second one now. I watched it again last Saturday night with its other brother ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" (that I hadn't seen before) and I changed my mind about it. I realized that I had overlooked it and I would go as far as saying that I found it much better than Tarantino 1994 film.<br/><br/>The staple story doesn't carry much weight. A wedding in the desert takes a tragic dimension when all the guests are killed except the Bride who spends four years in a coma. When she wakes up, she's got one sole word in her mind: revenge. On a scrap of paper, she noted down the names of the ones who made of her wedding a tragedy and is well determined to kill them all. She also keeps the best for the end: Bill. This story is for Tarantino almost a pretext to beef it up with sources coming from different horizons: comic strip, spaghetti western, samurai film and even video games in the elaboration of the fight sequences. And animated by a cinema passion, the filmmaker couldn't resist to the desire to include film-loving details throughout the Bride's adventures. Thus, the title of the second chapter is entitled if my memory serves me well: ""the Bride wore blood"". It's of course a hint at François Truffaut's film, ""la Mariée Etait en Noir"" (1968), a film on which Truffaut himself didn't have a warm spot. I have just mentioned the term chapter since the film and its companion are divided into chapters and Tarantino isn't afraid of subverting storytelling conventions by showcasing chapters in a chronological disorder like his previous efforts.<br/><br/>The technical command of ""Kill Bill: Vol 1."" leaves speechless. First, I would like to congratulate Tarantino for the cinematography he tapped. It enhances bright colors, especially the red and one thing I noticed: in the first sequence of the film, Uma Thurman drives a vehicle with red seats. In Jean-Luc Godard's ""Pierrot Le Fou"" (1965), the red is also a dominating color. In one scene, Jean Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina are in a car with red seats. If I don't understand at all the symbolical function of the red in Godard's highbrow work, in Tarantino's work, his symbolic is blatant according to the story and the Bride's motivations. Red is revenge, violence, death.<br/><br/>This revenge story is filmed with virtuosity to its recesses where nothing is left to chance. It's tempting to deem the introduction of some characters as filler but it's necessary to reveal and consolidate their persona. And throughout these chapters, Tarantino taps all the cinematographic possibilities to bestow and embellish the form to the service of his intentions (to pay homage to the samurai film among others) and the contents. Thus, one of the moments of the film is showcased under the form of a Japanese cartoon film and for perhaps one of the most momentous moments (the scene when the BRie kills some 80 masked enemies, Tarantino borrowed a device from Hitchcock he used in his mind-boggling ""Psycho"" (1960): to shot an incredibly violent fight sequence in black and white not to show the red blood. Besides and while I'm on this sequence as well as the others that involve fights, they are so well choreographed and set with clockwork precision that they can emulate, even outclass the ones of ""the Matrix"" saga. And as many film buffs know it, one of Tarantino's recognizable signs is his pronounced taste for bloody violence. For ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", he didn't shelve it but this violence is virtually all blood and thunder and watching ripped or pierced body parts or whole bodies, slashed arms and legs becomes highly great fun. Thrill-seekers will be overjoyed and the height is reached when the Bride before facing Lucy Liu declares to them: ""don't try to get back your missing parts!"".<br/><br/>Tarantino even grants some importance to some apparently trivial things like for instance the Japanese man who sells to the Bride a clean saber writes on the mist of a window, the one whom the Bride wants to get rid of at the end of her list (you guessed who it is of course) or when the Bride tries to move her big toe after her coma.<br/><br/>It's exciting cinema as one could wish and for Tarantino whose target was partly to pay homage to the samurai movies with which he grew up, he delivered the goods: to spend a truly great cinema moment. The different cinematographic devices and tricks interlock with easiness and fluidity. What about my judgment of the volume 2? The answer in my review about it.<br/><br/>NB: there's perhaps this unlikeliness in Tarantino's scenario. When the Bride gets out of the hospital and finds herself in the underground parking, thirteen hours pass by before she can feel her feet again. But during this time the staff at the hospital must have realized her departure. Why don't they find her again after such a long time? It's a minor detail."

","While I would'nt really want to go and try flaws in this movie, any attempt to do so would be really difficult besides the complaints that Tarantino ripped off somebody else. The formula has been perfect, to separate the story from the movie completely and set it aside for the sequel. But even after having done so, and having delivered non-stop bloody action, this movie really does not seem so commercial. Even when it comes to scenes with no action at all, the dialog is excellent and the sequences are gripping. Even if one imagines that Tarantino payed too much ""homage"" to others by using their ideas, the movie as an overall effort, comes out as highly original."

With this he showed off his directing talents, however the writing was almost nothing. This has less than half classic Tarantino dialogue and it's mostly consisting of strong bloody violence. This was a well done film, and many like it better than the much superior (in my opinion) Kill Bill 2.

After that, it was an extremely big regret that I did not see this masterpiece in the cinema theatre. Quentin Tarantino veers from his traditional formulae and proves that his a great director and writer through delivering a movie that everyone could like, as long as they don't find it too violent or offensive. This has to be the most stylish movie ever made. Completely stripped of the underlying story and using only subplots, Kill Bill is an out of control rampage that will leave you dizzy and begging for more.

","It took about six years for us to hear anything from the brilliant director/writer Quentin Tarantino. Then in the year 2003 we finally got him back with the amazing ""Kill Bill Vol 1"". The movie is a combination of Yakuza/Samurai/Triad movies what the good old Tarantino so much adores.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill Vol 1"" is a story of ""Bride"" (Uma Thurman) who is attacked by his former boss Bill (David Carradine) on her wedding day. After being in coma for four years the ""Bride"" wakes up and she has a vengeance on her mind. ""Bride"" works trough highly trained employees (for example Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen etc..) to finally kill Bill.<br/><br/>The film would have been over three hours long if Tarantino had decided to cut it in two pieces. In result the two parts work as they are. Tarantino has planned to make also one whole movie about ""Kill Bill"".<br/><br/>The film was very fun to make. Uma Thurman has said that: ""Kicking ass is ridiculously satisfying..."". I have heard that the old violence lover Tarantino had a fantasy about Thurman killing people for real... Maybe that would had gone too far... The realistic action and killing is enough in the embodiment of fantasy and imagination.<br/><br/>As usually Tarantinos dialog is rich and intriguing. He is a hell of a story teller who's mind is pure genius. You can tell that he has had certain actors on his mind while writing the script. Uma Thurman fits in the part of the ""Bride"" excellently. Once again a couple of Tarantinos favorites, Michael Madsen and Samuel L. Jackson have got a little parts in the film. The result is very satisfying indeed.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" may seem to be cruel and crude but inside burns the various flames of feelings. Once again Love is a powerful thing. You can see it burning while watching the film.<br/><br/>If you see ""Kill Bill Vol.1"" you must see also ""Kill Bill Vol.2"" because the first part isn't anything without the ending even if the part one is a bit better than it's sequel!"

The lead, Uma Therman, does a wonderful job portraying the Bride, both on acting and fighting. And of course I couldn't just forget about the music! It is used skillfully and I knew it was going to be a great movie from the first song.<br/><br/>The reason I give it a 9 out of 10 is because the use of blood is way off hand at some points, especially during the anime part."

","To start, the main point of this is to say WOW. What a fantastic film. It's entertainment at it's best, no doubt. To be honest, before this movie I had never heard of Quentin Tarantino. But, I was young so I hope that you forgive me. This wonderfully looking film got me hooked on the drug I like to call QT. The action is great, and is a fantastic homage to Japanese films of the past, the dialogue, at least the way it is put together, is original, the acting is very good, especially for a film like this, and the action is, well, you guessed it, awesome. This is one of those movies that you watch over and over and over again and it truly never dulls down from the first time you saw it. As usual with Tarantino, the soundtrack is great, and the reason I like it so much is because it strays far away from the first three Tarantino movies, hell, even the second volume of Kill Bill. Tarantino proves that he can make any type of film. This has great comedy, great cinematography, and a spectacular anime sequence that by itself would make an awesome short movie. So many spinoffs of this movie could be made in the future, but I sadly believe that it will not happen. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to enjoy this to the fullest next time I watch it, and the next time, and the next time, and you get the point."
"ebiros2","8","0","3","5 June 2006"," Why doesn't anyone have spears, guns, Uzis ?
","What I liked about Kill Bill Vol. 1 was that it was really modern movie that paid homage to many of the great TV and movies of the past 4 decades. The color was fantastic and beautiful, and actors and their characters played out superbly. Yeah, I have to give it to Tarantino. No one can make a movie like this (good or bad) other than him. I'd say that good far out weighed the bad in this case, and I hope he'd make more movies like this one that defy Hollywood stereotypes. He's not narrow in the way many American film makers are in that they can only play up a drama in a cook book sort of a fashion. His taste in cinematography is also very different from other Hollywood directors. I would hazard to guess that if a student made a movie like this in art schools, they would be berated very badly. If I like Tarantino, it's for these reasons. The stuffs that's good and fun that are getting forgotten these days is abundant in his movie making taste.<br/><br/>Now for the ridiculous antics. First of all, you can never use a Japanese sword the way Uma Thurman did. Samurai's sword is made of steel core and iron blade. For this reason, the blade part chips very badly when it hits a hard object like human bones (this is the reason why the samurai always carries a shorter ""spare"" with the main katana). No way you can kill 100 people without devastating the sword way Uma did. Made by Hattori Hanzo or not. Secondly, Japanese Yakuzas carry guns these days. No one carries a samurai sword. So this is the purely fiction part of the movie. Uma would have been gunned down in five seconds in a real situation. Thirdly, there's no tea house like the House of Blue Leaves in Japan. The architecture simply isn't Japanese. It's clear that the set was in China.<br/><br/>That's my take on this movie. Don't get me wrong, I thought this was a great movie, and I wish more movies made were fun to watch as this one was."
"walteraquilina","Null","0","4","5 May 2006"," A flawless masterpiece!
","Movies can't get any better than this. This movie has it all; good action, blood, great story and good acting.<br/><br/>Yes, the blood is not that realistic. I mean, how can someone have a fountain of blood coming out of their hand and remain alive? But of course, unrealistic movies can still be great. For example, take Lord Of The Rings, Star Wars or The Matrix. Those movies were much more unrealistic than this is, and still they're in the top 250 of IMDb.<br/><br/>Acting was incredible. Uma Thurman, Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Lui couldn't have been more perfect. The supporting actors; like Julie Dreyfus, Chiaki Kuriyama and Sonny Chiba were awesome as well.<br/><br/>Without the music, this movie wouldn't have been in the top 250, trust me. The music supervisor, or whatever they call him, did an awesome job. They fit every part exactly, and the beat keeps going on in your head. For example, when Beatrix was talking to Sofie in her trunk, telling her the second reason why she kept her alive, that music was awesome and it made me shiver.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that everyone who watched it, liked something. It had everything. If you like action, it was full of it. If you like blood, there's a lot. If you like cartoons, there's like 10 minutes of it (it's still great, trust me). If you like thrillers, there will be a couple of surprises. If you like dramatic movies, you'll like the story. If you like comedy, it contains a bit of humor every now and then. So, you must have liked something.<br/><br/>For me, this is much better than the second one. This sets the mythology of the story, while the second answers everything. This one had more action and blood than the other. The only real action part in the second one was the fight against Daryl Hannah. In my opinion, this is the best movie ever made, and you just HAVE to watch it."

Four years later, the Bride wakes from a coma to find out she's not only lost four years of her life, but also her child (she was pregnant at the time of the shooting).

Fox, Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen). Let the body count begin.<br/><br/>So as the Bride exacts her revenge on anyone that gets in her way, we quickly realize that ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" is a movie made by Tarantino for Tarantino. You get the feeling that what he's saying with this film is, ""If you don't like the Huber-violence and mega-blood than fudge you, because I do."" Body parts fly across the screen with glee. Buckets of blood spurt out of body stumps. And heads roll (literally) all over the film. My rule of thumb, lots of blood, something to watch and enjoy or laugh too. Ya watch this."

","Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown) brings us one of the greatest martial-arts movies to date. I have seen this film a countless times and it still holds it's greatness on each viewing. This is definitely Tarantino's best film and is a pure masterpiece. Kill Bill: Volume. 1 is a gritty martial-arts action movie, filled with amazing fight scenes and true pieces of art. <br/><br/>Uma Thurman stars as the furious, revenge-seeking, blood thirsty Bride, shot down by her former boss and lover Bill (David Carradine) 4 years ago on the day of her wedding (rehearsel). Tormented with anger, she hunts down each of the assassins that took part in the massacre that put her in a coma for 4 years, she engages in brutal and bloody fights to the death to avenge her tragic loss 4 years earlier. <br/><br/>Uma Thurman is brilliant, playing the role superbly and definitely bringing her best performance since Pulp Fiction. Lucy Lui also gives a surprisingly good performance, very different from the roles she has played before. Her portrayal of O-Ren Ishii, the evil and sadistic boss of the Tokyo underworld is perfect. She acted every scene like she was the character, showing she can do much better than her previous work. <br/><br/>The film is accompanied by one of the greatest soundtracks ever used on screen (composed by the talented Robert Rodriguez) and each piece fits perfectly with every scene. The direction is also one of the best aspects of the film. Quentin Tarantino knows how to perfect each scene and is a true genius at what he does. As this is something a little different from the usual work Tarantino is used to I think he did exceptionally well in creating one of the best films of it's genre. The writing too is flawless, with hints of Tarantino's quirky and comedic dialogue there is nothing that can go wrong. <br/><br/>This film is absolutely brilliant, with amazing and surprising ending. Kill Bill is a film you can watch over and over again, still being entertained on each viewing."

","I just watched ""Kill Bill"" 1 & 2 back-to-back, first viewing. Gotta tell ya folks, I found it a little boring. I think it's too long, and could easily have been one film. I don't think the films can be considered separately; ""Kill Bill 2"" is not a sequel, it is simply a continuation of the film, much like ""Matrix Reloaded"" and ""Matrix Revolutions"" cannot be considered separately, nor any part of the ""Lord of the Rings."" Neither part stands alone. ""Kill Bill"" is obviously an homage to Hong Kong lung-fu films, in which realism does not necessarily play a part (e.g. gravity). Take for example ""The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei."" There was also a bit too much Monty Pythonesque spraying blood for me. But okay, if those sorts of things don't bother you, then it's no problem. The movie(s) are certainly beautiful, and the cinematography is excellent, certainly up to the standards we have come to expect from Tarantino. There are many excellent scenes, and overall the plot is pretty good. There are, however, several scenes that are just too long, too overblown, and frankly, to dull. There are also a few scenes that could have been completely cut out as they add NOTHING to the film; e.g. the scene where Michael Madsen goes to work at the topless bar. What was that all about? There were other scenes that were included that I found not important, and not all that interesting, like the scene in ""2"" with Esteban. I almost found the animation segment sub-standard. It could/should have been much better. While watching these films I got the impression that maybe Tarantino has been reading too much of his own press. I found ""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Jackie Brown"" all to be better films. The ""Kill Bills"" aren't bad, but I would disagree with anyone who says that they are Quentin's best work. Just my opinion."
"Vomitron_G","10","0","2","24 February 2006"," Quentin Tarantino surpassed himself with this one
","Quentin Tarantino has arrived to a point in his career where he can simply do anything he wants (and gets away with it too). And by all means, he has earned that right. He went from a modest video-clerk with a love for comic books to one of the most versatile film-makers ever to walk the face of this earth. I simply won't be told otherwise. He knows movies (the Classics and the Junk) and he knows how to make one. I won't even go into the story, or the visuals. Nor won't I go into the things I really liked or point out where he got his ideas and which films he pays homage to or makes fun of. I won't list the different genres this movie blends in the mix (but there are a lot, and I'll only tell that he also uses Japanese anime for one chapter, which can compete with the best manga out there, in terms of drawings and motion) and I will not talk about the flaws the KILL BILL-saga has (yes, there are flaws and I will see to them in my KILL BILL: Vol. 2 comment).<br/><br/>I will just say KILL BILL: Vol. 1 is a must-see thrill ride, which perfectly portrays, exaggerates and perfects Tarantino's style of film-making that I've come to love over the years. This is Tarantino's ultimate take on the 'revenge-flick'-theme and he makes sure this sub-genre rises to new solitary heights. As to the complaint of some viewers who state that a lot of events in KILL BILL are illogical and unrealistic I can only say one thing: This is a movie created in an environment free from limitations and as a cinematographic experience it pushes the boundaries of modern-day film-making. Therefore it is by definition granted the defiance of logic, for being bound by logic restrains oneself from pushing boundaries (and you can quote me on that). I'll leave it at that. Or maybe one more important thing: I recommend seeing the two KILL BILL-volumes (the whole experience) in one take (perhaps with one cigarette-break in between), like it was intended. Why? I'll explain in my comment for KB: Vol. 2."

Everything about this movie is a lot different from all the other movies - everything about this film just seems so postmodern!

","Kill Bill, this bloody action packed movie is by far the best action movie ever made. Not only does this movie have people with samurai swords hacking through everything, its storyline is so in depth and perfect that is makes it THE BEST. The plot follows a women who worked as an assassin for a man she also fell in love with, when she was pregnant with her child, she left him and tried to start a ""normal"" life. Bill didn't accept that and killed all her friends and shot her in the head. Desperate for revenge on her dead daughter, she wants to kill all the ""cunts"" and ""dicks"" who did this to her.

","When I saw this movie in the theater and it opened with the cheesy 70's style intros I knew this was gonna be an extraordinary movie. This is a movie I watch over and over again because it is so incredibly entertaining for me. This is a movie for those who love kung fu movies. It's not required but I think that a lot of the nuances would be missed if don't dig kung fu classics like Enter the Dragon or Master of the Flying Guillotine. Quinten and Uma deserve high praise for this film. This movie I felt truly harnessed Uma's tremendous talent because for once she wasn't cast a a piece of window dressing. She was undoubtedly a BMF in this movie and I believe is right up there with Jules, and Dirty Harry as all time great BMFs. Also not to diminish her but I think Uma was never more beautiful than in this movie because she was allowed to show off her natural beauty. As for Quinten...I felt that this movie was, in part, a middle finger to the Hollywood giant and that is a very good thing. You can tell the amount of love that went into this movie because it's oozing off of every single frame of film."

The story of a pregnant bride (Uma Thurman) shot during her wedding by the Viper Assassination Squad sent by a man named Bill. It only happens that the victim of this assassination was a former member.<br/><br/>The current story (current is used loosely seeing as how the movie jumps from past to present simultaneously) picks up when we see the bride laying in a hospital bed in a coma. She wakes up and vows to kill all four of the four of the members who helped kill her, then to kill Bill, the man who put a bullet to her head.<br/><br/>The four Viper Members are played by Lucy Liu (O-Ren Ishii), Vivica A. Fox (Vernita Green), Daryl Hannah (Elle Driver), and Michael Madsen (Budd). <br/><br/>Now don't come to the theater expecting something different from Terintino, you will be sadly mistaken. But for those who weren't, congratulations, you came to see the right movie. Kill Bill has that same vibe from Pulp Fiction with more action and lots more blood. Seriously, a lot more blood.<br/><br/>The movie has plenty of drama and slow moments as well to balance out the film, which is nice. But after every action scene you find yourself laughing and screaming MORE! And thank God Terintino threw in that awesome soundtrack because even the greatest script needs music.<br/><br/>If a retro yet modern action packed movie with good acting and sweet music is what you need, then most might say you to see Kill Bill. 8 great stars out of 10."
"brainofj72","8","0","3","4 September 2005"," A Violent Pop Culture Extravaganza
","""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is a film that's all about style. Style, violence, and pure entertainment. Some call it gratuitously violent, some call it disgusting, some call it style-over-substance...I call it magnificent.<br/><br/>The film follows a woman known simply as The Bride (Thurman) (her real name is never revealed), an expert assassin who, while pregnant, was left for dead at her wedding by her criminal employer, Bill (Carradine), after her former, um, co-workers massacred her entire wedding party. Well, four years later she wakes up from a coma (as a situation that is as amusing as it is disgusting and brutal arises, I won't spoil it for you) and, upon discovering that she has lost her baby, becomes enraged and embarks on an epic odyssey of bloody revenge.<br/><br/>In classic Tarantino form, the film is presented out of order, but, as always for him, it works wonderfully. ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" also exhibits another trait that is signature Tarantino: it's packed to the brim with homages. While many may complain about this and say that Tarantino is nothing but a flamboyant plagiarist, it is what he does, and he does it well. Very well.<br/><br/>Another gripe many people seem to have with the film is that it is overly violent, repulsively so. This seems to have been a popular complaint also with Tarantino's first two films, ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", and while I believe those two films have more of a violent reputation than actual violence, ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" really is extremely violent. However, it is not gritty or realistic violence meant to be taken seriously, but comically over-the-top violence in the style of the Kung Fu and samurai films of '70s, replete with gallons of squirting blood and plenty of flying limbs.<br/><br/>Another pervasive complaint is that the film suffers from a severe case of style-over-substance, but, as I stated in the first sentence of this review, ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is all about style. It's what makes the film such a joy to watch. Quentin Tarantino works the camera and breezes through scenes so expertly and effortlessly that one can't help but keep their eyes glued to the screen. Also, this complaint is rendered obsolete once one has viewed the second volume of this epic saga, which really fleshes out the characters and adds meat to the bone, but I'm not reviewing that film.<br/><br/>Another talent Tarantino has is extracting a spectacular performance from his actors, and ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is no exception. Uma Thurman is simply outstanding, especially in Volume 2, but again, I'm reviewing Volume 1. David Carradine delivers such a menacing and exuberant performance as the elusive Bill, and we never even see his face.<br/><br/>And of course, how could I forget Quentin's marvelous dialogue? It has always been his strongest point, and ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" finds him in top pop culture form. Allow me to quote one of my favorite exchanges from the film: -O-Ren Ishii: ""You didn't really think it was going to be that easy, did you?"" -The Bride: ""You know, for a second there, yeah, I kinda did."" -O-Ren Ishii: ""Silly rabbit."" -The Bride: ""Trix are for..."" -The Bride and O-Ren Ishii: ""...kids."" It's just so self-consciously tongue-in-cheek and joyous that it's damn near impossible not to fall in love with it.<br/><br/>All this being said, ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"" is not a film for everyone. If you're a fan of such films as ""Sin City"", ""Ichi The Killer"", or any kind of classic Kung Fu movie, then you'll most likely love this modern masterpiece, but if such films rape, kill, and then shoot your value system in the head just for good measure, than you should probably avoid this one.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Kill Bill: Volume 1, directed by the epitome of cool, Quentin Tarantino, is a fantastic, action-packed movie. The soundtrack is awesome, the fight scenes stunning and the acting is superb from the entire cast.<br/><br/>Kill Bill follows The Bride's (Uma Thurman) story of revenge. Gunned down at her wedding by her former workmates she has now created a Death List Five. This movie focuses on the first two. Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu) and Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox). In typical QT style we flash back and forth gathering information about The Bride and her former workmates, in particular Cottonmouth.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is just a freakin' outstanding movie. Not as good as QT's Pulp Fiction but still a damn good movie. Uma Thurman delivers an outstanding performance, although we don't know a lot about her she is still manages to make us feel for her. The soundtrack is probably one of the best I have ever heard however tThe dialogue isn't as witty and memorable as his dialogue from Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, which is a little disappointing. But the action scenes are exceptional (a great throw-back to old kung-fu flicks), which we would expect from QT.<br/><br/>5/5"
"Robert_duder","8","0","3","23 August 2005"," Tarantino Scores...finally!!
","I admit, I was very determined to NOT like Kill Bill. I am not a Quentin Tarantino fan by ANY means!! His film making is egotistical, and annoying and he works far too hard to make the film unique, original, and usually confusing. But the general public seems to like his films for his gratuitous violence and pointless everything else that is taboo. Nonetheless he manages to mainstream his film enough to make a decent action movie that the film goers loved. So I went into this film expecting very little and it was awesome!! <br/><br/>First of all someone else I am NOT a fan of Uma Thurman but she turns in a brilliant performance and likely a lasting classic film character in ""The Bride."" The film is all about simple, horrible, blood thirsty revenge. The simplistic plot makes the film easy to watch despite Tarantino's directing style which still shows through. The entire main cast really creates lasting characters for film history. Not only does Thurman turn in a blood thirsty disturbing role as The Bride, but we have her main adversary O-Ren Ishii played by Lucy Liu, who up until now has also never turned in an impressive role so it's fair to say that if anything Tarantino brings out the best in sub par actors. The opening battle between The Bride and Vernita Green set the tone for what Kill Bill is about. Although not a lot of plot has been given about their backgrounds or the circumstances of The Bride's attempted murder, enough is given to keep it interesting. We are also introduced to some of the future battles and characters that will be covered in Volume Two and they were interesting enough to make you want to know what's going to happen.<br/><br/>Strangely enough the worst and best part of this film is Tarantino's direction. His positive unique style comes through in the incredible choreography of the battles, the intense over the top violence, and the less than credible bloody scenes that seem so unrealistic that it's meant to be that way. At the same time you are bombarded with Tarantino's forced uniqueness, the scenes made from Japanimation, the annoyingly jumpy plot line, and the oddball small little admissions, which may or may not be explained away in the second volume (I have yet to see.) No matter what anyone who wants a simple hack fest with loads of blood and over exaggerating violent scenes, this one is worth seeing plus it will be a cinema classic no matter what. Looking forward to volume 2!! 8.5/10"

","Tarantino's brutally violent homage to kung-fu and samurai films is a bit overrated in my eyes. When i told my friend who is in love with this film that i enjoyed it but not to the point of worship like him, he got mad. Well I thought this film was powerful, sure was entertaining, and had very good writing and acting. Now to the bad parts, thought it was too violent, a bit redundant with battle scenes, got bored actually at times. I thought Uma Thurman did a hell of a job, very good acting, as did Madsen in his small role. I'm not a big fan of Lucy Liu, but I thought Vivica A. Fox was decent. The main reason I probably didn't like this film is because I don't like kung-fu movies for the msot part, or most karate fighting films with Jet Li/Jackie Chan, etc... However I thought Zwick's The Last Samurai was much more engaging than this, maybe thats just my style. Anyhow it was entertaining, and had some good acting and Tarantino's writing was evident. 8/10"

Good movie, indeed and Uma Thurman played a kick ass role. The movie was extremely brutal and blood lashed out everywhere from beginning to end, but it's a Tarantino movie, what do you expect? I wasn't really bothered by that point, despite it was a little unrealistic but I guess that's how it was suppose to be made. Overall, Tarantino's, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is very stylish nevertheless and it also to add, it had great music. Not as great as everyone says it was, but it was still a good movie.

","Quentin has done it again and with no hesitation he pays tribute to the most interesting film genre of all time. Kill Bill has got to be the most well put together homage to classic samurai movies of our time. The great thing about this movie is that unlike the imported Zatoichi movies this movie has no lame voice over actors and is far from wacky with the character mannerisms. What makes this movie so enjoyable is that Quentin although staying as true as he can to the pop culture was able to Americanize it in his own way. I'm a big fan of martial arts films and also of the wu-tang clan so then again for me this movie was heaven. With Rza on the tracks and the experience of Sonny Chiba(the reason for the 70's martial arts film boom) this film is great success. Not for everyone though.

","Who are the greatest directors of all time? The Perfect Movie I love Tarantino Audio/visual unsynchronized: When Winston Wolf departs in his Acura, he takes a hard corner, but the sound indicates continuous acceleration in a straight line. While the acceleration is possible, it would sound different going around a corner. I think one of the problems many people have with this movie is that it defined and set into motion an extremely irritating trend in contemporary film. The god-awful clones of Tarantino pouring out of indie and mainstream studios alike should not, however, detract from the brilliance and subtlety of this movie. It works simply because those moments of brilliance (I have to admit I know the whole ""Jules redemption-speech"" by heart) that its imitators lack come in the midst of the camp and gore they all do so well.

","""Kill Bill, Volumes 1 & 2"": Quentin Tarantino has now sucked all the milk from his earlier teat career. ""Wunderkind QT"" is no longer inventing. He's caricaturizing everything he and other film makers did. He has learned nothing positive or negative from Warhol or Devo. ""Kill Bill 1 & 2"" could easily be one film of standard length. It wouldn't make it a better film, but it would reduce the dragging, dull scenes of repetitive slashing (yes, I said dull - there only so many limbs that can be removed in so many ways), and endless pseudo-story-laden philosophizing - ""My Dinner with The Squad"". I was obviously disappointed. There WERE occasional witty moments, some fun choreographing, pretty animation, and I often liked the atmosphere created by cover songs used in scenes...but even they were overused. Tarantino overuses everything, including himself. The centuries old and still valid challenge to all artists is to know when to STOP on a work...and it IS before you run out of breath. See ""Reservoir Dogs"", see ""Pulp Fiction"", and then stop wasting your time."

","I love this movie.<br/><br/>Tarentino is a genius. This movie has many twists and turns, and there's something about the way it's shot that you can't tear your eyes from. One thing I noticed was the color usage -- quite a bit of hue for such a macabre film, but for some reason this blended with it perfectly.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point: this movie pulled off some tricks that any other flick probably couldn't. For instance, when The Bride was comatose in the hospital bed, they split the screen to show Elle Driver disguising herself as a nurse. That in it's own right was risky, because most flicks who try that tend to butcher the scene. Not the case with Kill Bill. And despite the fact that Elle Driver was preparing to commit murder, the music was oddly a cheerful and uplifting ditty. Fantastic!<br/><br/>That actually happens a lot in this movie. You hear music that you wouldn't normally find fitting for such a scene, but for some reason when it's thrown into the mix, it turns out beautifully. In addition, I am a militant anime hater - and even I enjoyed the segment explaining(Lou's) life, I found it morbidly artistic.<br/><br/>Just as a warning, though, this movie has a lot of gore! If you're squeamish to bloody sword fights and decapitation, you probably shouldn't watch this one of a big screen. Otherwise, enjoy this flick, I know I did!"

","A hideously-wronged female avenger left for dead on her wedding day tracks down her former colleagues from an assassination team (lead by the eponymous Bill) and treats them to some cold-hearted justice.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's first movie in six years is the first of a two-part epic homage to the old Shaw Brothers Cantonese kung-fu classics of the seventies, and makes for deliciously overblown entertainment. This is the kind of movie you just don't see these days, where a director has been allowed to write his own ticket and go absolutely bonkers. It's fantastic. The main setpiece is a breathtaking samurai swordfight in a Tokyo restaurant, which pretty much manages to beat anything Jackie Chan, Tsui Hark or John Woo have ever done. The whole movie pulsates with crackling energy and rocks to a typically eclectic mix of music ranging from Asian beats to elevator pan-pipes musak. Art design, action choreography, editing and camera-work are all razor-sharp, and all of the numerous limb-hackings are accompanied by some of the most gloriously squishy sound-effects I've ever heard. The cast (including a great serio-comic turn from Chiba, who starred in many of the films that inspired this) somehow manage to inject some reality into the collection of lunatics they play. To a large extent this movie exists somewhere beyond criticism - it's only half a movie, its timeframe is all over the place (in the classic Tarantino tradition), it goes off into a manga animation section in the middle, half the dialogue is in Japanese, there are enormous credibility holes (characters are allowed to carry samurai swords with them on modern-day airliners) and not a whole lot makes sense. I just wish more people made movies with this kind of sensibility."
"mdfuk","8","0","3","9 June 2005"," I Predict a Riot
","Kill Bill is a film of blood, violence, Quentin Tarrantino. and that's about it. The basic plot outline is extremely far-fetched if not a little crazy (but would be expect anything less from Tarrantino) We start out with a bit of murder and chaos, take a trip back in time to learn why, then we hurtle back to the present with more murder and chaos. Simple really? The Films main point of interest that makes it almost stand out from the crowd are the cleverly directed and choreographed samurai fight scenes between The Bride (Uma Thurman) and what appears to be the rest of the world. The main fight scene with the Crazy 88 is very bloody, graphic and realistic if not for a few wire stunts from Thurman and some of the other scenes are rather disgusting to watch (there is a now infamous head slamming in a metal hospital door scene) Disgusting as they are they are worked into the plot line very well by Tarrantino and as with all his films it is extremely difficult to predict what will happen next. I really did love the fact the films name was Kill Bill and Bill did not die in this first outing a perfect set up for a sequel and now talks of a third (clever money spinning tactics I think) Overall this film is pretty much a riot. If you like your films gritty, real and packed with more violence than a state prison. Kill Bill is definitely worth a watch, if your squeamish about the sight of blood, guts or revenge doesn't appeal to you then go and rent something else and don't say i didn't warn you."

","Tarantino's fourth (and fifth) film as director see's him blatantly working through his cinematic obsessions in a whirlwind of bloodletting and wire-fu. Tarantino's movie mixes Japanese Yakuza, Samurai and Hong Kong martial arts genres together and even throws in a little Anime segment (By Tokyo's 'Production I.G.' studio) and somehow it just about holds together. There are some nice cameo's too, from Tarantino hero Sonny Chiba and Battle Royale minx Kuriyama Chiaki. Miike Takeshi favourite Kunimura Jun also has a small role too, winding up on the wrong end of Uma Thurman's 'Japanese Steel'. The film is full of cool, nerdy injokes for fans of this kind of stuff. It even opens with the old 'Made in Shawscope' logo that adorned Hong Kong's Shaw Brothers productions in the 70's. Somehow though, despite the fact the movie is terrific fun for fans of Eastern exploitation cinema and newbies alike, it leaves you feeling slightly unsatisfied. If you're a Tarantino fan you might find yourself wondering where all the witty dialogue is (That a good proportion of the movie is in Japanese won't help, either) with only the occasional trademark witty one-liner (Thurmans to young gangster wannabe while smacking his ass with sword ""This is what you get for f**king around with Yakuza's Now go home to your Mommy!"")although we're assured there's lots of it in volume two. Which brings us on to the other real problem. It's no secret that Kill Bill was originally a three hour movie that Miramax has sliced in half with their marketing katana. Unfortunately, this is exactly how it feels too. The movie just stops, albeit on a plot revelation, and up come the credits. Not quite the damp squib of Matrix Reloaded but perilously close. And whereas that film had far too much plot and not enough action, this seems to be the exact reverse. Even the dodgiest Shaw Bros. vehicle revealed more motivation for it's characters actions that Kill Bill does. Ultimately it's a film that cannot be judged until we've seen the complete thing. Unlike the Matrix or Lord Of The Rings trilogies Kill Bill was never meant to be sliced up this way and, despite it's being divided into chapters anyway, it doesn't seem to do the movie any favours. Personally I was always destined to enjoy this, it panders to some of the things I like most about cinema, and Tarantino clearly 'grew up' (Possibly the wrong words, come to think about it) on the same eastern grindhouse cinema I did myself. My advice then, rent out a couple of Fukusuku Kinji Yakuza movies, or Miike Takashi's Dead Or Alive films, or Shurayuki Hime (AKA Lady Snowblood) which this film borrows from most of all and have a marathon screening session with them and THEN see Kill Bill Part one. You'll enjoy it so much more once you know which films it's referencing, and you'll get to see some wonderful movies along the way."

","Billed as Tarantino's fourth film, Kill Bill Vol 1 is both a departure from what he has done before, and a mix of all previous films. It is primarily a Kung Fu revenge movie with many nods to past martial arts classics. Uma Thurman plays The Bride, a pregnant woman shot and left for dead at her wedding by Bill and his gang, the people she used to work for. After lying in a coma for four years, she wakes and immediately begins her quest for revenge. She is a killer, and all of her abilities remain, so she travels to Japan to get herself the greatest sword ever made and pick off her old gang one by one by one...<br/><br/>All the trademarks of the Auteur are here, the dialogue, the non-linear story-telling, the clever camera angles, and the violence, but while his past films appealed to smart-ass critics, this is one for the fans, for himself, for all the kids like me who grew up watching Martial Arts movies. There is a great amount of blood-shed, although it is all brilliantly and stylishly filmed, and of course it is all done in a humorous way. As usual, Tarantino gets the best out of his cast, and they all seem to feel that it is an honour to work with him. Thurman is back to her best, old favourites like Sonny Chiba and Kenji Ohba are excellent, Lucy Liu is very good, and all the smaller parts are filled admirably. Julie Dreyfuss is also good, and Chiaki Kuriyama of Battle Royale Gonin and Shikoku fame. Tarantino is clearly having fun making this, experimenting with a variety of styles, from manga and anime to filtering between black and white and colour, the soundtrack is as effective as all his previous films, the instrumental mixing well with the songs and noises.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol.1 works mainly, through all the impressive violence, fun and games because of the Bride and her quest. We want to see her get revenge, we want to see her destroy all the murdering mah-fah's who get in her way, and we want to see her Kill Bill. For that though you may have to wait for part two, unless you've wisely purchased that as well. There are a few twists, saving the biggest till last, but overall this is a fun movie, particularly for fans of fight films, setting us up well for the more emotive Vol 2, the Chinese Western part. A good return for the best new American director of the nineties.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","This movie has been criticized for having no substance; no meat, as it were. Now, I'm no great fan of Tarrantino (in fact, I hadn't liked a single of his productions before this one), so there are no feelings to be hurt on his behalf. There is no other reason for me to defend this film, than the very real fact that I loved it!<br/><br/>The second issue is the ""violence against women"" issue. It's been said that this movie is like ""A Clockwork Orange"" in its demonstration of everything that is wrong with our society. Okay, as true as that may be, this film covers MANY societies, not just American. It also shows that the woman does NOT have to be the victim. She can (and should) stand on her own two feet and do something about her problems rather then waiting for some Prince Charming to come do it for her.<br/><br/>This plot and story has been detailed so many times on IMDb, that I won't even bother laying out the plot except to say that this plot was so well-conceived and executed as to win it 10 awards and gross nearly 4 times its original budget.<br/><br/>Every single artist involved in this attempt has surrendered a very compelling finished product in that it is a dark and lovely story (yes, it has a great story), that is embedded with some of the most synergistically graphic brutality I've ever witnessed on film. The action is unbelievable, the narrative is instrumental in moving the story along from scene to scene, and the score is as inspired as the screenplay.<br/><br/>The choreography by Sonny Chiba (who also portrayed Hattori Hanzo) was excellent and, when viewing the final work, looked natural and brilliant. And I must say that the soundtrack of this work was inspired and more than competently highlighted each scene in which the chosen music was featured.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this, I highly recommend it. It's action, not horror or even drama. It's NOT for the squeamish.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","Although it is somewhat different from the previous Tarrantino movies, it does have his specific signature.<br/><br/>The action scenes are quite violent and are portrayed with the sense of humor and irony that one expects of Tarrantino. Blood sprays abundantly from chopped of limbs and heads, and the fountain-like sound that makes only adds to the sense of unrealism that makes this type of movie easier to cope with.<br/><br/>The story is told in the typical asynchronous style, jumping back and forth in time. And there is, of course, the camera-shot from a trunk of a car. <br/><br/>But rather than shooting their way all around, this time the hero and the villains go at each other with fists, feet, knives and swords. The martial arts scenes are very impressive, and despite the speed of these scenes, there are still some very funny shots. I particularly enjoyed the scene of a villain screaming while holding his chopped off foot in his hands.<br/><br/>Innovative and funny were the Japanese-animation-style scenes, about the youth and career of O-Ren Ishii.<br/><br/>All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie. It was good, but not as good as Pulp Fiction. But perhaps, that's just because I'm getting used to Tarrantino-movies."

","The main thing I heard about this movie before I saw it was that it was the most violent movie ever made. Not surprising for a Tarantino movie, but once I saw it the violence turned out to be rather cartoonish, which was, I suppose, the point. Evidently the movie was inspired by, pays homage to, or spoofs Japanese anime cartoons. I really don't care about the connection other than to say that I intensely dislike anime, martial arts movies, and the people who go ape over either. Its all very childish and quite emblematic of the Ritalin generation. Nevertheless, it is a Tarantino film, and it does have oodles of that sophisticated yet disgusting humor that make us Tarantino watchers keep coming back for more. Tarantino could have cut out two hours of tiresome Kung Fu fight scenes and just made one movie, but which would make everyone more money? Hmm? Well, we know the answer. Currently this movie is at #58 in the top 250--a distinction it doesn't deserve, but it does deserve it more than some others on the list."

","KILL BILL, VOL. 1 might be an amazing movie for someone who's never seen another movie like it. Unfortunately for me, I have, and Quentin Tarantino's latest is basically yet another tiresome rehash of worn out clichés from 70's grindhouse action flicks. This has served him well in previous projects such as PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN, but KILL BILL, VOL. 1 is wildly uneven, missing at least as often as it hits the mark.<br/><br/>I won't bother with the plot, as just about everyone knows it by now. If you haven't seen it, think HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER times a hundred. That's not necessarily a compliment -- bigger is not necessarily better -- and that's proved here repeatedly. In the wake of such astonishing martial arts movies as THE MATRIX and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, KILL BILL is old hat.<br/><br/>There are some good scenes, such as Uma Thurman's initial battle with former partner Vivica A. Fox, the derivative-but-still-cool battle between Thurman and dozens of Japanese mafia warriors, and, especially, Thurman's showdown with a schoolgirl assassin wielding a razor embedded flail. Another fight between Thurman and Lucy Liu is the movie's highlight.<br/><br/>Other than these points, however, there's just not much here. It movies along at a good pace, but has more than its share of ""been-there-done-that"" sequences that probably should have been left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with KILL BILL, VOL. 1 (and VOL. 2 for that matter) is Uma Thurman herself. Her performance is jaw-droppingly awful, more often than not emulating a post-STAR TREK William Shatner with her contrived dramatic pauses, bugging eyes and stilted delivery. Lucy Liu plays the same character she's played in everything she's ever done, so one can't really complain nor condemn her presence here. The standout performance is Darryl Hannah as Thurman's would-be assassin. Her role here is little more than a cameo, but she is given much more to do in VOL. 2.<br/><br/>Overall, KILL BILL, VOL. 1 is Tarantino's weakest directorial effort. It's a bit better than NATURAL BORN KILLERS or TRUE ROMANCE, both of which it resembles stylistically, but well beneath what Tarantino fans have come to expect from the man himself.<br/><br/>I must nit-pick a bit here and say that the opening credits kind of p***ed me off, with all the ""4th Film by Quentin Tarantino"" and ""1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 as the Viper Squad"" crap. It's self-indulgent film geek pseudo quirkiness at its worst. At least he was kind enough to spare us the torture of watching him act."

","Plot Synopsis: The Bride (Uma Thurman) has just suffered the indignation of everyone at her wedding being brutally slaughtered. Now she wants revenge, Tarantino style! <br/><br/>This is Tarantino's first film since 1997s Jackie Brown and this chop-socky, Asian-influenced, blood-drenched fanboy's wet-dream is the epitome of style over substance - entertaining, action-packed and fast paced, yet lacking the depth of his previous films, thus not holding up well in retrospect.<br/><br/>Action wise, the film is brilliant. Tarantino's direction and Woo-ping Yuen's fight choreography are set to induce many 'action reply' moments on the DVD player with the thumping J-Pop soundtrack providing a great foil to the carnage. However, one of the most disappointing aspects of this film is the absence of Tarantino's customary sparkling dialogue so evident in his previous outings. <br/><br/>A hack-job at its most blatant, it is nonetheless a feast for the senses.

","First off, I generally enjoyed KB1. It's got some very entertaining fight sequences and strong visual style, and while the blood was excessive I found it more comical than gross, even though I normally have a low threshold for gore.<br/><br/>But I'm left with the same feeling I get from any Tarantino film: so what? Tarentino could be described as a pop artist like Andy Warhol, who made his fame making replicas of Campbell soup labels and putting them in art galleries. Tarantino made a very stylish, slick, high budget homage/pastiche of shlocky action films. It is convincingly like those movies. But it doesn't bring anything new to the formula. Tarantino's films seem to exist entirely on the surface, lacking any subtext beyond, gee, weren't these movies really cool? Isn't lots of blood funny? Tarantino's consciousness seems to have gelled when he was about 17 and not gone anywhere since, and his style serves only itself. He has nothing to say about revenge, or violence, or the moral code of the warrior, he just throws it all up on screen because he thinks it's really neato.<br/><br/>Which would be fine if he were making a cheap action picture, but Tarantino imbues his films with the sense that he's doing something really special when he's just recreating formative films from his childhood. And the feeling that the movie means to be bigger and better than its inspirations but really isn't makes the experience somehow hollow and unsatisfying, like a cake that is so airy you feel you haven't eaten. <br/><br/>This so what feeling has kept me from enjoying previous Tarantino films. Tarantino's scripts would work best with more straightforward direction, which is why True Romance worked better than any of the scripts he has directed himself. Still, I did enjoy this movie overall, I did give it 7/10, and it is the first Tarantino-directed movie I have genuinely enjoyed.<br/><br/>I just feel it's a shame that someone with obvious skill seems to have so little depth."
"van-der-veen","Null","0","1","23 October 2004"," Dear mr. Tarentino,
","I've been watching the beginning of your movie Kill Bill, volume 1 and I failed to comprehend your motivation for the excessive violence. I turned it off. I studied film and watched your earlier 90's movies Reservoir dogs and Pulp Fiction. In these days in the mind frame I was in, it seemed to make sense at least someone making such movies, because of the discussion it provoked on the explicitness of violence in film as a subject. I wrote a paper on it, but already had moral problems. Of course I am free to watch or not. But you are free to make such movies or not too. So why do you? I regarded your movies as thought provoking and sort of a reaction to be in a way in opposition to violence in the casual way it gets portrayed in cinema or television series in abundance, in many ways which one could almost condone it. That's why I thought you to be in fact a very moral person, who could oversee the moral complexity of his actions while taking things to and over the edge. By now, I feel you have tripped into a minefield with no way out, and dragging me as a spectator in there a little with you. Isn't there a comparison to the way in which 'the military fighting for a good cause' may become as dark as the supposed 'evil' that they are fighting. Is it a misconception of my part to place you in this discussion in this way, or is it just the thrill of making such violent movies, do you actually still have the overview or has the car run of with the driver. Could you make any more brutal a movie? Do you want people to see violence for what it is or has it just become a trade? I know you're not Walt Disney, by the way, and of course Donald Duck is also quite violent... Or are you?<br/><br/>A naive dreamer for a more friendly world"

","'Kill Bill' is one of the truly hottest movies made in recent memory. There certainly was some hype associated with its debut; we knew, for example, it was to be made in two parts, but had no clue why that might be a good idea. Well, that as well as the structure and tone of the film were ALL good ideas.<br/><br/>What we immediately conclude is that finest of accolades: there is no movie like this. Or, put another way, find me a film in which there are great chick fights (an opening number, as it turns out), mean blonde bad girls with eye patches, half a dozen edgy moments in which we might want to look away but instead grit our teeth and WATCH - voyeuristic as it may seem or listen to a score masterfully matched to the action.<br/><br/>This is the revenge film of revenge films. The Bride (Uma Thurman) has been seriously wronged (by Bill  David Carridine  in the best work we have ever seen him do) and is out to make it right. Well, have revenge, anyway, the rightness of her actions questionable but probably what we would like to do ourselves given her situation.<br/><br/>We also have recorded here some of the strongest female characters ever shown on film. In fact, nearly all the women are stronger than any man portrayed, and this is fascinating. Without doubt men troubled by tough women won't like much of what they see here. But those men that don't will be treated to some nifty niceties.<br/><br/>Witness, as Uma Thurman runs through her list of former associates that she's determined must be eliminated, the first great femme á femme fight ever recorded; then watch assassin Lucy Liu (as O-Ren Ishii) deliver a stunning boardroom speech. There are no moments less riveting as The Bride moves though her list.<br/><br/>For sheer style there have not been very many films offered us that convey such tongue-in-cheek mayhem. Put this one on your list of must-sees. <br/><br/>Rating: Four Stars."

","If you want to see a feel good movie or, if you're faint of heart this is not the movie for you. If you like blood and revenge, then Kill Bill Vol.1 is the movie for you. I would highly recommend seeing this movie. It is an action thriller. Kill Bill was directed by Quinton Tarantino.<br/><br/>It starts out with a young bride who is in the 'Deadly Viper Assassination Squad.' She wants to leave the team for a normal life. The leader, Bill (David Carradine), has the bride (Uma Thurman) watch them kill her wedding party. Then he shoots her in the head, putting her in a coma for four years. When she awakes, she has vowed revenge. <br/><br/>This two part series is very gory. She hunts down the team starting at the bottom and working her way up to Bill. First, she hunts down Vernita Green, aka 'Copperhead,' (Vivica A. Fox) and fights her in her own home. Then, she goes to Okinawa to find Hattori Hanzo, a master sword maker, for a sword to go after O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). They have a magnificent battle on a snow covered Japanese garden. <br/><br/>This movie has more action than you can imagine. The plot is very intriguing and dramatic. I like the way it always has something happening, and it is fast paced. This is a movie that you can watch many times. The first movie defiantly makes us want to see the second one. The movie has blood and body parts flying everywhere. One critic even says it's the goriest movie ever released in the U.S. Quinton Tarantino has outdone himself on this series. Like his other classic's Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, and Jackie Brown, Tarantino proves he can still make an original idea into a movie."

I think the scene is really missing, for it would set the tone a few notches up for the violence that comes afterwards, and perhaps would have made it even more justifiable. What I mean is the audience reacts well to edges of emotion, and sex is the edgiest of edges. Anyone who has seen Irreversible will understand my point: it's greatly more disturbing to see the contrast between sex and violence if there is more graphic display of the sex."

","and I really dig it. It's a tale of revenge, this time with a hot, sword toting Uma Thurman, who woke up from a 4 year coma. She was beat up and shot by her former partners, the deadly viper assassination squad, on her wedding day and very pregnant. As with other Tarantino films, this one goes back and forth in time, and this time it really works and is not confusing. Plus, great music is used as usual. And I have to say I really laughed when in the beginning the little girl comes home to find her mom and the bride covered in blood and broken glass, and the mom says the dog did it; also the P#ussywagon truck and when the bride wakes up and takes care of Buck.<br/><br/>All the sword fighting was very well done. Uma did a great job with the training it must have took to do all that. I do wish the fight with Lucy Liu would have been longer and a more dramatic death, but the way she dies was funny. And it certainly was not too violent because all the blood and limbs flying were so over-the-top and unrealistic, which is how it was supposed to be. I loved the fight with Gogo because of her weapon of choice.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I can't wait to see volume 2. I highly recommend it, very entertaining and amusing.

One day, however, quite recently, I was watching one of my premium cable channels and there it was, just asking me to watch it...so to speak. I sat down, gave it nearly my full attention, and became intrigued within minutes. Yet again, the beautiful and talented Uma Thurman dazzled the screen of a Tarantino film, this time not nearly as helpless as she appeared to be in Pulp Fiction. Armed at first with only a knife, she embarks on a journey with the sole intent to seek revenge on those who destroyed what was to be her life. As usual, this film didn't go in chronological order, causing the viewer to really pay attention to the fine details of the movie, thus creating a well captivating thriller/drama/comedy. Yes I said comedy, I know it may not seem that way to some, but there some just plain funny parts to this movie, in a way I suppose is impossible to explain. Even the end of this movie, while you knew it was going to be a cliffhanger, kept you guessing up until the last minute, and definitely made me run out and rent Kill Bill Vol. 2, which perhaps not as good in the fight scene aspect, yet still achieved a thumbs up in my opinion.

","""Kill Bill"" begins as a black and white preview of a beaten Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) who is talking to someone as the camera stays focused on her face. A bullet pierces her skull and the credits immediately start to roll. This movie has me eagerly waiting the 'What's going on?' question that sits in the back of my head while my eyes are glued to the TV. As the movie progresses, Kiddo starts her anger-driven rampage with Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox). The list includes, from least important to most, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Budd (Michael Madson), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and finally Bill (David Carradine). Kiddo goes about the entire film eliminating the characters one by one. When doing this, she takes her time to plan out each kill precisely, down to the way she's going to fight. Kiddo only gets to O-Ren Ishii before the movie ends and continues the rest of the story in ""Kill Bill Volume:2.""<br/><br/>What's great about this movie is that it doesn't come out and bluntly tell us this is why this is happening. The film took us through loopholes from the present and then back to the past to explain why each person was on her list. During Kiddo's less important kills, it foreshadows a twist in the plot later in the second movie that drove me to go out and rent Volume:2. I think the reason this movie is so intriguing is that I've never seen a film relate one story from the past to the future story so well without making me want to press the stop button. The amount of detail used in this film and the more than unusual storyline had me hooked from the beginning and kept me going through the entire film, even enough to spend more money to finish it. I was quite surprised that director Quentin Tarantino didn't bore me to death like his other films where the story went nowhere. I was very impressed by the plot setting and the technique used to create this wonderful story. This film was interesting and truly one of a kind."

"ed_metal_head","8","0","1","31 August 2004"," Quentin Tarantino Returns
","'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' marks the return of acclaimed director/writer Quentin Tarantino to the cinema screen after a six-year hiatus. Tarantino originally made Kill Bill as a 180-minute homage to films that have influenced him (he seems to enjoy 70's Kung Fu movies the most). However, the movie studio's economic concerns over a three-hour film meant the director was asked to split the film into two parts; hence, we have this film (Vol. 1), with Vol. 2 being released some time after. <br/><br/>Kill Bill: Vol. 1 tells the story of The Bride (Uma Thurman) and her quest to kill Bill (David Carradine - who we hear, but do not see in this film). Her grudge with Bill is the result of Bill and his serpent named Assassination squad (of which she was a member) interrupting her wedding by killing everyone. The Bride manages to survive a bullet to the head that leaves her in a coma (her unborn child it seems, was not so lucky). After she awakens, she swears she will have her revenge on Bill and the rest of his assassins. As this is the first of the two films, The Bride only encounters two of Bill's assassins: Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).<br/><br/>The story unfolds in chapters that are not necessarily in chronological order (much like 'Pulp Fiction'). Tarantino's script is always entertaining as it takes The Bride along her journey. Along the way, she encounters several colourful characters, such as Buck (who likes to) and Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). It is interesting that some of the best moments in this movie are the scenes with Hanzo (a legendary Japanese sword maker) that are quite sombre while the rest of the film is mostly fast paced action. The plot also features some nicely thrown in unusual moments such as The Bride's real name being beeped out whenever another character says it. An element of accuracy is also present since The Bride battles atrophy after she awakens from her coma. The main disappointment though is a lack of proper character development and none of the excellent dialogue that Tarantino does so well.<br/><br/>In terms of direction, Tarantino shows that he has learnt a few new tricks. These include one scene that is entirely in Japanese anime and several others filmed in black and white. However, one must question whether the choice to do this was an artistic one or an attempt to tone down the violence.<br/><br/>The cinematography in this movie is stunning. There is no better example of this than a scene filmed in undisturbed snow that becomes covered in blood. The contrast created by the red blood on the white snow is something to behold. Also visually captivating are the well-choreographed action sequences where Uma Thurman shines. In fact, her fight scene with the 'Crazy 88' gang is much better than the hyped Neo vs. several Agent Smiths in 'The Matrix Reloaded'. The action seems to fall flat however, whenever a limb is severed. The blood spews so ridiculously that it looks more like a gag in a 'Monty Python' film than an action movie. Tarantino has apparently done this effect purposely, as part of his homage to 70's kung fu films, but it seems stupid and out of place.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' has little. Arguably, Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo gives the best performance. Uma Thurman is good as The Bride, especially her fighting sequences that clearly required extensive physical training. However, she never truly gets enough time to display her acting talents. Lucy Liu's performance is not very good but is still her best one to date. The less that can be said about Vivica A. Fox's acting ability the better, so it is pleasing to see that she gets little screen time and dialogue. The remainder of the cast is unobtrusive and does not hamper the film. <br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is a fine film that highlights a director who is a master of his craft. It has a good plot scored with some high-quality music and is visually beautiful; the only disappointments are a lack of quality dialogue and some sub par acting. One cannot help to wonder what might have been if this motion picture had not been cut in half."

","As a movie fan, I wouldn't like to say I ""dislike"" Asian cinema, I simply haven't seen enough to comfortably pass judgment. I am certainly not a fan, and imagine it to be a genre that would be quite difficult for me to get into. The excuse that I've seen thrown around, that ""Kill Bill: Volume One"" is almost solely for Asian film fanatics, is ludicrous. I don't believe that this film will necessarily make an Asian film fan out of anyone, and I should know because I bloody loved it (but maybe that's because I was a Tarantino fan before).<br/><br/>So the plot at this point isn't particularly deep and the characters aren't very well explored, but all this can be forgiven due to the equally excellent ""Volume Two"", which fleshes everything out nicely. The cast do a good job this time around, but it isn't until ""Volume Two"" that the extent of their work can truly be appreciated. It isn't even until then that Tarantino's smart dialogue really comes into play. ""Volume One"" is solely about style, and I hope the Wachowskis are watching, because there really is much they could learn here.<br/><br/>It is so refreshing to watch an action sequence that for once, feels so real. The over-abundance of CGI elements in the ""Matrix"" films (amongst others) rose the action to absurdity. It was also nice to see the sequences in ""Kill Bill"" play out solely in real time, none of that slow-motion crap, which is a real thrill killer. Of course all this would mean nothing without the great control Tarantino shows during these scenes. A fine balance was retained which makes you root for the bride, but at the same time not take things too seriously. Tarantino WANTS his audience to have a good time, there's not nearly enough directors who hold that value to the same extent. I find it laughably ironic that this movie is seen as homage to many previous works, but delivers some of the freshest action sequences in recent years. I must also say it pays to see the ""House of Blue Leaves"" sequence in smashing full-colour goodness, if you can get hold of the Japanese version.<br/><br/>The anime sequence really opened my eyes and showed there's more to Japanimation than ""Pokémon"". When I first heard about it I questioned it's value, but it's executed brilliantly, and is phased in seamlessly. Of course there is no reason for it, other than to contribute to the film's style, and as I said that's what ""Volume One"" is all about.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is Tarantino's most diverse yet. This isn't an ordinary film, so an ordinary soundtrack won't do. The pieces that Tarantino has gathered do an admirable job, with a few original pieces (a first for Tarantino) from the RZA to fill the gaps.<br/><br/>I won't deny that without the presence of ""Volume Two"", it's easy to dismiss this first installment as shallow, but it delivers a level of sheer entertainment with eye bleeding visuals that shame most blockbusters. 9/10"

","Kill Bill was originally supposed to be one movie, but since the movie would have ended up being so lengthy, it was decided that two movies should be made.  Because of this, Kill Bill Vol. 1 got much less of the story and more of the action.  Vol. 1 doesn't play like a regular movie, since there's so little story and you feel there's something missing in the movie, even though you know it's all going to emerge in Vol. 2.  The movie is mostly made up of a few gruesome battles and a couple of scenes, which really make the movie fun to watch, and one dorky animé sequence, which doesn't.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 is pretty good, not Tarantino's best film, but better than Jackie Brown.  The best way to enjoy the film is probably to watch it and Vol. 2 back-to-back so that you're not left hanging at all and so that you don't forget all the stuff from Vol. 1 that is mentioned in Vol. 2.  Nine stars out of ten."

","Kill Bill: Volume 1 is an entertaining look at what Tarantino gleaned from his years of indulging in high-octane, low-brow entertainment. As we all know by now, this movie has elements of anime, chop-socky, chambara, kung-fu, and the spaghetti Western. I had hoped that Tarantino, the most revered of all pop-culture nuts, would be able to combine these elements with the dialogue of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs.<br/><br/>Such a combo would have been brilliant. But the dialogue is not there, and the cool characters of Tarantino's usual writing are strangely absent. In lieu of the likes of the legendary Mr. Blonde and Vincent Vega, we have ""The Bride"" Beatrix Kiddo, Vernita Green, and O-Ren Ishii. These characters have meat, but leave much to be desired. The second installment satisfies more in this department.<br/><br/>What's more, much of the material has been pilfered (big surprise here) from other films. Paying homage is not a crime. Kill Bill is a fun and violent tribute to these movies that deserves to be enjoyed, but not worshiped."

","Kill Bill is an onslaught of violence, that is NOT artistic.  It has many trappings of ""artistic"" violence -- but it crosses too often into revelling in its graphicness.<br/><br/>A violent film needs to have violence of one of three types:<br/><br/>1. Artistic -- like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Then fight sequences in that film were like watching a well choreographed dance.<br/><br/>2. Unique -- the Matrix.  such as the opener in the original, the battle with the Merovingian's guards in the 3rd.<br/><br/>3. Heart-pounding (purposeful) -- like Gladiator.  Maximus seems to be fighting for his life in there, and it seems that he could lose at any point.  He beats insurmountable odds.<br/><br/>Kill Bill, vol. 1 does not deliver on any of those three levels -- with the exception of the fight scene involving Vivica A. Fox meets the conditions of #2.  Tarantino has gotten violence right in the past.  In Pulp Fiction, when Bruce Willis' character kills Zed and his buddy that fit into #3.<br/><br/>You never get a chance to root for the bride, she can't seem to lose.  Her quest is well positioned, in that we understand her want for revenge.  But she doesn't seem to be in any danger, so it is hard to root for her.<br/><br/>I give it a B-"

","All the attendant of a wedding, including the pregnant bride (Uma Thurman), have been killed by an assassination squad. The sheriff and his son think that this has been done by professionals. Although she was shot in the head, the bride is not dead but is in a coma. Four years later, the bride wakes up. She realizes that she has lost her child but also the husband she was going to marry. Since she knows the name of all the murderers (they were former assassination squad fellows), she decides to seek revenge by killing them one after the other. The first is Vernita Green aka Copperhead who lives in a suburban house. The second is the terrible O-Ren Ishii, boss of the Japanese mafia, who is protected by the 17-year old Gogo Yubari and the crazy 88 bodyguards.<br/><br/>In fact, Kill Bill vol. 1 is not a movie but half of a movie as its title obviously indicates. You can't be satisfied watching this one only (especially since vol. 2 is much better and contains the entire plot). In this first part, Uma Thurman is taking her revenge on those who killed her baby, her husband and almost killed herself. This movie is a tribute to Samourai movies. It is very violent but very well directed. It is probably Kill Bill Vol 1 that is, to this date, the best technical achievement of Quentin Tarantino as a director. The manga sequence is great, even if it is hardly watchable for those who don't like to see blood on screen. The whole fight sequence in Japan is a masterpiece of action movie and a lesson of cinema. Among the two main components of Tarantino movies (that is: 1 violent fight scenes and 2 funny talkative scenes), this volume 1 contains 80% of component 1 and 20% of component 2 (it's the opposite in volume2). This first part is just an appetizer to the second. Don't miss volume 2. I give this one 8/10."

","With the two-volume series of films that come to be known as ""Kill Bill,"" Quentin Tarantino has achieved a level of creativity lacking in most modern films that will take years to surpass.  ""Kill Bill"" is, in fact, an amalgam of all the grindhouse cinema outings that Tarantino made during the 70s.<br/><br/>When you think real hard about it, the plot to ""Kill Bill"" is absolutely ludicrous, and under the direction of a normal filmmaker, wouldn't make it past the 50-minute mark.  But under Tarantino's careful guidance, that ludicrous plot remains ludicrous, but he injects his requited love of cinema into the material and the plot suddenly takes a life and a whole new spin.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" is by far Tarantino's most accomplished work as a director, considering that I typically favor his non-directorial efforts (""True Romance,"" ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""From Dusk Till Dawn"") over his own directorial outings (""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Jackie Brown"").<br/><br/>I certainly look forward to more from Quentin Tarantino in the future being that with ""Kill Bill,"" he has created a cinematic epic of one man's love of movies and then seeing it realized on the screen."

","I had wanted to see ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" since I saw previews for it whenever they started advertising it.  My parents are HUGE Tarantino fans, and they wanted to see it as well.  Sadly though, we didn't get out to theaters to see it during its original release.<br/><br/>My best friend actually saw it before me, something that rarely happens, and she said that she just thought it was okay.  I was a BIT disappointed by it, but even though she's my best friend, I don't usually go by her movie advice.  She doesn't appreciate fine cinema as much as I do.  Or quite like I do.  To say I was underwhelmed to see the movie from her review, I wouldn't be lying.  Luckily enough, once it came out to buy, my Dad bought the DVD, no questions asked.  Although, it probably took me another 2 weeks to finally have enough time to watch it.<br/><br/>But all the waiting, anticipating, and hype was completely worth it.  This movie is just in a word: awesome.  <br/><br/>Uma Thurman gives an awesome performance as ""The Bride"" in the first installment.  As a hit woman out to avenge the deadly attack on her on her wedding day she did such a wonderful job.  I even enjoyed Lucy Liu in this flick as DiVAS nasty ""O-Ren Ishii"".  Usually, I have a hard time watching her, but I actually really liked her.  I also liked Vivica A. Fox's spunky portrayal as ""Vernita Green"".  And how heart-breaking was that scene in the kitchen when Nikki comes in to find that horrible discovery.<br/><br/>Director Quentin Tarantino crafts a smart, sophisticated, bloody masterpiece that almost anyone will enjoy.  He pays great homage to the Saturday morning kung-fu shows that many people used to watch in the early 1970's.  Even his tribute to anime during the chapter ""The Original Of O-Ren"" didn't bug me which is a HUGE feat to accomplish.  To tell the truth, I really liked it. It was done cleverly and had a good story behind it, so it didn't really bug me.  I especially  love the scene where ""The Bride"" kicks the coffee cup across the kitchen at ""Vernita"", I think just because it looks cool on screen.<br/><br/>I was PSYCHED to finally be able to see ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" and was totally impressed.  It was completely worth the wait and I was happy to see that I wasn't disappointed by all the hype that was surrounded around it.

","I held back my review of Kill Bill 1 and 2 until I saw both movies, esp. since originally it was one movie, which is confirmed by the credits in KB2. I do like Quentin's work, albeit in KB1 I found myself asking why? What is so intriguing, entertaining, pleasing, shocking, confusing about it? Well exactly that it is all of that but KB1 fails to deliver in that respect, it is technically brilliant and all students of film making will get the most out of it, but a movie is plot driven which in turn is carried by its characters and I really fail to see why this simply plot has to be stretched out over 2 movies. It is lengthy, oversaturated, chock full with abhorrent dialogue and Uma Thurman doesn't convince me in the least she can wield a samurai sword without cutting herself up.<br/><br/>It seems Quentin has a big bonus due to his prior work (and rightly so) and when it comes to reviews of KB1 I cannot help but feel that he used it all up with KB1+2.<br/><br/>So, when I left the theatre after seen KB1 I asked my fellow viewers what they thought. Everyone agreed that this movie is pointless. Literally, it has no point. We care not why when if killers kill themselves under whatever circumstances and we certainly care not just because it has coolness written all over it. It lacks the certain intelligent and witty touch his prior flicks possessed.<br/><br/>Others I asked were enraged when I voiced my critique and pointed out that this is a masterpiece, a homage to all the trash movies and animes and to that art of film making per se. I grant you that. But why does this make it a good movie? Because? Well, that's just not good enough for me. And what about the soundtrack?

It was very interesting indeed, the music to the movie really helps provide emotion and dept to the movie, also on many occasions it had me tapping my feet or jamming to music. Very good idea, seeing how Rza of Wu-Tang is known to be a big fan of kung-fu so it must have brought some good motivation on his part.<br/><br/>The fight scenes, of course were unrealistic beyond belief, and in a lot of movies that is a bad thing, except this one. The unrealistic and gory fight scenes definitely made the movie, there was blood all over the place, I don't think I've ever seen so much blood in a movie, it's incredible. The fight scenes in this movie were off the charts, reminded me of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon ..well minus the flying all over the place.<br/><br/>When I heard that the movie was going to be starred by Uma Thurman I was definitely spectacle of her ability to portray to role.

"warnerclassic","Null","0","1","1 July 2004"," One of the best films ever made
","Quentin Tarantino may have been off the Hollywood radar for six years but the former Reservoir Dog' has shown he's lost none of his bite with a film that is truly a masterpiece of cinema. Proving that you can't define a film by one genre, Tarantino has put together a samurai sword fighting, spaghetti western, part kung fu revenge thriller, which is the work of a director at the top of his game. The story goes like this. Uma Thurman is `The Bride'. A former member of an elite assassination squad, she is viciously gunned down (along with the rest of the wedding party) by her former employers. Awakening after a coma of 4 years, The Bride extracts her revenge, going after each member with `Bill' the boss, at the top of her list. Thurman as `The Bride' is astonishing, her performance maintaining a hardened femininity in the mist of all the violence. Her costume, deliberately reminiscent of Bruce Lee in Game of Death', is iconic, her samurai sword as sharp as her beauty. Tarantino's use of anime to tell the background story of a character is effective, while the black humour that punctuates any grim scene is classic Tarantino, proving he can bring out two emotions from an audience that was only reaching for one. Other performances live up to the last with Daryl Hannah perfect as the seriously short tempered Elle Driver (codename: California Mountain Snake), while Vivica A Fox is a high kicking mean machine whose fight with The Bride is interrupted when her daughter comes home from school. Lucy Liu here is no Charlie's Angel', more Bill's Devil', now a gangland leader who is in the bride's sights for her part in the wedding day massacre. This is a film that has incredible style with substance to match, made by a director who is a film fan's filmmaker and not just a cog in the Hollywood machine. Some critics have attacked the film for it's violence, but this is being blind to its story. Yes it is gory, but it is shown in a cartoon manner, and while most films have stories set in the real world `Kill Bill' is set in the movie world where real time is exchanged for reel time. With a cool seventies soundtrack, and the promise of a Kill Bill volume two to come, Kill Bill is a movie fans dream."

","This style in this film could have been good, but overall it is a bloody mess without the help of Vol. 2. Too much blood and gore throughout the action scenes. The script isn't even nearly as good as True Romance's. The story is basically about a bride who is assaulted on her wedding day, and wakes up three years later and seeks revenge on everybody. Tarantino is not an action or martial arts director, he usually does well in crime/thriller films (Reservoir Dogs). Uma Thurman is good, but the rest just stand out a bit. It would have been better if actors like Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi or Tim Roth has at least a cameo. Tarantino has done better and I hope he will do better in the future. 2.5/5 stars."

","When I came home after seeing KB, I said to myself, as if i'd only just realized, that its storytelling had been kind of incredible. And it is: its great slowness, the title cards, the way they fade in slow, fade out slow. The way it has chapters, like a great piece of literature, the epic fight scenes, the epic explanations of prior events (that really is Hatori Hanzo steel...). It does everything ""big.""<br/><br/>But as soon as I sat down in my home, I couldn't look at my Pulp Fiction screenplay, which i'd been the night before to get autographed by QT (as he signs, so he can sign as many as possible), and felt kind of sick in the stomach. I wasn't going to admit it yet, but I was like a son who idolises his father, only to realize one day that his father wasn't such top s**t after all.<br/><br/>I was quite attached to QT, i'd loved Pulp for many years... but it took a second viewing of Volume 1 for me to face the facts. Kill Bill was just plain uninteresting. It was probably the worst film to stand a second viewing since Batman and Robin. I was having flashbacks to Batman and Robin, actually, during the film... I guess its a sign of how bored I was. Kill Bill reaped absolutely nothing from a second viewing. First viewing, you've seen absolutely all there is to see: because he hands it to you so slowly! So much is wrung out of the most insignificant little moments (the ten minute sushi scene, the twenty minute sword-making scene, the half-hour anime scene, the ten minute hospital scene) that its over-wrought almost to breaking point!<br/><br/>What Tarantino has done in Kill Bill is like putting a bow-tie on a turd. Its like putting frills and pretty lace on a pair of work shorts. Its like putting a gold frame around a piece of graffiti, giving an Oscar to Uma Thurman, comparing your own movie to the great films of all time when its empty genre-rehashing bubble-gum trash. He takes something which is so vacuous (a simple revenge story), and pretends its a great roman epic. The result for some has been exhilaration. If you could stand a second viewing, i don't want to cry at your party. Don't keep reading. For me, it was one of great frustration. <br/><br/>QT loves crappy asian martial arts movies. That's fine. But what he doesn't realize is that those movies are so lovable because they AREN'T presumptious. They don't pretend they're Citizen Kane, or War & Peace. KB is the very definition of pretentious. It dons fancy disguises, pretty colours, sound effects, camera angles, good music, animation, slow fade-ins and outs, it gives chapter names to half-hour long (unnecessary) sequences! - all to pretend it is epic cinema. But what substance is there? A few action scenes, exploitation violence and a thin-as-a-tampon revenge story.<br/><br/>QT talks (boy does he talk) about ""f**king with the audience"" - his words, not mine, IMDb - but he can talk his way into a coma and it won't distract me from the fact that never in my life have i heard cornier dialogue and hammier acting, and never in my life have i seen a more self-serving movie. The audience might as well not even be here - Tarantino only cares about amusing himself anyway. You should have heard him laughing at his own movie at the premiere..."

","Kill Bill Vol.1 is simply one of the best directed and best written movies I have ever seen. Tarantino, as usual, brings a lot of new ideas into the movie, and the execution is flawless. But, it's just too damn unrealistic too take seriously, plot holes are everywhere which makes it hard to relate to a situation if the situation is wildly far fetched. Many movies have plot holes, if not most, but the flaws in Kill Bill are so blatant it's embarrassing. Should've been one of the best movies of all time but it's pitfalls are so obvious and stupid the film just can't cut it with the elite.

","Your typical overstylized, bloodsoaked Tarantino talk-fest is sure to wow some but make others fall asleep. Upon awakening from a four-year coma induced by a gunshot to the head, does Thurman rehibilitate? No, she flies all over the world slicing and dicing about two-hundred people, including those responsible for her near death. I enjoyed the first ten minutes, which actually contained a little realism (something lacking in any Tarantino effort). Then there's dialogue lulls, an endless Japanimation sequence, sword battles resulting in more dead bodies than any ""Friday the 13th"" film, and those patented, asinine kinds of lines only read in a Tarantino film. ""When do you want to die, b*tch?"", ""Silly rabbitt, Trix are for..."" (other character finishes) ""...kids."" Again, the first few minutes seemed grounded in at least a bit of reality. Unfortunately this is followed by people flying and severed limbs that shoot gallons of blood while the victim rolls and screams and one person killing an army of men....enough. At least cheesefests like ""American Ninja"" kept the hero somewhat able to be doing what he was doing. Here Thurman so effortlessly hacks away at people in live-action video game style that you just roll your eyes. It is far, far too long after the fact of The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. But again, Tarantino's fans (and sadly bandwagon critics) will feel this big-budget studio horror film should take away an arm full of Oscars."

","""Kill Bill:  Vol. 1"" is a great work of art.  Despite the violent theme, it is a ballet in cinema.  The color is vibrant.  The use of black and white photography is very well adapted.  This technique helps to subdue the extreme violence toward the end of the movie.  Uma Therman is magnificent in her portrayal of a young woman with revenge on her mind.  Her ability to perform the marshall arts is remarkable.  Her eyes are piercingly blue, and her emotional presentation is perfect in her role.  There are scenes that are totally done in cartoon, and this too helps to allay the fears of the violent episodes that frequent this cinema.  One must add this to their library of great films.  This director is a true genius.  If you have not seen it on the big screen, the DVD is perfectly well done."

Here's my problem. If anyone but Quentin Tarantino made this film the critics would've killed it, but because it was done by him it was innovative, inspired, and original. The violence was cartoonish and fun which made the amount of fake blood spilled on screen easy to take. The story was a standard revenge flick filled with interesting over the top (Tarantino)scenes. I just find it funny that there seems to be a double standard for the critics, and Tarantino's treasure is another directors trash. Once again if you like revenge flicks styled after 70's kung fu and revenge movies you'll love it. I do recommend it."

","If one did not know going in that this was a Tarantino movie, one would be able to discern that fact within five minutes. From the violence of the opening scene segueing to Nancy Sinatra's haunting ""Bang Bang"", it would be obvious to all who know QT's work.<br/><br/>Then we go right to a fight scene, where she dispatches the 2ND person on her ""Death List Five""; what a deliciously funny moment when both characters have to pause their knock-down, drag-out catfight because a school bus carrying Vernita's daughter pulls up right outside!<br/><br/>Then we go back in time to the scene where the Bride wakes from her coma... and she exacts revenge on the orderly who had been pimping the coma patients for a few bucks! (Who but QT would throw something that perverse in just for laughs?) I remember the first time I saw that scene, when Buck is explaining ""the rules"" to his would-be customer, I said aloud to the screen ""Boy, you picked the wrong girl on the wrong goddamn day!""<br/><br/>The Anime segment detailing O-Ren's origins was a very nice touch... it's been said that this whole film is a live-action cartoon, and having actual animation within it seems apropos.<br/><br/> From there we go to Okinawa, where the Bride acquires the services of a retired sword-maker, getting him to relinquish his vow to never create another instrument of death. This scene was a little overly long, but a wonderful precursor to the bloody scene that was to follow.<br/><br/>And then, at last, the final third of the movie: The Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves. One of the best fight scenes ever filmed! Some may find it gratuitously violent, and rightly so, but people offended by such things should have known better than to go see a QT movie in the first place! Such people may also take note that the most gratuitous part of the fight scene switched to B/W, so as to tone down the bloodiness of it without detracting from it.<br/><br/>My best friend, whose name was Larry, sadly, passed away in the year 2000. He was an avid moviegoer - he loved spaghetti westerns, he loved Asian martial-arts movies, and he loved QT. I look at this film and I know without a doubt that it would have made his list of all-time favorites, and it saddens me that he never got to see it.<br/><br/>I must add that I was a little bit disappointed with KB2; though I didn't expect KB2 to be a carbon copy of KB1, it seemed to be lacking the campy spirit that KB1 had. QT's movies all have certain themes in common; violent action, wacky homages to his favorite genres, and memorable dialogue in the scenes that are purely for exposition. In my opinion, KB1 is an outstanding movie because it had all three of these qualities; KB2 is just okay because the exposition far outweighed the action.<br/><br/>If gratuitous violence offends you, or if blood and gore makes you squeamish, then you should probably avoid this movie at all costs. If, on the other hand, you like exploring what I like to call ""the dark underbelly of film-making"", which is the essence of QT's work, then you will love this movie, and want to watch it over and over again.<br/><br/>My Score: An unqualified 10."

Taratino mixes kung-fu with his insanely entertaining dialogue which is always a plus for me. Just listening to the way everything flows makes it that great of a movie. The best part of this epic is the amount of blood shed. Uma takes down the whole Crazy 88 and leaves a bloody mess. What she did to O-Ren Ishii(Lucy liu)was pure masterful. The music is awesome as well mixing like a techno type kung-fu music produced by the RZA.

"vilincica","Null","0","1","14 June 2004"," It's Tarantino....
","Well I watched and re-watched this movie a couple of times and first of all you have to know that basically I like it. I didn't at first. It certainly stands out from other movies made in the last oh 10 even 20 years, that sooooo many people went to see. The acting performances are great I have to say it, and I don't even like Uma Thurman :). The use of camera is interesting and seems very fresh, and the soundtrack is well......something else. And all of these things bothered me a lot when I first saw Kill Bill Vol.1. Why? Because I knew I've seen it all before somewhere. Then I read an article about the movie in a magazine and the thing I noticed the most was that it said Tarantino's inspiration was another movie, a Japanese movie made in mid 70's called Lady Snowblood. Now I knew. I've seen it a while ago and liked it a lot, but somehow it slipped my mind. But you see, it must have been much more than just inspiration, there are so many similarities (camera, story, music, details...)Tarantino must really love it or he just wanted to make his own version of it, some would even say copy I hear. I don't know and never will. Still the fact remains that Kill Bill is a well made movie and a bold one, brutal and violent, but in a way very different from the rest of todays action movies out there. The story is revenge. Pregnant Uma is gunned down on her wedding day in a church. She wakes up, from a coma, realizes there is no baby, realizes what had been done to her. Now the only thing on her mind is revenge. She will find the people responsible and kill them one by one.....and so the story progresses. Like all Tarantino movies you either like them or you don't, there really isn't any middle ground. It is the same with this one. See it and decide."

But I think I know why he split the film in half and released it in a 6 months space. He wanted Uma Thurman to be nominated for both volumes and win two Oscars with one movie lol!!! Too bad the Academy ignored her, cause she certainly deserved it...the moment where she wakes up from the coma and looks for her unborn child would be enough for me to knock on her door and give her the damn award!!!<br/><br/>The film also gets a 10 out of 10 as well."

","Kill Bill Vol.1 is Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction and Uma Thurman's best work ever.  It's a classic revenge tale, in which Thurman's character seeks revenge on the crew of assassins who tried to kill her.

After the Bride is attacked she goes into a comma for a few years, she wakes up and only has only one thing on her mindÂ…REVENGE!!!  Kill Bill is the perfect combination of action, comedy and Japanese anime.  Uma Thurman is excellent as the bride.  Lucy Liu is great as the half Chinese half American, O- Ren Ishii.  Quentin Tarantino does it again.  The entire film was good from beginning to end.  I can't wait for volume 2 to come out later on this year.  Vivica A. Fox is awesome and lethal as Vernita Green.  However, David Carradine fans will be disappointed.  He is only in a couple scenes throughout the entire film. Hopefully we will see more of him and Michael Madsen in Kill Bill Volume: 2. Overall I gave Kill Bill Vol. 1 an 8 out of 10.  The action scenes were spectacular and I loved the Japanese-anime sequences in the film.  If people liked this movie I would recommend seeing Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction."

Check it out.<br/><br/>Now I know some the slash and hack can be a little gruesome, but those sound effects are a killer arnt they? Sorry, it could just be me, but even throughout the gore, it raised a smile. <br/><br/>Soundtracks are a key feature in a Tarintino film, where merely they are often incidental to the action, with Tarintino they are often centre stage. <br/><br/>For example the soundtrack in the showdown between the Bride and Cottonmouth adds to the occasion. Especially in those settings, with the water feature in and the gentle falling snow. And doesn't O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) show both the vulnerability and strength of the Samari Sword, and by god she makes it look sexy.<br/><br/>Finally, I admire the casual humour of Tarinto, one of which was seeing all those Passengers on the plane with their Samari Swords holstered in the walkway, parked as casually as umbrella's, whilst the Bride writes her Kill List. Its little features like this that is the trademark of Tarantino. <br/><br/>Excellent film."

","I just saw this movie for the first time on DVD. As a whole, this movie has amazing cinematography and creativity. It's a cool homage to old spaghetti westerns, Japanese samurai, anime, etc. I borrowed it from a friend, but I can see myself owning it since I like those kinds of films with over the top violence. You can't take it too seriously, because it's not done realistically, and it's fake from the get-go. That's part of its charm.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Quentin Tarantino tends to use overly crass subject matter and language just for the sake of being crass. Fans of Tarantino would probably say, ""What do you expect? It's Quentin Tarantino!"" But I say, why is it needed? This movie was already good, and stuff like that doesn't enhance the plot. I don't mind movies that have some language and/or crass subject matter if it's done tastefully and at a bare minimum. But the way Tarantino does it is just jarring. It stops the movie and prevents the plot from moving forward when it should. There's just too much language at times(and it's always the worst words used), and that scene with the two guys either raping or wanting to rape Black Mamba while she was in a coma is just sick. Granted, they didn't show anything (thank God), but their choice of words during that dialog that went on between them was just unsettling and it's something I'd rather not hear about. The subject is crass on its own, so it didn't even need that 5 minute bit of dialog with them talking about it. I have yet to find a good reason for that scene to even be there. It didn't enhance the plot at all. I'm absolutely positive that this scene, as well as most of the language could've been omitted and the film would've still be great(probably better). Scenes like this, and over the top bad language insult my intelligence. The movie is perfectly fine without all that. Sorry if I have morals (actually, I'm not sorry), but some things are just better left out.<br/><br/>Thankfully, most of the crude language and subject matter was gone after that, and we got a magnificent blood bath of a movie with excellent choreograpy for the fight scenes, wonderful cinematography, and fun homages to Japanese samurai movies, anime, spaghetti westerns, etc. The plot was clever and witty when the movie actually focused on the plot.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8/10"

I have seen Vol. 2, and with the extension of that, makes an instant classic. Both work good on their own, but I don't consider Vol. 2 a sequel. Quentin Tarantino once again writes a great script and selects a great cast. Uma Thurman is great in her role as the Bride with the unknown name. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a smart and brutal revenge tale that will, if nothing else entertain you. 9/10 stars."

","I thought I'd hate this film. Over the top violence isn't my thing. Finally decided I should give it a try, and liked it so much I rented it twice, so my wife could see it too. Since I am not an afficionado of Hong Kong-style or Japanese-style or any other style action movies, and haven't ever seen a Bruce Lee movie, etc., I'm illiterate in the matter of all the homages Tarantino was paying. But I know a good story line when I see one, and the thing that was so interesting to me was that I found myself really caring about the Uma Thurman (Black Mambo) character and rooting for her in her justifiable quest for revenge. Considering what a killing machine she was, that was quite an accomplishment. Maybe Tarantino is just punk hype, and maybe he's only made 6 films to date (including Vol.2), but he's visually arresting and makes you ask why you identify with certain inherently evil characters when others (say Tony Soprano) fill you with revulsion. As to the mayhem, it was just a cartoon and not at all objectionable to anyone over the age of 6."

","This movie is without a doubt one of the best revenge flicks ever made. Even though the story maybe very very simple it is perfectly executed with pure Tarintino style. The blood, the severed limbs, the limitless tributes by tarintino kung fu and western genres. He is a genius. I have to admit when I went to see this movie in the theatres I knew it was quite violet and bloody and I thought ugg am I gonna like this? But having liked every movie Quentin Tarintino has ever made... I managed to get there. Well I wasn't disappointed. From the opening scene in black in white with a savagely beaten woman in a wedding dress who we come to call ""The Bride"" with the very sassy and deep voice of David Carradine as Bill. The scene sets the stage for a hell of a ride that takes us from Pasadena California all the way to The House of Blue Leaves in Tokyo Japan. Now I may not be a pro movie critic but I know when I like something and this I definitely liked. The music was absolutely amazing. Even though hardly any of it original it is Quentin's way of paying homage to the films and genres he loved growing up as a kid. The cast was just amazing. Uma Thurman probably her best performence of her career. Darryl Hannah had like 5 mins of screen time and used it too it's full potential. I loved Volume 1 and I loved Volume 2 even more. 10/10 Quentin you are a movie genius and I can't thank you enough for your contributions to cinema."

","I was reluctant to see this film, hearing reports that it is simply an excuse to watch a lot of gore. I think it is important to remember that there is a lot of stupid gratuitous violence out there, but Tarentino rarely fails to raise this standard a notch. I don't have a problem with gore, as long as it's interesting, creative, filmicly-interesting gore, which Kill Bill most definitely was. As hoped for, there is suspense, humor, interesting, unexpected twists, and even the predictable is brilliantly carried out. A lack of realistic assessment of Uma's probable injuries after her fight with Gogo barley bothered me. Now I can finally see volume 2, which I hear is great."

","Kill Bill has been deemed as a violent, bloody revenge film. But it is so much more than that. Though some may say that this movie is nothing but non-stop fighting, bloodying, and limb severing, I strongly disagree. This movie is a visual piece of complex art. The fight scenes are done in a gorgeous way, with awesome sets, and interesting characters.<br/><br/>Though this movie is intensely violent, it is not disturbing violence. The over-the-top blood waterfall when limbs are severed actually seems to LIGHTEN the movie. This movie does not have the brutal, realistic violence that certain horror movies, and movies like ""The Passion of Christ"" include. Due to its tribute to old cheesy ""revenge"" flicks, the violence is something that most every can handle. I, for instance, am easily disturbed by violence. However, this movie didn't bother me, or disgust me at all.<br/><br/>Most adults enjoy this movie, but it is not just them. I, too, am a big fan of this movie, even though I am only 13. And, unlike many my age, I was not interested in this for the violence. I liked the idea of the plot. And when I saw this movie, I was definitely not disappointed. <br/><br/>The interesting combination of great lighting, amazing camera angles, and stunning sets made this a visually attractive movie. I found myself glued to the screen, very happy with what I saw.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie. It seems to be a movie that people of all ages, and of both genders, can both enjoy this movie. So, if you have not seen Kill Bill Volume One yet... run, don't walk, to your nearest video store!"

Like a lot of people, I didn't know much about it until I heard a review for Volume 2.  I got hold of a copy of ""1"" and watched it last night.  It's the best entertainment I've had this year!  I was riveted to the screen.  Uma Thurman is truly excellent, and in a film full of charactures she comes across as a real person.  Stunning.  Or maybe that's a worrying comment on my own perception! At any rate, the point was well and truly got across.<br/><br/>
This is no average film in any way.  Yes, the violence is horrific; I found myself thinking ""what on earth am I watching this monstrous film for!?"", but unable to stop watching it.  It is done in such a stylised, often tongue-in-cheek, and sometimes outright funny way that it's simply about conveying a message, the anger.  And that is achieved in no uncertain terms. This is a simple, raw revenge tale, made interesting by my sympathy with Thurman's character.  It IS horrific, but it's about righteous anger and fury, and that makes it seem almost okay.  Thurman efficiently got me on side very early on, and from then on it's goodies and baddies, really good, gripping stuff.  I don't know what that says about me and I don't care to analyse myself too much there! Who cares if they bleed all over the place, they're the baddies and they deserve it, that's how it should work isn't it? And I, for one, can't wait to see Vol. 2 to find out just what happens next.<br/><br/>Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!!!!!"

This style of samurai hitmen has really shown Quentin Tarantino's abilities. He has made a modern day hitmen movie with almost no guns. The bloody style in which Uma Thurman executes her enemies is truly enjoyable. But Uma isn't the only one who rules the screen. Oren-Ishii who is played by Lucy Liu is #1 on Uma's kill list(Bill being #5).

Lucy-Liu was so good as O-Ren Ishii! Another member of the deadly Viper team,  that you end up liking her.  I never expected to see her playing a character like O-Ren, such a change! but that shows how great Lucy Liu is! not only she can play an Ally McBeal lawyer lol, but also an evil and ruthless yakuza boss and mercenary!  I also enjoyed very much Vivica Fox' performance, even though she had a small part, but it was pretty good!  Daryl Hannah was outstanding in her very small part as Elle Driver, my favorite scene is when she shows up! (you know when, i'm not going to spoil it!).  I haven't had the chance to see David Carradine as Bill yet, but I guess it'll be terrific. And i have to mention the girl who plays Gogo, I have no idea what her name is, but wow! she was very well casted as O-Ren's lunatic bodyguard!  Only by her eyes,m you can tell that she doesn't know the meaning of the words ""compassion or fear""!  Bravo to her!<br/><br/>Well the music is great, very well picked for every scene and situation, the characters are very interesting, each one of them, even the ones that are not that important.

It is so unreal it is in a way less disturbing than a realistic depiction. The best example is the accountant that loses an arm; if you think about what ensues, she lost enough blood for 10 people.<br/><br/>The massive sword fights make it clear that the heroine is invincible, executing perfect multiple dismemberments, leaps and bounds that Peter Pan would be proud of while barely breaking a sweat.

They didn't quite go through with chopping up the food with a sword, but I thought they might and it would've been hilarious.

We don't know why he did it, or who 'The Bride' really is, we have to just go along with it.<br/><br/>The Bride wakes up after a coma and decides to kill Bill and his (female) helpers.

","Ever since the disappointing 'Jackie Brown' in 1997, film fans have been wandering ""what ever happened to that Tarantino fella that every young new movie Director tried to imitate?"" Well the answer is that he was writing (along with the lovely Uma Thurman) his story of ""bloody revenge"" that is known as Kill Bill Vol 1. The basic plot is that a character known only as the Bride is left for dead in a Texas chapel on her wedding, day along with 8 other unfortunates. It also transpires that she is pregnant with the would be killer's child (the Bill of the title). 4 years later she wakes up in a hospital bed, & then goes on a violent, bloody & at times hilarious revenge rampage. That's it in a nut shell & the result's are absolutely magnificent. From the opening cat fight with Vernita Green (Vivacia Fox) to the incredible (& I mean INCREDIBLE) showdown with the Crazy 88, the film's pace is relentless. It thunders from set piece to set piece wreaking havoc on the senses. But be warned, the film is not for those of a weak constitution. It contains some of the most outrageous, bloody & over the top violence ever put on to celluloid. But that is where QT's wicked sense of fun comes to the fore. The Violence is so gloriously gory & OTT that you can't help but laugh at it's absurdity. There is also a beautiful crafted & imagined flashback sequence done in animated Manga style that is possibly the highlight of this near masterpiece. I say near masterpiece because there are a couple of minor grievances I have with this movie. The characters all seem a little 1 dimensional, in fact they are almost cartoon like, so you don't really care about any of them a great deal. Also there isn't any of the usual Tarantino snappy dialogue that you almost take for granted with the great man. There is also the ""I'm sure I've seen this before somewhere"" feeling you get whilst watching this movie. If you are a fan of old Samurai or Kung Foo films you will recognise alot of nods to some of the Eastern classics (Bruce Lee's yellow jump suit in Game of Death being an obvious one). Those small gripes aside, Old Banana Chin has come up with the goods once again. & you can forget about all the CGI nonsense that was so obvious in the Matrix Reloaded, What you see on screen in Kill Bill is a masterclass in choreography, timing & gushing blood fountains.

"Sisiutil","7","0","2","3 May 2004"," Entertaining, dazzling...but over-rated (typical Tarantino)
","Quentin Tarantino makes good movies. No question about it; he's a remarkably consistent (if far from prolific) film-maker. His movies are always entertaining, visually dazzling, and usually feature very sharp dialogue. Tarantino also deserves credit for not underestimating his audience's intelligence. In an era when most films are dumbed-down to the lowest common denominator, Tarantino bravely employs non-linear narratives, confident that the audience can keep up.<br/><br/>This, evidently, is enough to garner him a devoted--even fanatical--following amongst film buffs, if the position of his films on the IMDB top 250 list is any indication. But perhaps that's a sad commentary on just how bad most Hollywood dreck is. Because I've always found that while good, Tarantino's movies are never great.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 1 showcases all the Tarantino qualities I mentioned above, but also displays all of his usual shortcomings. His failures come down to two things for me: a lack of heart and a lack of originality.<br/><br/>
The lack of heart shows itself in the consistently unlikeable characters. It isn't just the foul language and lack of redeeming qualities. In the case of the bride, we're never given a chance to really warm up to the character. All we know is she was pregnant and wanted to get married and then got beat within an inch of her life. Why? Why did all those assasins try to kill her? Maybe she deserved it! She was and is a pretty formidable assasin herself. Who knows? We sure don't.<br/><br/>Granted, this is probably deliberate on Tarantino's part. He likes complicated characters, especially anti-heroes, and leaving out some backstory elements is part of his respect for the audience's intelligence and imagination. But he often errs too much on the side of restraint with his character development. The only reason I care if the  Bride succeeds in her mission is so that the really cool cartoon-style carnage can keep going. I don't really care about the character; Tarantino hasn't given me a chance to--evidently on purpose. That emotional distance keeps me from making an emotional investment in the film.<br/><br/>Tarantino also loses marks when it comes to originality. It's not that he's wholly unoriginal, far from it; Pulp Fiction was pretty strong in that regard. It's just that the guy is SUCH a film buff that his movies are pretty much pastiches of other flicks. When I watch a Tarantino flick, I get the uncanny feeling that I've seen this film before--in a more linear format, perhaps, and with less foul language, but it's a retread. It makes his movies predictible, and Kill Bill Vol. 1 is especially guilty of this. I know the Bride will meet up with each of her enemies and, after a visually stunning kick-ass spectacle, ultimately get her revenge. No surprises there.<br/><br/>Tarantino is obviously devoted to duplicating the martial arts/spaghetti westerns he's ripping off...OOPS, sorry, he's PAYING HOMAGE to them, silly me. But that costs him in Kill Bill Vol. 1 as well; unlike his previous movies, his devotion to duplicating their stilted speech means there's none of the crackling dialogue that made Pulp Fiction such a joy to listen to, despite the (often needlessly excessive) profanity.<br/><br/>I'm not saying ""Tarantino sucks!"" Far from it; I like watching his movies. I just think they, and he, are vastly over-rated. Good, but not great.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not going to rush out and see Kill Bill Vol. 2. I can wait until it's on DVD. I do want to see it, but my patience is the strongest evidence of how Tarantino intrigues me, but ultimately leaves me cold. 7/10."
"dromasca","8","0","2","8 May 2004"," That's Entertainment
","(I mistakenly posted this comment originally on vol. 2 - it was meant for vol. 1)<br/><br/>Take 'Kill Bill' for what it is - good escapetionist entertainment, and you have good chances to enjoy it. Judge it according to art cinema criteria, and you risk to not like it and miss the fun. Terentino may be one of the most talented film makers around, but his violent and beautiful films are not meant to be more than entertainment, and folks looking for big artistic messages are searching in the wrong place.<br/><br/>'Kill Bill' is a revenge story, as many were written for the big screen since the beginning of the Western history. There is not too much originality in the story - what is different is the art of film making, the smart mix of quotes from all what Terentino likes in the history of cinema, from spaghetti westerns to classic Japanese samurai films, the soundtrack, and of course the unmistakable touch of non-censored violence so typical to Terentino.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is entertaining. I saw it on DVD, and I cannot wait for volume 2 release on DVD, so I intent to see it tomorrow in the theater. 8/10 on my personal scale."
"reddragon1110","Null","0","1","7 May 2004"," KILL BILL ROCKS!!!
","When I first saw the trailer, I thought this movie was going to be the typical ""Jackie Chan"" rubbish movie. I went with a friend and saw it and I loved it. This is a very particular type of film. This is a very good film, not in the scene of amazing masterpieces such as Requiem for a dream, a clockwork orange, In America, Lost in Trnaslation. This film is completly different. This film is charged with unrealistic battle scenes, gallons of fake blood, and lots more. But this is a very good cult film, an anthology which colects all those martial arts moves and join them to create this. The photography again is outstanding, the character design and development is amazing, (O-ren Ihii (fantastic) Elle Driver). Quentin and Uma create characters so deep, such as Luci Lu's character, dark, evil, but at the same time calm and always full of rage. Elle driver is a bit more trashy, more rude, and the scene in the hospital is very memorable. This is a must see film. 9.35/10.00"
"Skeptic459","7","0","3","3 May 2004"," I steal from every movie ever made.
","I think that this quote from film maker Tarantino perfectly captures Kill Bill and its endless references to other films. The excess references artful or annoying? I still have not decided.<br/><br/>Some of the things that follow Tarantino films make my skin crawl. For example the rabid fans, the geeks with their black t-shirts and their obsessive record and DVD collections. The ones that refer to the director as 'QT.' Another example would be all the fashion crap that seems to travel. Vain celebrities who hope to get noticed by being at QT's premieres. I hate Hollywood! Will there now be a million duplicates of Kill Bill? I hope not.<br/><br/>I have extremely mixed feelings about Tarantino and his films. His movies are ultra-violent with little redeeming value. 'Kill Bill' shows Tarantino to be a kind of Godard of Violence. The problem with a film like Kill Bill is that it seems that you really have to be a teenager to enjoy the movie. I am sure many adolescent males will love this film along with its cult movie flavors. Kill Bill reminded me of when I first discovered Manga. I thought it was the cool new thing at the time. Anything with super-violence appeals to you when you are a teenager! I am  older now and have left Manga and comics behind. But this film and its popularity  proves that some people still reside at this developmental point. What is with all the comic book films?<br/><br/>My main complaint of Kill Bill is like a comic book, there is no psychological depth to any of the characters. The figures in this film could all be action figures from your local Wal-Mart. The plot is that a woman goes to get married in Texas. Her old assassin pals show up and kill everyone at the wedding chapel. The bride is left for dead but survives. She proceeds to enact revenge by killing literally hundreds of people.<br/><br/>
That is the movie in all its simplicity. That is why Kill Bill bugs me. The film is like a glossy magazine for people with ADD. It is pretty, glossy with beautiful people plastered all over it. But it has absolutely no depth. What is interesting is that Tarantino films used to be synonymous with clever dialogue. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were cool because they had some interesting dialogue. Remember Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink? Remember Samuel. L. Jackson and the path of the righteous man?  Yeah, that was some cool dialogue! Moreover, the films of Tarantino all speak like he does, in that motor-mouth random fashion. In Kill Bill the dialogue is very minimal, which actually surprised me.<br/><br/>The major factor in this film is that it is a 70's or 80's action film that has all the terrible idiocy taken out. It is a 'Delta Force' with no Chuck Norris. it has high production values, good acting, superb direction and nice choreography. In other words it is everything an action film is not. But it is also as standard as any action film gets. This is exhibited by the usual revenge plot that we the viewer have observed so many time in other action films.<br/><br/>Tarantino must be congratulated for making an action film that is not stale. This standard action flick still manages to be fresh even though the material is not. It is well filmed and I liked the animation sequences. But animation interjected into a live action film is a double edged sword because it reinforces the idea that you are watching nothing more than a comicbook. For me it makes the film seem like it lacks depth. What is interesting here is that there is another film that suffered  from the same problem as Kill Bill. That film was Natural Born Killers. Actually written by Tarantino but directed by Oliver Stone.  The film threw in a lot of things, including an animation sequence. This  detracted from N.B.K and made it seem even more shallow than it was. the constant insertion of different styles detracted from the film. Most notably the dysfunctional family sequence set to a sitcom format.<br/><br/>However Kill Bill is the better film and there are some good things about it. The fact that you have some damn fine looking woman fighting, this is always a good thing! Samarai swords and swordfights are cool. There is no way of getting around that fact! I thought it was quite amusing to have a kung fu fight set in a domestic setting! There was another cool bit where the Bride tells a young gangster off by smacking his bottom with a sword. 'This is what get for messing with the Yakuza!'  YOU GO GIRL!!!' There is another great bit where the Japanese sword-maker states that if God were in a swordfight with the Bride and his sword, God itself would be cut. This is a nice touch and reminds the viewer that Tarantino still has his dark sense of humor.<br/><br/>But the main problem with this film is exhibited by the final part of Kill Bill. Ultimately the movie is one long video game. It reminded me of  when I played Enter the Matrix on the playstation two. But then I have never really been a kung fu movie fan. Kill Bill is a film that will not linger in my mind. It is not my kind of film but at the same time I can recognize Tarantino's talent. This is volume one and I don't really care what happens in volume two. I was pretty indifferent to the characters because they had the character development of WWF wrestlers. I kept expecting the Rock to appear at some stage. But in a film such as this, who wants character development? Watching a film like Kill Bill makes me want to see something character driven like Six Feet Under to compensate. I give this a 7 out of 10 and feel a definite ambivalence."
"m0rg16","10","0","2","1 May 2004"," Original and Entertaining
","Quentin Tarantino has the ability to write scripts which end up being highly original, despite hundreds of homages to other movies/directors. Kill Bill follows that exact formula. Original, yet it contains so many homages you could probably not count them all.<br/><br/>The plotline is: Once upon a time there was a girl called ""Black Mamba"". She was part of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. However, she wanted out and tried to settle down and get her own family. That's when the founder of the DVAS attacked, with the rest of it's members, killing everyone at Black Mamba's wedding. Including Black Mamba (From now on referred to as ""The Bride"").<br/><br/>Unfortunetly for the DVAS, The Bride did not die. She survived. However, she did end up in a coma for four years. But when she finally wakes up, she goes on a killing spree, killing everyone who stands in her way for revenge. Her first targets are Venitra Green and O-Ren Ishii. Both former members of the DVAS.<br/><br/>This film is violent, there's no doubt about it. In the climax battle blood is sprayed everywhere. Altough you cannot take this violence seriously. Just one short sequence of the fight. Three members of the evil guys team yell franaticly, wave their swords in the air and run down the stairs just to be instantly killed by The Bride in a second or so. All of this, including the violence, looks incredibly corny (intentionally) and funny. It's almost sick how perfect this movie's mood is. One could say that this is definetly one of the best movies ever, just because of scenes like that.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is good, even though no real room is given for the characters to really go all-out. The directing and editing are top-notch, among the best I've seen. The writing is also good, as the movie jumps from past to present in a series of flashbacks or montages. The soundtrack is very fitting, and Quentin has thrown in several songs that are so good that they make you REALLY want to own the soundtrack. Something I noticed in this film more than any other is that the music and sound editing here is also perfect. Usually something like that goes mostly unnoticed, but here it's obviously well done, and adds to the twisted and wierd feeling of the movie.<br/><br/>There's not awhole lot more to say about this movie. One has to see it for themselves. So I urge you to do so.<br/><br/>10/10"
"grumpyass","5","0","1","1 May 2004"," A lame film all together
","I want to start out and say that this film was good in a way but sucked. The film was over the top of violence.  I love violence but what bugged me is how they cut to black and white for no reason.  I stated in my review for vol. 2 that I thought the black & white worked to represent past & present. Here I figured I would have expected the same thing but out of now where in the last fight with crazy 88's it jumps to black and white which made me mad.  there was no reason for it. If he had cut down on the blood he wouldn't have had to do that.  Tarantino is a bad filmmaker.  He has blood gush out like a constant spray, yeah that's wrong blood doesn't do that. Those parts were over the top.  He probably figured he had money why not blow it all on crap effects.  The other thing the irritated me was the stupid animation to tell the story of that one chick, I forgot her name. That was a waste of money.  It would have been more affective if it was like action with real people.  The story was good but how he slapped it together sucked.  People talk about it getting nominated for an oscar, I don't think it should have made it to DVD.  I liked the second one a whole lot better than this.  I watched this to gt a little more feedback on what's happening in 2.  This film should make Tarantino got down as the work filmmaker of all times."
"labebe","8","0","2","1 May 2004"," Unsentimental and brilliant
","This movie has a lot of references: the films of Sergio Leone; kung-fu and Godzilla movies; blaxploitation films; Japanese anime; and specifically, the French movie The Bride Wore Black. Even with all of these elements, the movie exists unto itself. There is no self-referential winking; the audience is drawn into the film's seamless reality without question.<br/><br/>
Uma Thurman is magnificent as the Bride; her vengeful drive is focused and unsentimental. Her will is unstoppable. While many wrongs have been done to her, she is not a victim; she is a survivor with a wrath.<br/><br/>
Besides Uma Thurman, my favorite performances are Lucy Liu (O-ren Ishii) and Julie Dreyfus (Sophie Fatale). Lucy Liu is real and brilliant in the role of the immaculate boss of the Japanese crime underworld. Julie Dreyfus is perfect as the beautiful and multi-lingual co-conspirator/witness.<br/><br/>The movie is dark and gruesome, but not in a salacious way. It works and it works well."
"jasonsurety","8","0","2","4 May 2004"," What Plot?
","Oh yeah, its about revenge.<br/><br/>Negative comments about this movie seem to pertain to there being a lack of plot and dialogue.  Some critics think that the film is incomplete. Everything about it, however, is intentional.  Less dialogue gives more time to action, the plot is simplistic on purpose, and the movie may be seen as incomplete, because it is the first half of a two-part story.<br/><br/>
The film reminded me more of Lock Stock and Two Smokin' Barrels than Pulp Fiction.  But, then again, Barrels reminded me a bit of Pulp Fiction when I first saw it.  At its worst Kill Bill Vol. 1 is Matrixy, with its huge fight scene involving The Bride(Uma Thurman) against the countless foes of the Crazy 88.  At its best, Kill Bill is a fantastic action packed movie that takes on the look and feel of Japanese Anime(and there is even a short section that is animated).  <br/><br/>
The fight scene pitting The Bride against O-Ren Ishii looks like a state of the art fighting game on the XBox gaming console.  So much style and pop-culture references arise throughout that I don't know if this is on purpose or not.  Tarantino keeps the movie in its own world where Japanese steel is used to make a sword that is the ultimate weapon.  The world is similar to ours in the 21st century, but it follows different guidelines. We see guns used, but only in certain situations.  The sword is the honorably weapon of choice.<br/><br/>
Thurman, Liu and crew do a great job at doing what they are suppose to do, which is: look tough, act cool, seem passionate about what's going on, and be beautiful."

In terms of pop-culture references QT just have outdone himself. The movie hints this before the actual opening credits. The intense rhythm of the movie never stops, and I would bet that if did had 4 hours those would seem more like 10 minutes. I have the distinct impression that if I would even blink I would loose entire scenes.<br/><br/>The plastic aspect of the movie just out made my favorite ""plastic"" directors, Tim Burton and Peter Greenaway.

","Quentin Tarantino has a very unusual way of directing a movie. Relying on Inspirations from Martial Art/Bruce Lee movies and other classic Japanese films. But he does know how to borrow this genre and work it in his films. Kill Bill Volume 1 is a good example. Uma Thurman, who became a star after Pulp Fiction (another Tarantino film) Plays a character known simply as the Bride, (You have to see Vol. 2 to find out her real name.) She plays a hired assassin and is a member of the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad. (D.I.V.A.S.) Get it? The Bride finds out she is pregnant and decides to give up the lifestyle of being an assassin and now wants to live a normal life. But during her wedding, her boss Bill and the other members of the D.I.V.A.S. crash the ceremony, kill everyone in the church and leave the Bride for dead. a few years later she wakes from her coma and begins her quest for vengeance by going after her boss Bill and the rest of the Assassins. The movie tends to go over the top in terms of violence that in some occasions it's comical. The actors though are first rate: David Carradine, (of the hit show Kung Fu.) Lucy Lui, Vivica A. Fox, and Daryl Hannah. But the film belongs to Thurman, who I believe gives her best performance since Pulp Fiction. Kill Bill has some terrific action sequences and terrific camera work (one final note, this movie is rated R for good reasons so kids should not see this.) I give it an A."

","Well, to start off my review, I must state that my knowledge of martial arts, or even the films that influenced Tarantino to make this film in the first place, is extremely limited. I managed to get a thrill out of ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" purely on a superficial level. I always love revenge flicks, and the stakes were definitely up with this one. This movie can be summed up in one word: intense. Uma Thurman plays ""The Bride"" (whose name isn't revealed until part 2) in her best role ever. Lucy Lui, Michael Madsen, Vivica A. Fox and Darryl Hannah play her assassins -- all led by the infamous Bill (played by David Carradine -- although you don't actually see Bill until part 2). This installment focuses on The Bride coming out of her coma and traveling to Japan to convince the retired sword maker Hattori Hanzo to fashion an instrument for her to strike vengeance against those who did her wrong -- and anyone who gets in her way. The best part of this movie pits The Bride against about 60 henchmen protecting O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui), and it is a thrill watching her slice and dice her way through the mob. Like I said before, I may not fully understand every aspect of this movie, but I still loved it and was entertained 100%. ""Kill Bill"" is another example of Quentin Tarantino's cunning ability to take obscure material and bring it successfully to the mainstream. And not only is this Uma Thurman's best movie yet, it's also Tarantino's defining moment. If you thought Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs were great, prepare to be blown away. The ending is perfect and gets us ready to sink into part 2...<br/><br/>""That really was a Hattori Hanzo sword""<br/><br/>10/10"
"TheHig","8","0","2","29 April 2004"," Nearly, but not quite
","If you, like me, have a problem with one on one violence, yet are quite happy to watch the wanton dismemberment of an entire squad of assassins, then Kill Bill Volume One is a film best seen as having two halves.<br/><br/>The first half features lots of unpleasant solo inflicted violence, mostly by The Bride.  The second half is so blatantly over the top that you can suspend your disbelief and squeamishness, and just enjoy it for the masterfully crafted piece of filmmaking that it is.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is unfortunately not the best actress in the world.  She seems too harsh, too unlikeable to ever really fully deserve empathy.  Admittedly she may be a mindless killer, but she just looks kind of weird at times, thus the necessary special something is lacking.<br/><br/>Tarantino is a vastly over-hyped director, but credit where it's due, by completely ignoring the linear storyline and bringing in the surprising cartoon sequence, he shows himself to be a filmmaker of intense vision and bravado.<br/><br/>It is the House of Blue Leaves that this entire film revolves around, a wonderful demonstration of the ability to use types of shot, shading and above all, kick-ass fighting.  One of the most impressive shots, completed without an edit, is the roving camera that drifts throughout the club and into the toilets.  Not even an action piece, it shows just how innovative a director Tarantino can be.  Even better that he follows it up with all the black and white, and shadowplay that follows.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, without the House of Blue Leaves, Kill Bill Volume One wouldn't really be that special, just another film about killers.  Let's be thankful that it is there and just enjoy it.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8 out of 10"

","Though visually enchanting, I fear I must join the army of those who complain that there is no movie here to speak of.

The characters are thinner than the anime and chop-socky movies he is saluting, the non-linearity of the plot eliminates any suspense about who will win what fight, and 5,6,7,8 drove me crazy.  Tarantino suggests a parallel between this and the Indiana Jones movies, but accepting that only weakens the movie:  there are no human relationships in this movie, unlike even ""Temple of Doom,""  the sense of fun is more pervasive in the Indy movies, and the music...  well I'd rather have seen an attempt to create one's own, rather than borrowing from everything in sight.<br/><br/>Perhaps Volume 2 will make the thing hang together better, but Volume 1 is less organic than ""That's Entertainment.""

Okay, I may come across as a tedious liberal parent here - but I was a little squeamish over Vernita Green's daughter witnessing her mother's last breaths (but what a way to set up God knows how many possible sequels - another Roaring Rampage of Revenge - Orphaned Daughter vs. Mother & Daughter (vol 2, anyone?) - hell yeah!).  I was very disturbed by the anime section, illustrating the Genesis of O-Ren Ishii (I suppose it's what makes her who she is).  All told, I accept that these scenes are there for a reason - but it still doesn't change my gut reaction to them.<br/><br/>However, with all the seat-squirming, I still adored this film.  QT doesn't go for his usual dialog-riffing approach, but the action? Well, this goes up to 11!"

","I wont talk about the plot, cause too much has been said about it already, spoiling you lots of fun. I will just say what i think of the movie in general.<br/><br/>Wonderful movie...a must see even for those who often avoid violent films. Kill Bill takes violence to a poetic level turning it into a work of art that delights us both visually and mentally. The movie es smart, funny and very well (and strangely) told. The characters and their violent interactions can be interpreted either as meaningful or meaningless depending on the perspective. The pace gets slow at times and then too fast too suddenly, like a rollercoaster...you slowly go up the hill anxious to speed down it..and then you just one to do it again.<br/><br/>Cant wait for Volume II."

","What on earth was all the hype about? I thought Reservoir Dogs was good, if a little over-rated. I consider Pulp Fiction to be one of the best movies ever made. But this? Great start, with real promise of an interesting movie. Then she gets the samurai sword and, for me, the movie starts to slide. No plot twists, interesting story directions or intriguing tales. Just one woman killing lots of people...? The dialogue is dull, the camera work seems to last forever. I do buy all the references to other movies, but that is simply not enough to hold my attention. This was just plain dull. I found this very similar to the second Matrix movie, in that halfway through the major fight scene I was just totally bored. The only plot driven element to the movie is how many different ways, using different weapons, and different gymnastic moves can you kill someone. The first explosive fight scene was great, but they just go on and on.. As a result I have no interest in seeing part two as we all know it will just be more of the same, I'll wait till it comes on TV. Wake me up when its over. By the way, I'm a huge Bruce Lee fan, and loved the few decent movies that he made, but Kill Bill just doesn't compare."

Which proves a point, having an interest in something alone does not make for talent or even good taste. (I'm with you Simon Cowell: the guy is a disaster.) That aside, the music really wasn't the point. Gushers of blood was the point!!! Whoever would've thought there was so much internal pressure in a bad guy?

Even Monty Python's black night bled more realistically but the cartoonish nature of the blood made the movie somewhat more palletable...If it wasn't so absurdly unrealistic they'd probably have to hand out puke bags at the gate.  Uma was perfect, Lucy was deliciously wicked, Carradine was a great villain to hate, even the former mermaid did a great job.  Vivica fox was hot.  Michael Madsen was hateful in a good way.  I can't think of anything wrong with the flick, however, do not watch this movie looking for some deep social commentary or moral redemption message."

His violent mind has unloaded to create a goofy-gory feature film about an unmerciful assasin on the run to hold her revenge over her lost daughter and groom. As ""The Bride"",Uma Thurman, she holds her revenge with a swift mighty sword. Anyone who has seen Quentin Tarantino's other films will understand his madness and enjoy this film. As always he incorporates some awful crude sex scandal, excessive killing, and foreign people who stand as racial benchmarks. One thing completly absent from the movie is drugs, in contrast to ""Pulp Fiction"" brings a person down.

","I have to admit that I have never seen a Quentin Tarantino film and this is something I had to put right when I heard that Kill Bill was going to be released.  A revenge movie, with the acting talents of Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah and in volume 2 David Carradine and Michael Madsen.  Add to this a director with a very good reputation, a martial arts expert of supreme caliber you are going to be on to a winner.<br/><br/>The film is the most fun I have had with a fight scene at the end that beats anything ever seen on film (that includes the excellent fight scenes in the Matrix movies).  The acting throughout is superb and Tarantino's direction is just brilliant.  He makes the smallest of gestures by a character seem so effective.  Also the music is so moody and great to listen to in its own right.<br/><br/>Some people have criticized this film, but I can't guess why.  It is only second last year to Return of the King as the best film.<br/><br/>I now can't wait to see volume 2, but more so hopefully Volume 1 & 2 merged and uncut.

"mortenwebstar2","5","0","1","23 April 2004"," an ok movie, but it doesn't deserve the high praisal it gets
","After watching Kill Bill 1, I though of giving it a rating of 6 (out of 10) here, but after reading some user comments here, I decided to give it 5. Originally I wouldn't have made a comment about it, but many things prompted me to. I won't give a summary of the movie, as that has been done plenty enough times here.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I am not big against the film, as my rating shows, I find it quite an average movie, and therefore I do not understand the comments often stated, that either you love the movie or you hate it. I am not a person sniffing at the high amount of violence within the movie, I just don't the point in that. The problem with it is, that it all seems to cover for an extremely weak plot, a woman seeking revenge and consequently kills each of the persons she wishes revenge for. This is filled out with non-exiting combats, and no matter how many thousands of people the woman fights at once, she always wins, so the movie is also predictable.<br/><br/>A thing I also don't understand, is how high people praise that Tarantino doesn't let the movie go chronically, and claims this to be a sign that this is an highly intellectual movie. Apparently no one knows, that this has been done before. I do like the jumping back and forward in the history, and the small little direction details, but this alone can't a movie great.<br/><br/>I divide the movie into two parts, the first I found was rather good, this was the part until after the japanese anime part (actually I think that the anime was the peak of the movie), all that came after this was nothing special. Also I don't understand why the movie was seperated into two parts, it seems just like an attempt to create more fuzz and interest about the movie. People argue, that the movie shouldn't continue after the massive battle in Japan. But as I don't see it as a 'peak' but merely a way to fill out the 1½ hour, this argument doesn't work. Furthermore there was many things that didn't make sense and made the movie made up, like when the bride wakes up of the coma, she knows that it has been four years. How on earth can she know that exactly four years passed, when she just woke up of the coma??? And towards the end, when Sofie goes to the toilet, why does she go via the stairs on her left, which means she had to pass all the dancing people and walk far more, than if she took the stairs on her right? Finally, then Tarantino doesn't make enough out of the 'bad' guys (and girls), they seem like puppets and not real humans. I know many other directors doesn't do that either, but I had expected more from Tarantino.<br/><br/>Regarding all the extaggerrated blood-shed, then I did find it quite amusing. But the predictability of the fights, and the super-human powers that bride apparently must have, made the fighting scenes as ridiculous as the old fight movies it tried to ridiculate.<br/><br/>Pulp Fiction was a great movie, this is mediocore, all this said, then I was dissapointed when it ended so soon, and I will probably watch the sequel, but I don't have high expectations."

But I will wait and see!"
"MovieLuvaMatt","10","0","1","22 April 2004"," QUENTIN TARANTINO IS A GENIUS!!!!
","I've been looking forward to this movie for such a long time, and it not only fulfilled my expectations, but surpassed them.  I was initially afraid that since I'm none too familiar with the martial arts flicks of the 70's, I wouldn't be able to enjoy it.  Well...I was wrong!  There's even a Japanese anime sequence that I loved.  I am by no means a fan of anime, yet I enjoyed the sequence.  Hell, I enjoyed every minute!  Tarantino uses every trick in the book to keep his audience fascinated.  First off, he uses all the lovely trademarks from his past films--long takes, non-linear narrative, sharp dialogue, etc.  There's even some subtle touches that I'm sure Tarantino fans, like me, will pick up on.  For example, there's a part where Uma Thurman says, ""Everything's square,"" and goes on to do a gesture of the shape.  She did the same thing in ""Pulp Fiction.""  Also, there's an advertisement for Red Apple cigarettes, a made-up brand that popped up in his past movies.  We even have Michael Parks as a sheriff.  He played the same role in ""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" which Tarantino wrote.<br/><br/>
I can't say enough to compliment this movie.  Everything works!  Rarely do I give a movie a rating of ""10.""  As I always say, there's a lot of good movies, but very few ""great"" movies.  And I don't take the word ""great"" for granted.  Uma Thurman is perfect in the lead role.  I've never had a problem with her as an actress in the past.  She's no beauty and isn't much to look at, but I never remember showering her with praise for any of her performances.  In ""Kill Bill"" she carries the whole movie on her own two shoulders and does it perfectly.  The role required a lot more skills than simply being in great physical shape.  I know she didn't receive an Oscar nomination for this movie, but hopefully she'll at least be considered for Volume 2.  But as Oscar politics go, the Academy tends to overlook actors in comedies and action movies.  Everyone else in the cast is terrific as well. David Carradine has a very commanding voice, and that helps since he's never shown on screen.  It's nice to see that Tarantino is not afraid to use actors who have talent, but simply because of their faltering popularity they're considered to be ""has-beens.""  You know who else was considered a ""has-been""?  John Travolta.  And look where he is now, all thanks to the great Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>The cinematography is brilliant.  There's all sorts of weird and unique camera angles that I'm guessing were inspired from the 70's martial arts flicks.  Tarantino even makes great use of black-and-white footage.  The effects are cheesy, but they were meant to be and they added to the fun. We're supposed to laugh when we see characters' heads sliced off, and fake blood squirts out of obviously fake bodies.  I'll tell ya what, I'd much rather see effects like that than CGI.  The soundtrack alone is absolutely brilliant.  Tarantino loves to use great hits from the 70's and put them to good use.  That was most evident in ""Reservoir Dogs.""<br/><br/>As much of a Tarantino fan I am, I didn't think he'd be able to make a better film than ""Pulp Fiction.""  Once again, I was wrong.  I can't say that ""PF"" pales in comparison, but ""Kill Bill"" even surpasses that movie's brilliance.  There's absolutely never a dull moment!  Not only are the action scenes spectacular, but the story is fascinating.  The action is by no means used as a crutch.  We get to learn a lot about each of these characters.  Even though there's many fast-paced moments, there's also many slower, quieter moments.  Tarantino achieves a perfect balance in the film's pacing.  I will just give one warning before I conclude:  this movie is incredibly violent!  I know people have mentioned that before, but they say that about all of Tarantino's films.  Yet do we ever see the actual ear getting severed in ""Reservoir Dogs""?  No.  Do we ever see blood squirting out the man's head in ""Pulp Fiction""?  No.  But this movie is jam-packed with blood and gore.  All I have to say is now I can't wait to see ""Volume 2""!<br/><br/>My score:  10 (out of 10)"

"kwongers","10","0","2","25 April 2004"," In one word  WOW!!!!
","This is an incredible movie  smart, witty, sexy, sharp, and beautiful all at the same time.  There are some gripes about this story not having a story, which is totally not true.  The plot revolves around The Bride (a superb Uma Thurman), who was shot and left for dead during her wedding. `Kill Bill' tracks her revenge on two of the five assassins: Vernita Green (Vivica Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu, who totally redeems herself for her two mindless `Charlie's Angels' movies).  I concede that so far, it looks like a revenge movie; however, I haven't seen Volume 2 yet, which develops the story even more and fleshes out its characters.  <br/><br/>	Still, even if Volume 1 just shows Uma Thurman getting her revenge on her assassins, it's a great film.  Quentin Tarantino, a master of technique, uses his knowledge of 1970s Shaw Brothers Hong Kong kung-fu movies to create a beautiful work of art.  It isn't meant to be realistic; it's meant to be extraordinary.  The fight scenes are over-the-top and the fruit-punch blood spurts like geysers but this movie isn't really `violent,' per say.  It's so unrealistic (in a good way) that it's ironic, satirical, and funny. Tarantino's style pokes fun at, celebrates, and transcends the kung-fu movies.  His writing is also often quirky, colorful, funny, and sometimes dead serious.  It's a lovely combination.  <br/><br/>	If you want more examples of Tarantino's total dedication to his work, look at where he chooses to set his scenes and what kind of music he picks.  Just because the movie is violent doesn't mean that Tarantino doesn't have a sense of beauty.  He knows what he's doing, and one only needs to look at his use of an elegant, quiet, snow-covered garden for O-Ren Ishii and the Bride's final fight.  There is also an incredibly moving and exciting anime sequence in the movie.  Also, the use of the MUSIC is absolutely incredible, and one of my favorite aspects of this movie.  I can't say enough good things about it.  In one scene where O-Ren is being driven to the restaurant, the trumpets in the background music perfectly match the light that passes on O-Ren's face.  Everything is timed so perfectly.  Music is so important to this movie; you'll feel your adrenaline go right up just hearing it.  It's really that good.  <br/><br/>	There is great acting in this movieI can't think of a single character that didn't intrigue me.  To single a few of them out, though: Uma Thurman gives an amazing performance.  I loved how she could alternate from being funny, sexy, serious, charming, and deadly so easily  She kicks major butt in this movie, but she isn't exactly just a stereotypical, generic, tough action girl.  There's a real brain and a real heart behind her character. Also, Lucy Liu (O-Ren Ishii) is so good in this movie, I personally think Tarantino should make another movie just about her.  She is a character so rich and so complex, it would be a travesty to just call her only a `villain' or `The Bride's adversary.'  And besides, some of the best scenes in `Kill Bill' featured O-Ren Ishii and her posse.  My personal favorite character in `Kill Bill' has got to be Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), O-Ren's teenage bodyguard.  Kuriyama plays Gogo with fun menaceI loved the fact that she was young, beautiful, and crazy.  Just watch her in the few scenes she hasshe just oozes coolness.  It's that combination of the school-girl outfit, smallish stature, youngish face, long straight black hair, and beautiful deadly eyes that is just awesome.  Suffice to say, I also think Tarantino should make another movie about Gogo, too.  Heckmost of the main characters are so awesome and complex that Tarantino could make another movie out of any of them.  <br/><br/>	`Kill Bill' is one entertaining, beautiful, smart, exciting visual bonanza. Don't pay too much attention to the people who gripe about the lack of story and excessive violence.  Whatever it may be, Tarantino has presented pure storytelling at its finest.  It's now one of my favorite movies ever. I loved it very, very, very much.  10/10"

So this film had to be good. i had built up my expectation and excitement to a level which i myself would normally mock others for displaying. so was i a fool for believing the hype? Hell no.<br/><br/>When QT made reservoir dogs he didn't make just a good heist movie, he gave us the best heist movie of the decade. in Kill Bill tarantino hasn't made just a good kung fu movie, he has made the best kung fu movie i have ever seen! 2003 was supposed to be (Hollywood had us believing) the year of The Matrix, but they hadn't reckoned upon this little beauty coming along and quite frankly stealing its kung fu thunder.(which draws comparisons with 1999's original Matrix movie doing the same with George Lucas' Star Wars franchise) Right from the short pre-credits opening sequence this film blasts your senses and refuses to let up until the final frame which, although leaves you on a cliffhanger, gives you enough of a movie not to be annoyed, but excited and eager for the next installment.<br/><br/>Kill bill is a triumph of gutsy and confident film making and the most experimental work Tarantino has produced yet.  although the dialogue is sparce it also very sharp the action is superbly directed and beautifully shot, Never becoming dull.<br/><br/>Can't wait for part two."

He, just like the Coen Brothers, know exactly how to mix brutal action, suspense, drama, anime and, perhaps most important, comedy in an excellent timeless classic (hopefully), while adding a message about humanity. Of course, Quentin Tarantino can't make an excellent movie without an excellent cast.  I have to admit, I've seen more bad movies with Thurman than good, so I didn't think that she would be any good at all.  Same goes for Vivica and Lucy.  Matter of fact, the only people I knew would be good were Michael and David.  Boy, was I wrong.  There is not a single major character in the movie that I believe is flawed in any way.  Although some were stereotypical, they still showed human aspects that we were not used to seeing in action movies.  Notice how some characters plead for their lives, some embrace death because they deserve it, some are almost sympathetic to their enemy.  Interesting. This movie also has excellent cinematography, top-notch editing, and a score to die for.  Put in these five ingredients together and you not only get some memorable major scenes (the enormous and over-the-top sword-fight in the restaurant) but some minor ones as well (Daryl Hannah whistling ""Twisted Nerve"" and goons comparing a waiter to Charlie Brown). 10/10"
"tdawgg29","10","0","1","18 April 2004"," Tarantino's Best Picture Since ""Pulp Fiction""
","Kill Bill, Vol. 1 is the best action/comedy/anime film I have ever seen. Since the DVD was released last week, the first picture was incredible and the entire cast were on the spot.  Uma ""Prettiest Feet Award Winner"" Thurman's character as The Bride seeking revenge on Bill (played by famed Kung-Fu's David Carradine) was the most memorable I've seen on any motion picture.  The visual effects, graphic images including an anime of Lucy Liu's character were incredible.  Mad props to Quentin Tarantino for putting bits and pieces to this film.  I'll look forward to see Kill Bill Volume 2 and see where we last met our heroine.  On my 1 to 10 scale, I give Kill Bill Volume 1 a perfect 10!!!!!!!  I'm so very glad I gave this film the accolades it deserved.  Keep up your best work, QT!!!"

","Saw this last night and had to watch it again the next day. What can I say except ""WAY TO GO, QUENTIN!"" The Bride (Beautiful Uma Thurman), on her wedding day, gets beat up and shot by her fellow assassins,known as the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad(DIVAS), lead by the wicked Bill (David Carridine). The guests, including the groom, are killed, yet The Bride survives and is in a coma for 4 years. Waking up, she sets a plan in motion to seek out and kill those that tried to kill her. <br/><br/>The film is a tribute to the old school kung fu movies, anime and even ""spaghetti westerns"" (The Bride's name is not revealed until part 2). Like Tarentino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" it is out of sequence, jumping back and forth. Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver, although not in the film that much (Her best work will be in Kill Bill Vol. 2), is wicked. The best parts include The Bride's battle with Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox, kicking some serious ass), her fight with O-Ren Ishii (Cool as ice Lucy Liu) and her gang at The House Of Blue Leaves (Nice name! And what's up with the guy that looks like Charlie Brown?), and O-Ren's origins(Nice anime!). None of the people involved in this revenge film are saints (The Bride is an assassin, after all), and you actually end up feeling a tiny bit sorry for the assassins (Especially Fox's incredibly violent death in front of her daughter), but that's what happens when you live this kind of life.<br/><br/>To get the full feel of the film, watch it back to back with part 2. Hopefully, they'll put the film back together the way it was supposed to be."

","Quentin Tarantino's super charge revenge epic begin in this first half with a rip roaring introduction to the bride played by Uma Thurman, who gets revenge on those who wronged her who includes Vivica A. Fox, Lucy Liu, and David Carradine who plays the enigmatic Bill, who is the tile of this movie. Tarantino's revenge flick is a great throw to the 70's exploitation films that has a great attitude and a great stride. Lots of blood, bullets and swordplay to even satisfy the most harden of movie fanatics. This is the first part of a two-part epic, and if this part was a wild ride then I can't wait for the next half of this story to see what happens next. Can't wait for vol 2, and i hope its just as good as this one."

","This movie simply rocks, the only people who bashed it are the people who are thinking, ""well this movie isn't like Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction."" First off, those movies were over a decade ago, Quentin shouldn't have to make all his movies the same.  That would be like saying you hate Raiders of the Lost Ark because it doesn't have the same feel to it that Jaws does. Quentin has stepped away from his gangster movie image and gotten into the realm of action films of the 70s, I pretty much love Bruce Lee and Kung Fu the series so this movie is a great addition to my movie collection.  And about the action being over the top? That was the intention, this movie shouldn't be taken seriously in terms of its violence, only the dialogue and story is really believable, if you want to watch Quentin Tarantino make a gangster movie just watch Pulp Fiction, but stop Your whining, this movie is great!"
"omegahertz2000","8","0","1","17 April 2004"," A bit bloody, yet entertaining
","The fighting scenes were extreme with blood gushing giving the viewer an exit from reality and an entrance to Tarantino's twisted domain.  This movie certainly expresses revenge driven by furious rage.  In Black Mamba's quest for revenge played by `Uma Thurman' we see a human terminator with one goal; inevitably to KILL BILL.  Along the way she has to eliminate his protégé's. Nonetheless her motivation and will to succeed and survive no matter what obstacles may stand in her way captivates the audience and validates her actions.  Overall this was an entertaining movie till the very end, and leaves you wanting more.  I await the sequel with a thirst for revenge."

Is it possible that volume 2 will fill in the blanks and make this into a better film? This is an amalgamation of many films in the past. I'm not sure if this is a good thing or not. Pure genius comes from creation not duplication...but it is very eclectic. I'd like to know what Q.T. could do if he tried to be more original. There has to be more to this. Well, on the bright side it is not the same old crap that keeps getting prefabricated by the Hollywood mainstream. I really don't have much else to say because I've kind of forgotten about it."

","A bloody revenge film with great dialog, excellent film technique and perfect pacing. The film never has a chance to bog down and instead accelerates into... fun.<br/><br/>Charmingly evil anti-heros do battle. Nothing really original about that but amazingly entertaining. If Pulp Fiction inspired everyone with the ability to write some cheap dime-store dialog to put out a 'film' riffing on unoriginal ideas, then this movie is the ultimate jazz jam of grindhouse technique. Tarantino movies are more or less pitch perfect remixes of genres. And you know what? That's better than ok. It's a tune you can hum along with. Original in principal? no. Entertaining. YES! The tons of unanswered questions are half the fun.<br/><br/>If you like fast paced action, skewed plotting, stark images, crafty editing and interesting exchanges between characters this film is for you. Deftly melting down a genre and forging an entertaining masterpiece. A great film that WILL stand the test of time.

"dark_baker","7","0","1","13 April 2004"," Style......that's all (may have spoilers)
","I don't think there's much to tell about this movie. It's full of gore and violence, but that's not the problem. The problem is there's almost nothing else! Kill Bill is what we can call the classic ""revenge story"". The Bride was betrayed and her friends and family have been killed. Then she takes revenge using a katana (instead of a gun). Of course, fighting with a katana makes stylish fights, but a movie needs more than that to be good. Kill Bill uses original colors like a lot of yellow which we don't really see very often in movies, that's a good style point. Finally I wasn't really convinced by the acting, I thought it was okay.<br/><br/>
*Good Points* : The movie has a great style and is colorful.<br/><br/>*Bad Points* : I was a bit disapointed by the script and the storyline lacks of originality. And when I see someone's arm being cut by a katana and all her blood spills out ruining the carpet with more than 30 liters of red liquid, I expect this person to die or at least show some emotions.<br/><br/>I still give Kill Bill a 7/10 because of its style."

"gregsrants","9","0","1","13 April 2004"," Better with each viewing
","Every once and while I hear a critic or film-goer utter the words `The movie just gets better and better with every viewing'.  Really?  What so magically transformed it into becoming a much better film?  Was the screen at the theatre too big for you and the movie played better on your 19-inch television?  Maybe you have bladder problems and the DVD version allows you to pause for all bathroom breaks?  Or maybe you were too busy smooching with a blind date that you missed most of the good parts and had to watch the film several times over before you really knew what the whole thing was about.<br/><br/>Whichever way, I have always raised an eyebrow when someone blurts out that phrase.  That is, until I caught myself doing the same thing this week.<br/><br/>The movie was Kill Bill Vol. 1 and I had seen it in the theatre upon its 2003 release.  At that midnight showing I marveled at how Quentin Tarantino weaved yet another masterful story onto the big screen with humor, violence and imagery so unforgettable that you left the multiplex salivating like a Pavlovian dog after shock therapy.  So, when it came out on DVD, of course, I immediately ran to the front of the line for my copy.  I knew that the wife wouldn't be interested, so I waited for the proper moment, put it in the player and sat back to be wowed once more.  What I didn't expect was that my second experience was even better than the first, and the third was better than the second.<br/><br/>You see, Tarantino films have always been like a multi-layered onion. There is so much going on at any given time, that you could watch a film over and over and get something new out of it.  Take Pulp Fiction for example. There were so many plot developments that jump from present to future in their timelines that second viewings allowed you to focus on a specific character or an event.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 is no different.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman is `the Bride', codename Black Mamba.  She was a member of the ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DIVAS)"", but on her wedding day, she is brutally gunned down by the other members of the team and their leader, Bill.  Four years later, she awakes from her coma and quickly sets out to avenge the massacre of her wedding party and unborn child.  There are five names on the Bride's list, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Lui), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen) and the ringleader, Bill (David Carradine).  One by one, the Bride intends to visit and extract revenge, and unfortunately, a two hour movie just isn't enough time for payback.<br/><br/>First on the list is O-Ren Ishii (not first in the movie however).  The Bride travels to Japan where she attempts to use her newly crafted sword to engage Ishii.  All that stands in her way are countless bodyguards in Kato masks with swords and chains.  When she was done, 57 people were on the floor bleeding profusely where limbs used to be.<br/><br/>Next on the list was Vernita Green (who is known by three separate names in the film).  A homemaker who has since given up the life of the DIVAS and settled down with her 4-year old child, the Bride confronts her and again comes out victorious.<br/><br/>That just leaves three to go and Volume 2 to extract revenge.<br/><br/>
Tarantino seems to be having the time of his life with Kill Bill.  He switches formats in a blink of an eye and has elongated scenes in black and white or animated violent cartoons.  He spills life with gallons of blood being poured onto our screen just like in the martial arts movies of yesteryear.  Tarantino's sick sense of humor is also rampant and borderline out of control in Vol. 1.  Whether it was the Pussy Wagon that the Bride drives around town or the intermission both her and Vernita need to take from trying to kill each other once the school bus drops off her child, I can visualize Quentin behind the camera with a grin on his face like that of a five year old at Christmas.  Even the first thing you read before the film begins, `Death is a dish best served cold..Old Klingon proverb' sets the tone.<br/><br/>But aside from all the violence and format changes, there is so much to explore and enjoy in Kill Bill Vol. 1, that I don't know when I will be done watch it and adding to my praise.  The third viewing, I focused simply on the music (Tarantino has a real knack for soundtracks - Stealer's Wheel, anyone?), and was amazed at all the adrenaline flowing sound bytes he incorporated.  Even Darryl Hannah's whistling in the hospital had me tapping my finger on the arm rest.<br/><br/>The fourth viewing, I focused on all the comparison references that Tarantino made towards other films he has directed.  Vernita hates her code name (Mr. Pink in Reservoir Dogs), the Bride makes a hand gesture to represent square (Uma again in Pulp Fiction), Michael Parks plays a sheriff as he did in the Tarantino writ From Dusk 'Til Dawn.  A film lover could have a field day just amassing all the small details that Tarantino has thrown our way without explanation.<br/><br/>If there was but one complaint about Vol. 1 is that it leaves us hanging like no film has done since Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.  I yearn to a point of giving up my children for the second installment to becoming viewing available.  And you may note that I didn't put Kill Bill at the top of my list for 2003, but give me three or four more showings and I would expect nothing less."

And a concern of mine is this...When The Bride AKA Beatrix Kiddo rolled up in the ""Pussy Wagon"" truck when she confronted Vernita Green, does that mean that she stashed the truck when she was in Okinawa and Tokyo prior that whole time? I mean why would she still have it or even keep it? She bashed that male nurse a second time after he was dead for the ""Pussy Wagon"" keychain, right?

"Tyler_Bateman","8","0","1","14 April 2004"," Not your traditional Tarantino...
","Kill Bill: Volume One- First of all, this movie may as well have not been directed by the legendary Quentin Tarantino. With slightly below par lines, a brutal, disturbing opening sequence, and not much charecter development, this does not signiture traditional Tarantino at all. It portrays Quentin at his most angry, complete with over-the-top gore and violence (which is generally fun, but gets just disgusting every once in awhile). Sure, it is a whole ton of fun, but it is no where near being the filmmaker's best.<br/><br/>Considering this, I did enjoy the film. However, after a while, the violence got a little overboard, the dialouge terrible for the maker who wrote it, and the movie had next to zero plot. There were scenes I really enjoyed, such as the anime sequence (which ran slightly long), the House of Blue Leaves fight, O-Ren and the head chop blood sprinkler, and, of course, O-Ren's death. But there was something that angered me tremendously about the film. Where was the writing? It seems as if Tarantino just through the script out the window.<br/><br/>Now, I feel I must right a full paragraph just about the violence in this film. It is absurd, amusing, and sometimes downright disturbing. Do you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail? You know the Black Knight scene? The whole film is kind of like that, mixed with some brutal violence. If that sounds like your cup of tea, be sure to see this film. I liked it a lot to an extent, but certain scenes were just lacking oomph.<br/><br/>However, so I don't go overboard on bad things about this film, I did love everyone's acting, and the special and visual effects were brilliant. I did laugh, but just because of the complete absurdness of the violence. Rarely was I wowed by Tarantino's wit, like I was in Pulp. Rarely was I shocked by what had just happened, as I was in Dogs. This was just not traditional Quentin, and I hope he quickly goes back to his old ways, and away from this grotesque, disturbingly over-the-top, do-anything-for- a-shock faze. It isnt near as fun. 8/10<br/><br/>Favorite Scenes See Above.<br/><br/>Favorite Lines ""As your leader, I encourage you from time to time, and always in a respectful manner, to question my logic.

","I saw this movie last year at the theater and, at this point, recommend the biggest screen experience possible.  Its sparse script borders on poetry, allowing thrilling imagery to impact viewers to the max.  All cast give strong performances, but Uma is most striking in her role as the bridal bruiser, a convincing Amazon, yet showing tenderness as perhaps a woman best can, most notably in her character's maternal grief over her child presumed dead.  The film's violence, perfectly choreographed, appears to draw upon a wealth of sources ranging from comic books to Sam Pekinpah.  A sensory feast.

"FilmFreakHoya","10","0","1","14 April 2004"," Amazing and original ... classic Tarantino
","** SPOILERS HEREIN**<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" was simply breathtaking!  Tarantino is a true genius both in his writing and his directing.  I believe that ""Kill Bill"" is his best film to date both because it is two-parted and therefore is the most complex and lengthy, but also because it carries with it more substance and homage than any of his previous films.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman was awesome; she plays the femme fatale as a hero instead of a villain, which is refreshing.  She embodies the rage and vengeance that the Bride feels for her former accomplices, and she does it looking hot at the same time! Tarantino once again brings his groundbreaking directing to the table. His unorthodox use of sequence, flashback, and camera angle provide for a visual treat that one can't find in many other directors.  It seems that the order in which he presents this film is at random but yet not at all (e.g. the audience knows that the Bride kills Ishii, but the HOW seems almost more important than the WHAT). All in all, there are many flaws (as there are in any film) but it seems that a ""flaw"" for Tarantino would be something welcomed by any other director. In other words, perhaps Tarantino implants these ""flaws"" so that dumbass movie nerds will waste 10 minutes of their time posting something about it on a website.  None the less, ""Kill Bill"" is an innovative masterpiece worthy of praise from all."

"drewsa9","Null","0","1","12 April 2004"," Kill Bill Preview
","For those of us who have spent little or no time on this planet without our existence coinciding with the birth and life of music television, Friday will host the release of the completion of Kill Bill, the fourth film directed by one of the most significant film makers of our time.<br/><br/>Starting with the music, comic-badass, schizo-progression combination found in Reservoir Dogs, QuentinTarantino marked in stone his place as an original within the film industry. Anyone who watched Reservoir Dogs more than once anticipated and, when released, in awe and elation absorbed Pulp Fiction: a self-proclaimed 3-D chess game of a movie.<br/><br/>Just as Pulp Fiction created a complete homage to film noir as a genre, the completion of Kill Bill, through exaggerated emulation, attempts to do the same with the cinematic world of Kung Fu. Director of Photography Robert Richardson (JFK, Natural Born Killers) contributes his talents in order to mesh several different film styles in order to convey Tarantino's crafted vision.<br/><br/>While Tarantino's other directorial efforts portray stories that more or less take place within a realistic world, Kill Bill, "".does not take place in the universe we live in. In this (Kill Bill) world, women are not the weaker sex. They have exactly the same predatory hunting instincts as men, the same drive to kill or be killed."" In this world, The Bride (Uma Thurman) speaks in wicked macho tongue threatening her enemies with the big-ball certainty of Keanu Reeves' Jack Traven in Speed. Also, there exists an unrestrained tendency toward the portrayal of gratuitous violence and bleeding. Both, while engaging, put the picture way over the top and keep it from four-star Pulp Fiction perfection.<br/><br/>So it is agreed that Vol. I is a beautifully shot action-packed brilliantly casted non-stop postmodern Kung Fu flick.<br/><br/>Having been shot as one film and then constructed to exist as two, Kill Bill<br/><br/>Vol. II has no choice but to simply be more of the same. Not unlike a new Strokes album. The deaths of Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Bud (Michael Madsen), and Bill (David Carradine) are certain, but it's not the question of who will die that will bring film-goers back many months later to see Vol. II. It is the question of how. To what extent can Tarantino trim the fluff and simultaneously offer 1) a tribute to the genre of 70's Kung Fu and<br/><br/>2) the completion of a relentlessly violent opus. Consequences aside, choreographed violence is fun to watch.<br/><br/>Writer/director Quentin Tarantino knows we know the story of revenge. He trusts us enough to skip through it so that he can visually take us from one prolonged fight sequence to the next using a signature music compilation and stunning visuals while hinting toward an original story: the perfect feast for our attention-deficient quick-edit generation to glut upon."
"NoArrow","10","0","1","16 April 2004"," Wonderful, epic martial arts film...
","...Every director has an epic.  For David Lean it was `Lawrence of Arabia'. For Steven Speilberg it was the `Indiana Jones' trilogy.  For Peter Jackson it was `The Lord of the Rings'.  `Kill Bill' is Tarantino's epic.<br/><br/>The story of The Bride (Uma Thurman), a former assassin gunned down by her old comrades at her wedding rehearsal, and how she awakes from a coma four years later, hungry for vengeance.  Her first targets are O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), the first now a Japanese crime boss and the second an American housewife.  The Bride locates her prey, meets them, declares `unfinished business' and engages in a battle.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not easy.  Vernita is a master with a knife and O-Ren has a massive amount of bodyguards.  What I like about this is that the story isn't told in chronological order.  It's unusual in a movie that the first target (O-Ren) in the movie is more of a challenge than the second (Vernita) but realistic (the first target is not always easier), but Tarantino decides to tell the battle with Vernita before the battle with O-Ren.<br/><br/>Tarantino's script is also written well.  It's not as impressive or quotable as `Pulp Fiction' or `Reservoir Dogs', but it's better than ninety-nine percent of your usual Hollywood writer.  His direction is the feat here though.  He's always talked about how much he loves action movies, but he's never directed one up until now.  Here he proves he can direct an action movie better than your usual Michael Bay or George Lucas.  The camerawork is perfect and the camera tricks are clever.  Going in and out of black and white, just showing the silhouettes of the characters fighting, playing spaghetti western type music during the fight scenes, all pieces of the puzzle of some great action sequences.<br/><br/>If Tarantino were Edward D. Wood Jr. then Sonny Chiba would be his Bela Lugosi.  It's lovely seeing Tarantino work with his idols (Pam Grier, David Carradine) and Chiba certainly works here.  Chiba plays a sword maker who The Bride goes to for help; he is positively charming, funny and cool in his scenes and you can just picture Tarantino behind the camera shouting `Excellent!'<br/><br/>Of course, it's still only half the story.  No major plot points occur, the characters aren't really developed, and there are no plot twists until the very end.  If you're looking for all that, then chances are you'll like Volume 2 more, but if you're the kind of person for great action with some dramatic elements, you'll love Volume 1, 8/10."

I don't remember Spielberg or Kubrick counting how many films they have made.<br/><br/>I assume the scorecard is ... Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction Jackie Brown Kill Bill<br/><br/>A classic (Pulp), a great work (Dogs) and an O.K. film (Jackie).<br/><br/>What about From Dusk to Dawn? I thought he was proud of that too, until it was released and got ripped. Surely he has been in other projects too after he left the video store.<br/><br/>Tarantino, count Academy nominations, wins and I guess money. Don't keep score on how many films you've made."

","Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) wanted out in her assassination group, headed by the leader, Bill.  She decides to settle down and get married.  However, when she got in, her friends did her out and put a bullet in her head and murdered the rest of her family.  They left her for dead but she wasn't gone.  For four years, she stayed in a coma.  When she awoke, she made a promise of vengence and revenge: kill Bill.<br/><br/>This is a great movie.  Quentin Tarantino brilliantly directs this saga with amazing shots and exciting sword filled action sequences.  One turn off for many may be the violence.  No I'm not kidding.  This is jaw-droppingly violent.  The amount of fake blood used in this triples the amount of seawater at your average Sea World marine park.  Limbs, heads, and Lord knows what else are hacked off.  This movie is NOT for the faint of heart. Yay for violence!<br/><br/>This is a definite member of your DVD collection.  If your unure, rent it but chances are you'll be satisfied."

","The problem with satire, is often the more well done it's made, there will be more people who won't get it.<br/><br/>Everything here is over the top, but that's the point.  Quentin knows what he is doing in this wonderful mixture of styles.<br/><br/>Just like South Park, Big and Uncut attacked the concepts and social structure of profanity (while not glorifying it by the way), Kill Bill does the same to notions about violence in movies.<br/><br/>Having anime in the film isn't just a device to tell background or because Quentin is a fan.  It admits that the rest of the film can be seen in the same context.  The blood sprays from a newly headless body would require a hundred times more blood than the average person has, the ability to take on and defeat a hundred villains is something only a superhero could accomplish.<br/><br/>The film calls upon a viewer to think about how they view different genres of film, what is true violence on film and what is of a cartoon nature and how far and just how dark a hero, can be allowed to go."
"bekelleher","7","0","1","11 April 2004"," blood, lots of blood? see if you like that sort of thing.
","Not my favorite of Quentin's work.  The choice of Uma Thurman as the lead, was good.  She was excellent in Pulp Fiction.  Tarantino likes to reuse his actors and actress's, one of the more compelling reasons to see his films. With names like Uma Thurman and Steve Buscemi what reason could there be for NOT seeing a film.  (However, Buscemi does not appear in this particular film.)<br/><br/>Quentin plays his favorite cards in this film, mainly violence and a strange fascination for anime and Japanese style martial arts.  Though I normally enjoy the violence in Tarantino's films, as it is usually paired with snappy dialogue and a witty plot, this film lacks the latter two qualities.  Mrs. Thurman plays her character to her full potential, the problem there is is the utter lack of substance, a vengeful bride and some neat stunts is all she is alloted.  The gross and seemingly unneccesary violence is the downfall of this film.  It is a blood bath, plain and simple.  Different from Tarentino's other films he sees no need to justify or augment the violence in this film.<br/><br/>That being said, I enjoyed the movie.  I am rarely disturbed by violence in movies, especially not the unrealistic kung fu scenes in these types of movies where people can come back from seemingly near-death experiences and continue to fight each other with all manner of stunts and manuevers.  In that sense the violence is almost playful in this film.  It is fight scene after fight scene, modeled directly after kung fu movies that Tarantino loves so well.  The special effects are up to par and the fights are well played. But all in all, this is a bloodbath of a film.  Uma vs. the world.<br/><br/>
If you enjoy violence for violence's sake, then this is the film for you. If you do not, pass and perhaps skip the Tarantino altogether."

","I have mixed reactions to this film.  The story lines and the writing are excellent, the performances of Uma Thurman, Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu are alright.  I liked Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and this film but can people bleed like that having their limbs/heads chopped off? Maybe he's referring to Old school samurai films?  I Don't know.  but I do know this film a completely different film than Mel Gibson's The Passion Of The Christ because of its violent tone but overall Kill Bill Volume 1 is amazing but brutal.  I can't wait to see volume 2.<br/><br/>In the end in my humble opinion is that Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 (which I will see volume 2) is ten times better than the Joel Silver produced and Wachowski Brothers written and directed sequels The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions any day, any night, any time, forever!!!"

","I don't like Quentin Tarantino or his movies.  I think he is an egotistical, obnoxious jerk and his films reflect his personality.  Kill Bill Vol. l is no exception.  A few of the action scenes are good and Uma Thurman is excellent as the Bride, but the movie just doesn't work.  For one thing, I saw no need to split Kill Bill in half.  I think Vol.1 could have been cut by 15 minutes because of one pointless scene after another.  Do we need to know so much about Lucy Liu's character?  No and we don't care about her character.  Tarantino seems inspired by movies that only he has seen and rips off far superior Bruce Lee films.  I think everybody should give Quentin Tarantino a  message that Pulp Fiction was ten years ago and his 15 minutes of fame are over with.  Skip Kill Bill Vol.2 and no Vol. 3 for us. 5/10 and I am being generous."

Cutting this movie into two was a brilliant idea as seeing the whole thing at once would probably ruin the picture as their will be way too much action in it. It would be a complete andrenaline overload and this would have affected the movie. The action in the first part was awesome and very exciting to watch. The scenes in between with the story getting set in motion was intersting to watch and very cool. The story of lucy liu in the movie was very cool too but really violent. This movie isn't as violent as people say it is. Even though people get chopped up from limb to limb, it's comically done so that it isn't realistic and just silly. Definitely buy this movie on dvd cuase it is a classic."

But like ""the dreamers"" with it's overwhelming sexuality, it's got edginess on it's side: tons, and tons and tonsandtonsandtons of violence.<br/><br/>Every shot, character, line, theme and musical cue seems stolen from another movie.  sometimes you can pinpoint the exact one, sometimes you can't, but it tends to keep you smiling and planning to tear into imdb when it's over. It's over-the-top (not an ""epic"" by any means as some have described it) and more importantly, doesn't take itself seriously, which would have been a tragic mistake.  And certainly it is fun to watch... again especially if you think it's funny the way fragments of other movies are being subtly pieced together for comic value.<br/><br/>but plenty of people casually call this their favorite movie, but i submit that by combining a bunch of fragments of movies for the sake of doing so one cannot produce a whole greater than the sum of its parts. <br/><br/>

But without any kind of emotional set up they only end up being cartoon like. And, as the film tries to cut off the critics from this opinion, we then have a cartoon sequence that is even more bloody and violent.<br/><br/>If you want violence that entertains go back to some of the films that this film apes but fails to fully understand.<br/><br/>I am hoping part two will add in some sense of meaningful plot (which it promises to) and maybe it should have been one film after all, and heavily edited with some good dialogue put back in.<br/><br/>Why this is in the top 100 on this site I do not understand.

I promise anyone reading this that you WILL forget your problems if for just a moment watching Kill Bill.

First, I'm not an anime fan at all, but I think the addition of the O-ren cartoon segment was genius, and it's a perfect example of why although not highly esteemed by all, tarantino is undoubtedly talented. With shots like the one of the sheriffs dashboard and all the glasses, the scenes/sets themselves (suburban house fight, O-rens snowy and indoor scenes), combined with such other tarantino (unorthadox to almost a arrogant/comical level-think of them as the new briefcase as in pulp fiction) icons as the pussywagon, and the ""deadly viper..blah blah insert catchy group name here.....squad"" (that was sarcasm not their name, but i still got a laugh from the real name) you have to laugh at times as well as appreciate the creativity in every detail.

"M-oO-dles","8","0","1","2 April 2004"," The Brilliance of Kill Bill Volume 1.
","!!!!! WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS INCLUDED !!!!!<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a movie on which I had my eyes on for quit a long time. The 5th film of Quentin Tarantino had a lot of high expectations to live up to, and that had it's good reasons to. Tarantino's previous films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were jewels. They gave a new impuls to the Heist genre and they inspired a lot of filmmakers. Would Kill Bill also be that renewing and brilliant? Or maybe Tarantino's inspiration and idea's were all worked out and Kill Bill would only be the obligated next Tarantino movie he had to make, that would be a nothing more than a spot on his excellent reputation?<br/><br/>
Now I've finally seen the movie and actually there is only one thing to say about it: F*cking Brilliant! I can't imagine that I thought for a second that Tarantino didn't had it anymore, and for that I most sincerely apoligize. His movies just seem to get better and better. What we see here is only the tip of the iceberg! And this is just Volume 1.! I told you it only gets better and better.<br/><br/>Here's the story. On the wedding of the main character 'The Bride' played by Uma Thurman, everyone is killed by an assassination squad called: The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad of who she was a member. Their boss, a mysterious guy called Bill puts a bullet in the head of the pregnant 'Bride' and that is that. At least they thought that would be that. 'The Bride' miraculously survives and after four years lying in a coma she awakes. She then wants only one thing: Revenge! She intends to kill all four members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and when she's done with that she's going to kill Bill.<br/><br/>
The characteristic way Tarantino presents Kill Bill to us, reminds me of Pulp Fiction. The story is not linear still every scene is essential to the plot and solves some of your questions.That, together with a smooth soundtrack as normal, and the outstanding performance of all the actors, makes another jewel of a Tarantino movie. The main questions however, namely why do they wanted to kill 'The Bride' and who is Bill,  remain unsolved. Result; your sitting on the tip of your chair for about two hours, and you're actually disappointed when the movie is over. The hunger to Volume 2. only gets bigger and bigger.<br/><br/>I admit the story isn't that comprehensive or profound. But then, why should it? It all goes about the stunning swordfights in confrontations between 'The Bride' and her enemies. They are profound and comprehensive enough to complete the movie. The heads and limbs are splashing into the screen like it is as normal as every eight o'clock news. Extreme violence in his purest form. You don't need complexity in a movie like this, it is entertainment. And by the way  the story is good, actually very good because it contains action, drama, crime and thrills. Kill Bill has it all.<br/><br/>Do not fear extreme violence, though. And if you don't like blood either, do not watch this movie! But if you do like it, and if you see it like amusement and art, like, Kill Bill Volume 1. would be your perfect match!"
"ks4","8","0","1","23 March 2004"," Who can deny Tarantino's greatness?
","Kill Bill Vol. 1 is in many ways groundbreaking, experimental, it may not be the best movie i have seen in my life, but it is one of those that will be rememberred in 20 years for it's poetic and unique style. I admire Tarantino for his courage to experiment with the art of movie making and how he always tries to be original and somehow always manages to succed, even in a movie like this which has been build upon stealings from old movies, and they are obvious at times, but they are great, and the sarcastic look he gives on violence, it's all fantastic, he steps on grounds where not many others dare to step and always gets a unique result.<br/><br/>
This movie has a lot of Tarantino touches, and honestly no one else than him could have made a good movie out of this storyline, his use of sound is, like before, outstanding, the soundtrack of the movie got a big part of the way he makes the blood and violence look poetic, yet realistic in a way.<br/><br/>Now i must admit i think Volume 2 will be better, this movie spend a lot of time working the story up, and i now understand why QT decided to do it in 2 parts, else it would have been too long, this way it actually works pretty well..<br/><br/>Now you can't watch a movie without having to put your finger down somewhere, and in this case i must say i think the movie wasn't as Adrenaline driven as expected, but then again i wouldn't directly say that is bad, because i think the fighting scenes was well stopped, i hate it when they overdo the fighting scenes and they become doll in the long run (Matrix Revolutions!), this way he managed to end everything up pretty nicely. Although i saw Zatoichi last week and the fighting sequences there was better done, but that's not Kill Bill's fault i guess, they are unique in their own way, one thing i found beautiful in and obscure way was the overdone ""wooooosh"", obviously inspired by crappy b-movies where these sounds are all over, but they are so exagerated in this movie that you are gonna end up loving them, a thing that only Tarantino could have done convincing.<br/><br/>Praising Tarantino all the time now for his genius, i gotta comment on the acting too, i think Uma Thurman is brilliant in this role, it fits her fine, this sporty, cold and driven killer. As for the others i don't think there is much to say, i liked the bodyguard for Lucy Liu, the little innocent teen girl with the big nose, but other than that i think they were just pretty average, Uma Thurman is the one that shines through, if anybody. The strong side of this movie is really the scenery, sound and directing, that's what i think.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I saw Kill Bill in it's opening week here in the Netherlands. I was looking forward to a Tarantino who I fondly remembered for the great films like Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and for the fascinating story of Natural Born Killers.<br/><br/>However, I also remember Four rooms. I also Remember From dusk till dawn. Perhaps even Jacky Brown. I will also remember Kill Bill the same way; Why? You will ask, when it has these great references to classics? Why when cinematography and imagery is so great? Why when it has so many different styles of filming?<br/><br/>For three reasons; the first reason, the great films Taratino made had great plots in which he added depth, witty conversation and/or unexpected variations. Kill Bill lacks all of these and good directing does not make good on this.<br/><br/>The second reason; despite the fact that I am a movie fanatic, Tarantino referring to the movies which inspired him to make Kill Bill does not spell originality to me. It annoyed me mostly for lack of it. Critics love it for this but people who never experienced or seen American movies from this period will see it just as an action flick with ""cool"" bloody scenes.<br/><br/>Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction really appealed to me. As a character and a presence. The Bride had no radiance whatsoever. She couldn't scare an eight year old.<br/><br/>These are the reasons why Kill Bill does not appeal to me. Maybe Tarantine is picking up his pace again after relatively a long time of silence. Maybe the next episode will have the quality which made the others great. Maybe the plot in Kill Bill2 will twist like a snake on a hot plate. Or maybe he should have started doing these things in volume 1 so I would care if Uma Kills Bill.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","This is a truly beautiful piece of cinematic history. Never before have I walked out of a movie with such a huge mix of emotions. Quentin Tarantino is an artistic genius. Granted this is only his 4th mainstream directorial role, but greater things are to come from this man. The film is just the absolute best piece of entertainment that has graced the silver screen in the life of my movie going career.<br/><br/>The use of so many different styles that would normally appear out of context, or even cheesy are somehow pulled off to create a universal heightened emotion superior to any other film I have experienced. Not only is Tarantino's heady mix of film genre's refreshing and experimental, it is also well perfected and honed.<br/><br/>Tarantino manages to create a sense of 'real' that other films (even his own) lack. You can't help but feel that you are a part of every breath that Uma Thurman takes. Every moment of weakness and every ounce of rage that she experiences; you again are right there with here.<br/><br/>This has been the hardest film I have had to describe to friends as it such a step forward for film, yet without hesitation I would say it is the unparallel greatest film I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. If you're not fond of gruesomeness then it might be a little too much for the faint hearted to take. The film can also be very raw in its emotion and the way that the sound plays a part in creating it, and this again can almost be too much for some people.<br/><br/>If you see one movie this year, then I implore you; go see Kill Bill. You will not be disappointed. Not only does it meet the requirements of any film, to entertain the audience, it also ticks the boxes of so many other criteria. It really is a thinker, even if the think you are thinking is malice aforethought.<br/><br/>All in all, the best 2 hours I've had with my clothes on.<br/><br/>10/10"

It starts with slow burning story telling and then moves to the films climatic and brilliant action sequence remember these words ""tricks are for kids"" If tarantino had given this to a different director they would probably of made a brainless piece of summer crap, The Bride is totally believable as a killer.

"doguire","10","0","1","14 March 2004"," A near-perfect epic
","""Kill Bill"" is an anomaly in today's Hollywood culture. Here is a movie that neither makes you think too hard nor tears at you heartstrings--and it is a truly excellent flick. Under the shrewd (and possibly insane) hands of Quentin Tarantino, ""Kill Bill"" details an ultrally brutal and even more emotionally statisfying quest for revenge.<br/><br/>Beat to a bloody pulp and shot in the head and left for dead at her wedding day, The Bride (Uma Thurman, whose name is never revealed) is carted away in a four-year-long coma. She wakes up and vows revenge. And, oh, does Thurman play revenge well. It seems that the supporting cast (Lucy Lui, Vivica A. Fox, among others) truly beat Thurman to the edge of death. Her eyes convey her emotion--the limited and brief dialogue isn't even necessary. She is surpremely convincing in every aspect of her performance, even throughout the amazingly stylish fight sequences (which put ""The Matrix"" to shame). She fights like a pro with samurai swords, lethal daggers, butcher knives, and frying pans.<br/><br/>One of the main draws to this redefining adventure is the hilarious subject matter. Tarantino goes overboard. Blood flies about like fruit punch, gushing out of wounds like a torrential downpour (sometimes, in fact, you will even wonder if the human body has that much blood), and in any other movie, that gore would force you to leave--but here, it doesn't. Why? Because Tarantino never takes himself too seriously. Fight scenes are punctuated with effective and sometimes laughable dialogue. But beneath the hokey action scenes and the cute quips, there is a real movie at work here. Tarantino dances about the timeline, bouncing the story back and forth to a dizzying point, which forces your full attention on the gradually unfolding general story. The cliffhanger ending merely seals the deal.<br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" deserves all of the accolades it gets. Although it may seem to be a hackfest on the surface, there is true talent at work here. Uma Thurman and Lucy Lui give inspiring performances; the story, however linear it may be, it instantly grabbing; and Tarantino's masterful direction is as inspiringly as it is slightly distubring. A true masterpiece. One of the films to beat for 2003."

","I read, with interest, the previous review of Kill Bill Vol 1 and was surprised how insulting it must have been for Quentin to read. We all expected what was delivered in this movie, the effects, the martial arts homage, even the shallow characters seemed to fit the story amazingly well. I for one was glued to the screen not wanting it to end after the first kill... When you have stoled from everyone you admire and have not been afraid to admit it, a little originality over depth seems to have miss fired in some peoples minds. Tarantino attempted to honour his martial arts hero's in this flick, I think it was done with a great deal of admiration in it's style, story and character development. The final fight [water feature et al] was pure tarantino as was the trick in the tail... I for one will be at the front of the queue when Kill Bill Vol 2 comes to a cinema near me."

Kill Bill is the perfect combination of action, comedy and Japanese anime.  Uma Thurman is excellent as the bride.  Lucy Liu is great as the half Chinese half American, O- Ren Ishii.  Quentin Tarantino does it again.  The entire film was good from beginning to end.  I can't wait for volume 2 to come out later on this year.  Vivica A. Fox is awesome and lethal as Vernita Green.  However, David Carradine fans will be disappointed.  He is only in a couple scenes throughout the entire film. Hopefully we will see more of him and Michael Madsen in Kill Bill Volume: 2"
"deepion","9","0","1","15 March 2004"," Kill Bill: Volume 1, stand-alone material?
","I have seen Kill Bill: Volume 1, both in it's original form and the slightly tweeked Japanese version. For those who are not familiar with Quentin Tarantino movies, they are violent and bloody but ultimatly entertaining. Although this movie is mostly Japanese in idea (with the anime section a good example of this), This movie is so much more. From great fight sequences (some which rival the might of the last two chapters in The Matrix trilogy) to incredible acting, this movie has it all. The script itself is also an added achievement to Quentin Tarantino's filmography with a lot of pop-culture references and humour to stand along side previous classic works such as Pulp Fiction. This is the reason why Kill Bill: Volume 1 is rated so highly, its individualitly along with great dialogue and action make for an explosive and entertaining movie. The idea to split this movie into two halves was not the greatest idea in the world (it seems to be happening an awful lot lately). Does Kill Bill: Volume 1 stand alone? Just. But when put together with the stunning conclusion Kill Bill: Volume 2 will undoubtbly bring, then you can't help but believe that this will be another sucessful outing for Quentin Tarantino. And for those of you who can, i suggest you see the Japanese version of the movie which has a slightly extended anime sequence and full colour in the battle between The Bride and O-Ren's army (no black and white)."

","Ok I've left it a bit late to comment seeing as Vol 2 is released next month and I seen this film the day it was released back in October but nevermind!<br/><br/>First off I'd like to say that this movie does not intend to take itself seriously, it isn't set in the 'real-world'...I mean come on how many airlines would let you carry a big nasty katana onboard and if a hospital orderly, with a car as noticable as Buck's, was killed I'm sure they'd be quick to find the culprit...but the lack of reality in this film just adds to the greatness of it!<br/><br/>In my opinion it's a triumphant return for Mr T.

","So I finally saw ""Kill Bill"", Tarantino's fourth movie. UUUUUUuuuuuuuuu. To be honest, I'm kind of glad I didn't get the chance to see it in the cinema, it was kind of a bummer watching it over at my friend's house. The first half or so is, apart from the dry script, more or less great, brilliant cinematography, great music and there's a true Tarantino-ish feel to it. But the big fight in the end is overly silly and spoils the atmosphere filled with anticipation. Really cheesy blood effects that were perhaps intentionally cheesy get tiresome after the first dozen cut off limbs or so, and the whole movie just seems to loose its edge and witt. I definitely want to see the second volume, just this time anticipation will be left at home. A really nice nostalgic and cinematographic effort by the foot fetish director. 7/10"
"patrick_bateman_90029","10","0","1","8 March 2004"," Kill Bill: Vol. 1 - The 2nd Best Film of 2003
","Quentin Tarantino. You know the name and you know the movies. When some of the classic directors began to decline, such as Scorsese, Spielberg, Kubrick, and Coppola, he arrived on the spot with a little film known as Reservoir Dogs. While it was not a smash with the critics, it was with the people, making it a small hit and putting his name on the map. Then, he did Pulp Fiction, which has been hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time, resurrected John Travolta's career, made big stars of Uma Thurman and Samuel L. Jackson, and scored Tarantino various awards, mainly an Oscar win for Best Original Screenplay. Then, there was Jackie Brown, which wasn't as hot, but did become a cult hit. And now, after five years, he's come back with the 1st half of a simple film: a woman getting back at the person who stole four years from her.<br/><br/>From the very beginning of the film, it is very obvious of Tarantino's love of samurai and grindhouse films. Some of the best examples include the beginning (featuring the Shaw Brothers' and the `Feature Presentation' logos, the usage of Sonny Chiba portraying Hattori Hanzo once more, Gordon Liu as the head of the Crazy 88 (and make sure to look out for him as Pai Mei in Vol. 2), and Chiaki Kuriyama as Go Go, the cute girl in the Japanese schoolgirl outfit who could get a little mace crazy, and the way whenever someone gets a limb severed, the wound just sprays and sprays and sprays.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman. What can I say about Uma Thurman? She is the woman of the year (sorry, Charlize Theron. You were great in Monster (and you have all those awards to prove it), but you didn't have to spend three months learning about the art of combat or learn how to speak Japanese). The Bride is a character you sympathize with, even though her character was once a cold-blooded assassin. The performance has everything; coldness, humor, tragedy, and all those other things you love to see women do (Charlie's Angels, eat your heart out).<br/><br/>And speaking of Charlie's Angels, who would've thought that Lucy Liu could actually act in something? I love her in the Charlie's Angels films, but her character in those films is actually pretty one-dimensional. With O-Ren Ishii, she really expands out of the good girl look and into a REALLY bad girl look that's pretty mean with her samurai sword.<br/><br/>The rest of the actors playing the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are really good at their jobs as well. Vivica A. Fox does an really good job with her 20 minutes, Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen rule (and I can't wait to see their characters develop some more in Vol. 2), and David Carradine. What can be said about David Carradine? Yeah, they never show Bill in Vol. 1 or give Bill's motives for trying to off the Bride, but that's the greatest thing about Bill and the Bride. It's the mystery about these two characters and what they once shared that gets the story moving forward (although I wonder if Bill would still have been an interesting character if it was Warren Beatty or Kevin Costner playing the role).<br/><br/>The fight scenes in these films are something The Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions wished they could be, yet never could. Why? Because Quentin put heart into the battle scenes here, not a few million bucks worth of CGI. The Matrix fights failed, in my opinion, because it is very obvious to tell where it was the actors and where it was some CGI trick. With the fights in Kill Bill, especially the House of Blue Leaves battle, it is always the actors themselves, sometimes with a little help by traditional special effects that will shoot out blood like a water fountain. And while I loved the House of Blue Leaves battle, the best battle would have to be the battle between the Bride and O-Ren Ishii. And that's because of three things: the beauty of the scene, the excellent cinematography/editing, and the perfect use of Santa Esmerelda's `Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood.'<br/><br/>And speaking of the cinematography and editing, I found it to be criminal that Robert Richardson's breathtaking cinematography and Sally Menke's award winning editing were not nominated for Oscars this past year. But it was a pretty big year last year and if Vol. 2 ends up getting nominated next year, it would be kind of pointless for the same film to win the same awards twice in a row.<br/><br/>I loved Kill Bill: Vol. 1, but it's just so hard to have it as the #1 best film of the year when it's going up against The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. They're both completely different, but also so completely entertaining.<br/><br/>Well, here's hoping that Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is just as great as Vol. 1. Should be great to see how the battle between the Bride and Bill will play out.<br/><br/>A+"
"Halfwaytoheaven","9","0","1","7 March 2004"," New Genre, same old Quentin
","From start to finish, it is abundantly clear that this film was made by and for avid fans of 70's martial arts films.  Kill Bill is an homage to the Hong Kong cinema of that era, and as such it oozes with references to signature films of the genre.  Uma's costume during the restaurant battle scene is a duplicate of that worn by Bruce Lee in Game of Death, his final film.  The swordmaker, Hattori Hanzo, is also the name of Sonny Chiba's character in the ""Shadow Warriors"" series.  As a result, Kill Bill is best appreciated by those well schooled in Kung Fu films; however, that does not prevent those without such a background from enjoying the experience.<br/><br/>The movie is also very characteristic of Tarantino.  Several of his screen signatures can be observed, including some reference/appearance of feet, the camera following a character for a long time without breaking, and the infamous car trunk POV shot.  In addition, Kill Bill carries a 70's aesthetic similar to Tarantino's earlier films.  Just as the others were inspired by the film noir, gangster films, and blackspoitation, Kill Bill shows the filmmakers love for the martial arts genre.  In addition, the film renews my enthusiasm for Tarantino by demonstrating that he can work in multiple genres.  One can only wonder what else he might decide to do next. I hear he likes westerns."

","What thinking about this movie ? Violence, savage brutality and exaggeration of blood, that's what could think some people after looking Kill Bill. Non Sense ? I'm not sure. The fourth film by Quantin Tarantino. Only the fourth. We know Tarantino's style. The passages between the past and the present, the story cuts in little chapters. But this time, the realization and the action take the place of the dialogues. And how !!! The realization is perfect. The plans are amazing. A use of black and white, a little manga and an impressive soundtrack complete this perfect realization. And blood. Because blood there is. Violence is everywhere but never useless. Always used with elegance for the artistic side of the movie. Simples dialogues, irony, exuberant vulgarity, nothing is conceited. This is art. cinema !"

","The editing wavered in quality. The cinematography, excellent. The first half drags a bit, but the movie gets interesting later. The ""art of combat"" is flawed, but more significantly, reality is skewed to more than an extent in a supposed-to-be-almost-real world.<br/><br/>Despite all the negativity the movie's got charm. It's probably got to do with Quentin Tarantino's movie-making style: it's something else. What adds to the movie-watching experience is the music accompanying the movie all the time. It's a mix of retro, Japanese, country and modern music. You need to experience it. The music is so interesting and well-blended with the movie that it's almost like a half-identity of the film.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman plays a lady assassin who is out to take revenge against some of the members of the ""Deadly Viper Assassination Squad"", which she was part of. She was attacked on her wedding day by the gang leader (Bill) and her yet-to-be-born child is killed (or so she thinks). In this installment, she takes her revenge partly. She's yet to deal with the ""ace"" - Bill. Also, apparently, her child is still alive. However, we'll have to wait for the next installment to know more.<br/><br/>The movie is very graphic with lots of bloody scenes and as I mentioned a lot of them unrealistic too. But it's the movie-making style that's fantastic. Even if you do not particularly enjoy Quentin's style, the half-undone story is intriguing enough, and you'd definitely want to catch the next installment."

The non-linear story telling is also really cool and everytime you watch this movie you realize more and more of the story.  The fight scenes are extremely violent but made to resemble an anime (which there actually is about a 15 minute section of awesome anime in the middle).  I like this movie a lot too because he is getting away from his traditional old school gangster films (not always a good thing) and trying a new genre and paying homage to others that have come before him.

A movie that reminds us of Manga, of Matrix, of Martial Art movies, of Police/ Detective-thrillers, of never-aging myths of revenge, betrayal, and all the non-sense Tarantino is so able to observe and laugh at, a movie that puts us in front of what we see, like or dislike (or fake either of them - as snobbish persons) most of the time when we go to cinema, rent a movie or watch TV.

","If any other name had been attached to this movie, it wouldn't have gone through because no one would let it. Tarantino has been awarded every freedom to indulge himself, and dear god, he uses every last one.<br/><br/>The movie is drenched in style. It's loaded with very impressive cinematography and art direction, and it's well directed for what it was going for. But I find the major disappointment to be with the writing. Particularly the dialogue. The story was very good, but almost all conversations between characters were just horrible. The Bride & Vernita's conversation in the kitchen was just embarrassing to listen to. Their lines were so cliched that it must have been impossible to say them with any passion without hamming it up, so they hammed it up.<br/><br/>The blood spewing from every open wound was also a little overdone, and just looked fake. Even without knowing the physical problems with it, the blood didn't look good in almost every fight scene. I mean, if you're going to have THAT much blood in a single movie, I'd take steps to see to it that the blood actually looks decent.<br/><br/>And then, there were a lot of scenes, or, at least, shots, that were too long, and pointless. They added nothing to the film, and if it was any other director, would've been on the cutting room floor. Unless Vol. 2 is substantially different, this movie did NOT have to be cut in two.<br/><br/>WHile it's certainly worth seeing, it's not nearly Tarantino's best, nor is it worthy of all the praise it's been getting. There are way too many instances where useless content or ridiculousness was just shrugged off with, ""Well, it's Tarantino."""

The film doesn't necessarily raise, or lower (depending on your point of view) the bar; suffice it to say I never had to turn my head - but neither did my stomach turn.  Sex? Not enough to turn viewers off, but not enough to turn many on either.  While  the film features several talented female characters, the focus is on their fighting skills , and not their passion for the more intimate arts - a pitiful waste.<br/><br/>Tarantino's Kill Bill, Part One doesn't waste your time or money, though; three and a half stars - just enjoy the moment."

","When I viewed this movie less then an hour ago I couldn't help to compare it with another great classic movie. I am talking about: 'Once upon a time in the west'. Not just the music, but the theme of revenge, the slow way the plot is being revealed (it takes him more then one movie to reveal it all), the crazed hero who kills whomever stand in its way, the flashbacks.<br/><br/>
There are of course big differences between the movies, but Kill Bill felt to me like a spaghetti western and I loved it.<br/><br/>I loved the music, the fighting, the abrupt changes in mood and speed of the movie, the way he uses different filming techniques to tell the story. The use of flashbacks to tell even the tiniest of details of the story.<br/><br/>There are some flaws, I personally didn't care much for the showers of blood. The endless pumping of the red stuff was overdone and did not add much to the movie. I also missed some scenes that just should have been there. The training, the getting into shape after so many years in coma and yes some more violence. This movie is so full of gore and mayhem that cutting things like torture does not make much sense and I felt a censor recommending to cut these scenes.<br/><br/>So I give it a 9 out of 10. Not a 10 mind you as it is not perfect but it is one of the best movies i've seen this year.."
"prawnny","8","0","1","28 January 2004"," Gosh, it's so cool!
","I watched this movie in Belfast by myself and I regret I didn't bring any friends to watch it with me. It's such a cool and entertaining movie! Uma Thurman's performance was so good. It would seem like her character's invincible but when she fights, she still feels pain, tiredness and um, she pants after long fights too. It made her character more real.<br/><br/>*minor spoiler* The cartoon chapter of Lucy Liu's character is a real surprise but it's very good. The pace is fast, the scenes and story is nicely edited. It would be really stimulating if it's not made in cartoon because of all the blood smearing and stomach cutting scenes.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a really cool movie. I just hope Vol 2 will be showed in Malaysia."

","Hi Yall!<br/><br/>This is my first review, so please bear with me.<br/><br/>Some time ago I first heard about Kill Bill from some talk show, Conan O'Brain or Jay Leno I am not quite sure, but as soon as I heard that it was a Tarantino's, I was dead sure I wanted to see it, and plus, it has the lovely Uma Thurman.  However, being very sensitive, and not a fan of gory or violent movies - even though I am 22yo guy, I had second thoughts of catching this movie.  I know Tarantino's style, I loved `Pulp Fiction' and `Jackie Brown', but as I saw how almost everybody reacted to the gruesome fighting scenes, I thought it was one of the sickest movies ever! I fought with myself for a long time, then decided with what-the-heck mood to see it.  And I was BLOWN AWAY!!!!<br/><br/>The mastermind has done it again!<br/><br/>*SPOILERS*  If you haven't seen the movie and would love to, and don't want any part of it revealed to you, please READ NO FURTHER!<br/><br/>I hate martial arts movies, actually I have never finished watching a whole martial art movie in my life, I always got bored and had to leave the theatre.  But this one I knew it would be different.  That artistic 70's vision of the movie was amazing.  I enjoyed every little bit of it.  The most thing I enjoyed was the introduction scene, with the song playing `Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)'.  That song was stuck in my mind for hours!<br/><br/>Okay, what else about the movie..  Yeah..  I got attached very easily to the characters, especially to the bride.  During the movie I was chanting `Kill them, Kill Them ALL!' The fighting scenes, according to a lot of people, were very violent, but not to me.  I am very sensitive, and the view of blood makes me sick, but I guess I got used to violence and gore for all the horror and thriller movies I watched.  And I was quite pissed when the screen turned into black and white during the Crazy88 massacre scene -for censorship-.<br/><br/>Yeah, when the name of the Bride was bleeped, I was really pissed.  I never thought it was the making of Tarantino, I thought it was a profanity or some political-related insensitive remark or something, but then I researched on the net, and read the movie's script, I realized it was done intentionally. I guess the joke was on me! And the final fight scene between O-Ren Ishii and the Bride was breath-taking!  I loved the character of O-Ren, and felt very sad when she died, but was quite happy too for the Bride. And need I mention the last scene in the trunk!  That got me hanging for the sequel!<br/><br/>I give this movie a perfect score 10/10!  It even deserves more."

I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Kung Fu/Samurai movies dripping with class. I'm a big fan of blood and guts and this movie didn't disappoint. The only downfall I can think of is the Anime in the middle of the movie, but at least it was bloody."

Kill Bill's got elements of an epic movie, martial arts flick, western, even anime mixing it with old school music, action beats, japanese-latino-disco remixes.<br/><br/>Avoid it if you're too stuck up on the classic and predictable movie styles and afraid to try something new (like my parents)!

","Very good movie.  Although it wasn't as good as Pulp Fiction, this movie hopefully marks a comeback for director Quentin Tarantino.  The movie has a unique style that makes it interesting to watch.  The movie wouldn't be what it is without the touch of it's director.  The movie incorporates anime as well as black and white through a few portions of it.  This movie, being an action/drama, caters well to its target demographic of men in their 20's - 30's or so.  That said, the violence is to say the least somewhat gratuitous.  Even so, the spraying blood and limbs being chopped off gives the movie a sense of sick hilarity.  I laughed more than a few times at the violence. I enjoyed the movie overall, and I look forward to seeing Volume 2."

The turning from colors to black and white comes directly in the right second. Mr. Tarantino has rhythm. But does he have the blues?<br/><br/>Many critics have complained about the lack of clever dialogue (almost none of them however dares for some reason complain about the violence anymore). Concerning the dialogue the critics are right. There is humour to be find, especially in the scene with the two Japanese men in the Okinawa bar, yelling at each other.<br/><br/>But one has to ask: Doesn't Mr. Tarantino get tired of himself? He should make a comedy, a clever comedy with clever comedians and nobody even getting a slap in he face.

"allisonium","10","0","1","19 January 2004"," Rocked Me
","As I reflect on all the movies of 2003, the only one that knocked me on my ass was Kill Bill.  This one should be up for Oscar contention, but because Kill Bill unapologetically lacks the artsy finesse the Academy drools over, I doubt it will be nominated.  But from the first scene where Uma Thurman gets shot point blank in the head to the last I-won't-spoil-it-for-you scene, you will be intrigued.  There are bits that are unrealistically bloody, but Tarrantino meant it.  There are scenes, like the fabulous knife fight between Thurman and Vivica Fox that may seem heavy-handed, but you can tell Tarrantino meant that, too.  Love him or hate him, Quentin Tarrantino *gives a damn* about his audience and puts an extrordinary amount effort into every second of the film for you.  Tarrantino desires to make you emotionally react to his work.  When you are shuddering and queasy during a grisly scene, you realize that the last time you felt that way was--- an equally grisly scene in Pulp Fiction.  Like him or not, he takes you where other directors don't or won't, or most especially, *can't*.  Tons tried to imitate the cool / retro / Los Angeles style of Tarrantino (most notably and ineffectively Guy Ritchie), but they end up looking stupid (like everything Ritchie's done).  Tarrantino gets it just right here - he creates a movie that you don't just happen to see, it *happens* to you."

The Crazy ""88"" battle (there were only 27 of the Ukoza guards) is supercharged, beautifully shot and is guaranteed to make you grit your teeth and watch closely. I love the silhouettes fighting against the blue background. As in all Tarantino, this film has nonlinear storytelling, and it is also difficult to praise or criticize him for constructing the script this way. There might be some plants in Vol. 1 taht would get payed off in Vol. 2 - who knows? But the last thing that Bill says in the end is guaranteed to keep fans of this one waiting anxiously for Vol. 2.

With Kill Bill he proves to the world that he actually can get inspired from a wide source of media, and create something new and original.<br/><br/>Where Ying xiong (Hero, 2002) and Wo hu cang long (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, 2000) found a wider western audience than most other Asian films, these two movies are pathetic in comparison to what came out of Hong Kong, China and Japan during the 90's, but these two are also by far boring if seen together with Kill Bill.<br/><br/>But why compare anyway? Kill Bill stands on its own, and there is probably no other film like it. It has violent scenes that have a humour not seen since RoboCop (1987) and it also has really neat performances from severel actresses and actors I didn't even believe were still alive.<br/><br/>I never liked Uma Thurman or Pulp Fiction (1994), but after watching Kill Bill volume 1., I can say that I won't say a bad word about Uma ever again. She is perfect.<br/><br/>As can be said by most people in this high quality sword slashing flick.<br/><br/>Kill Bill has only one thing wrong. It's divided into two films, volume one and volume two. I hate that. I wanted to see these two films together, but now I have to wait. That is not nice of Miramax, but hey, they probably want us to double their money, right? I can't see any other reason.<br/><br/>Kill Bill vol 1 is a perfect 10. Quentin Tarantino must be proud. I haven't seen him make a good film since 1992, so I'm happy.

","I consider myself an objective movie reviewer. Just because Tarantino directed this movie doesn't mean I'll try to like it. I have no loyalty whatsoever to any studio or director. It is human nature to look up to mythic characters like Tarantino and Tolkien. How else did Hitler come to power? This perhaps explains the fanaticism of Tarantino and LOTR fans. It also explains why Tarantino's films as well as the LOTR films have such inflated IMDB ratings.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a good movie. The music and visual elements are unique and idiosyncratic. Especially during the first half of the movie Tarantino builds up great suspense with the nurse walking to the Bride in hospital and almost killing her. The splitscreens, bright-cool colors, and anime scenes were stylish and entertaining.<br/><br/>However, halfway through the movie Tarantino seemed to have gotten lazy. The fight scene in which the Bride goes up against hundreds of men with swords is excessively cut. A continuous shot like that found in most fight scene in The Matrix would have been preferable. This would have created a greater sense of cohesion. Instead the fight scene in Kill Bill is quite confusing.<br/><br/>After watching Kill Bill: Volume 2, I'll be able to talk about the plot and characterization. In the first volume characterization is quite disappointing, but I can expect that in martial arts films. (The Matrix had poor characterization as well. Every character spoke like philosophy professors.)<br/><br/>Like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Kill Bill's main protagonists are females, which is quite alright as it works well as a feminist message to viewers. Gender roles are often reinforced by sexist movies like Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>7/10"

"da040926","Null","0","1","5 January 2004"," I love this film, but I am not so happy to admit it ..
","I have to agree with every complaint regarding this film. There is so much violence. The story is so simple. QT is evidently strongly inspired from many old movies. And so on .. Yet, few days ago I saw it in a cinema for the second time and .. I loved it again. How to explain it .. my strongest feeling is, that QT completely enjoyed every moment of making this ""retro"" movie and somehow his joy emanates from the movie, at least for most of us.<br/><br/>**** Few possible lesser spoilers follows ****<br/><br/>One thing I considered great are characters. Go Go looks so sadistically evil (in her seventeen!!), that everybody must run away just guessing her coming, trust me! Freddy Krueger was just a funny old neighbor.. O-Ren Ishii is wonderfully mythical Japanese (geisha? ninja?), at least until her Chinese / American ""taint"" shows :-) Hattori Hanzo and his two faces - funny shopkeeper / noble samurai sword-maker are just flawless. And there are others, excellent as well!<br/><br/>Another great part are scenes. A beautiful Japanese winter garden is probably the best but there are many others - blue/red pool, Yakuza brainstorming, Hattori Hanzo katanas, anime scene etc.<br/><br/>
Last but not the least, the humor. Just the right amount of it and usually on right places. A little girl entering the house - everything is broken and crushed, shards and blood everywhere, her mother and stranger women all in blood with their hands hiding knives behind back: What has happened mommy? - Well, you see, sweetheart, it was your little nasty dogie ..<br/><br/>
Few interesting pointers leads to part II, probably. Protagonist name is not mentioned at all (actually in one scene is even ""censored"" - beep method :-), only a code name. In the part, when Uma leaves the Japan by airplane you can spot a second katana in the plane but not its owner .. And the end point of this part 1 is good too, luckily.<br/><br/>
Shortly, if you can understand that the film doesn't try to be serious and if you do not mind to accept that violence may be so funny to watch (strange though may it be) you may love the film as I do .. and still you may ask yourself: how is it possible I like such things? Frankly, I do not know the answer for myself.<br/><br/>I give 9/10"

","With ""Jackie Brown"" it seemed as if Tarantino kind of lost his edge. Though, where it's fair to say ""Jackie Brown"" wasn't Tarantino's best movie, it wasn't all bad, and there were still some trademark Tarantino moments. Now he waited for the right moment to do these films(kill Bill volume I&II). And my god is it good! It's in no way the same as his former movies, and it's in no way the same as all the other movies in where there's martial arts. Let's face it, there's a hype going on since the first Matrix. How easy it was in 1999 to create some intresting and original martial arts attacks, how hard is it to do the same today. But with ""Kill Bill"" Tarantino did it beautyfully, just by not creating an overkill. And not only with the fight scenes Tarantino creates originality, also the way he portrayed it is done perfectly. With a huge amount of blood you can do so much, he might of thought. Well he's correct. Plus the movie is funny as hell, just the way we like it from Tarantino...

"refaelba","Null","0","1","10 January 2004"," Quality production, waste of resources.
","Well, in my opinion the director is genius. The movie has NO PLOT WHATSOEVER, and yet the director finds a great way of telling it. The movie is divided to chapters, as every chapter is getting you further down the ""plot"". The thing is that there is no plot, other than ""My man tried to kill me at the wedding, so now I'll just go and kick his ba**s"".<br/><br/>
The ba**s kicking is not bad, although it isn't exactly good. It shows that a lot of effort was put into the making of this film, but I fear it was a waste, since it really tells you nothing at all, and tries to tell you things anyway. The deadly bride doesn't even have a name.<br/><br/>
In the film, the bride is going through all of the *evil* characters and kill them systematically. There's a lot of blood, more blood, some blood to go with it and a few blades and fights. The only innovative fight is the first one. After that, you are may be excused. <br/><br/>There's also a scene that features some really bad anime. The creators probably wanted to give it their own touch, but they ended up with a REALLY BAD ANIME scene, during which I only wished it was over.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is really nice, though, well- made and picked. Overall this movie is really well- produced, but it has nothing to offer. Today top-notch effects are not enough, I fear. Watch it if you're into tons of blood and gore, that doesn't let plot get in the way.<br/><br/>5/10"

"wawain","10","0","1","29 December 2003"," live-action anime
","This film is brilliant. It's a bonafide vision from beginning to cliffhanger.<br/><br/>As others have pointed out, I think this film was created with anime-style in mind. I haven't seen much anime but many of the visuals in this film remind me of stuff like Mononoke Hime and Rurouni Kenshin. The latter example tells me to interpret Kill Bill as a brilliantly executed episode, a two-parter, rather than a film.<br/><br/>People have complained of the ""lack of story."" I perceive the same fact this way: Tarantino is working with a cookie-cutter cliche of a revenge flick, so it defies any attempt at exciting description. The movie tacitly assumes that a story so basic should automatically resonate with anyone. So now the entertainment is derived from seeing *how* the film executes the story: a movie movie. I think Tarantino has created this film with more enthusiasm and panache than you would normally see in mainstream stuff.<br/><br/>
The semiformal dialogue in this film also reminded me of old Samurai stuff where strongly-abided codes of honor and respect, and warriers and swords (as well as swordsmiths) of different orders of strength are the dictates of the land. So I think it is appropriate that the dialogue is restrained compared with Pulp Fiction. Really, I don't see how Pulp Fiction has anything to do with this film other than the fact that the director made both with his particular kitchensink style. Folks he was going for something different from his previous efforts. Actually I take it back: Pulp Fiction foreshadowed this film when Butch rescues Marcellus Wallace from a fate worse than death with a samurai sword, and subsequently Wallace, who was a moment ago hellbent on ""scouring the earth for the motherf*cker"" Butch, without hesitation follows an unspoken code of conduct and dissolves their feud.<br/><br/>Okay, naysayers, you gotta admit at least that Tarantino has a sense of showmanship. That alone, sadly, still puts Kill Bill above average in the mundania also known as Hollywood."

","Charlie's Angels has nothing on this one.<br/><br/>Not only was this movie stylin', but it still had the Tarrentino influences and twists. Those of you who say this movie was ""Blah"" or ""Not original"" lack exactly what you should all like about this movie: the color and excitment. This film is an ode to the old school Japanese Samurai movies that Tarrentino is a huge fan of and while some may think he sold out with high profile actresses, they were perfect for the parts. They completed the feel of the movie, and Uma kicks ass more times than Cameron Diaz in both ""Angels"" movies combined. Tarrentino took amazing artistic chances with this film and suceeded wonderfully. Even the animé was so well-done, and I have never been a fan of Asian-inspired cartoons. Tarrentino's crazy, so you all should expect when walking into the theater. If you're not back for the second and last installment, no one will miss you, but you'll be missing out on great, demented work of art."

","I can't remember the time I was so thoroughly entertained by a movie. Kill Bill is a very violent and gory trip and it doesn't pull any punches. It's one of the best movies ever made. You can watch the first ten minutes and you won't be able to get up until it's over. <br/><br/>   Tarantino puts a Kung Fu, Samurai and Spaghetti Western movie all in one. It borrows from the Samurai movies that 60s and 70s Spaghetti Westerns were based on. I was taken aback when I actually heard some Spaghetti Western music in the movie. The movie is pretty funny as well. Tarantino has a unique sense of humor and most movie lovers go introduced to in Pulp Fiction. This movie has the same sense of humor. He pays a lot of homage to Kung Fu movies, The Bride's costume as she takes on an army of henchmen is the same one Bruce Lee wore in Game of Death. It's little touches like this that will make Kill Bill a must see for any Kung Fu movie fan. I can't wait for part two.<br/><br/>Rayvyn"

But however hard he tries to give it that good ol' B-action/martialarts-from-back-then, he cannot make me forget that this is infact a multi million $ movie; its a big-budget low-budget wannabe. Why didn't he simply make it low budget to begin with?!<br/><br/>Story-wise KBv1 is an orgy of worn-out chlichés (which might also be the intention).In fact, the ""story"" seems simply to be an excuse for QT to show off some skills in capturing visual styles. The characters are high-school-script flat, and 1-st grade-home-made-comic stereotype. Heck, I've seen kids who play with LEGO present more interesting characters.<br/><br/>

"Chujo","Null","0","1","27 December 2003"," Beyond reference
","Quentin Tarantino's fourth film starts as it means to go on. The film fades in on a broken, black and white Uma Thurman wheezing and coughing whilst listening to her former lover intone his parting words. She tries to speak, but before she can fully form her sentence, Bill (the omnipotent David Carradine) levels his gun at her head and starts The Bride on her path to vengeance. Cue Nancy Sinatra and some of the most mournful, slow opening credits I've ever seen.  The relationship between music and image is neatly encapsulated and Tarantino makes it clear he's working at his own pace.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is about revenge, pure and simple. We learn just enough about our heroine in this part to understand that her retribution is just and deserved. Like a million nameless cowboys in a million Spaghetti Westerns, she is a living instrument of fate. Thankfully Tarantino's deft direction and Thurman's warm, charismatic performance are more than up to the archetype, carrying it with consummate ease.<br/><br/>Kill Bill and Tarantino instead choose to focus his attention on the rogue's gallery of adversaries. Lucy Liu's character Oren Ishii has her origins relayed through a series of split screen sketches and a braveu anime sequence courtesy of Studio IG, the talented individuals behind Blood: The Last Vampire and the Ghost in the Shell series. It is perhaps this scene that best illustrates Tarantino's objective with his fourth film, the marrying of various cult flavours the world over. Here sublime sketchy, fluid, animated bloodletting is scored to operatic Italian Western themes and it works beautifully.<br/><br/>As with his previous pieces, Tarantino is able to take disparate elements from world cinema and spin them into a cohesive whole, with his own imprint firmly stamped on every frame. Here it's European Westerns, Jidei Geki films, Yakuza and 70's Kung Fu epics, and whilst an understanding isn't essential it certainly helps. The tone is expansive and melodramatic, with a heavy helping of gallows humour.<br/><br/>What's most impressive about Kill Bill though is that the action and execution goes beyond reference, it actually matches what it's paying homage to. The fights and action sequences have that illusive rhythm that eludes most Western attempts to copy this unique brand of cinema.<br/><br/>
What's astounding though is Tarantino's sheer mastery of the tempo. He effortlessly shifts through several different types of combat without it ever jarring, a fantastic achievement first time out on the action scene. It's almost like being a fan of John Woo's 70's comedy of eras, and then watching A Better Tomorrow. You never knew the man had it in him. Obviously a good portion of the kudos must be laid at Master Yuen Woo Ping's door (he of Matrix and Crouching Tiger. fame), but Tarantino's own voice and style are clearly visible.<br/><br/>As ever Tarantino breathes new life into a group of actors thought past their best. The two that stand out the most are the Street Fighter himself, Sonny Chiba and Kung Fu's David Carradine. Chiba best known for playing stoic, emotionless killing machines bleeds warmth as Hattori Hanzo, an accomplice for The Bride. His performance combines weary humour and a genuine regal air. Carradine as the never-seen Bill is perfect as the behind-the-scenes puppet master. Quite the feat considering you only ever see his feet and hands.<br/><br/>In all Kill Bill is for my money an unqualified success, although certainly not a film I could wholeheartedly recommend to anyone, it is certainly a film of true quality. If you've ever stayed up late to catch a Godzilla flick or marvelled at the sheer elegiac comedic woe of Leone's films, then this is the movie for you. As close to an instant masterpiece as I've ever seen."

","Who ever said a movie needs a story? In this day of computer effects, CGI and all that bullcrap which can be nice if used with a purpose and for the right things, but Hollywood has over used this method of creating unreal shots to spice up action scenes. Enter Kill Bill. I didn't notice any computer effects in this one. The impact the action scenes had on me (and believe me, they had quite an impact), came from the great choreography of Yuen Woo-Ping, the physical abilities of the stunt men and women involved and obviously from the incredible sense of style the great Quentin Tarantino possesses. I guess a lot of people will call this movie tasteless and dumb action and so forth. It's probably guilty as charged but you can't deny the artistic abilities of the director and the poetry in motion that this movie definately is. I gave it a 9 due to the lack of story but it's still the best movie of the year (Note: I haven't seen the return of the king yet). This American production has the same level of martial arts style and stays true to the genre like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero to make one of the best Kung Fu movies ever. I can't wait till Vol. 2."

","Tarantino has taken a six-year break from film-making, leaving all his fans awaiting his next project. Being a very big fan of both Reservoir Dogs, and definately Pulp Fiction, I was exceedingly excited to see this film. It did not let me down.<br/><br/>Tarantino obviously indulgences in his likeness of Japaneese action, and bloody gore, but we expect that from him. As Tarantino is an admitted film geek, it would be almost sinful to him, not to make references to his favorite films; such as: Uma's outfit that's identical to Bruce Lee's outfit in Game of Death.<br/><br/>I must remark to Tarantino's beautiful direction; exploring in new camera tricks, and japaneese cartoons. Probably Quentin's finest directorial performance yet. As a screenwriter, Quentin was going places he has no business being. He'd been made famous with gangsters talking about ""Royale w/ Cheese"" and Madonna, he seems to want to leave that behind, but doesn't realise that this is another expectation from of his fans.<br/><br/>Most definitely not his greatest film, but it is worth watching to see Tarantino experiment with Japaneese folklore, and a superb performance by Thurman. It's a megablast of pulp.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

But it's just too much style compared to the substance; the scenes are not perfected with style, rather the scenes exist just in order to carry the style. Also, one could argue if it really is cool. I don't think it is. A blonde girl with a samurai sword and a yellow motorcycle suite might be comically, but certainly not cool to me.

","Now don't get me wrong, I am not the greatest QT fan around.  I simply hate reservoir dogs. (Overrated) and pulp Fiction was fun but is not  for repeated viewing not to mention the dire Jackie Brown but I simply adore this movie.  Maybe it is as simple as ""finally movie about a girl who whoops everyone's ass"". Although,I believe it has more to do with the layer upon layer of different influences, music choice, fighting scenes that put the matrix to shame and darn seemingly, effortless cool that is rarely attained in movies but frequently strived after.  I have to concede that story, even though told in a novel fashion, is not the thing that got most attention, but then again, the premise of a woman out on righteous revenge is an avenue which has not been explored too often. It has a freshness about it that neutralises any thinness of plot.  In fact, it would get in the way of the whole picture in my view.  We get that she is p*ssed and we get that she is right to pursue the people who betrayed her.  What more do we need to know than what QT so meticulously tries to unfold? That is the paradox in this movie.  The story is told in a slow pace that belies the action packed scenes. No boredom here.  Just total awe at the greatness of it all.   I envy the talent.. I think every moviemaker in Hollywood is, right about now and might do their utmost to prevent this movie to get the credit it deserves.  Let's hope that integrity will rule over egos this year."
"basrutten","7","0","1","15 December 2003"," Overkill Bill
","""Kill Bill"", as we now all know ""The Fourth Movie by Quentin Tarantino"" is an over-the-top action spectacle that unfortunately doesn't really hit the mark. It's a decent attempt, but by no means a classic like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". <br/><br/>""Kill Bill"" is undeniably still a Tarantino movie: the absurd characters, the absurd situations they get into, the pointless but very cool dialogs, the deliberately corny music (once again, chosen brilliantly) and all the things that made his other movies so great are still there, but they are used a lot more sparingly than they used to be.  <br/><br/>Instead, everything takes a back seat to the action. Normally, I wouldn't mind this, since the action is usually also quite good in QT movies, but in this case it's just overkill..the first couple of blood fountains, decapitations and dismemberments are fun, but after that it just gets old very fast...many of the gore simply isn't shocking or entertaining enough to keep my attention. The fact that you don't really care about any of the characters dying doesn't really help either. <br/><br/>That being said, there are some truly great action scenes, like the fight between the Bride and Gogo the sadistic school girl, and some parts of the showdown with the dozens of masked yakuzas, but for every great scene, there's at least one that just drags on way too long or is just pointless. <br/><br/>
""Kill Bill"" is far from a terrible movie, since there are still enough flares of brilliance to make it quite entertaining, but there are too many times at which the action becomes boring/overkill/pointless, or the narrative become simply a bit boring.

","I know Japan history and traditions very bad, but to my mind Even the Japanese would happy to see this movie like me. Tarantino make a new unique movie, which are not similar to his others. This Movie are not similar to any others. Sometimes it look like western, sometimes like anime, sometimes like Hong-hong action, but as a whole it isn't western, anime or any other.

"FilmFanatic14","10","0","1","8 December 2003"," Yet another classic from Quentin Tarantino.
","Kill Bill: Vol.1 is in my opinion, one of the best films made over the past few years. Kill Bill is a story about a woman (Uma) who worked for the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Her code name is Black Mamba. She quit the squad, got married and pregnant. Bill, the leader of the squad attacks Black Mamba's wedding splattering everyone everywhere. This is about where the film starts off - we see Black Mamba in the church and Bill shoots her in the head. She goes into a coma for four years, when she wakes up she is one angry assassin. She wants revenge - so she writes a to-kill list of five Deadly Assassins and their boss Bill, and goes out 'on a roaring rampage of revenge' - as the punch line says.<br/><br/>Of course I am telling you this in chronological order, unlike the film, where Quentin has splattered the movie all over the place - as normal. This is not bad of course, it makes you think and you will enjoy the movie more. Kill Bill: Vol.1 is all it's meant to be. It's ultra bloody, has heaps of ultra cool fight sequences (which all look real) and an ultra great cast. The story hops along quickly, it never leaves you bored. No one should complain about it being split in two because the first half alone goes for almost two hours. We are left at the end of the movie with a cliff hanger - and no, this is not the sort of cliff hanger where someone has a gun to the main character's head and you know they will get out of it - it's 100 times better than that!<br/><br/>The film also includes an anime sequence that tells a story of O-Ren's past. This is a really good anime sequence - you will enjoy it. The whole film is done in a way that follows that sequence - when someone gets a leg chopped off the blood will keep spurting out like a fountain - quite funny at times. The violence isn't that bad because it is done in a humorous way and is quite unbelievable and low impact. The soundtrack is great; it really goes with the movie. The music made you laugh at some points because it just didn't seem appropriate (but it was, in a way).<br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill: Vol.1 is a must see movie and is defiantly not a waste of money just because it is split in two. The first half alone is better than most film experiences you will ever have.  So, if you haven't seen Kill Bill: Vol.1, see it today. 10/10."
"Hellmao","7","0","1","8 December 2003"," Missing a lot
","Kill Bill has turned out to be a rather incomplete piece of art, because a lot is weak and a lot is missing. Here is what I mean: First of all sophisticated choreography and editing do not hide that Uma Thurman cannot fight. The training sequence - unmissable element for any decent martial arts revenge movie-is poor. The way the Bride finishes off her first victims in the hospital is rather uninspired. Her ex-squad sister looks kinky but quite out of shape and has not a single good line. The Bride uses the best sword ever made and O-Ren-Ishii praises its quality in her final breath - so why don't we see it being manufactured? There could have been many ways of making it a memorable sequence. The Yakuza Dinner scene does not pull any strings. The Go Go Yubari character is great, but the introduction of her violent madness is boring. She kills a poor idiot in a bar - is that the craziest thing she did? There is no fine dialogue. Then this whole movie is slow and rather short, while some scenes are still too long - why cut it in two? There are also scenes I did not understand, like the motorbike ride, extensive exposure of the list with Bill's hand and the sheriff's senseless conclusions on the wedding slaughter scenery. Bill himself was too stupid to kill the Bride but then finds it below standard to kill her in the hospital ? The mountain of preparation time that Tarantino has taken, cannot be found back in the movie. It looks like the script has been glued together in weeks. In the end, there are many open identity questions involving husbands, parents, daughters, Bill and the Bride. This Who is Who-idea can only work if you really burn to know the solution, a feeling that I frankly miss. So, despite Sonny Chiba, a beautiful animation sequence and the gorgeous snow falling in the garden showdown, this movie is like the band at the restaurant: Looking better than it is."

","Having enjoyed ""Pulp Fiction"" and even ""Jackie Brown"", I had great hopes for ""Kill Bill: Vol 1"". I was impressed with production design, score and cinematography in general, but couldn´t get myself to enjoy the completely over-the-top blood-effects, even though I knew they were supposed to be that way as a reference to certain cheap martial-arts movies. I should say that I haven´t seen any of those, so maybe that´s why I couldn´t enjoy ""Kill Bill"" as much as people who did. The shifting in time, which was a master-stroke in ""Pulp Fiction"", seemed forced to me in ""Kill Bill"" and I found most of the dialog either boring or silly. No complains about the really simple revenge-story, but the second half of the movie was nearly all fighting, which became somewhat tiresome for me. I liked the cast and was especially looking forward to seeing David Carradine as Bill - he seems like the perfect choice to me, even though I hear he wasn´t Tarantino´s first choice - so I was disappointed to see so little of him in ""Vol. 1"". I am definitley going to see ""Vol. 2"", but with greatly reduced expectations."

","All you sad people, who think that Kill Bill is overrated, unworthy or whatever, just don't appreciate a good film when you see it. first of all, Tarantino is a genius, and the fact that he's never won an Oscar only proves how unique this filmmaker really is. Just doing what he wants, putting his heart into it and not appealing to the mainstream fans. the guy is basically having a good time, while creating an exhilarating, avant-garde, non-apologetic, explosion of a movie.<br/><br/>The problem with people who dislike this picture is that they think of Tarantino as the film school graduate, deeply philosophical type, when in fact the man did his homework at a video store, proving that you don't have to be Hollywood's favorite pet in order to make good movies. you just make them... and try to have some FUN while going at it. some people will like it, others won't. but that's the great thing about good movies - they make you feel (for better or for worse). Indifference is the worst form of criticism. So i ask, what's so wrong about a film that pays homage to those action-packed B-type kung fu movies that we all grew up on? (well, at least some of us). Its fun, its crazy, the cinematography is spectacular, the dialogues are, as always, sharp and very self-aware in a ""Tarantino"" sort of way, the Soundtrack is superb (another Tarantino trademark), the anima sequence was outstanding and a brilliant touch. All in all I had great FUN watching this movie (maybe that's why i went to see it 3 times),and i laughed my ass off. Sometimes people forget that films can be enjoyed simply because they're FUN to watch, even if sometimes they don't contemplate on deeply intellectual matters (which is not entirely true about QT's films). So if people can't just have pure FUN from watching a movie, then why bother?"

The plot itself is divided into chapters but not in chronological order similarly to Tarantino's other work, but this turns out to be far more effective than i thought it would be. <br/><br/>The characters themselves are given enough depth to them and the acting is fine, Uma Thurman delivers a great and beliveable performance. The cinematography is beautiful and amazingly done, the music its a league in itself, Tarantino perfectly knows how to use music in his films effectively, but best of all this is a highly entertaining movie.

","Just a good martial arts flick.  Don't expect anything from the plot.  The writing is weak as well, there are some really BAD lines.  Many of worst lines are in the conversation between Uma and Vivica in the kitchen near the beginning of the movie.  But this is topped later on by the WORST line of the movie: ""Silly rabbit, tricks are for kids.""  What compelled Quentin Tarantino to include this stupid stupid reference form the Trix kids' cereal, I have no idea.<br/><br/>There are some funny parts though, like when there are about 100 men lying in blood in the restaurant/club/bar near the end, and they are moaning and rolling around.  But there are stupid parts as well, like when those three guys with swords come running down the stairs at Uma, and then time she spanks the little boy with her sword.  The trouble with this movie is that it doesn't know if it wants to be realistic or cheesy.  It flip flops back and forth, which makes all the cheesy parts annoying.  Typical QT type movie though, either you like it or you don't in my opinion.<br/><br/>Overall though I enjoyed the action and it was a generally entertaining movie, but because of the reasons above, I give it a 7/10."

I really didn't expect to like it as friends had informed me it didn't have much of a plot and there's lots of plot holes (how did she recover so quickly, where did she get money and passports, etc.), but as someone pointed out to me, it's got more than enough style to make up for these things. It looks and sounds beautiful. For those that say it's stupid and ridiculous, they're forgetting THAT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT! Granted, the plot is very simple and riddled with plot-holes, but as I said that seems to be the whole point. Tarrantino deliberately filled the movie with plot-holes and mistakes ... or so he claims. This is normally not the type of movie I would like, but I simply LOVED everything about it! A bloody, seductive carnage, and bloody entertaining to boot! Go Q & U!<br/><br/>My favourite parts include the animated sequence with Lucy Liu's character as a young girl, Uma taking on 88 combats in the House of Blue Leaves (easily beats The Matrix Reloaded with Keanu and the 100 Agent Smiths), the tasteful black & white/silhouette scenes that help increase the gore impact, and the samurai holders on the airplane!

"gabehabash","8","0","1","26 November 2003"," The Best Film of the Decade to Date
","With trash like ""Cat In The Hat"" and ""Legally Blonde 2"" being released left and  right, it's nice to know that filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino still make movies  because they love film, not for the money they can make.  That being said, ""Kill  Bill: Volume I"" is the best film of the last four years, and when combined with the  soon-to-be-released ""Volume II"", the two will likely be a four hour masterpiece.   Though not better than Tarantino's previous work on its own, ""Kill Bill: Volume I""  accomplishes more before the opening credits than other brainless sequels produce after the end credits.  Other than having flawless direction (especially in  the House of Blue Leaves sequence) and wonderful pacing, the film's music is stellar. Tomoyasu Hotei, Santa Esmerelda, Nancy Sinatra, and most importantly  Ennio Morricone create a perfect atmosphere for each of their own scenes.  The next opportunity you have to see this wonderful film, do not pass it up to see  anything else, unless, of course, the other choice is ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir  Dogs."""

From frame one I was really flabbergasted. The ""Shaw scope"" trailer was funny, but the First few minutes of the movie were amazing. The black & white scene with mostly the look in the eyes of Uma followed by the opening credits accompanied by the wonderful song by Nancy Sinatra (Shivers down my spine!).<br/><br/>I will probably talk more about this movie on another time and date, when i see it again...but know I will end this comment with something that i noticed in some other reviews:<br/><br/>Some people complained about things that they found not plausible. Things like: ""the blood escaped from the body like it was a fountain"" or ""How was Uma able to take a Samurai sword on an airplane?""<br/><br/>For those people I have some advice: This thing called Kill Bill that you have witnessed is called a ""movie""...... Most movies, and most certainly this one, are a product of the imagination of someone and do not happen in real life....

","Sometimes people need to have a certain kind of mindset before going to see a movie at the theatre, for example: - Leave your brain at the door when you go see ""ELF"" with Will Ferrel. - When seeing a romance, don't be mad if it has an obvious ending. - If you go see a horror movie, DO NOT worry about getting freaked out, even if you're there on a first date.<br/><br/>In general, allow yourself to enjoy the movie no matter what genre it is you paid to see. Besides, if you already paid for it, you might as well enjoy it.<br/><br/>That being said, a person will most enjoy ""Kill Bill"" if they watch the flick with an open mind.<br/><br/>First of all, it is not a typical film. If you are even remotely familiar with Tarentino's work then that should not suprise you. Kill Bill is a very unique take on the kung-fu fighting movies of old.<br/><br/>What one might first notice is the oddball plot manipulations. Well, like I said, Tarentino has his ways. What remains salient is keeping an open mind and letting yourself enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Tarentino employs a very distinctive technique with his story-telling. Everything comes together to create an extremely vivid, lush, and highly exciting movie with very intriguing characters.<br/><br/>Two scences that seem to stick out in my mind: 1. When O-Ren Ishii and her gang walk down the hallway, all decked out, with that killer soundtrack playing in the background. What style! Oh my! 2. Again with O-Ren Ishii, this time in the winter garden. The backdrop of the scene is magnificent! The japenese garden, with its soft whites and blues set up the last fight scene nicely. The scene really takes off as O-Ren Ishii slips off her slippers and the music starts playing. Another brilliant track.<br/><br/>One thing is consistent with most brilliant directors, their use of every technique at their disposal. Kubrick attained fame with his notorious manipulation of very distinct filming techniques, and every famous scene of his masterpiece's will stand witness. Same with Coppola, and the other greats.<br/><br/>In Kill Bill, tarentino uses intricate plot, vivid character development, use of japenese anime, various cutting edge special effects, a brilliant soundtrack and plain old good story telling. He is at, or nearing his peak. enjoy"

","As I watched the opening credits and the beginning of this movie, I wondered what to expect.

Within about 5 minutes of watching the movie I immediately felt the same energy that I felt when I originally watched Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. This is Tarantino at his finest. In fact, he was totally unrestrained. This situations and content in this movie are brutally gritty at times, yet presented in such a way that I found myself chuckling throughout.<br/><br/>I think one of Tarantino's most unique talents is being able to tell a story by skipping back and forth through different parts of the timeline. I can't imagine this story being told any other way. The camera techniques were incredible, the performances were incredible, the editing is incredible and the blood and gore is extremely entertaining. This is an instant classic.

There was another sitting next to her also with a samurai sword. Howabout the fight sequence between Vernita Green (Copperhead).. stopping for coffee .. hilarious.!

","Oh my God, what is it with you people? EMBARRASSING is the right word for most of the reactions to tarantino's new movie, which was boring and lame for almost the entire 111 minutes, not moving. Commentators felt compelled to compare it to Matrix for absurd reasons but they were right in that both movies are equally overrated and hyped. (I AM talking about the first of the trilogy, never saw the sequels because number one clearly explained that all there was going to come up was even more silly coats, sunglasses and a trigger-happy karate kid saving the REAL world, reloaded bullshit ha ha!)<br/><br/>Now tarantino did produce some decent moments of film, and of course he recycled some of his better ideas in kill bill (the res. doggish `I shoulda been black mamba', the pulpish biblical revenge prattle etc.) As for the talk of kill bill being a movie about movies it has to be said once and for all that even the lamest okami or zatoichi flick is more entertaining and exciting than this. One major problem of the movie of course was Uma, whom some people may like as an actor and whom quentin evidently is very fond of, but who simply can't deliver one single move or even glance in a convincing fashion. I am not even talking about the admittedly difficult iaido-work (every single opponent our heroine engaged looked better with the sword than she did), I am talking about those badly performed justin timberlake jumps and the fact that two months in the gym might have done her some good. The monty pythonesque kitchen fight in the beginning was nothing but an eye-roller, but that was true for most of the movie. My aunt Jemima would have done a better job with the help of some computer work and a baggy bruce lee costume, that's for sure. The sound engineers tried to make up for the lack of verve with loads of noises, but hey, who is afraid of dinosaurs that roar like Kellogg's lions? The music doesn't deserve any comments, anybody who didn't expect spanish tunes or at least Andean pan-pipes in the final snow-covered japanese garden scene (well, it didn't look like snow to me, actually) hadn't understood quentin's rather half-assed post-modern gimmickry. There were some remarkable moments in the movie, though, the animation sequence was perfect and should have set the pace for the movie, but it didn't. It was intense and it revealed all the things kill bill was not. The barefoot band was awesome, but where were they when things got interesting? Gone, like every hope mr. TIMBERTINO (or mr. Brown) could pull this off."

","Good opening, and fab soundtrack from the start. Although I thought the non-chronological ordering was unnecessary to some extent. Good strong theme (revenge). I began to waiver between like/dislike during the animation. To me it smacked of 'ran out of time and money' or 'couldn't be bothered any more' although I'm perfectly sure that this was not the case. I also thought that the fight between The Bride and the Crazy 88 was overlong, verging on becoming boring, and I did begin to wish that someone would just shoot her, and wondered why no-one did? Having said all that, I just loved the gratuitous violence! The limb-chopping and blood spurting were terrific. And the culmination of the fight between The Bride and O-ren was one scene that will stay with me for a very long time. Truly inspired!

First, the music: QT has an uncanny ability to bring a smile to your face (or make you cringe in the case of Reservior Dogs) simply by the music he chooses.  I don't know how he does it, but it's always *just* *right*.  From the opening credits of Pulp Fiction (with the changing of the radio stations) to the Nancy Sinatra tune and Mexi-Japanese songs in Kill Bill, it helps to create a memorable experience.  Second, the non-linear storyline.  While it's not used quite as effectively as Pulp Fiction, it's still effortless and entertaining.  I mean really, there's not much of a plot here, so it adds some interest, but the story is kind of besides the point.  It's a tribute to the genre with the QT spin on it.  Can't wait for Vol. 2."
"jonothanwarriorpoet","9","0","1","17 November 2003"," Best at what it does
","The most important fact to keep in mind about this movie is that it is exactly what it is and makes no pretense to be anything else.  If you are looking for deep philosophy or drama, you are looking for a different movie. Kill Bill Vol.1 aims to be an action filled story of vengeance and mayhem. The actors (or in most cases actresses) are wonderful in their performances. Yes, some of the dialog seems awkward, but it is not written as realistic dialog, it is written for this movie, which is not realistic either. These characters talk as the stereotypes they portray - the honorable vengeful hero, the female blacksploitation action hero, and the lord of the Japanese Underworld.  Tarantino deserves props for this highly stylized piece. Not to mention, it is nice to see some American Actresses really stepping up to the plate in an action film, for once without the previous notions of them needing to be sexy or alluring.  All three of the fighting women in this piece hold their own and get down and dirty.  Finally, there is only one thing to do, sit back and hope that he can deliver on the sequel.  9/10 stars"

"saffell","7","0","1","17 November 2003"," I think it's a damn good flick.
","Don't read this if you don't want the plot spoiled a little bit.<br/><br/>Well, it's definitely Tarantino. And as it goes I also think it's a little too ""stylized"" in the words of my roommate. The bloody action scenes are a cross between old school kung fu films like ""Riki-Oh: The Story of Ricky"" and Monty Python. In essence, I think it was overdone in some places ... an attempt to make the film too campy. It was obvious the director (Tarantino) was striving to achieve the campiness of originals.<br/><br/>Also, that whole thing about the coma-raping and Buck - unnecessary. Albeit, it does explain how she got out of the hospital and overcame atrophy, but that could have been done in dozens of other ways without such gratuitous sex-and-violence nonsense. And if I thought it was excessive (and I don't mind the intestine scenes in any of the kung fu films I've seen), then I can only imagine what other folks thought ... especially the Italians I was with in Firenze who don't mind all-out sex scenes, but edit the least bit of blood from everything.<br/><br/>However, this didn't mar the cinematography or story. I came away knowing I had seen a movie, and, even if I never suspended disbelief enough to fully lose myself in The Bride's suffering or whatever, I did enjoy a great revenge story. Plus, it had all the classics: the one man (or woman) army against incredible odds, the sword-blade reflection shot, the ridiculous Asian weaponry (the chain-ball-sickle minus the sickle that Go Go Yubari had), and that shot of Uma from underneath the glass dance floor was cool, too.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie was a great time and I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks that they can stomach it. It's well done and enjoyable, so go see it or if that's not an option, at least rent it when it comes out on DVD or video."

","Ok I admit I had my reservations about Kill Bill. Being an avid fan of Quentin's previous film, this movie seemed to me like it was gona be below par. But everyone says that. And when they see it, their hypothesis dont ring true. What Kill Bill is, is a masterpiece. At first it seems its all style over content, but i think the content is excellent too, thin and patchy maybe, but still excellent. The film contains several moments of powerful emotion, such as when thurman's bride realises she has 'lost' her baby after waking from her coma, or the final showdown between her and o-ren, that was hard to watch. You have these two women who you presume hate each other, but theres also a respect there which makes it just that little bit hard fro them to except that they have to kill one another. Ok i know that basically this film is fun, and most emotion plays second fiddle to the action, but, its still there.<br/><br/>The violence level is high, its one of the most violent films ive seen, but it seems strange to say, but lots of the violence is, well, beautiful. Perhaps its the fact that lots of it is commited by women, something we are not used to seeing. And im not saying that because they are women, the violence isnt as genuine or powerful, but theres just something there that you dont generally see in movies when two guys fight, not in western movies anyway. Uma Therman and Lucy Lui especially, possess a grace and dignity that pervades through their violence.<br/><br/>Basically this film is fun, escapism. But that doesnt mean that it has to be emotionally sterile. it oozes emotion. violence is the brides emotion. roll on volume 2."

"Al_James","10","0","1","13 November 2003"," Arguably Tarantino's best, certainly THE best film of the year so far.
","A long time ago, in a cinema far, far away I saw a film called Pulp Fiction. Dripping with pop culture references, littered with quotable but more importantly, accessible dialogue and smothered in 'can't laugh will laugh' violence, it was the best film I had ever seen.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is NOT Pulp Fiction, but it is a descendant of all that Pulp Fiction stands for. And in my opinion Kill Bill is best used as an indication of how perfect a film maker Tarantino will become.<br/><br/>I won't bother with the plot, although important and omnipresent during the viewing of this first of the two volumes of Kill Bill, I always subconsciously held the premise that any questions would be answered in Volume Two. And what freedom that gave me to sit back and enjoy a craftsman so aptly and ably applying his tools. Tarantino IS the whole reason I hear media students arguing out style over content issues and never really answering them.<br/><br/>Shot in so many varied styles, you could be watching five different films from five different cultures - most noticeably the cross-referencing from Eastern and Western cinema (including a breath taking anime sequence) which is so seemless that Kurisowa might well have shot certain sequences with Bruce Lee flapping around as stunt co-ordinator - Tarantino repeatedly bombards his now devoted audience with aesthetic and aural set-pieces that look like they'll spiral off screen, but are executed with such control that they become perfection. From the first smashing domestic rumble to the blue lit silhouette sword fight, your pupils will dilate, and your eardrums will vibrate.<br/><br/>Ever present are the in-jokes (SPOILER* Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) concealing a pistol in a cereal box with KABOOM written on the side, before attempting to KABOOM Uma Thurman into next week), and although dialogue may not be as sharp or as memorable as the rest of his cannon, Tarantino keeps the script succint and to the point, never losing sight of the fact that this story is about revenge. And when revengins being done, there's not much time for discussions about Big Macs.<br/><br/>I might have made them up, but I felt so many connections between this film and Pulp Fiction that I almost linked their stories together. There are the inconspicuous references (the close-ups on the Pussy Wagon keys, Uma drawing out an imaginary square to Vivica Fox) but my main question was are the 'Deadly Viper Assasination Squad' in anyway related to 'The Fox Force Five' that Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) mentions in Pulp Fiction? In it she describes a black demolitions expert (Vivica A. Fox?), a Japanese swordstress (Lucy Liu?) and a French seductress spy (Julie Dreyfuss?). Maybe my mind played havoc, but it certainly adds another dimension to Tarantino's incredible movie intellect.<br/><br/>Does style dominate? Yes. But is content ever sacrificed? Hell no. My proof is that The Bride (Uma Thurman) is so filled with rage, bitterness and betrayal that I haven't met a person yet that didn't root for her. And character is what Tarantino's films are about.<br/><br/>As ever the music is perfect. When a track needs to fit, Tarantino will use it (Nancy Sinatra's 'Bang Bang' after Uma's skull crunching gunshot wound), but give him the freedom to apply music to a sequence with no musical boundaries, and he'll throw in a tune that opposes everything we see but still drags image and sound screaming and kicking together (the heightened strings in the anime sequence, just before the blood rains down).<br/><br/>In short see Kill Bill. See it for the soundtrack, the action (allegedly the whole film cost only 2/3 of The Matrix budget), the central FEMALE character (Thurman's performance is unbelievable considering her alluring, free-spirited turn in Pulp Fiction), the pure education in global cinema, but see it most of all so that you can remember just how good you had Tarantino mapped out to be. He's getting even better, soon enough every director from Woo to Scorsese will be shaking in his boots.<br/><br/>And if you can get Bernard Hermann's 'Twisted Nerve' (from Daryl Hannah's introduction sequence) out of your mind, I'll give you a tenner."

I urged them to sit through it, and when they did, they saw the best swordfight ever.<br/><br/>The homages to Oriental cinema are thousandfold...The Bride wears Bruce Lee's jumpsuit from Game of Death, Go Go Yubari (the acress that portrays her) was in Battle Royale, Sonny Chiba needs no introduction, and neither does Lucy Liu.<br/><br/>The movie is style, style, style, from the arrival to Tokyo, to the conversation with Hattori Hanzo, to the acrobatic and relentless carnage of the House of Blue Leaves, to The Bride's duel with O-Ren Ishii.<br/><br/>Even the minor actors had their own (sometimes smarmy) style. Darryl Hannah as Elle Driver was coldly psychotic, and David Carradine was convincing as Bill.<br/><br/>Simply put, to those who complain there is no plot, the plot is one word:<br/><br/>REVENGE.<br/><br/>The Bride wants it for what happened to her, her husband, her child, her friends at the wedding, and she exacts it in spades. The swordfight sequence in the House of Blue Leaves simply eclipses ANY action sequence in recent memory.<br/><br/>The movie is pure gold. Grab some while you can.<br/><br/>10/10"

After lying in a coma for four years, Thurman returns to exact revenge on those that were involved. The revenge trip takes her to Okinawa and Tokyo, Japan. At its best, this mind-blowing extravaganza is a razor-sharp homage to Japanese and Chinese action cinema (parts were filmed in the Shaw Brothers studios); at it worst, it's a drawn-out, nearly plotless indulgence. Also, too many questions are left unanswered. Film comes to (bloody) life in final action set-piece in the `House of Blue Leaves'.

","After witnessing a brutal third film by Quentin Tarantino (JACKIE BROWN), I went into KILL BILL with little expectations. Due to the fact that QT made two brilliant films to start his career, I was so psyched up for JACKIE BROWN. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. Even great actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Robert DeNiro couldn't save it. I also questioned why Miramax would spilt KILL BILL into two parts instead of making one film. Well folks, my father always said money talks and bulls**t walks.<br/><br/>QT is back in full force, directing a film that is right up there with RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION. The film opens with a quote from STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN that says `Revenge is a dish that is best served cold.' Revenge is the main theme in this movie, just as honor is one of the central themes in RESERVOIR DOGS and redemption is the main theme of PULP FICTION. <br/><br/>Basic synopsis (MINOR SPOLIERS) --- the Bride (Uma Thurman looking hotter than ever) is left for dead on her wedding day. We don't see the full attack take place, just bits and pieces. She awakes from a four year coma and vows revenge on her attackers. <br/><br/>Just to warn everyone, this is one of the most goriest movies I have ever seen in a long time. If you can't stand the sight of blood squirting and dismemberment, this may not be the movie for you. Limbs and heads are disappearing faster than food on a plate of a person that hasn't eaten for days.  Multiple deaths in this one, compared to very few in PULP FICTION. The scene where Uma fights all of Lucy Liu's army is one of the best action sequences I've seen since Keanau Reeves fought the Smith clones in THE MATRIX RELOADED. <br/><br/>With KILL BILL, Quentin Tarantino again proves what a skilled and gifted writer he is. It leaves with a startling revelation at the end, making us wait until February 2004 to see what goes down. I noticed quite a lot of PULP FICTION references in this one. When Uma draws the square in the air, I laughed. Unfortunately, my girlfriend has never seen PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOGS. She did enjoy this movie though, just as I did. Welcome back, Quentin.

","It's been a fair while since a Quinten Tarantino movie. Famous for the groundbreaking Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, Tarantino later created Jackie Brown to mixed reviews. Kill Bill Vol. 1 is his first major release since then, and it manages to to be as fresh as his earlier hits, as bloody as them, and as groundbreaking, in a sense.<br/><br/>It's simply a story of revenge, as Uma Thurman's character, whose name isn't revealed except 'Black Mantra', goes on a rampage to kill those responsible for ruining her wedding day by killing the entire congregation bar her, and for the loss of her child as she was pregnant at the same time. After a 4 year coma she's free to hunt the assassins down in vengeance.<br/><br/>It's never made clear, yet, who she is, why she's so proficient herself as an assassin, and why her wedding day was ruined.<br/><br/>The first volume, as it is a 2 parter, is simply about the first events.<br/><br/>The story is simple, but effective - and simultaneously rather strong, with very stylish direction, some original sequences such as anime, and plenty of action with visceral lashings of the red stuff. It *is* a bloody movie, but it's carried out in a comic book fashion so it never seems gory for the sake of it.<br/><br/>The acting, from Thurman, is exactly what it needs to be, and to be honest it's the same from everyone. It's supposed to be *slightly* corny and cheesy, given the comic-book theme.<br/><br/>The only real downside in this movie is the characterisation, or lack of. You don't really care about Thurman, or anyone else. I don't know if this is also intentional, but the movie draws no real emotive response from the viewer. You don't feel as involved as you perhaps should.<br/><br/>But in saying all that it's a fine piece of film-making and highly recommended."

","This is a well made movie (which is not necessarily the same thing as a good movie). In fact this movie is very well directed by Tarantino's usual iron hand in a succession of violent scenes some of them curiously impregnated by a poetical atmosphere revealed not only in the scenery that frames them but also by the excellent music and songs conveyed by the sound track which at times has moments of great lyricism. Most sequences pay visual tribute to Japanese cartoons and the movie contains itself some sequences made up actually by cartoons in that style. If we take for granted the usually unplausible scenes in this kind of movies (e. g. the heroin coming of a coma and recovering almost at once all her physical fighting strength) we'll appreciate the firm way by which this movie is made and will become fascinated by its exciting atmosphere. There is a small flaw in the plot consisting in the lack of a quite understandable explanation for the attempted killing of the heroin at her wedding ceremony as well as for the actual killing of all the other people there. Since she was herself a killer maybe it was a squaring of accounts within the gang. Anyway this detail is not very important. Well some people might say that this movie purports a lot of gratuitous violence. Yes this may be true but if we read the daily papers or watch TV news bulletins don't we hear about lots of this kind of violence performed everyday in real life? Hasn't someone already said that mankind is creating a society of monsters with its consumerist values? Do these movies impel people towards crime and violence more than society does or on the contrary they arouse in most people a strong aversion for violent behaviour? This is a vexed question for psychologists and sociologists to solve. Anyway personally I'm against all forms of violence and I never said this was or wasn't a good movie. But I reaffirm that in pure formal terms (disregarding its content) it's a well made movie. And one more remarkable feature: this is a feminist movie in a certain sense. In fact I can't remember seeing a violent movie where women's roles are so much more important than men's like in this one."

You've made your point, QT, so go easy on the cheesy Oriental cinema homages, would ya? Some of it simply made me cringe; the dialogue between Thurman and Vivica A Fox thuds like a severed head hitting the floor.<br/><br/>Tarantino has clearly made Kill Bill to amuse himself, and doesn't really give a flying foot massage whether he entertains his audience. It's certainly brash, bloody and different but love it or hate it, he's too cool (or so he thinks) to care.<br/><br/>I have a sneaking suspicion that Kill Bill was always intended to be released in two parts, with the 'last minute decision' to split a single movie being a savvy bit of marketing between himself and Miramax (who, as everyone knows, are particularly adept at that game).<br/><br/>Vol. 2 will determine whether I've been party to maverick moviemaking at its most audacious or just a director having a wonderful time with someone else's money."

","Some spoilers included<br/><br/>Revenge. It is the one-word summary of `Kill Bill.' The plot could not be more transparent with the main heroine periodically reaffirming the goal: to kill all the members of the DiVAS. Yet the plot's brazen simplicity becomes the skeleton for Tarantino to build on the muscle fibers of his home-made story-telling.<br/><br/>The first scene of the movie explicitly introduces the story's timeframe, the 60s or the 70s. The story itself does not flow seamlessly but assumes an anachronistic sequence. The time steps are range from few days of travel to a few years of coma. Since very early on, the viewer learns of the revenge as the fuel for Black Mamba's unstoppable rage. Tarantino's manipulation with the time sequence affords a graceful flow of the movie towards the first manifestation of the revenge as the fight  between Cottonmouth and Black Mamba which chronologically belongs to the beginning of the film. Alongside this adjusted timeframe the visual and cinematographic elements pick the pace as well with the final fight being the zenith of the first movie.<br/><br/>The visual effectiveness of `Kill Bill' is astounding throughout the film. Tarantino genius delivers the highly stylized violence with the backdrop of fluid atmosphere that seems to ooze from the screen and onto the minds of the viewers. Yet the rest of the movie fades away if compared with the Cottonmouth fight. Following the seemingly mundane and gory fight with the Cottonmouth's private army, the fight between Black mamba and Cottonmouth happens in another world. Cottonmouth's immaculately white kimono complements the tranquility of the snowed Japanese garden and the menacing snow clouds. Black Mamba's poisonous-yellow biker suite reaffirms her presence as a stark contrast and a deadly challenge to the Cottonmouth's home-world.  The battle, elegant with courtesy, is perfectly timed with only other mobile element of that particular set, the snow and the fountain water. With the color scheme and the choreography the battle seems more of a phenomenon of the natural forces rather than the action of human mind. Of course, Black Mamba prevails with a coup de grace worthy of the grand fight.<br/><br/>Once again Tarantino has shattered the stifling cinematographic limits of Hollywood. `Kill Bill' undoubtedly is another permanent milestone by Tarantino's genius in the history of  world cinema."

","Ok, it seems that a few people don't like the film because of the pointless violence and lack of a plot.  And sure, the plot is not Oscar-worthy and the violence is a little over the top (ok, a LOT over the top).  But the purpose of this movie is not to engage our spirits with the pain of love and the hope for a better tomorrow and all that other crap.  It's to have a good time in the movies.  The movie is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL (my three favorite scenes are the anime one, the go-go fight, and the shadow fighting scene). And the soundtrack ROCKS!  It's such a blast to listen to.

Basically, it is about a woman (Uma Thurman in an amazing performance) seeking revenge on the 5 people who tried to kill her on her wedding day (Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, ""Bill,"" Lucy Lui, and Vivica A.

","A beautiful pregnant woman, called The Bride (Uma Thurman), is going to marry, but a guy named Bill (David Carradine), puts an end to that. He and 4 other members of the DIVAS (Dealy Viper Assassination Squad) kill everybody on the wedding, but the Bride survives, and lies in a coma for 4 years. She wakes up, and decides to take revenge on the DIVAS and Bill. She was a former member of the DIVAS, what's in her advantage. She can track down O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), codename 'Cottonmouth', the most feared person of the DIVAS, and also Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), codename 'Copperhead'.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino promised Uma Thurman a movie like this, they discussed this on the set of 'Pulp Fiction' and this is the result, a real masterpiece. It begins with a simple plot, but it thickens by the minute. It's fun in the beginning, but it really gets more interesting by every second, and it's not easy to make a movie like that nowadays.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is one my favorite directors, because he can mix violence with humor very well. He's more known for his scenario's and again he made a very strong and terrific script. Even though he doesn't make a lot of movies, he really takes more time for making them than most directors do, that's why his movies are all great. He's so enthusiastic and puts much effort in his work and his pen and mind are one when it comes to writing scripts. He doesn't act much, but he's certainly not a bad actor. He grew up with movies and he still isn't tired of it. Another thing I like about him is that he gives actors, who are forgotten, a second chance. John Travolta is the biggest example, now David Carradine for Kill Bill. And he always gives winks to other movies, like the yellow suit that Uma Thurman wears in Kill Bill, it refers to Bruce Lee. His idea of using a Japanese animation images in Kill Bill, is really original even though it was really violent. And again this movie is not chronological, that's how we remember our little Quentin. He said in an article that the violence in his movies is unbearable, but that it really looks damn cool. Damn straight, Quentin.<br/><br/>The movie is very interesting and Uma Thurman is terrific as The Bride, she trained intensively for 3 months (and she had just given birth) and the result is a beautiful, dangerous woman in a tight yellow costume. The blood is all over the place, but that doesn't really matter. The sprinkles with original ideas, like the Japanese anime, the sound of the mosquito that goes around in the dolby surround system of the movie theater, the Pussy wagon. The movie consists of extremely cool fight scenes like the fight between The Bride and Gogo, and the crazy 88 and of course O-Ren Ishii in the House of the Blue Leaves, with beautiful Spanish flamenco music on the background. The music was also  nice through the whole movie, the scene of the House of the Blue Leaves in particular. The music is totally in contrast with the duel between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii, but that's the beauty of it, it makes the duel look more like a dance number, or a ceremony. But it's also a lesson for directors. Use music that lies parallel with the scene, or use music that is totally in contrast with the scene.<br/><br/>Through this whole experience of 111 minutes, I can only say that was FUN to watch, it's a masterpiece made by a genius and I can't wait for Kill Bill: Vol. 2. Keep up the good work, Quentin.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Wardlem","5","0","1","9 November 2003"," Is Tarantino losing his edge?
","A cocktail with too many ingredients<br/><br/>First of all this review contains SPOILERS. Ok? Right, let's move on..<br/><br/>I saw KBV1 last night, and I have to say I don't think it works as a contemporary piece of cinema.  Fans of this movie will almost certainly say the reason I don't like Tarantino's 4th film is because I don't get it. However, I'd argue those people who say they do get it, don't get why it fails.  But before anybody starts thinking, yeah but you've not seen this movie or that movie, let me give you an analogy.<br/><br/>You know how every so often games developers try to blend together several genres into one video game?  They'll take the platform action of Super Mario, the fighting of Tekken, the gun-play of Devil May Cry, and add the aerial combat of G-Police and the driving of Gran Turismo, then dress it up like a Star Trek game and attempt to give it the atmosphere of Resident Evil?  It doesn't work does it? For one reason or another it will fail; that's how I see Kill Bill.<br/><br/>The film hops from one style to another and doesn't settle down until the conclusion in the Blue Leaves restaurant, by which point the tension and mood built up at the very beginning of the movie has been evaporated by the lack of consistency.  It's a shame, because at first it does feel as distressing and unsettling as such legendary revenge movies as `I Spit on Your Grave' and `Bais-Moi'.<br/><br/>Tarantino is famous for jumbling up the sequence of events in his films, but unlike Pulp Fiction (in which the non-sequential story telling ultimately fits together like a jigsaw puzzle) Kill Bill feels like the back story is tacked on in a vain attempt to add depth to characters whose only aim is to kill or pervert others.  The result is that like a video game that tries to mimic several of its peers at once, the set pieces in Kill Bill feel disconnected from one another, and more like Tarantino was desperate to tip the wink at as many Hong Kong and Japanese classics as possible.  To have one piece of back story told in B&W, another in colour, and another as an anime means the movie feels like it has no identity.  However, it is possible to blend different cinematic styles and have it work.  The original `Matrix' for example managed to blend film noir with sci-fi, gun-play and kung-fu excellently, because each had its place and purpose in the story (shame the sequels failed to achieve this). In the end movie had its own identity, despite the fact that, like Kill Bill, its list of influences is as long as your arm.<br/><br/>However, Kill Bill's biggest failing is that by showing The Bride kill the second person on her death list first, then going back and spending the rest of the movie telling you about the assassination first person (Oren Ishii) means the latter half of the film has no dramatic impact.  Sure, you already know The Bride is going to survive the battle in the Blues Leaves restaurant because `Kill Bill Vol 2' is out in about six months, but to be shown a character is intact and no worse for wear BEFORE their big battle just means what's supposed to be the climax of a movie has no punch.  The positive conclusion outweighs the drama of the events leading up to it.  Why do you think sports fans don't like to hear the final score before they watch the match?  Because if you know how it's going to turn out the highs and lows of the event lose their impact.<br/><br/>The fight in the Blues Leaves wasn't all that interesting anyway.  Like the stupid fight scene in `Matrix Reloaded', where Neo fights scores of Agent Smith, seeing The Bride fight all eighty-eight members of the Crazy 88 isn't very interesting because the number of opponents makes the scene too cluttered.  The choreography might be superb, but there's too much going off for you to appreciate it.  The scene would have looked better and worked better psychologically if it had involved fewer opponents, people can imagine fighting off a dozen opponents at once, but not the better part of a hundred.  Check out the fight in the playground in Jackie Chan's `Police Story 2' if you want to see a fight with one-person-against-many done effectively.<br/><br/>**ENDING SPOILER** However I will be going to see Volume 2, but only because the cliff-hanger: the Bride's unborn daughter surviving her mother's coma. I have to say, though, even that's like something from Sunset Beach.  If Volume 1 hadn't ended with that revelation, something for the audience to wonder `What's the Bride going to do when she finds out about that', I'd have no interest in seeing part two at all.<br/><br/>In all honesty I think the best thing about the whole movie is the signature track, `Battle without Honour or Humanity' by Tomoyasu Hotei.<br/><br/>5/10"

Although on the surface a very simple story...it was nevertheless thouroughly entertaining and enjoyable.  To the point that you leave the cinema rooting for The Bride and her quest of vengeance. <br/><br/>
For me, though what really made the film was Tarrantino's flair for detail...which really created a unique character.  Aspects such as the array of sunglasses on the dashboard of the sherriff's car, the close-up of the mosquito sucking blood from The Bride and most effectively the solitary sound of the wooden water fountain during the final fight between The Bride and Oren Ishi.<br/><br/>The soundtrack as well really helps to add to the killer atmosphere.

"johnlgauci","Null","0","1","8 November 2003"," A killer film!
","This film was simply awesome. Tarantino succeeds in making every second of the film an experience in itself. Although ""Pulp Fiction"" remains my favourite Tarantino film, Kill Bill has managed to wedge itself between PF and ""Reservoir Dogs"" into the second place. However, who knows, maybe Volume 2 will change my opinion once again... Anyhow, Kill Bill is a cinematic festival embodying the Tarantinesque (or is it Quentinesque?) philosophy that on-screen violence is the ultimate aesthetical experience. Although being a high-budget movie, it still retained that subtle QT ironic and highly entertaining dialogue. As they say, two thumbs up! (I wish had more thumbs, though).<br/><br/>

","Tarantino hits back with a vengeance with perhaps the best action film of the year. Its hip, it's funny, it's stylish and lord does it kick your booty. Quentin has taken inspiration from Honk Kong movies of the seventies, mixed it with a funky soundtrack and has churned out something superbly entertaining and at times extremely gory. The film has the odd moments of trademark QT dialogue but this feels so different to his other films, it is a real departure.<br/><br/>The direction is stylish, Yuen Woo Ping's choreography is outstanding as usual and this is just a very entertaining Kung Fu movie, offering something different to the Matrix shenanigans which Kung-fusiasts have been dying for in Hollywood cinema with all the crappy Martial art turkeys like The Transporter and Romeo Must Die. Only Monsieur Jackie Chan has made enjoyable Martial Arts movies in Hollywood in recent years, good ones are few and far between with most choosing to copy the Matrix ahead of the real origins.<br/><br/>As with all of QT's films the movie boasts a superb cast. Firstly, Uma Thurman is excellent in her comeback, she has not done anything major since the stinker that was The Avengers.  She strikes back to the crown jewels with ferocity and karate kicks the face of the cinema going public as if to say `I'm back!' I soothed my groin with a bag of frozen peas and thought `You're so welcome Uma, you are so welcome!' When this film was first announced, aside from the feeling of excitement that had me and any movie enthusiast jumping with excitement, I couldn't help but think, Uma Thurman, all size 6, 8 stone of the lass, in a Kung Fu movie, with samurai swords and lord knows what else, all the fighting, all the stunt-work, wire work. Okay a little chauvinist  perhaps and then there's all the Charlie's Angels and the Matrix women kicking ass, would she be able, or would there be a bloke in an Uma wig jumping around the room and hacking off peoples arms. Boy were my mild doubts proved needless. I was with the audience in awe when you see her plain as day unleashing Kung Fu badness. Of course I did have a similar reaction to Keanu Reeves in The Matrix, the fact that the training beforehand and the fact he did most of the fighting himself made it altogether more enjoyable. Her performance is also top rate, holding the movie together. The rest of the cast are all very good too, with Lucy Liu, Darryl Hannah and the legendary David Carradine amongst others.<br/><br/>This movie is enjoyable, it seems very authentic, you really feel like your watching a film out of 1970's Hong Kong, and at times it is typically modern. The cinematography is crisp and striking, the score is authentic and pulsating. As per usual the soundtrack is great too. Overall a great flick, it may lack the intelligent scripting of QT's first two films but in terms of sheer escapism this is his best. ****1/2"
"TJC_will_Kill_Bill","10","0","1","7 November 2003"," comments on Kill Bill Vol1
","Hi everyone...heres my thoughts...hope you enjoy...<br/><br/>First off, WOW!!! How superb was the directing by the always-brilliant Quentin Tarantino? He shocked us with his brilliance with Reservoir Dogs, he proved his brilliance with Pulp Fiction, he continued his brilliance with Jackie Brown, and now he has gone to a new level with his brilliance with Kill Bill Vol 1.  His direction in the showdown that pits The Bride against Go-Go Yubari, the Crazy 88's and O-Ren Ishii was top-notch and a stand-out piece of direction.  The help Tarantino received from the outstanding Yuen Wo Ping was invaluable and can be seen throughout the fight sequences. However, there was one flaw that I noticed. How does the Bride miracously clean up her face after every fight?  Thankfully, this minor flaw can be overlooked and forgiven due to the awesome fight sequences that surrounded it.<br/><br/>In a role that Uma Thurman claimed to be impossible to play, she excelled beyond even the highest expectations to give a knock-out  performance as The Bride aka Black Mamba. In an up-and-down career, Uma has definitely hit a high point playing the revenge-seeking Bride.<br/><br/>Uma's performance was matched by all co-stars involved, including Lucy Liu as the violent Tokyo Crime Boss O-Ren Ishii, Vivica A Fox as the changed women Vernita Greene, and also the legendary Sonny Chiba as Hattori Hanzo. All these stars complimented Uma's performance to help this become an all-round superb movie.<br/><br/>Minor roles played by Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, Michael Madsen as Budd and the unseen David Carridine as Bill are agonising teasers that make you want to see more of these characters...but will  have to wait for the second volume to be released.<br/><br/>I must say I had my doubts before seeing the movie in concern with the anime sequence.  Although after seeing the film, I realise why Tarantino choose that style to tell the story of O-Ren Ishii's childhood.  Even though i have never been a fan of Japanese anime, this was one sequence i thouroughly enjoyed, and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked in the movie.<br/><br/>However, push aside the brilliant directing, push aside the great acting, push aside the awesome story, push aside the surprisingly entertaining anime sequence, and push aside the great fight sequences and visual wit, because it is the amazing soundtrack that truly makes this movie a groundbreaker. The awesome combination of old-school martial arts music and typical spaghetti western music is truly a delight to hear and enhances the movie to a level few movies can reach.<br/><br/>I cant wait for Kill Bill Vol 2 to hit Australian Theatres and hope it matches up to Vol 1.<br/><br/>'Movies- best thing in life' TJC"

It's hilarious throughout, has a great cast, and could be regarded as the first authentic live-action anime.

"bix171","9","0","1","6 November 2003"," A Welcome Return To Form
","Quentin Tarentino's insanely violent homage to exploitation cinema is, after the irrelevant, self-important `Jackie Brown', a welcome return to the filmmaking he does best (though he seems to be narrowing his audience to film school students and video store geeks). The first half features the shockingly graphic Americanized violence we've come to expect from him as he sets up a brutal fantasy about a woman (known as `The Bride' and played with relish by Uma Thurman) beaten and left for dead on her wedding day; after four years in a coma, she returns to exact her brutal revenge against her aggressors. In this first of two planned pictures, she battles two of the five (although, in typical Tarentino fashion, not chronologically). It's in the second half, where she travels to Japan to  commission a samurai sword from Hattori Hanzo (the legendary Sonny Chiba in a terrific performance) in order to confront O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), that the violence goes into overdrive, turning into a stylized chopsocky fever dream with each over-the-top situation outdoing the previous. (At one point, Thurman single-handedly takes on an army of nearly one hundred yakuza.) Though there's plenty of the sadistic misogyny that defines Tarentino as a cold-hearted egotist who seems immensely gratified seeing women tortured (you're reminded of his glee with his captive in `From Dusk Till Dawn'), there's also an overt desire to explain them--he gives each of the first part's major female characters the baggage that comes with being a woman. (Thurman grieves over the child she carried at the time of her attempted murder; Vivica A. Fox' young daughter interrupts their confrontation; and Liu's childhood character--in a chilling anime sequence--sees her parents slain and is a victim of pedophilia.) It's a bid for a pass that doesn't work: he can't help but dress up his observations with clever stylizations and he throws them into the mix as juicy tidbits merely to provoke discussion among his acolytes. Still, the film is great fun to watch, a nerd's passionate desire to regurgitate every exploitive action scene he's ever watched within the context of his art and surprisingly it comes off as sincere and reverent."

Fully packed with fun, I gave it 10/10.<br/><br/>BTW, I heard that Japanese edit is completely different from US edit.  I hope R1 DVD version (would be unrated) would provide US viewers the Japanese edit - from what I've heard Japanese edit has significant advantages.  I'm still wondering if I should buy R1 DVD or R2 DVD (or both)."
"voodoo4936","8","0","1","5 November 2003"," Stylish, energetic, and witty trash
","The first thing you need to know about Kill Bill is that it's about as far removed from Tarantino's classic Pulp Fiction as you can get. Tarantino's calling card - cool criminal types who kill casually and shoot the breeze about pop culture from this and many other decades - is absent. And thank God. Returning to that formula, used to lovely effect in Fiction and 1992's Reservoir Dogs (and aped by just about every subsequent crime movie since), would have provoked audible winces from Kill Bill's audience, who have been anxiously awaiting the director's followup to 1997's mildly received Jackie Brown.<br/><br/>No, Mr. Tarantino has tired of that one trick, and as such can't be called a pony. He's looking in other directions, inhaling every piece of cinematic candy he can find and sifting through it all to find suitable inspiration. In this case, the inspiration is the classic kung-fu ""chop-sockies"" of the 1970s. Kill Bill is littered with sly references to these cult flicks, so it's safe to say that those cultists will get slightly more out of Kill Bill than the average moviegoer. But that doesn't mean the average moviegoer won't have fun with this trash. Because make no mistake: Kill Bill is trash, in its purest and most exhilerating form. Tarantino borrows, recycles, and improves on old garbage and turns it into....well, new garbage. The result? A cult classic in the making, and a breath of much-needed fresh air in this season's stale movie environment.<br/><br/>The second thing you need to know about Kill Bill is that the pace never slows down. You know you're in for a treat when the first major fight scene takes place less than 5 minutes after the opening credits. After that, it's a high-octane ride as the Bride (Uma Thurman) tries to track down the b**tard who crashed her wedding, killed everyone in attendance (including the groom and her unborn baby), and shot her in the head. She survived, though, and newly equipped with a metal plate in her head (and one hell of a bad mood), the Bride is out to kill Bill. See, Bill is the leader of a top-secret group called the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DVAS - they're divas, get it?). The entire Squad, along with Bill, busted up the wedding for an as-yet-unknown reason (hopefully Volume 2 will fill that particular hole). So the Bride decides to kill all of the DVAS, along with Bill. In case you couldn't tell by now, Kill Bill has ""cult movie"" written all over it.<br/><br/>And what a cult movie! Tarantino fills Kill Bill with knowing nods to martial arts classics, and manages to fuse them with his own pop-punk, ultraviolent sensibilities. The gore in this movie is deliciously overdone - you can practically see the hose spouting blood out of the decapitated yakuza's head, and that's to say nothing of the anime section detailing the childhood of one of the DVAS, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). The final climactic fight scene, which takes place in a gorgeous Tokyo restaurant, has more eye-popping choreography and virtuosic camera work than you likely thought possible. The whole thing is like Crouching Tiger on acid, with Uma and co. brazenly flaunting the rules of gravity while showing off some of fight supervisor Yuen Wo-Ping's best work to date. Kill Bill's dialogue is shamelessly cheesy, its characters are cartoons, and it's all overseen by the faceless Bill (David Carradine, from TV's Kung Fu, natch), whose weapon of choice is a katana that closely mirrors the one that the Bride uses to exact her revenge. A retired swordmaker (who Makes One Last Blade After Swearing He'd Never Make Another Weapon Again, cough cough cheese cheese), a p**sed-off bartender's assistant, a necrophilic male nurse (he's Buck, and he's here to f*ck), Nancy Sinatra, and El Paso all make their way into the Kill Bill mix. But what's most interesting about Kill Bill's atmosphere is the East-meets-West sentiment. For every slo-mo katana attack, there's a gunshot from a six-shooter. For every Oriental flute solo, there's a harmonica lick. For every masked yakuza gangster, there's a deputy decked out in a cowboy hat and leather boots. It's as if Tarantino is subliminally trying to get us (the West) to connect with them (the East), two cultures legendarily incompatible.<br/><br/>As it turns out, they're quite compatible after all, as Kill Bill has huge appeal for both hardcore Bruce Lee fanatics and the average blood-and-guts-loving Joe Schmoe. Kill Bill is a bracing, thrilling piece of pop-culture junk that no one over the age of 18 should miss out on.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"DrBootleg","10","0","1","5 November 2003"," The film was Kill Bill, and this is my glowing review...
","From the moment it starts you can't help but feel that Quentin is back, with a vengeance. Every one of his films to date has been original in every way, and Kill Bill does not differ.<br/><br/>The story (don't worry - no spoilers), as you may already be aware is about an assassin (The Bride) who is taking revenge on her former colleagues for trying to kill her on her wedding day (as well as killing everyone else in the chapel).<br/><br/>The film is split in to 5 chapters, all of which are highly suspenseful, dramatic, and original. From the first chapter, where The Bride tries to take revenge on one of the other assassins, Vernita Green, QT shows that he is making his mark on the action film world. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed by Kung-Fu expert Master Wu-Ping (who also worked on the Matrix Trilogy).<br/><br/>The film is not bogged down by un-interesting dialogue (but name a Tarantino film that is), and each scene is even more thought-provoking and painstakingly original than the last. However, I would say that the film could be shortened in places, to sustain the momentum. In this respect, the film does sag round the edges slightly, but the painstaking originality of the plot and characters makes it unstoppably watchable.<br/><br/>The animé sequence in the middle is fantastic, and masterstroke by Tarantino, and shows he has, for want of a better word, the balls to go where other directors won't. I wonder how many Quentin wannabes will add a sly animé to their film after this?<br/><br/>The film culminates in one of the action sequences to end all action sequences. Forget whatever you've seen in the Matrix, including the Burly Brawl, The Car Chase and Superbrawl, The House of Blue Leaves will leave you pining for more. It has too much gore and sword action to shake a stick at, and leaves you with word pinging around your head - ""Woah!"".<br/><br/>
Overall, I cannot recommend Kill Bill Vol. 1 enough. It is *the* best film this year (apart from maybe Return of the King), and ends on the type of cliff-hanger that Matrix Reloaded strived for. However, I would say that it is extremely gory, and some viewers may be shocked.<br/><br/>A solid 9.5/10"
"bimetale","7","0","1","5 November 2003"," Not bad, but lacks a twist
","Tarantino has always been an eclectic filmmaker, lacing his pictures with overdoses of quotes from and references to the kind of stuff he used to watch when young, as well as during his job in a video rental. Each of his previous movies, however, was something more than just an amalgamate of classic style elements. Every one of the movies he was involved with up till now, the ones he directed himself as well as those he only scripted, had something more... to set them appart... Tarantino's movies were sophisticated, delicately balanced yet in your-face-exploding-powerfull coctails, and every good coctail has a *twist*. So did Tarantino's flicks until this one : it was the twist that made them totally original, ""Totally Tarantino (TM)"" so to speak. It's hard to describe what the Tarantino twist is about : it has to do with a combination of many elements - plot, dialogue, the way he directs his actors, portrayal of events.<br/><br/>An that is what ""Kill Bill"" lacks. Don't be misunderstanding me : I totally appreciate the amount of work Tarantino put in this one - which is to say : obviously A LOT. The fotography is quite perfect, in its dynamic as well as its static qualities. Sometimes the camera moves frenetically, sometimes it stays still and shows the full beauty of the battle choreography. Every time, it is well thought out : every move of the camera, every part of the scenery, every color, every piece of clothing worn by the actors - it all adds up to a painstakingly crafted visual masterpiece . The music, as allways, is the perfect accompanyment to each piece of imagery presented. Tarantino's direction is tight, effective and spotless. And still : there is something lacking. None of Tarantino's basic plotlines ever were anything new or original. Yet he did manage to present them as such. None of the Tarantino dialogues ever were high literature. Yet they lingered on in the collective cinematic  memory. None of the Tarantino's actors, except for Harvey Keitel, were really anything great (don't start me on Travolta, Jackson or Madsen please). Yet, Tarantino got way more out of them than they ever were worth. And that is what's lacking in KB : the dialogue seems bland, the plotting linear and featureless, the acting very well directed but without any real ""spunk"". ""Jackie Brown"" was already suffering from this effect, but it's only gotten worse with this next installment. Maybe Volume II will have more to say. Maybe he should have left it a single movie. I do think KB was better than JB, simply because I love the burlesque that drives this movie. But still : it lacks the twist.<br/><br/>I can't stop thinking Tarantino should also have directed all of those movie scripts that were eventually outsourced to people who simply couldn't create Tarantino's vision : ""Natural Born Killers"", ""True Romance"" and even ""From dusk till dawn"" would all have made better true Tarantino products than ""Kill Bill"". Final conclusion : go watch it for it's technical brilliance and the fun in finding and naming the movie and TV quotes, and hope that we get more *true* Tarantino goodness in chapter 2."
"chiehlilee","10","0","1","5 November 2003"," To better appreciate a movie is to understand the motivation and intent behind the movie
","For granted most people will sound their opinions from their own perspective and they have every right to, but to critic any art form without first trying to understand its motivation and intent is like a heterosexual man calling Michaelangelo's David a piece of crap simply because he doesn't like to look at another naked man.<br/><br/>Personally I enjoyed Kill Bill and I understand it's a controversial issue as to many great art works.  I do not believe QT intended this to be a serious movie.  I believe that QT used excessive blood as a dark humor and QT has been known for dark humors. (i.e. Reservoir Dog, Pulp Fiction...etc.) It is just pure campy fun at asian cult kung-fu movie's expense.<br/><br/>Being Chinese and growing up watching Kung Fu movies, I have my share of its influences.  I find Kill Bill entertaining because never for one minute I took it to be a serous Kung Fu movie.  Like one of the other commenter mentioned, if I'm looking for a serious Kung Fu movie, why would I even chose one shot by an American?<br/><br/>There is no purpose for the excessive violence and bloodiness in Kill Bill other than pure campy fun.  As another commenter pointed out, if you want a movie with purposeful violence and bloodiness, rent Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is not a masterpiece in the ""Gone with the Wind"" sense.  It's a masterpiece in that it's the first movie of its kind in the American mainstream.  It's not intended to be a serious Kung Fu movie, if you want that, go rent Lee Ang's Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  It's not a real campy Chinese/Japanese Kung Fu/Samuri movie, if you want that, go rent East the Invincible or White Hair Bride.  It's strength does not lie in its plot or character development, if that's what you are looking for, I can give you a whole bunch of other suggestions such as ""The Others"".  It's strength is it's simplicity, it's excessive violence, it's bloodiness all wrapped in a nice package and get away with it by been shown in large theatres across the nation.<br/><br/>I find that disappoints from movie watching experience usually rises from mis-matched expectations.  If you expect Kill Bill to be anything other than what it is intended to be, you will definitely be disappointed.  But then it would be your personal bias, not because the movie has faltered to be what it is intended to be.  So maybe try to cast your own expectations aside, try to understand the intention of the movie itself first and then watch the movie, perhaps you'll finally be able to appreciate the movie for what it is."

","Another entry to the 'you will either love it or hate it' genre.

I've laughed at some of these reviews where people are saying how this is the worst film of all-time, etc.  People, please pay attention here.  Tarantino intentionally made this film exactly how he wanted to.  It's a tribute to virtually every karate, action, drama, adventure film (or tv show) he ever liked.  Yes, it does have the feel of a 70's B-movie at times.  Yes, it does not exactly flow in a straight-forward fashion (as many of these reviewers would apparently like all of their movies to go).  And yes, some of the action/violence is extreme and implausible, BUT THIS IS BECAUSE HE WANTED IT THAT WAY.  If you have ever seen any of the films referenced in this one (click on the 'movie connections' link here on the imdb site for ""Kill Bill""), then you might have a different way of looking at this movie.

","In terms of moral and social comment Kill Bill is about as unedifying as a movie gets. but, and let me make this quite clear, who the hell walks into a QT movie expecting to learn? not me. i went to marvel, at the coolness, the artistry and yes, the fake blood. tons of it rain down as The Bride carves a trail of vengeance back to the shadowy Bill.<br/><br/>QT follows the physics of a revenge movie perfectly, given ample opportunity to gain the upper hand by stealth The Bride literally goes out on a limb to inform bill that she is coming for him. Bill for his part really should have finished her off by now so he will only have himself to blame come the finish. but these samurai are not permitted an easy kill, first they must dance, and the dance is where this film is pure unadulterated Tarantino. Light, music and dazzling camera combine to pull you into the action as O'Rens Crazy 88 kato clones confidently step forward one by one to be slain. I got the impression that O'Ren wouldn't have sent them in if the had any chance of killing The Bride. and the O'Ren revenge itself is a tableau in snow to contrast perfectly with the inevitable blood spill.<br/><br/>While watching The Bride will herself to wiggle her toes she reminded me of Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction. didn't Mia once do a pilot for ""Fox Force Five"", maybe someone watched the pilot and offered her a starring roll in a revenge flick. The familiarity of the characters new and old, their connection to the QT universe is a Tarantino trade mark.<br/><br/>Somebody, some time ago said something like we should stop trying to find a meaning or purpose to art but to enjoy it for what it is.

"flixking","Null","0","1","2 November 2003"," Uma Thurman plays a vengeful Samurai in Quentin's Latest
","KILL BILL - Volume One<br/><br/>Uma Thurman teams again with Quentin Tarentino in this ultra violent tale of revenge and survival. Thurman plays an assassin that was betrayed on her wedding day by her cohorts who executed the entire wedding party. Thurman was beaten, shot and left for dead, she survived and began enacting revenge on each of her former partners ( THE DEADLY VIPER ASSASSINS) The Assassins include Vivica Fox, Lucy Liu and Michael Madsen with David Carradine showing up to play their boss BILL. Other notable characters in the film include BUCK a hospital orderly that is well...disgusting and GOGO, a pubescent female bodyguard dressed like a Catholic School girl. Remember this is a Tarentino film, a good one too.<br/><br/>In the hands of almost anyone else on the planet this would be a run of the mill story with run of the mill action sequences and shoot outs. Tarentino however turns this story into a homage to Samurai Assassins, 1970's karate movie and  legendary Japanese film maker  Akiro Kurosawa. ( It was Kurosawa's ""THE HIDDEN FORTRESS"" that was the basis for ""STAR WARS"")  With his tongue planted firmly in his cheek  Tarentino has created another stylish and daring movie that audiences will either love or hate, not many people will say ""oh, its ok..."" they will either love it or hate it, no room left for waffling. Tarentino is like that kid you grew up with that was always in fourth gear and over the top, now he has a few million dollars to put those thoughts on the big screen. Again you either love it or hate it. Two people got up and left the theater  in disgust during one of the fight scenes and others while the majority of the audience (including me) were laughing...go figure.<br/><br/>As far as the movie itself goes it is hard to describe the effect of seeing it on the screen. It's part black and white, part animation, part subtitled and non apologetic for any of it. It's loud brash and bold with an A+ performance by Thurman, she plays her part with convincing attitude and swagger and doesn't give a hint of vulnerability. I'm not sure if this was done on purpose but the effect is great. The long drawn out final sequence ( with Thurman in a yellow jump suit...sound familiar Bruce Lee fans?) is worth the price of admission and feels like an entire movie in itself and is artfully disturbing to say the least. There are plenty of gross outs in the film and those with weak stomachs might want to stay away, as stylish and intentionally corny as some of it is, if dismemberment isn't your thing you might get grossed out. I have to admit I cant wait to see the next volume due out in February so all the questions that are left at the end can be answered and there are plenty of questions. Some of which will never be answered, like why they beeped out the name of one of the main characters and how each assassin got their nicknames...we can discuss that after you see it, it will make better sense then.<br/><br/>Bottom line...if you like Tarentino OR want to have fun go see it. If  you don't like Tarentino and want to have fun anyway check out PIRATE S OF THE CARIBBEAN with everyone else.<br/><br/>Kurt"

That certainly isn't the case here. Tarantino has done it again! I don't know exactly what it is, but the older I get (I just turned 60) the more I enjoy Tarantino's warped and twisted mind! I used to think that David Lynch and Steven King were twisted, but they don't hold a candle to Quinton Tarantino! I imagine a lot of viewers would find the overabundance of blood spray to be a turn off, but I caught myself laughing several times during the goriest of scenes. I think that was because the scenes were so far out and implausible, you know they aren't real, and could never happen that way in real life. At least that's how I justify my reactions. Una and Lucy were superb. Even Daryl Hannah did a wonderful job in her role. She just gets better with age! I can't wait for Volume II to hit the screen. It's definitely on my ""must see"" list!

"andy_ferris40","8","0","1","2 November 2003"," Violence violence violence, oh....and a story.
","I have given away the main feature of this film in the summary - violence. Ok, other Tarantino movies have been violent, and it would be naive to expect this latest offering to be as violence-free as a PG-rated cartoon flick, but it should not be the lasting memory of the movie. Perhaps i am missing the point of this movie, perhaps i was missing something - the plot seemed to be a simple case of revenge. Revenge exacted in a japanese style, which was reflected in the samurai sword massacreing of so many people. The effects are impressive - the anime sections are particularly well done, it really manages to make you move the emotions and make you cringe at the violence, which is impressive for what is essentially a cartoon section. The music, a vital part to most good movies, really makes this film for me - it is what makes it Tarantino. The music, mixing the old western stand-offs with the modern, makes up for the lack of really great lines - there were good ones, but no quotes of Pulp Fiction proportions. The lead role played by Uma Thurman could not have been played by anyone else - she is simply superb in the role, and Lucy Liu is impressive as a homicidal japanase-chinese-american samurai-sword-wielding mafia-esque leader. So was this a good movie?? Yes. It had essentially a plot which kept you interested, to the extent that i'm now eager to watch the second volume, and some great acting performances from the leads, with a fairly original section of anime (the crouching tiger hidden dragon moments weren't so impressive, for the obvious reason that they are now old-news). So why the emphasis on violence?? Ok, films are more violent these days, and this film to some extents needed to be this violent to succeed, otherwise this would be a fairly average film - the only problem i have with the level of violence is the way viewers seem to get de-sensitised to it, and even find it funny. I myself found it funny by the end. I just hope that there aren't people watching this movie and seeing that it makes people laugh who then decide to make their own comedy with their own violence. With more violence in movies comes the trust that people should be allowed to watch what they like, rather than censoring in case a few take it the wrong way and decide to imitate. Great film for the lads and gory-hunters, just don't take anyone with a weak stomach! I gave it 8 out of 10."

Tarantino has always had the gift to give the last little tweak to a movie, which makes it absolutely brilliant. What really marks this movie is also the perfect choice of underlying music, which makes those battle scenes, and the whole movie epic.

","This is the first Tarantino disappointment. After the brilliance of the excellent 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Jackie Brown', all pretty much instant classics, this seems like a backward step for the director. It seems more like the sort of movie he should have made as his first or second movie, not his fourth.<br/><br/>The storytelling is what's at fault here. It is told in a too straightforward and simplistic style and the pacing is way off for this first part. It is full of pauses and the dialogue is only regular action movie dialogue not Tarantino dialogue, so the fans of his dialogue may wish to skip this one. I do feel that the movie could have all been fitted into one 2-½ hour film if it had tighter editing. Harvey Weinstein's advice to Tarantino not to cut anything smacks more of a money-making ploy than a way to tell the story in a more efficient way. <br/><br/>The acting is generally good but tends to veer unpredictably between convincing and a hammy.<br/><br/>The action is top notch however and Tarantino is on top form in his first movie as an action director, although we are definitely in over the top movie land territory towards the end!<br/><br/>One element the movie does not lack however is style, the blending of the manga anime with the live action works well and Uma does look great in those leathers!<br/><br/>Highlights of the movie include the Sonny Chiba segment and the very amusing scene around the council table in Tokyo that's not for the squeamish!<br/><br/>By the way, if you are squeamish I would advise you either to skip the movie or to not eat before you see it.<br/><br/>Overall this is Tarantino's darkest movie yet and it certainly has an oppressive atmosphere but it is certainly no classic.

I enjoyed the first movie and thought that Tarantino did a great job in pulling off mixing the different genres together. And I happened to read a previous comment when the person criticized Tarantino for adding a satyrical or comedic effect to his movies. If we think real hard as movie fans we can all think of some great genius who was a director that basically made the hidden satire effect famous, That man is Brian De Palma one of the greatest directors of all time.

"specialshake","6","0","1","2 November 2003"," ok overall, but disappointing for Tarantino
","Let me start by saying this film was entertaining to watch.  I must say I felt an overwhelming sense of disappointment compared with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  First off, he greets the viewer with the announcement in the opening credits that this is fourth movie.  Well Whoopty-Frickin' Doo! Lets just have a parade for Quentin.  We are all so very proud of you.  The writing was disappointing in that I found it bland.  This isn't Speed- a movie like this must use the script to capture and hold the viewer.  At times got the sense it was trying to hard, much as in the second Matrix movie when every line has laced with fancy syntax.  Second: some of the special effects were distracting.  Everytime someone loses a limb (which happens many times), a virtual ""Old Faithful"" geyser of blood spouts forth. Funny the first time, but old by the tenth.  Third: Plot holier than the Pope.  Maybe they plan on finishing this in Kill Bill Vol 2: The Search for More Money (Credit to Mel Brooks).  You never really find out how Uma gets to be on her quest- other than the last fifteen minutes prior to her assassination attempt.  They spend too much time developing relatively unimportant segments of the story such as how Lucy Liu got to be who she is.<br/><br/>In spite of my criticisms, there are many moments that grip the viewer, and plenty of bizarre comedy to keep one interested.  The fight scenes are adeqate and he does some neat stuff with weapons.    I just hope that Mr. Tarantino can redeem himself Vol. 2."
"metalannihilator","9","0","1","2 November 2003"," It's supposed to be outlandish
","There has been buzz on the forums at Kill Bill about how ridiculous and stupid it is; that's the point.  Tarantino is not making a realistic movie by any standards.  The blood sprays like in old samurai cinema, the dialogue is simple because of the focus on dramatic elements, and there is some sense of humour to remind you of how much fun these movies are.  Also, Tarantino adds a feeling of two boys with action figures making up a movie, because as he has stated in the interview on the Pulp Fiction SEDVD, he did that when he was little.  Overall, the movie is for Tarantino fans which is a strength and a weakness; however, it is primarily a strength to show he is making movies he loves in order to share his vision with moviegoers at risk of losing box-office bucks.  If you want an action-packed, realistically violent movie, see Braveheart or Blackhawk Down.  For something off-kilter and artsy, see Kill Bill.  I cannot recommend it enough!"

","Is mister Quentin Tarantino a genius? After having watched this one I know the answer is a big yes, perhaps even the best director I can think of and not because out of a sudden you must forget Hitchcock or Kubrick but just because Tarantino makes them different, his movies are things you haven't seen before, he does with violence what Lynch does with the ununderstandable, he is just God... Moneywise I also would like to see Kill Bill in one turn rather than being split up in a volume 1 and 2 but knowing that I wasted tons of money for movies that aren't even worth the time, so not to speak about the money, I am excited to run back to the theatre the day they released vol.2 All the ingredients for a Tarantinomovie are there...superb soundtrack (James Last will never be the same again!!!), great acting from actors you don't expect from (Daryl Hannah is breathtaking), unexpected takes (there is a mangacartoon included) and violence. Violence is the word that makes Tarantino the man and I really hate it if I see that a director is accused of gloryfying death and violence where as a president who sends troops to death is seen as normal. I mean it's just fun...just entertainment and there will be no one around who will take up a sword pretending he is The Bride... The Bride is Uma Thurman who takes revenge on Bill and the gang... You see the story couldn't be more simplier, a bride has been beaten to death (4 years in a coma) and everyone who was at the ""party"" got killed and once Uma wakes up she must take reference and kill the gang...and Bill will be the last. At least that's what we think as I am sure that vol.2 will be full of surprises. One of the best movies ever made, point!!!"

","_""If you was a moron, you could almost admire it.""_<br/><br/>The fact that what I have seen so far is only half a movie by default makes what I'm going to say subject to change as soon as the second volume of Tarantino's latest hits the screens next February. I can safely say now however, that until I see the second half it will be quite impossible for me to say whether Kill Bill is an absolutely brilliant masterpiece or a piece of substance-deprived trash-referencing spectacle cinema.<br/><br/>First of all I will say this much; I believe that it was a big mistake to cut the movie in half. The overtly simple concept just isn't strong enough to carry the weight of 3 hours and I find it highly doubtful that it will be able to draw any but the more hardcore Tarantino and movie fans back into the cinema come February, due to the simple fact that nothing in particular is happening. To the untrained eye (if you will allow me) the movie isn't much else than blood, limbs and finely choreographed kung-fu. And there's nothing wrong with that as such, but if you've seen one scene you've seen them all.<br/><br/>I'll be the first to celebrate the blood-geysers and limb-removing sword play of Kill Bill. The work of martial arts choreographer extraordinaire Yuen Woo-Ping, whom you're sure to know in particular from The Matrix Trilogy and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (As well as other movies that have made it to the west, such as Black Mask, Double Dragon and Fist of Legend), is just phenomenal and lives up to everything we have come to expect from modern day kung-fu action on the big screen.<br/><br/>
Before I move on to talk about the movie itself, I would like to just take out a few lines to sum up my view of Tarantino, since I think it vitally important that one considers the artist when viewing the art. And of the modern day auteurs Tarantino in particular is worth a second glance before his movies are delved into.<br/><br/>With Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in particular, but also to some extend Jackie Brown, huge critical successes and to great lengths also economic successes, Quentin Tarantino was pretty much set for life. Though Reservoir Dogs made a splash when it was first released, it was not until Pulp Fiction debuted at Cannes that Tarantino made his mark. Critics went berserk, the audience frenzied and the money rolled into Miramax, making Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein a happy man who has said ""Miramax, is the house that Quentin Tarantino built.""<br/><br/>And that is the very reason that Tarantino, or indeed _anyone_ has been allowed to not only spend some $55 million and 3 hours of screen time on what is essentially a tribute to trash cinema, exploitation movies and oriental kung-fu TV series from the 70's. However it's not just the screen time that seems to last a lot longer than it should, as Kill Bill was being shot, new scenes were being written in daily and what should have been a 2 month stay in China soon doubled. And the list of production oddities goes on and on.<br/><br/>Were I to make a guess, I would say that the 'Weinstein influence' has affected more than just the bloated production and release, making it possible for Kill Bill to receive its R-rating. Something which even to an incarnate rating-opponent such as myself, seems absolutely preposterous. Though it makes for a good case against the MPAA ratings board.<br/><br/>
Tarantino, like other successful modern film makers, is at heart a massive movie-geek, which Kill Bill shows in no small way. While it wouldn't have been thought possible, Kill Bill is in fact more stuffed with absolutely obscure movie references than any of his previous outings, making it a study in the fine line between 'tipping the hat' to a blatant rip-off. Luckily for Tarantino, his reputation as a lover of what is I think commonly thought of as 'trash cinema' steps in and saves him from falling into the rip-off category. And that probably makes Kill Bill the biggest tribute movie ever released, recognizing among a plethora of others, such talent as Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou, Ang Lee and John Ford<br/><br/>This also makes me want to visit Tarantino's home which has to be the biggest collection of obscure movies ever seen in the history of geekdom. And that is kind of cool.<br/><br/>Now I'm not going to pronounce myself a lover of grindhouse cinema, 70's revenge movies or samurai tales of mostly any kind, even though a quick perusal of the various message boards will reveal that there apparently are a great deal of geeks that do pronounce themselves as such). I have however seen, in my youth, a quite wealthy display of ninja movies. That was back when ninjas were the coolest thing around and I wanted to see them kick some ass. Add to that the various grindhouse-gone-commercial movies of the mid-70's that I am sure most of us have at some point digested (how they survived the intervening years at my local VHS-pusher I don't know, but I was a bored kid in a lazy town so I ate it up) and the inevitable Russ Meyer flick.<br/><br/>So while I'm unable to pronounce myself the know-it-all guru of 60's and 70's underground movie making, I certainly feel that I know where this movie is coming from, and even more so where Tarantino is coming from. And I think most other people like myself do as well (unless you failed to waste your youth on bad movies, in which case the 'finer' points of Kill Bill might go over your head, which in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing).<br/><br/>And that, the purity of the love that Tarantino has for this stuff, goes a long way to save both himself and Kill Bill.<br/><br/>If you saw any other director do a movie like Kill Bill and not have their heart and life buried in the same kind of movie-mythology that Tarantino wears like a badge wherever he goes; it would die a horrible death at the hands of the fans and critics (though it can be argued that Kill Bill has already suffered death at the hands of the critics).<br/><br/>Even so, Rikke and I both agreed that while we can respect the self-indulgence and obvious ego-tripping of Tarantino, the final result suffers from being much too long; at least for commercial purposes and in terms of average costumer satisfaction. It is obvious that if you are like Tarantino, and Kill Bill feels like a movie that Tarantino tailor-made just for you, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with the length of it. And I can certainly sympathize with that attitude, seeing as that is how I feel about The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings; some people bitch and whine about their length; I just wish they were longer yet.<br/><br/>And that I think is a good basis of comparison. The Matrix Trilogy. Both 'series' have been made by über-geeks who have thrown absolutely everything, including the kitchen sink, into these works of pure adulterated passion. They both tribute the movies and cultures that the directors grew up with (and they both use Yuen Woo-Ping as their fight choreographer :)). And finally, and most importantly, they have both been created for great sums of money and released as 'commercial' cinema, when they in fact only cater to a relatively small audience of people 'in the know'.<br/><br/>But if I were to rate this, the first chapter of Kill Bill, based on these merits alone I would probably end up somewhere around 6.5 out of 10. Seen from my perspective, it is an entertaining movie with a great use of color, some cool cinematography, fantastic but ultimately non-revolutionary fighting. It is too long, too self-indulgent, utterly lacking in story and with a main character that I quite frankly find it hard to emphasize with.<br/><br/>With the exception of the suburban house-raze and the wedding massacre I found most of the scenes to run way over the time that they could support. Those two scenes however are worth taking a closer look at.<br/><br/>The fight in a suburban living room was by far the best scene in the movie if you ask me. Not only did it at the time warm up to what seemed like classic Tarantino meets kung-fu - though it never got there - it also had a ferocity that the rest of the fighting lacked. In this scene we have two primal animals just having a go at each other with everything they've got. It leaves scares and it smashes inventory. It almost manages to culminate when the bride kills the mother in front of her baby (R-rating anyone?), but then just sort of fizzles out from there.<br/><br/>As for the wedding, which is interspersed throughout the fragmented timeline that is so characteristic of Tarantino, it certainly pulls all the dramatic weight in the movie, granting the bride with any and all audience-sympathy (with the exception of the hospital scene). I thought it was unfortunate that there wasn't more of the movie that had been given the same dark, bleak treatment of that scene. Unfortunately it seems to pull most of the grit in an otherwise glossy movie.<br/><br/>But then again, since Kill Bill is a tribute to trash films, it can allow itself to be trash without anyone really being able to point fingers at it. And that is in itself somewhat brilliant when you think about it.<br/><br/>Another thing that Tarantino up until now has been brilliant at is writing. I personally enjoy him much more as a script writer than as a movie maker and story even goes that he became a director so that he could star in his own movies, since no one would let him star in theirs. And even if you haven't seen any of the movies that he himself directed, you might still have come across his work in such contemporary classics as True Romance and Natural Born Killers, both personal favorites of mine and both written before Pulp Fiction (and then of course half of From Dusk Till Dawn).<br/><br/>The funny thing is that of all the movies that Tarantino has been involved with writing, I like the ones that he himself hasn't directed. Natural Born Killers being by far my favorite of the bunch. Which is kind of ironic since Tarantino was so against what Oliver Stone did to 'his movie' that he had himself removed from script credit (though he still received story credit).<br/><br/>Regardless of what you may think of Natural Born Killers or whether or not you like Tarantino's particular style of writing to begin with I think that it can be said with some certainty that a good deal of the charm and wit that movies like Pulp Fiction gained from that writing lacks presence in Kill Bill. Where you have Jules and Vincent discussing the finer points of a European McDonald's, something which manages to tell us a great deal about their characters, Kill Bill has almost nothing of the same sort. And that is truly a shame.<br/><br/>You do get some of it when the bride goes to fetch her sword from Hattori Hanzo, when he starts bickering with his help. But ultimately that seems to lead nowhere and doesn't, at least on the surface, further the story or the characters in any way.<br/><br/>Without having seen volume two I would say that if the point of Kill Bill was to point out the low standards that popular culture has for art in modern western culture (and possible in eastern culture as well), then it certainly succeeded. A visit to the various Kill Bill message boards will show you lots of people shouting to the hills about the wonders of Kill Bill and how it is true art.<br/><br/>Somehow I don't think that was the point Tarantino had in mind however. But like so many things that Kill Bill contains, it is hard to say whether or not it is meant to have any depth and/or seriousness embedded in it. The mere fact that the movie and all its PR announces with much fanfare that Kill Bill is `The Fourth movie by Quentin Tarantino' is in itself a puzzle. Are we meant to take from that, that this movie is a wonder bestowed upon the world, or is it merely poking fun at the Tarantino image?<br/><br/>In the same way that the overt feminism of the movie can be looked on as nothing more than modern day equivalents of what Russ Meyer did back in the day it can also be interpreted as a feminist statement, or at least merely a feminine stone. On one hand we have Uma Thurman being shot from every conceivable angle and with close ups of every conceivable body part (including an extreme toe close-up). We have blood that makes blatantly sexual allusions and the Crazy 88 puffing and moaning after having been exposed to the furious virility of the bride. It's all over.<br/><br/>On the other hand we have a woman taking charge, avenging the murders of her husband and unborn child. She takes the absolutely one-minded revenge that is normally reserved for men and makes it her own instead. When the suburban fight is interrupted by Vivica Fox's child returning home from school there is an unspoken understanding that can only exist between to women.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is on the surface a 'simple' revenge movie with a good side and a bad side, but further examination reveals that there are in fact many layers to the 'good' and 'bad' sides of the story. Not only is our heroine a cold-blooded killer herself, gaining our sympathy only through of the brutalities bestowed on her by her former 'co-workers' - She kills a mother in front of her child, in cold blood (which leads us back to the opening Klingon proverb: `Revenge is a dish best served cold')<br/><br/>O-Ren Ishii gets her own complete anime sequence where she witnesses her family getting brutally murdered and indulging in pedophile sex to gain her vengeance. (making it two mothers killed in front of their own children - R-rating?)<br/><br/>But Kill Bill isn't your standard run-of-the-mill Hollywood summer action blockbuster, and it doesn't need to make any excuses for its characters. The bride doesn't have to spare her crippled opponents; in fact we don't give a s*** if she does. She just wants revenge at all costs, all other factors are irrelevant.<br/><br/>And that is probably both the reason why the movie works and the reason that it doesn't.<br/><br/>Because in the process of revenging, the bride looses any character she should've had. She is - as are her enemies - defined by the outfit she wears and the weapon she uses. And that could work just fine, if the movie wasn't 3 hours long.<br/><br/>Considering all of the more subtle nuances, at least the ones that I currently know of and understand, I would probably go as far as to grant the movie a resounding 8 out of 10. But as I said at the very beginning, Kill Bill can't really be fully appreciated before the entire thing can be watched from beginning till end. And while I have no doubt in my mind that the second half will be just as virtuoso in terms of its mastery of references, music, style and cool, it better be tighter than its predecessor.<br/><br/>But should that happen, then it could truly be a potential masterpiece. The effects of which will be felt in cinema for years to come.<br/><br/>And that is about all I have to say for now. There are so many things that I failed to cover, and it is to Tarantino's credit that an entire book could be written about the many subtle details, references and echo's of its 'source material'. I did find the movie to be too long, but for the self-indulgent movie it tries to be it is absolutely stunning in its execution."

","You can tell when you've just watched a really great film. You find yourself replaying whole scenes in your head or sitting at your desk, daydreaming about the music or the action, or remembering choice moments of dialogue. Kill Bill: Volume 1 is one such film, a exhilarating experience from bullet brained beginning to revelatory end, it'll leave you with baited breath, counting down the seconds until Volume 2 appears in February. 	At its core Kill Bill is an incredibly simple story. Take one woman out for revenge, pit her against five foes, ramp up the body count into triple figures and watch the blood (and dollars) flow. However, this is a Tarantino movie, and nothing is ever simple with him around. 	A less skilled director would have made a total hash of the whole thing. Mixing western, martial arts, comedy, drama and revenge themes into the mix, not to mention creating perfectly choreographed, beautiful fight scenes and squeezing in some brilliant dialogue in the process, would have been too much for some. Not Quentin. Here he proves that sometimes, being a geek is good, his encyclopaedic knowledge of the various genre's helping to make every segment, every scene of the movie stand up and be counted. There is nothing, nothing in Kill Bill: Volume 1 that should have been cut.<br/><br/>	There's no doubting that Kill Bill is a Tarantino movie. It has all of his trademarks (scene headers, sudden shifts in tone, even his obligatory boot shot) yet somehow, it all feels fresh, like you haven't seen it before. It has weirdness (hospital nurse Buck's way to may a few extra quid, Uma talking to her toe) and it has the non-linear narrative approach of Pulp Fiction, shifting back and forth in time as we learn more about the bride, and in a particularly brilliant scene, a manga cartoon introducing O-Ren Ishii's character. It's these marks of brilliance that, alone, would be enough to stamp this as a classic, but, there's more. 	The fight scene's are without a doubt the most brutal, exciting and funny that have ever been filmed. Yes, okay, the violence is excessive, fountains of blood spraying from severed limbs, decapitated heads and chopped legs, but its played for laughs, clearly stated throughout the film. This is not to be taken seriously, it is just a movie, after all, where else could you take a samurai sword on board a Boeing 747? Exactly, its set in a parallel universe, where nobody thinks anything of 100 dead bodies, all created by the same person. 	Kill Bill: Volume 1 creates so much tension, excitement and brutality in it's 1 hr 45 min running time and yet we're only halfway there, we still know next to nothing about Bill, Buddy, or Elle Driver (though we do catch a brief glimpse of her in this film). Also, we still don't know the brides real name, another eccentricity of Tarantino's, bleeping out her real name in the opening scene's. With so many unanswerd questions still left unanswered only one thing is certain: February is a helluva long time away!"

","*Possible Spoilers*<br/><br/>Well, that remains to be seen. However, Kill Bill may be Quentin Tarantino's finest film to date (and this is coming from somebody who rates Pulp Fiction as one of their all-time favourite films).<br/><br/>The plot is minimal, but then it doesn't need to be anything else. Uma Thurman's ""The Bride"" wakes up after spending over four years in a coma, caused by a bullet to the head at her wedding. When she wakes, she seeks revenge on the people who robbed her of four years of her life- and possibly- her unborn child. This includes Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu), Californian Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) and eventually (hence the title of the two films)Bill (David Carradine).<br/><br/>Many users and critics have stated that to enjoy the movie, a knowledge of martial arts and Japanese cinema is mandatory. True, if you are familliar with these movies, you will stand a better chance of understanding all the stylistic and thematic material on display here. However, I have very little knowledge of the genre Tarantino is paying tribute to, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first volume of Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Another key element of the film is the violence. Much has been written about this, including the controversial decision in America, to grant the film an R rating. The violence in Kill Bill is the icing on the cake. The fighting takes place in an alternate plain of reality, a stylised movie world which knows it is a stylised movie world. Quentin is constantly toying with the audience- experimenting with their preconceptions of where the boundary of reality and fiction lie. His deliberately outrageous, cartoonish blood-letting is both a tribute to his favourite movies and his little joke.<br/><br/>However, the real joy of Kill Bill is in its pure unadulterated entertainment value. Quentin obliterates the option of boredom through his flawless direction and, as previously mentioned, wonderfully stylised violence. The soundtrack is effortlessly cool and charcteristically offbeat, ranging from Nancy Sinatra to RZA. The use of different media such as black and white, colour and anime make the experience even more complete and memorable.<br/><br/>However, when reviewing Kill Bill, it is hard to ignore Uma Thurman's presence. Her performance treads a fine line between reality and the personification of revenge. She epitomises what Quentin is trying to achieve- in so much as she is sex, violence and cool on legs. Whether this is her greatest performance so far, is to be seen (Kill Bill volume two needs to come out, for me to reach this conclusion)but she is damn fine as Black Mamba and QT was wise in delaying filming for her.<br/><br/>
It's not deep, profound or original, but Kill Bill Volume one, will be one of the best things you'll see at the movies all year. I was thinking while watching this masterpiece, that having the amount of fun I was having, was almost probably illegal."
"XFLRWF","9","0","1","31 October 2003"," Tarantino's tribute fits the `Bill'
","Over the top and outrageous has always been a characteristic of director Quentin Tarantino.  And in his latest film, `Kill Bill: Vol. 1', the filmmaker doesn't merely leave this trademark all over the screen, but all over the floor and every square inch of the settings.  Tarantino, who is best known for his witty dialogue and pop culture references, relies more on the action to do the talking in his latest feature.  The director's tribute to the kung-fu genre packs a powerful punch that not only leaves audiences with their jaws dropping but has them begging for more.<br/><br/>On a warm Texas afternoon, a pregnant young bride known only as Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) is about to leave her old life as a mercenary.  The ceremony is cut short when she is brutally beaten by her old cohorts, The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (Vivica A. Fox, Darryl Hannah, Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen).  The bride is left for dead after the final blow delivered by her former boss, Bill (David Carradine).  Alive but in a coma, woman awakes four years later from her ordeal.  With the memories of her beating replaying in her mind, she sets out in search of the Squad and vengeance.<br/><br/>Director Quentin Tarantino makes a triumphant return after a six-year hiatus.  In `Kill Bill: Vol. 1', Tarantino presents his own unique style of martial art filmmaking.  A well-known trademark of Tarantino's films is the jump between times in telling the story.  The director utilizes this signature with great effect in revealing the past of the bride and the Viper Squad.  A great addition to the story telling is the incorporation of Japanese anime to introduce Lucy Liu's character, O-Ren Ishii.  The transformation from reality to animation gives the audience a break as well so as not to overexpose the physical fighting.  The cartoonish action does not by any means take away from the effect of the film.  Rather, it serves as a different vehicle for the fighting and narration.  With all the different camera tricks and storytelling techniques, fans will appreciate how the director never fails to capture a blood spurting chop or action packed sequence.<br/><br/>Tarantino co-wrote the screenplay with lead actress Uma Thurman.  Their combined talents deliver a smart and hard-hitting film from start to finish. The first volume is built on heart pumping fight scenes.  Each fight not only knocks moviegoers back into their seats but will also stun them with the aftermath effects.  The writing duo not only pens the fight scenes that are true to form of the kung-fu genre but the dialogue as well.  But that is not to say that the film lacks punchy dialogue that fans have come to enjoy from Tarantino's scripts.  One such example fans will undoubtedly appreciate is the comedic discussion between the sushi chef (guest star Sonny Chiba) and his partner as they discuss who is in fact in charge of the restaurant.<br/><br/>Actors rarely put on a bad performance in Tarantino movies.  Many seem to connect with the director's vision of the character and play it to a T. `Kill Bill: Vol. 1' follows in this great tradition.  Uma Thurman is absolutely terrific as Black Mamba/The Bride.  She plays the character with such great emotion that audiences feel her fear, her sadness, and her thirst for revenge.  Even more impressive is the extensive amount of work and training that went into for the role.  Thurman executes each fight with mastery that rivals many of today's action films.  Her technique and skill would make one believe that she had been studying martial arts and sword fighting for years.  Equally talented in her role is Lucy Liu as O-ren Ishii AKA Cottenmouth.  Liu emits an aura of fear and sympathy.  Her portrayal is so well done that audiences will sympathize with Ishii's traumatic childhood one moment and just as quickly become enthralled with her ruthless tactics. Liu is also very experienced with the sword but it is her acting ability that will grab audiences and make them cringe should they meet such a character.  Although playing the title character, David Carradine does not make a facial on-screen appearance.  However, his presence is felt.  With a sly evilness in his voice Carradine provides a truly sadistic villain. Even without seeing him, audiences can still picture the sadistic persona who would beat a pregnant woman unconscious and unleash a merciless horde of assassins.<br/><br/>Although `Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is not for the weak of heart, it is still an excellent piece of filmmaking.  All the right tools are involved: superb acting, brilliant directing, and an expertly crafted soundtrack.  Fans will leave the theatre with their hearts racing and a longing for the immediate release of `Kill Bill: Vol. 2.'  Tarantino's contribution to his beloved kung-fu genre will surely be remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","Kill Bill has received more than it's fair share of publicity in recent months and as a big fan of his previous Directions (Pulp Fiction being one of my favourite films of all time) I was very exited about this film.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman plays the Bride, a former hit woman, who was double crossed and left for dead by her fellow killers Copperhead (Liu), Cottonmouth (Fox), Sidewinder (Madson) California Mountain Snake (Hannah) and their boss Bill.<br/><br/>Right from the outset you know you are in Tarantino country with the different styles of camera work, drifting from colour to black and white (even sepia) and back to colour, an animated sequence (which works surprisingly well), a non-linear story to the memorable characters and Tarrantino's unique quirkiness. The pace is a bit on and off, however I suspect this is designed to give the audience a breather between the fast and in some cases unrelenting action scenes. Don't blink during the final half hour where the fight scenes rival if not better the Matrix without using so many special effects.<br/><br/>Tarantino has obviously had a lot of fun with this film, letting his imagination flow, drawing heavily and unashamedly on his influences. As good as it is, this is no Pulp Fiction and there are some points in the film where Tarantino's over enthusiasm gets the better of him, however this does not take anything away from the end result. What Kill Bill lacks in dialogue and memorable one-liners, it makes up for with visual style and wonderfull dark humour, never trying to take itself too seriously and proving to be a triumph of style over substance.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, Kill Bill has been criticised for it's violence, however this is mostly cartoon like, over the top and too tongue in cheek to be really offensive (althought the usual hardliners will always fins something to moan about - you know who you are). With that in mind, this is definitely adult material and not for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>I whole-heartedly support Tarantino's decision to present the movie in two volumes, as it would simply be too much to take in and appreciate all in one sitting.<br/><br/>Kill Bill did not disappoint me, instead for the first time this year I left the cinema buzzing with excitement at what I had just seen. Love him or loathe him, Quentin Tarantino has produced what I consider this to be the best film of 2003 and what is sure to be another cult hit.

","I would like to respond to the criticism of this movie as too violent and bloody. First, I should say that I am not a fan of gratuitous movie violence. It disgusts me. I couldn't even finish watching Resevior Dogs. However, I loved Kill Bill. The violence in this movie is NOT meant to be taken seriously. It's not supposed to represent what would actually happen to a person who was decapitated. As Quentin said in an interview (I think it was on ""The View""), ""Human beings don't have garden hoses for veins."" The human body does not contain as much blood as was portrayed in this movie. The entire movie is unrealistic, and that's why the blood had to be over the top. I haven't seen any of the kung fu movies this is modeled after, but I'm sure they don't attempt to portray reality. In reality, if you stuck a sword through someone's stomach, yeah, there'd be lots of spurting blood from arteries at first, but it would eventualy come out more slowly and there would probably be guts all over the place. If Quentin had showed that, it would be even more gory because it would be a realistic portrayal of someone dying. This way, it's just so ridiculous you can't possibly take it seriously."

","Tarantino's bloody Valentine<br/><br/><ul><li>Clap your hands, stomp your feet and wiggle your toes</li></ul><br/><br/><br/><br/>* * * * * (5 out of 5)<br/><br/>Kill Bill: Volume 1<br/><br/>Directed by: Quentin Tarantino, 2003<br/><br/><br/><br/>Kill Bill hits the ground running. With an uncanny grasp of film lore and a boy-scout's shameless innocence, Quentin Tarantino carves up a bloodied slice of geek mania in the finest of martial arts traditions - as masturbatory as it is exploitive and rewarding.<br/><br/>There's a popular saying about Tarantino. That he didn't go to film school, he went to 'films'. Kill Bill underlines this with a big, fat marker in screaming pink.<br/><br/>It is crafted with both a burning passion and a delicate sense of detail, amidst a grounded understanding of the history and style of its many scattershot origins. Be it Hollywood, spaghetti westerns, Che Chang, the Shaw brothers, a cult benchmark like Blade Runner (yes, that's the L.A. tunnel doubling for Tokyo) or pop-culture 60s TV-schlock like the Green Hornet (music and Kato mask) and Star Trek (how about that pompous opening quote?). Tarantino is throwing everything and the kitchen sink in the same cooker and it smells delicious. Tastes even better.<br/><br/>Is it a tribute or a parody then? Neither. It's a celebration.<br/><br/>The plot is deceptively simple: a woman known as The Bride (Uma Thurman) seeks revenge on a team of assassins (The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, or DiVAS) led by a man named Bill, who massacred her wedding party (including The Bride's unborn child) and left a bullet in her brain. As if that wasn't enough, Miramax decided to cut the movie (180 minutes) into two separate parts. Whatever stand Tarantino made on this issue doesn't matter, because Volume 1 works effortlessly in its current running time, even though we don't get to see that much of head-honcho Bill (portrayed by sleaze icon David Carradine - remember how bad this man was at kung-fu?) or the whistling, hip-swinging, one-eyed Darryl Hannah. Instead we get an agile Thurman carving her way through opponent after opponent, leaving wounds and body parts that erupt like scarlet geysers.<br/><br/>As with his other films, Tarantino ignores chronological order and goes about his story in a mish-mash of information. Yes, this is the style we are accustomed to with him but it never felt as right as it does here. This is the cartoon (and anime) style of interwoven storytelling, where characters are rooted by their past experiences and charged by emotions of revenge, while defined by their weapons of choice and/or colorful names.<br/><br/>
It turns out no one does it better and Tarantino naturally also knows where the line is drawn - he's a Ph.D. in congenial geekdom laws - so there's no plastered speech bubbles of ""oomph"" and ""kaboom"" and no awkward special effects just for show. He might tease us with bleeping out a name, go Manga anime for an otherwise too offending scene or suddenly turn black and white as a fingerpointer to TV censorship, but it's all direct homagés that fit as a whole. There's an unflagging spirit to Kill Bill, as if the tons of soul, trivia and history invested in it was meant to be.<br/><br/>There are also no digital effects during the fight scenes.<br/><br/>
Tarantino brought in friend and choreographer Yuen Woo-Ping, best known to the MTV-generation for his Matrix and Crouching Tiger work. Yet the elaborate action in Kill Bill is like nothing you've ever seen before. It's a gorgeous throwback to Woo-Ping's original style from the 70s - his Zui Quan (Drunken Master) days - which translates to being real stunts by real people and an emphasis on, say, just how sharp a Japanese sword can be. CGI-less and based on hardcore flow rather than specific stiff kung-fu moves (see Matrix), even the rare wire-work feels fresh and elegant. Blended with a keen eye for editing (Sally Menke works miracles), Kill Bill takes genre material and elevates it to a whole other level. To a whole new world. The showdown in the House of Blue Leaves restaurant between The Bride and the yakuza underworld is the most exhilarating, well-staged and intoxicating swordfight ever brought to the big screen. Doubt me? Just watch Tarantino's smoke.<br/><br/>Thurman delivers a remarkable performance as The Bride. Never once do you doubt her moxie or capabilities. Physically, she's completely convincing and not just a ""silly Caucasian girl playing with Samurai swords"" (an actual quote from the movie ofcourse), evident from the opening, high-speed knife-fight with Vivica Fox (as killer vixen Vernita Green) to her eye-popping electric boogie twirls on a dancefloor cutting hundreds of yakuzas into bits and pieces. Literally. Thurman's martial arts mannerisms are dead-on - a performance for the history books. White girl, yellow heart. Indeed. She truly honors the tracksuit she wears.<br/><br/>
While the yakuza showdown packs the most wallop, the best scene turns out to be a rather exquisite one. The final stand-off in Volume 1 between The Bride and another faster-pussycat assasin, O-Ren (Lucy Lui)- in an idyllic snow-covered garden - is a marvel. So where'd the snow come from? Don't ask and don't spoil the moment. Just acknowledge and respect that Tarantino is honoring an ancient Japanese tradition with the kind of love a mother has for her new-born. It's an angelic scene, enhanced by the loud dead calm that only lazy, falling snow produces. As the two warrior goddesses reflect in the crisp white landscape, the silence is broken momentarily by the caressing clank from a wooden waterpump. It's pure poetry.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect all around. Tarantino brings out both slapstick and relaxed realism in Sonny Chiba, while he gets the rather obvious Oriental fetiches (and his own?) covered with dressing Chiaki Kuriyama up as a schoolgirl with murderous inclinations. Her weapon of choice is a steel ball and chain with pop-out razors. What a deliciously funny performance by Kuriyama (however much is taken from Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale laid aside). But it's Lui that almost upstages our heroine. Her dotted, cheeky smile and twinkle of eye concealing a hidden ruthlessness is the object of much attention by the camera.<br/><br/>Lui is forgiven every bad episode of Ally (that's about 95%) and the shameless Charlie's Angels remakes for her performance as the sexy Godmother of the yakuza. I am reminded of John Ford's famous statement - when an assistent director questioned a shot he was making of a character's face, stating it was boring - that ""What is more exciting than the human face?"". Lui articulates a delicate cuteness and bruteness through the most subtle of facial expressions and as she fronts the yakuza entourage arriving at the restaurant, enhanced by the terrific main theme, it's as classic and cool as cinema can possibly get.<br/><br/>The mastermind behind the Wu-Tang Clan, RZA, has scored Kill Bill (together with Tarantino) and given it a pounding pulse to match the storm of visuals that come in from all sides of the universe. The overall sound is hard to define. Imagine old-school Nancy Sinatra (""Bang Bang"") mixed with the savvy groove of Hotei's ""Battle without Honor or Humanity"" on top of the theme from ""Ironside"" by Quincy Jones, and you'll have some idea. Oh wait, those songs are already in the movie. Well, there you go.<br/><br/>It has to be said: Kill Bill is extremely gory. The violence is ludicrous, sometimes hilarious, but it actually walks a fine line between simply bringing bloodsplattering anime to life and the repulsive horror of Michael Madsen's ear-cutting moment in Reservoir Dogs. One minute Kill Bill gets down, dirty and dangerous for fun or shock, and in the next Tarantino brings everything to a screeching halt - as when The Bride and Vernita simultaniously hide their knifes away, welcoming reality walking in the door in the shape of Vernita's kid coming home from school. You just might be able to sense Tarantino laughing contently in the background. He's toying with us, but it's as thrilling for us as it is for him.<br/><br/>
Kill Bill is glorius pulp fiction. A trancelike celebration of the pulp in the fiction. A martial arts benchmark and a slobbering, bloody Valentine's kiss from Tarantino to movie geeks all around the world. Right smack on the mouth.<br/><br/>Now, that's a first."

","Ääääh..... This movie really sucks!! No Plot, Not any kind of sense! Stupid movie for music video generation. Total waste of my precious time and money. I know that this is a Tarantino movie but that doesn't automatically mean that the movie is the best movie ever. I think Tarantino got a few screws loose in his head and this weird, extremely bad movie shows that well. People please don't overrate Tarantino so much that even any kind of crap he produces you appreciate that just because its from Quentin god o Mighty. Even if his earlier movies were good,doesn't mean that every piece of crap he does after that is as good as the previous movies he did. Ok. it's a fast, cool movie with good music and looks but that is it. It's full of all kind irrational sequence's that doesn't make any kind of sense at all.

"Nezz","Null","0","1","2 November 2003"," Big, pulpy fun.
","Even though I am a huge movie buff, I am not a Quentin Tarantino fan. I didn't enjoy any of his previous three movies and thought they were basically over-hyped garbages. Therefore, I was reluctant to watch Kill Bill : Volume 1. When I watched the trailer, I thought to myself, ""Give me a break"". However, after a close friend recommended the movie to me, I finally gave in and was quite surprised with what I saw.<br/><br/>Kill Bill doesn't seem to contain one original piece of movie making. Just about everything in the movie is stolen from some obscure movie or television show of the past, from the opening credits to Uma Thurman's yellow jumpsuit. However, all the pop references of the past are chopped up and brought together in such an unique way that a totally new movie is born. Even more surprisingly than that is the movie actually works, even with all the cheesy gore, great sword fights, and witty-yet-over-the-top dialogs.<br/><br/>
Outside of the characteristic heavy foul language, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I left the cinema thinking to myself, In that sense, the movie resembles another great tribute of the pop cultural past, the surprise cliffhanger. Can't wait to find out what happens in Kill Bill : Volume 2."
"Deckard-16","9","0","1","2 November 2003"," Gory, ridiculous and joyous to watch.
","I avoided seeing this film because most of the critics only talked about how much blood was spilled in this movie and I'm not a Texas Chainsaw Massacre type of guy, but my friends kept telling me that this movie rocked. So I finally saw it. Screw the pinhead intellectuals Kill Bill is sick. It is the bomb. This is Quentin Tarantino's 4th and best movie. I loved Resevoir Dogs, found Pulp Fiction obese (I hated it) and can't even name his 3rd film. Any movie that opens up with a Klingon proverb announces that it not to be taken seriously. What is shocking is the passion, effort and care that is evident on the screen in making this non-serious masterpiece. There was very serious work involved here. The action scenes are way over the top but beautifully executed. They are as gory as anything I've ever seen this side of Braveheart, but it is fun. The quiet scenes are sly and the dialogue is smart. What this movie lacks in emotion is more than compensated by intrigue. You want to know know what is going to happen next. You don't want to overthink this movie because it is so much fun to watch. If Mystic River is the best film this year then Kill Bill: Vol. 1 may be the best movie of the year. I can't wait for Vol. 2."

","I cannot wait to see this movie again, or until Kill Bill Volume 2 comes out. This is the best that Tarantino has done. It was a little far fetched and unrealistic (Not a cop in sight anywhere through all the bloody mayhem) and the martial art scenes are a little too mich like ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" but it was cool. I thought the japanese scene was drawn out a little too much, something tells me they could have edited this film better and put both parts into 1 long movie but didn't. <br/><br/>It was awesome with a killer ending. Uma (the bride) kicks some ass on all those who tried to kill her on her wedding day. She only gets through a couple names on her list, the rest being saved for Part 2. I normally do not like really violent movies but Tarantino does it well, and throws and makes some things so outrageous it is almost funny, even the most crude scenes.<br/><br/>

"sallyfifth","Null","0","1","31 October 2003"," Instinctive movie making.
","Whatever Kill Bill's faults, at least it IS. Here's a film that does not pussy foot around, it goes straight to the nerve endings. With a preponderance of movie's in the cineplex that want to be everybody's best friend, I'm glad Tarantino had the guts to make a film that shirks off our advances and hangs out smoking in the bathroom. <br/><br/>Kill Bill is instinctive movie-making. The story (at least in volume one) is a straight path, one which Uma as The Bride cuts with a samurai sword. Everything that happens is part of an equation that even a fourth grader could solve. It's what Quentin scribles within the lines of his script that make everything so fascinating. <br/><br/>I must admit though, I was bothered by the Japanese in the film, as I live in Japan and speak the language myself. It was embarassing. And I wish they had kept it to a minimum since I had to watch it with native Japanese.<br/><br/>
Go see this movie, if you like exploitation films, or just movies that come at ya looking for a fight."
"funang","9","0","1","30 October 2003"," A movie for the film geeks, made by a film geek:
","Many who have seen it have panned this movie for its over-the-top zealousness and its high body count, not forgetting the many severed limbs and bloodied body parts along the way. Coming from me, I can only comment that these critics have not seen many films, or at least they have not seen the films that Q.T has seen.<br/><br/>	As early as the Shaw Brothers opening banner right at the beginning, I know that this movie is not to be taken too seriously and I should just sit back and enjoy the ride. And not bad for a ride too, with a touch of nostalgia. Especially when more than 90 per cent of the films that the director have chosen to reference or pay tribute to are from the late sixties and the seventies, a by-gone era that still remains etched in memories. Here comes the spotting game: There's the Hitchcockian touch of suspense at the hospital scene. There are the samurai movies with Sonny Chiba and his samurai swords. Not forgetting martial arts maestro Chang Che's endless blood spilling (Q.T even acknowledged in an interview that during filming, he prayed and asked the belated Chang Che to teach him how to make the blood spill right! In the end, his persistence paid off and thank god he waited..) Even the major revenge plotline is based loosely on Samurai and Chinese martial arts movies, where vengeance is forever a recurring theme.<br/><br/>Coming back alive too and featured prominently are the Green Hornet (face masks cum music score) and Bruce Lee (the yellow tracksuit from Game of Death', the  Fists of Fury' setting for the final showdown, and the Green Hornet itself !) Most of all credit has to be given to Sergio Leone and the music of Ennio Morricone. All throughout this film, you can see Leone's Extreme close-ups, the mexican standoffs (with swords rather than guns), and intercutting the shots with Morricone like music to create the tension and mood. According to the credits, one of Morricone's own score is featured.<br/><br/>	Among the more contemporary influences, you have the Jap Anime sequence, courtesy of Production I.G, and the ultra violent ultra cool jap cult filmBattle Royal', which manifests in the form of Chiaki Kuriyama as Go Go Yubari. I am trying to cover as much ground here, but I believe I'm still missing bits and pieces that Q.T has slotted in throughout the film. Perhaps other commentators will care to add on to this exhaustive list?<br/><br/>
In retrospect, Q.T has built a proven track record on his 1st  3rd films, based partially if not wholly on movies that he loves dearly. Reservoir Dogs' is a hybrid of the heist films and the gritty Hong Kong crime/action genre. Pulp Fiction', with it's title saying it all, is the first time that Q.T pay hommage by featuring a retro star of a by-gone era, i.e John Travolta, re-doing his slick dance moves. Jackie Brown' is openly a hommage to Blaxploitation films with who else but Pam Grier to play the title character. It all culminates and comes to a boiling point in Kill Bill', with the number of stars' and movies featured topping them all. From the already mentioned Sonny Chiba to Gordon Liu, whom I feel didn't seems to quite fit into his green hornet masked role. Think Chiba got the better deal, playing the retired samurai swords maker cum master, with more dialogue and scenes to act in. But the incredible fact remains that Q.T has managed to cast them in his movie at this age, these two film legends if I may say so. Not bad at all for a former video store clerk.<br/><br/>	I totally enjoyed picking out the movie references. Standing on its own merits, the production is top notch crafting, thanks to collaborators like D.P Bob Richardson. Especially love the b&w and silhouette sword fighting sequences, and the long moving uninterrupted camera throughout the Japanese club set-up ala Martin Scorsese or Brian De Palma's films. Richardson also happens to be the cinematographer for Scorsese in Casino'.  Commendable work is also heard in the sound design and sound editing, which together with the mostly non-original score, serves the movie well.<br/><br/>	My only problem, or should I say conflict with the movie is: because the movies that Q.T loves are these sensational vengeance soaked exploitation flicks from at least 20-30 years ago, featuring them in today's context, to today's audience, will most probably result in tons and tons of negative cynical laughter. Not too many people can view this movie with a perspective in mind, as evidenced from the many negative comments. Q.T ended up doing more parody (I'm sure he meant to do some of it) rather than seriously and sincerely paying tribute to the films and the filmmakers that he so dearly adored and admired. It's like re-doing an old B-exploitation movie with a big budget A' movie production and craft. The overall feeling that I got is that the elements from so many different and varied movies' did not tie up together well, as compared to his earlier work like Reservoir Dogs'. It is intelligently put together, but certain elements are simply too over-the top, and they are better left the way they were, in the video libraries. I really wonder what will Leone and Chang Che say when they see Kill Bill'. If only I can ask them, like what Q did"
"epyon-2","9","0","1","30 October 2003"," Best movie I've seen this year
","I'm super glad that I was able to catch this film in Japan.  After hearing how the American version was different in a few places, I was happy gloat in the fact that I got to see (at least) one scene that didn't make the American cut (as far as I have found out). <br/><br/>The way the movie opened was possibly one of the more distressing things I can think of.  If the beginning didn't creep you out a little bit then there is something wrong with you. I was already feeling a bit uncomfortable before the first image of The Bride even appeared on screen.<br/><br/>The main reason why I enjoyed this movie so much is that I too am a pretty big fan of the kind of movies that Kill Bill pays tribute to. I found it quite enjoyable to see Tarantino's vision of these movies and the simple idea of a movie about revenge made it that much more effective. I can't begin to recall how many old kung fu flicks I've seen that had this basic concept at it's core.<br/><br/>Once again, Tarantino has managed to pick music that only makes the movie better. It may seem odd to some people, but I thought that the contrast of the music with the images was just too cool. <br/><br/>All the actors worked well in their parts, but I was particularly taken with Sonny Chiba's character.  It was hilarious to hear his English dialogue, especially the line ""My English is very good."" in his rather thick Japanese accent. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of old kung fu flicks and the like, this movie is a must see."
"shinymc_shine","7","0","1","28 October 2003"," Waiting for Bill
","A disappointing ""fourth film"" from Quentin Tarantino. Compared to his other films this is possibly his worst. ( Don't get he wrong. I am a Tarantino fan but this one is certainly not up there with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.) You basically never fear for The Bride's life as you well now that she returns for Kill Bill Volume 2. The climatic sword fight is pointless as you know in advance that The Bride survives and Lucy Liu does not. Please stop the novel approach because as sure as sh*t it doesn't work here. This film while well shot by Bob Richardson, possibly the best cinematographer around, is terribly slow and feels like your watching Tarantino's original three hours plus cut. This is not the visual masterpiece every claims it is. Requiem For A Dream, made on a smaller budget, looks better and is certainly more graphic than this. I hope Kill Bill Volume 2 is better.

I know that everyone on this planet gets screwed at some point in their lives, but the hero for this story is a nameless woman, who sets out to ""Kill Bill"", the one who almost killed her. How many women have thought of avenging a wrong-doing in the name of dignity and self-respect? For those of you who have a strong stomache, for those of you who get a twinkle in their eye at the thought of combat, this'll turn you on. I was worried that the public would label this a chick flick, but hardly anyone mentioned that phrase at all.

","I won't dwell on how good this movie is, I'll just say that I've watched it twice at the theatre, something I've never done with any other movie.<br/><br/>My gripes:<br/><br/>Vernita should have shot the wall a little closer to The Bride, she's an ex-assassin, she fired at close to point blank... missed her by a mile.<br/><br/>O-ren after her scalp ""That really was a Hatori Honzo sword"". I was kinda perplexed at this dieing statement until I read the script. The script contains a few more lines in this scene that really shouldn't have been left out.<br/><br/>O-ren - ""I always dreamed of owning one..."" O-ren - ""Did he make it for you?"" The Bride - ""Yes."" O-ren (final line)- ""...He must of liked you.""<br/><br/>I really hope the missing lines make it to DVD. It would have given the viewer some insight into O-ren's supprise at The Brides statement regarding the sword directly before their fight, and it would have left us with a lingering sadness that wasn't evident with the omission of those few lines.<br/><br/>Hmm, just 2 major gripes. I guess that leaves some room for comments on how good this film was. Some people have criticized Kill Bill for a lack of dialogue compared to his other films. I think it made the mood that more poignant and it brings out the quality of what is said. We laughed along in Pulp Fiction at the various characters opinionated chatter because it was a film that highlighted the various characters flaws and quirks. The more they talked, the more you loved or hated them. In Kill Bill, the opposite happens. We're dealing with professional assassins who know that talk is cheap. If they had rambled on, it would have detracted from their believability. Not that Quentin was going for a dead serious movie, but believable characters were essential to his ability to get away with all the film refrences and mixing of styles. Which, when added to the whole, is another plus. It was that mix of style that gave the movie a surreal atmosphere that put it over the top.<br/><br/>One other thing that really stood out was the soundtrack. All the music is brilliantly placed, but I give double praise to the music in the House of Blue Leaves. The way it builds up is simply maddening in a good kinda way. Awesome movie!"

","...and my expectations weren't that high to start with. Kill Bill vol. 1 has its fine moments, though never really memorable. The fight scenes are quite gory and over the top, but not truly shocking nor are they genuinely funny in their wackiness. The characters are rather flat and most of the times recite dull lines in boring dialogue. I don't know what to make of this film, because the ambitions are unclear. If it was to show the audience what a great actress Uma Thurman is, then the least they could to was to give some more depth to her character. Now she's just a cold, vengeful killer in yellow leather with a katana blade. I remained completely neutral towards The Bride throughout the whole film. Did Tarantino want to show how well he could write a screenplay on his own? He falls short. The story never comes alive, not even with the little - rather predictable - twist at the very end of vol. 1. I definitely will go and see vol. 2, but only to watch the end of the story with my own eyes instead of having other people tell me. The fate of the Bride and Bill doesn't affect me one bit, and that's something I regret.<br/><br/>Parts that are very OK though: the sunglasses on the dashboard, the anime part and the bickering between Hattori Hanzo and his assistant."

","The fourth film from oddball director Quentin Tarantino is expectedly violent, flashy, and totally off-the-wall. Thurman is well-cast as a vengeful bride who goes on a deadly mission to wipe out the ruthless gang of assassins who sandbagged her wedding and left her for dead. More specifically, her focus is on the gang's sinister boss with whom she has a much more personal vendetta. Tarantino's direction is anything but smooth—probably by intention—but with eye-popping visuals, clever references/in-jokes, bold, bloody, and pumped-up action scenes, the film pays off in spades. By design, this is only one half of the entire picture, but in that aspect it certainly works. ***"

","I watched this yesterday with my Dad and his wife and mine.  To say the least it made me uneasy considering our viewing companions.  Bottom line? Quentin did not accomplish anything noteworthy.  This movie seems to be the product of watching too much 70's TV in adolescence followed by Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, some good anime, and perhaps a few video games similar to Dead or Alive later in life.  Too much borrowing (hence the summary above) of material and not enough originality for me--I'll wait for DVD on the sequel."
"mamaway66","5","0","1","27 October 2003"," About as good as ""From Dusk Till Dawn""
","Since Pulp Fiction, it seems film making is more important to Quentin Tarantino rather than telling a good story. I wanted to check out this movie because I'm a big fan of Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and I think Quentin is a really good film maker. From the very start, you see that Quentin wants to be different, and see what he could get a way with in his quirky credits sequence, which I appreciated. Everything was good until about half way through the movie when it seemed Quentin became obsessed with showing blood spraying out of people's bodies a la Japanese anime. He actually includes about 15 minutes of anime, which IMO is artsy-fartsy animation invented only to depict sex and violence. I've never understood anime (maybe I'm in the minority judging by the ratings of this movie) but he had a good film going until the bloodfest started in that cartoon. I felt the same about Dusk till Dawn. Absolutely no plot in that movie. Started off looking like it had one, but then it was just another horror movie. I guess I should have expected more blood than story in Kill Bill, but he's not appealing to the masses with this one.  5/10"

","Ok,I'm a kung fu film snob so it takes a lot to impress me.  I'm also well versed in the Samurai films of quality.  So proceed with caution.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a good homage to the masterpieces of old but it suffers from weak dialogue  which is unusual for a Tarantino film.  I also need more story and plot twists from someone so skilled like QT.<br/><br/>It's more like Charlie's Angels on testosterone than anything else.  I appreciate the amount of violence and the interesting cameos (Sonny Chiba, Gordon Liu). Some of the fight scenes were nice like the opening sequence(vs Viveca Fox) and the fight with the schoolgirl and her ball and chain but the rest lacked impact maybe because of uninspired choreography and no drama, just massive hacking and slashing which is ok.  It's like just kill one stranger after the other over and over again.  I'll admit lately there are few alternatives so hungry martial arts action fans will be pleased.<br/><br/>Lucy and Uma going at it was anticlimactic for some reason.  Humor was also contrived.

","After being quite aprehensive about watching Kill Bill and knowing nothing about the movie, all I can say is it completely blew my mind away. Being as I have never really seen any of Tarantino's movies, I watched with an open mind and no expectations. The first few seconds of the movie grabbed my attention and pulled me into his bloodthirsty world. That was it, bathroom break or not, I wasn't going anywhere till it was over. Brilliant casting and definately Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu at their finest. I'm not much of a fan of Anime either but the Anime which explained the story of O-Ren Ishii(Liu) worked brilliantly well. Violent, bloodthirsty, disturbing, heart warming, amusing at times and outstanding fight scenes, make this for me one of the best movies to hit the silver screen in a very long time. I never knew it was a 2 part movie so I was very disappointed when it ended and now can't wait for the 2nd episode. Will definately be buying the DVD when it's released and even the soundtrack is excellent. Altogether it's a well earned 10/10 from me."

","And so, `the fourth film by Quentin Tarantino' is here, after six long years of waiting. By its outlook, by its synopsis, by its trailer, no one knew what to expect. A `pastiche' mosaic? An overload of obscure references only an ultra movie geek would find? The disappointment that inevitably spawns itself from the over-the-top hype? Or the complete opposite and a genius film all the way?<br/><br/>First, the hype has faded in six years, even more with the underestimated `Jackie Brown'. Thus, Tarantino could have been involved with this project well earlier, and the hype would be the same. So, you can say that there wasn't a better time than this one for Tarantino to climb `his own personal Everest'.<br/><br/>At first, you can find it somehow odd, right from the logo to some kind of obscure, oriental kind of cinemascope and the fantastic recollection of the cue card saying `our feature presentation'. But it's very easy for a movie lover to let himself be carried along this sheer trip, so idiosyncratic that, after an introduction that takes its time, you won't question its bizarre items, and the world this world creates. <br/><br/>I confess that my primal fear when I learned about the shape of the project was the possibility of Tarantino surrendering himself to auto-indulgence, filling his epic with dozens of obscure references to lost gems of the b-movie age, that could be well lost in the limbo of justified and unvoluntary ignorance of those who never saw such films. But Tarantino surprises everyone, and that's what struck me the most: by collecting all the bits and pieces of the world of movies Tarantino fell in love with, this movie creates not only a hommage, but also a glorification, a kind of grandiose landmark, devoted to a genre of cinema always overlooked away from the major leagues. Linked to this, are the movies' charismatic characters, and the way they're filmed: they all have their own story, they all have something to tell, they all have something mythical and epic about them. Uma Thurman heads the pack, showing that cooler than a samurai with a sword is The Bride in a Bruce Lee jump suit, reducing 88 oriental Reservoir Dogs to a pulp, almost like Tarantino put his past career in a backseat. Because we're not dealing with an intensely ironic humor, you have no doubtful questions: here the answers lie in front of you, all of them  it's a sincere, explicit work, but never diminished by that. <br/><br/>It's now also one of the greatest Tarantino works. Not only an epic that makes you want to see long lost movie genres, but also an instant classic, a redefinition of the concept of `exercise in style' times twenty. The genius moments are too many, since that hommage to Hitchcock (complete with a Bernard Herrman score), to the bombastic showdown, that makes the Burly Brawl run for his money. The most impressive must be the unforgettable epic-within-an-epic of animé short that lies in the heart of the movie.<br/><br/>With this movie, Tarantino opens again the doors to its usual genius, this time in a completely innovative way. And creates one of the most sinful fun rides of the last years."

","Quentin Tarantino´s back with this high speed action / kung fu / anmie / samurai movie. I only watched this one once by now. The reason for this is not that it´s bad, just that is not out yet ( at least only in lame ass workprint and/or telesync ) When i watched it in the Cinema last weak ( October 25th - Danish premier ) i quickly noticed that this is a very different kind of movie, then what we are use to seeing from the King ( QT > Quentin Tarantino ). There are a few scene skips ( as seen in Pulp Fiction and Resoivoir Dogs ), the movie is devidet in to chapters like a book, and chapter 2 comes before 1. This however i did find a little odd, becaurs i was unable to see what the point was, other then thats what he always does. Another thing that i did not like was the fact that the movie was short on QT dialog. QT write the most interesting and awsome dialog, where ppl ( mostly gangsters ) are in a verry serious situation, and however talking about some silly ass shit, like if Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. shit and so forth. This movie however focus more on individuals, like a old Samurai movie often do, or like classic Kung Fu movies ( Fist of legend and so forth ) This put a side, i think this movie is very very very good. There are tons of sceenes in it where the hole cinema laugh, smile and almost cry. At first where a pregnant UMA THURMAN is shot in the head by BILL the second she says ""It´s your baby"" the scene is so well made that I and everybody else jumped in there seat. From that point the action starts. I dont know what i liked best, that hospital scene where it she learns that lots of ppl have been having sex with URMA while she was in a coma, or the house battle where the victoms daught walk in and aventualy see her mother get a large hunting knife in he chest. Anyway, maby a bit to short this movie have only a few scenes in it. Pretty much devidet by the chapters QT made, it follow the story and change the style to fit it. luci Lu is presented in a 15 minnuts anime clip with as much violence as the rest of the flick. I dont wanna give any more away for the ppl who diddent see it yet, however if u didden, DO IT NOW! I read in some other reviews that if i liked anime or Kung Fu this woudt be nothing like that, and i must agree. it´s much much better. This is what Jet Le´s onl Kung Fu movies woudt have been like if they had had the buget ( and the worlds greatest writer / director ) This movie is a tribue to Kung Fu, Western, John Woo, Chineese / japaneese anime.

I just loved the ""Pussy Wagon"" scenes, especially Uma Thurman and the the vivid colors.

"ppanon-1","10","0","1","25 October 2003"," A tribute to Japanese films and their descendants(Partial Spoiler)
","Kill Bill is clearly a tribute to Japanese live-action and animation films that have gone before. The violence is sudden and graphic as in many Japanese samurai movies, and the main character is effectively a ronin: a feudal soldier who has been wronged by her feudal lord and comrades-in-arms and swears revenge. Gore and blood fountains reminiscent of the animated First of the North Star (or even Monty Python) contrast with beautiful cinematography.<br/><br/>Even though the main characters are female, this is not a Charlie's Angels, fem-power, feel-good chick flick. The humor is less overt and more noir than Pulp Fiction. This movie is quite dark and opressive. The pacing is good, with pauses to let you recover from the over-the-top fight sequences. However the acting was at times a little weak. The result is at times ridiculous and at times sublime.<br/><br/>Other reviewers here have complained that the backwards exposition is a tired Tarantino gimmick. Ah, but maybe it's a trick? The first chapter of the movie tells of events that, within the movie's chronology, take place after the last scene. But maybe QT chose that exposition so that, by the time you have been through all the gore to get to the end of Kill Bill Vol.1, you have forgotten most of that first chapter?<br/><br/>When I heard the last line of the movie, uttered by Bill, I thought ""That Tarrantino is a sadistic SOB leaving us hanging like that"". When I got home 3 hours later, the other shoe dropped and I got the second possible meaning behind that sentence, the whole first chapter of the movie had new layer of meaning, and my expectations from Vol. 2 just shot up. That delayed a reaction doesn't happen too often to me these days and, if I'm right about it, those of you that haven't gotten it yet will be in for a big surprise when Kill Bill Vol 2 is released. And maybe you too will decide an apology to Tarrantino is in order for having called him names."
"miguelsanchez69","9","0","1","25 October 2003"," Quentin Tarantino delivers one of the year's best films
","Quite honestly, after Reservoir Dogs and and Pulp Fiction, when I saw Jackie Brown, I figured Tarantino had peaked. I was wrong. When I heard he was making a martial arts film, I was worried he'd overuse wirefighting in extended and boring sequences a la Matrix Reloaded. Again, I was wrong. Next, I heard it would be two parts and figured that this was a clever marketing scheme and the movie would be left as a cliffhanger/feature length teaser a la Back to the Future 2. Again, I was wrong. This movie is complete in and of itself. Instead, we get a uniquely americanized take on Asian cinema and the samurai films complete with some fun dialogue and the Charlie's Angels on crack-esque Super Viper Deadly Assassination Squad. The directing is great, the story's taut, though flashback-riddled, and the acting's even better with Uma living up to the types of roles Sonny Chiba and Toshiro Mifune originated. Quentin even manages to get the bright red color and spraying quality of samurai blood correct. I do have one quibble though. Unfortunately there is a problem with this sort of blood. In the House of Blue Leaves the dramatic impact is lessened since violence appears toned down and minimized by the use of Black and White. I am uncertain as to whether this was capitulation to censors or the original intent, but blood and guts, specifically bright blood, as in samurai films, looks MUCH better in color. Many people have commented on the violence in this movie. I disagree with most of what's been said. I've seen dozens of american action films more violent than this. The fashion the violence takes is a little different than most action movies though since a sword, rather than a gun is used. Some of the violence in samurai style movies typically involves dismemberment and blood squirting from the slain or maimed like a firehose. The ""Baby cart at the River Styx"" series aka ""Shogun Assassin"" in its dubbed american incarnation has a higher body count (as well as more limbs and arms flying) in its first 5 minutes than does this entire movie. Entertaining as all hell, though not quite as violent as many would have you believe. Should delight the average movie-goer and hardcore film buff alike. Highest Recommendedation."
"Aberrmen","7","0","1","25 October 2003"," Holy Blood Bath Batman!
","When going to see Kill Bill i expected a very good amount of blood, i was not let down.  The Movie immediately starts off with a bang, with a wild knife fight between Fox and Thurman.  Then, as Tarantino loves so much to do, the movie takes an out of order hour+ long detour explaining the shtick(or plot) of the movie.  While some of this excursion is a little boring, or a little disturbing, any points lost are more than made up for in the end.  An epic fight sequence stacking Thurman up against over 88 bad guys(and girls) in black, in a fight scene in which over 100 gallons of fake blood was used.  This fight is in my opinion far and away the best part of the film, with such excessive gore that it is funny.  While Kill Bill, isn't quite as solid as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction as far as plot is concerned, you should not leave the theater disappointed."
"WilsonLau","6","0","1","25 October 2003"," The Mark of a good Director *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*
","The mark of a good director is when the audience is given credit. The plot isn't dumbed down, or the film doesn't go out of its way to explain things that don't deserve attention. In that way, Tarantino has earned respect.<br/><br/>
Initially i had my reservations about this film because of some of the action scenes i witnessed through commercials and what not. The fighting seemed a little stiff to me and this movie breaks a serious rule in my books by casting main characters as fighters or martial artists. I have to admit, fighting scenes in terms of choreography is very important to me when it is an element in a film. My philosophy is that you do not under any circumstance cast actors with no martial arts background in a film that requires them to perform martial arts. Its sloppy, choppy and only ""showy"" at best. Take for example Charlie's Angel 1 and 2, and the Matrix series. Given the Matrix did do a decent job, however i dare you to watch Keanu, then watch Bruce Lee or even Michelle Yeoh. Charlie's Angels highlights my point. The 3 main characters sicken me. Whats next? Are we gonna have Leo Dicaprio swing around nunchuks? Or how about Julia Roberts busting out wing chun moves? Not enough? How about J-Lo, (man, i hate that nickname) squeezing a sword with her rear end? The only mainstream actor who's a legitamate star who should be cast in these movies is Snipes. Snipes would have been good for a role in Kill Bill. He has that solid martial arts background and at the same time he is a solid screen presence.<br/><br/>None of the main characters have a real martial arts background, the closest being Lucy Liu. However my opinion of Liu is that she has almost become a pseudo asian, adding to bad asian stereotypes with every film she makes.<br/><br/>With all that said, I am not disapointed with the action in Kill Bill. Surprisingly the style holds it up. It was a little stiff but it has its style, its speed but yet it doesn't take itself too seriously so it makes things alright (spraying blood, like from an air pressured hose). I guess what i am implying is that they're not trying to become 100% authentic, and in that way they fail to insult my judgement on this topic. That deserves applause.<br/><br/>With the fighting aside the movie itself is outstanding. The style that Quentin brings to this movie is clever and cool but never to the point that it became cheap. I like the colours, the flair, the leads and the transitions. Everything was very smooth and nicely paced. The clothes are very cool, and the settings were eye catching. The only beef i have is the little references to the Great One. No not Gretz, Bruce Lee. Nobody wears the number 99 and for the same reasons i believe that nobody should wear the Yellow jumpsuit that Bruce wore in Game of Death and certainly nobody should wear the Kato mask much less a bunch of lackies. Unless you can prove without a shadow of a doubt that you can be as good as Bruce, (and nobody since Bruce has even come close, i don't care what anyone says, not Jet, not Jackie, gimmie a break) you don't wear the Yellow jumpsuit or any rendition of it.<br/><br/>I also like the little short anime scene. It brought out a lot of flare and its something only Tarantino would be creative enough to think up. It brought a nice little boost to the movie which already had a very good pace.<br/><br/>So...Kill Bill was good...See it<br/><br/>9/10"

The big fight - which is basically a ballet with severed limbs. Impressive. The occasional little quirk here and there.<br/><br/>But overall the dialogue was bad to terrible (I don't care if it's intentional), there was almost NO story to speak of, what there was was utterly predictable, and the pace of the movie frequently dragged.<br/><br/>Watching this was like watching someone else play a video game.

Kill Bill breaks away from conventional film techniques by throwing cartoon animation, black and white footage, and multiple close-ups and insert shots, into the mix.  Kill Bill gets the adrenaline pumping throughout your body and has you on the edge of your seat, waiting the next confrontation. The amount of training that went into to making the fighting scenes look believable is evident in Kill Bill.  The actors, especially Thurman gave great performances that succeed in making a fun-filled, action packed film. Although Tarantino is known for his immense use of dialogue such as in Reservoir Dogs, he proves that he is equally suited for making action movies as well.  Kill Bill also contains fun music and crisp sound quality that only add to making an exciting film.

I was shocked, to say the least, and I knew that I was in for a delicious film to fill my ravenous appetite.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 1 is one of the best movies I have seen in recent years. It is a must see for anyone who can stomach it.  It is a classic example of Quentin's staple to take borrowed methods and put a modern twist on them. It is a tightly woven revenge story told with many obvious allusions to Shaw Brother's martial-arts films, spaghetti westerns and anime, and like all other Tarantino films has a wonderful throughline explored in extreme depth.<br/><br/>I can not wait for the story to be finished in Volume 2, but I was not dissapointed with the cliff hanger ending.

I always found the geysers of blood is some Chinese sword-play films, namely the very successful One-Armed Swordsman series and such. Anyway they attracted legions of fans. Tarantino replays all image and sound chichÃ©s from action films in a small package, with such intelligent sequence, and such good editing, that your memory will go back to literally dozens of films you've seen in the 1960s and 1970s, and you'll be surprised at the end (well... sort of ending ;-) ) because you were not aware that time had passed. Than, there is such care in the building-up of suspense, and the cinematography, and the beautiful music (the last Japanese song with the end credits is superb!) and small details, like a water-clock (timed for 30 seconds, if I'm right) during the katana duel on the snowy inner garden...<br/><br/>Even if you think you don't like gore, try this one film; eventually, you'll discover you've been subjected to much worse in the amounts of blood in other films, and that this is a good film, even with discreet, intelligent, touches of humour - that those films you'll recall lacked entirely.

","Kill Bill Volume 1 is the 4th (well known) film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, and it has his mark stamped all over it, and that is by no means a bad thing.<br/><br/>It has a very Tarantino cast, with ""washed up"" celebs, and (of course) a few of Quentin's faves, Michael Madsen (Budd) and wonderful Uma Thurman (The Bride). It also has a very unique soundtrack, and every track fits in perfectly, from the spine-chilling revenge song to the brilliant western-style music during the standoff at the end.<br/><br/>It is well documented that the film is violent, and I reckon that it is the most violent film that I have seen. However, the violence is done brilliantly. It is wonderfully sickeningly funny in parts, and terrifying in others (the anime section is tense and splattered with fountains of crimson). It has even been ""toned down"" for the Western release, as the action becomes black and white during the incredibly violent fight at the end (Eastern audiences are given it in its full colour glory).<br/><br/>Therefore, I must recommend that if you cannot take violence, then this is not for you. Fight Club and Reservoir Dogs are tame by comparison. However, if you are able to take the gore as being a part of the film, as being funny and dramatic, then you really must see this film.<br/><br/>I have heard comments that the film has no plot, and I have to disagree. True, it does not have a very complex plot, and it does not make any witty references to pop culture, but it was always going to be compared to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. However, the majority of the first hour of the film is devoted to the (back)story about the Bride and the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, including a wonderful anime sequence.<br/><br/>You DO NOT have to have seen Sonny Chiba films, spaghetti westerns or have any real background knowledge aboutEastern cinema. All you need to be able to do is appreciate it, and maybe notice the odd reference (eg. standoff with western-style music).<br/><br/>There were very few things wrong with this film. There was the odd moment of dialogue which was not up to Tarantino's standard, it was a little slow in places and I didn't like the way they bleeped out The Bride's name, but these are small points.<br/><br/>Well, you may have guessed that I really enjoyed this film.

","You are lucky if you can go to the theater, watch a movie, and come out feeling any kind of emotion at all. Good movies are hard to find. I left Kill Bill, feeling disturbingly moved. It was definitely not what I expected and I mean that in the best way. The acting in this movie was spectacular, Lucy Liu and Uma Thurman giving particularly good performances. Not only was the film visually stunning, but the story itself keeps your mind interested and constantly at work. There is never a dull moment. The sequence of the film is abnormal, keeping a steady pace. It is full of flashbacks and introducing new, interesting characters as it progresses. This film is a must-see! 10/10. (and lets not forget that horridly wonderful Anime scene!)"

","There's not much one can say about Kill Bill: Vol. 1 that hasn't already been said.  In a way, it's all true.  No, it's probably not the most original movie in the world.  I have not seen a lot of the movies the film references, so it's new to me.  And I really liked it.  If Quentin's mission, like he says it is, is to get people to seek out Hong Kong/Asian titles, he definitely succeded in my case.  I will check them out.  I have only seen a few John Woo flicks and of course all the old Toho stuff.  For what it is, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is extremely well-made, technically, anyway. I think I have yet to read one complaint in that regard, even from the hardcore HK fans who hate it.  People either love or hate this movie.  I have seen it eight times, so take that for what it's worth.  This movie will seem like a no-brainer to the types that love Tarantino only for his dialogue, but quitcher bitchin'.  The dialogue is sparse here, but funny and fitting.  Loosen up and enjoy a great, violent time at the movies."

","I liked the other Tarantino films, but was greatly disappointed by this lastest work of his. This film is full of movie cliches, cheesy dialogues, and, at times, bad music -- esp. towards the end. The fighting scenes are bad imitations of HK martial art movies. Watching it feels like eating Americanized Chinese food, and the result is similar -- this film might appeal to a majority of the American audience, but not anyone with taste. Just compare it to any Jackie Chan classics. The only bright spot is the animation. Nice try, Tarantino, and to his credit his unique style still shows. But not a good film."

In despite of the accelerated speed the movie, Tarantino find some space to show his idea of violence; as in Pulp fiction, it's a terrible but sublime thing. The story of the movie is really perfect. The ""saga"" of a woman, and her desperate desire of vendetta. Uma really gets the character and it's spirit. The Bride couldn't be better.

I thought it brought something to the movie that, without it, would have made it just an ordinary gore fest.<br/><br/>I do question whether this movie really needed to be cut into two.  The fight with O-Ren's army could have been just as interesting if it had been cut by 75%.  At any rate, Uma pulled of the fighting beautifully.

"bix777","7","0","1","23 October 2003"," A bit confused....
","During the watching of this film, I got confused from time to time. What exactly was Quentin Tarantino (QT) trying to depict with this film? I was expecting the usual excellent QT dialogue, and there was some in Kill Bill, but it was not nearly up to usual QT standards ala ""Pulp Fiction"".<br/><br/>WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>I found the anime' sequence very disturbing, but not due to the violence. I would have much preferred that the action and plot line portrayed in the anime' done by live actors. I think that it would have carried much more weight. I realize that QT loves anime', and was trying to do his own homage to it, however, I found it to be an insult to my intelligence. Anime' is deliberately over the top in part because of the inherent brand of particular intensity of violence hidden in the Japanese psyche(this is not meant as a racist tone at all- I've studied Kendo and Iaido since 1989, and have had several Japanese friends, and seen their culture up close and personal). Not many Westerners really get what anime' is all about, just like a white boy from the suburbs really doesn't understand what South Central LA is about by listening to Snoop Dogg. Therefore, in Kill Bill, I found the use of anime' to be confusing, way over the top, ridiculous, and an insult all at the same time.<br/><br/>I'm a bit amused by some of the comments here that rave about how realistic the swordfighting scenes were. They were realistic only in the sense that most contests with the katana are decided with only one or two cuts, unless you are trying to wear down your opponent who is stronger than you with a sliding sayumen (cut to the forehead, in order to make the blood drip into your opponent's eyes, wearing them down). All of the Hollywood sword positions (way too low jodan no kamae (high on guard position)- at eye level, with blade across face- kind of like the homeboys who hold a pistol sideways- it accomplishes nothing- maybe looks cool to an amateur) were way overdone. Only Uma Thurman seemed to have taken whatever training that she was given seriously- she had the best chudan no kamae (middle on guard position) of the lot. Strangely enough, her character lacked kiai (fighting spirit- exhibited by a loud yell from the diaphragm at the stroke of the cut) though- I don't recall much of that from her. Her zanjin (remainder spirit) wasn't bad, though, and her shobori (a cut into thin air after an actual cut in order to cleanse the blood from the blad without touching it) was pretty good.<br/><br/>Why am I going into all of this detail? Because, QT was supposedly making a movie with a lot of expert swordplay, and I was confused and a bit disappointed by it all. I really wanted to see Uma ""tie a line of fishes"" as Kensei Miyamoto Musashi recommends when fighting a group of opponents- but, it was the same old ""everyone surround the hero, but attack only one at a time"" bit.<br/><br/>However, QT did redeem himself with the end scene. I don't know if he intentionally shot the climatic battle scene between Lucy Liu (outstanding job of acting) and Uma with the snow falling, with full realization of the hidden meanings. You see, white is the Japanese color for death (like black here in the West), and two determined people fighting to the death, surrounded by all of the death from the previous scene, while WHITE snow falls- the subtlety there was marvelous.<br/><br/>The plot line of ""The Bride"" was actually pretty good, but the pop in and out of violent scenes intermixed with everyday life was too much of a contrast, even for QT. When The Bride wakes up, it seems like a shot for shot reproduction of the Mia Wallace scene from ""Pulp Fiction"", though. The characters of Bill, the sheriff, the male rapist nurse, the assasins- all classic QT characters. I was hoping for a bit more development out of them, though- specifically Bill, The Bride, and each one of the assasination team. O-Ren (Liu)got the best characterization of all- and she's not the protagonist! What's up with that?<br/><br/>All in all, Kill Bill was OK, I guess- but it was not what I expected, and it is definitely not up to ""Pulp Fiction"" standards."
"CraigSmedley","6","0","1","23 October 2003"," Objectively, what's so excellent?
","Well, i have to say, there are a lot of people happy to call this one of the best movies ever made and that's unbelievable. To give a b-movie satire 10/10 is crazy and you've probably been seduced by the allure of the hip.<br/><br/>True, Tarantino is hip. He's more hip than any other filmmaker ever and his movies are so easy to love, but Kill Bill Vol. 1 is not an excellent movie. Perhaps if it is combined with it's upcoming sequel and many needlessly lengthy fight scenes are cut down to create a full movie with a decent amount of storyline, then it can be ranked at the height of b-movie satires, but that's not a 10/10.<br/><br/>I loved the introduction, the knife fight in the house and its dramatic climax was great and very well done. With humour, drama and action working excellently together, i figured i was in for a very unique and excellent movie. But, unfortunately for me, the drama died and the humour was reduced to laughing at the ludicrous amounts of blood lost and huge number of limbs amputated. This was funny, but pretty low brow.<br/><br/>The bleeping of The Bride's real name was great and showed courage and originality, the cheesy b-movie character names also worked very well, but the vast quantities of fight scenes were overwhelming and unnecessary. There's a great storyline under there about a woman who was wronged and needs revenge, but it is eclipsed often for 15-20 minutes at a time as our heroine goes to battle evil, or to get a samurai sword of unequalled quality.<br/><br/>I hated the anime part, that's just me (i always hate it) but in fairness it was done pretty well and fitted into the patchwork feel of the movie.<br/><br/>So, in summary, there were many good points to this movie, but its overall quality as a whole movie was most certainly not excellent. Unless you *love* a movie purely for the fact that it isn't afraid to do what's normally taboo.<br/><br/>Honestly, this was better than a lot of movies that come out of Hollywood so i'm giving it 7/10."
"hermes-10","9","0","1","27 October 2003"," another masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino
","What a brilliant movie! The visuals, acting, editing, music and story are just great. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and did not see any weak spots. One might think that a succession of fight scenes might get boring, but they just get better and better throughout the movie. It is visual poetry combined with humor. With his previous movies (Reservoir dogs, Pulp fiction and Jackie Brown) Quentin Tarantino has put the bar very high for himself, but he cleared it seemingly effortlessly. A 9 out of 10. Maybe it should have been a 10, but I don't give that easily for this genre."
"dfranzen70","9","0","1","23 October 2003"," Let the blood flow . .
","Quentin Tarantino's fourth movie (and first in five years) is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in years. It's also the most violent.<br/><br/>It's not just violent. It's Violent with a capital V. You could even capitalize the entire word, and you still wouldn't be scratching the surface of its violence. You thought Pulp Fiction was violent? Think again, brother. Kill Bill does for bloodletting what Jaws did for shark attacks, what Citizen Kane did for sleds, and what E.T. did for Reese's Pieces. It's so violent, it makes Night of the Living Dead look like Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, even if Fred Rogers donned a ski mask and went psycho with a meat cleaver in the Land of Make Believe.<br/><br/>I'm harping on the violence here; can you tell? I'm mentioning this because extreme violence is one of those qualities in a film that can divide the audience neatly: those that are repulsed by it, and those who are attracted to it.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman plays a flaxen-haired assassin who's bent on avenging her near death and the murder of her unborn child by the hands of her former elite-assassin teammates. Her story is told out of chronological order, a la Pulp Fiction, but not so jarringly; the audience is helped by onscreen titles explaining what time frame we're in.<br/><br/>Her character is one of an select group of killers that includes O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Viveca A. Fox), Budd (Michael Madsen), and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah); each member goes by a nom de guerre relating to a snake. Thurman's character is Black Mamba.<br/><br/>Her mission is simple. Find and kill each person who had left her for dead, leaving for the last their ringleader, Bill (David Carradine). Bill does not appear onscreen in this movie, but we do get to hear his voice, like Bosley on Charlie's Angels.<br/><br/>But as with most Tarantino films, including those he's influenced, the plot sometimes takes a back seat to style. That doesn't mean there's no substance at all, but with scenes as eye-popping (literally, in one case) as these, it's easy to lose oneself in sheer awe. From the very first scene - a real shocker - to the final, set-em-up scene, you just can't peel your gaze from the machismo and panache being exhibited onscreen.<br/><br/>The entire cast is incredible. Thurman's practically an old hand at this, having had a prominent role in Pulp Fiction; here, as the focal point of the movie - the heroine, sort of - she is more than up to the task. I saw nuances in her work here that I'd never seen before. And Lucy Liu? I must come clean and admit I've carried a torch for her for years, but this is easily her best work. Heavily layered, very finely characterized work. (She plays a part-Japanese, part-Chinese, part-American ruler of the Tokyo underworld, and she's damn good with cutlery, too.)<br/><br/>Now, as you may have guessed, this is not a movie for children. It's also not a movie for pregnant women, people with bad backs (the sudden moves you make when you jump out of your seat might make you slip a disc or two), people with weak hearts, the elderly, and Nervous Nellies. It's for everyone else, though. Boy, is it ever for everyone else! It's a potpourri of balletic swordsmanship, a feast for the eyes (there's that word again). Forget about the violence for a minute - this movie just plain rocks. And Sonny Chiba has a big role, too! You remember Sonny from his 1970s Street Fighter kung fu movies, right? He has a great role here, as the creator of the sword Black Mamba uses against her many enemies.<br/><br/>You'll notice the title implies this is not the last we'll see of Black Mamba, and you're right. Yes, it's a movie so big they had to split it in two, and Vol. 2 is due to be released in 2004.<br/><br/>But unlike, say, Back to the Future II, which existed purely as a setup for Back to the Future III, this one absolutely stands on its own. And that final scene, which I mentioned earlier, packs one hell of a wallop. I didn't see it coming, although looking back it's not an illogical surprise. (You can predict almost anything in movies if you really think about the movie, but who wants to? You're supposed to experience it as it's played out, not try hard to be three steps ahead of the characters.)<br/><br/>Tarantino's a connoisseur of genre films: caper films, blaxploitation films, martial arts films. His highly stylish touches and imaginative direction place this movie on a pedestal far higher than others of this type. Like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is in a league completely different from any other film."
"jazzest","8","0","1","23 October 2003"," Homage Collage with Visual Extravaganza
","As a homage collage with visual extravaganza, Kill Bill drives both die-hard cinephiles' brains and average filmgoers' adrenalins. Naturally it is gaining both critical acclaims and commercial success.<br/><br/>
There are some sore points in the screenplay. Many QT fans must be disappointed to find no witty dialogues, which have hugely contributed to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. This makes me wonder how much the dialogues in those earlier masterpieces relied on QT's ex-cowriter, Roger Avary. Also, his signature non-linear story structure seems meaningless this time. Obviously to build a climax, the less-engaged homage-to-blaxploitation chapter has to precede the highly-engaged homage-to-samurai-flick chapter in the film's timeline. It is pointless, however, to flip the revenge order in the protagonist Black Mamba's timeline; it is unnecessary for her to go to Japan first. If the reason is homage to non-linearly structured films including his own earlier works, I would call it autointoxication.<br/><br/>Conceptually Kill Bill is a film adaptation of American Pop Art, whose main focus is how to display sampled materials in new contexts. While it has been QT's significant weapon throughout his filmmaking career, he limitlessly enhanced this technique and almost exclusively used it to paint this extremely colorful picture. The film's uniqueness along with the director's well-known perfectionism had guaranteed its success even before the preproduction phase. Then, as expected, he left no flaws at least in the visuals qualities, overseeing cinematography, art direction, and costumes. In other words, Kill Bill was comparatively less challenging to QT; he just precisely executed what he knew and what he could. As he may not want to repeat this one-and-only collage piece, the next several films will test his real value as a director."
"sartois99","7","0","1","27 October 2003"," An adequate film, but nothing special.
","Hi,<br/><br/>I'd have to say that this film is merely adequate, and far from the revered masterpiece that some people would argue it to be. The plot is hideously simple and involves Uma Thurman gaining revenge for past misdeeds. Within the storyline there are also many gaping holes that are so damning that you have to accept them as part and parcel of the film. In essence therefore, this a simplistic revenge film that is partially a homage to samurai/sword movies but mostly an exercise in cool. Quentin would certainly like to sell himself as the ultimate purveyor of cool and in this film he has picked out the right music, genre, camera angles, close-ups, etc to make a 'cool' film. But viewed objectively, is a cool film actually a good film? Well, not really; as I said before, the plot is terrible, the acting poor and those elements that denote cool have been done better in other films.<br/><br/>Putting all these comments aside and ignoring it's failings, it's an entertaining swordplay film that has a good soundtrack and if is going to be watched, should be watched in a cinema with the biggest screen and best sound system you can find. I cannot say however that it's a good film; it's an adequate film that merely combines good elements from other genres and films, but whilst at the same time sacrificing the story - this film is certainly less than the sum of its parts."

"pharmaci911","Null","0","1","23 October 2003"," Good movie, but an overrated one...
","This was a good and exciting movie, full of great moments that has a lot going for it. The Cinematography and score were the best ever. But the problems stick out just like one of Uma Thurman's sore toes. Stuff like this becomes forgetable and self indulgent to say the least. There are valid reasons why I think this one's vastly overrated. Read on, I put a lot of thought into it.<br/><br/>(WARNING, MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!)<br/><br/>1# reason: Tarantino is having fun with himself at the expense of his audience. The audience I saw it felt cold and indifferent to the character of the Bride. Her logic, although justified, somehow seemed forced. For me the design of the story is the culprit, not Uma Thurman's performance. She was great but lacks the screen precense and charisma to truly make her an iconic character.<br/><br/>Bummer. #2 reason: Could anyone explain how can a skinny white girl survive that beating, awaken from a four year comma, suddenly remember what happened to her, and rehabilitate herself. All during the span of one day? Come on! The joke's on us and we bought it. This belongs in an 80's action movie and if it's intentional then I got lost on that one. If it's Arnold or Stallone then we I could beleive that, but Uma Thurman...No way.<br/><br/>#3 reason: The handling of the O ren ishi character. Bar none Lucy Liu is the best thing about this movie. Whenever she's onscreen the energy level goes up. Her story actually made me feel empathy for her character and I thought she was the superior swordswoman vs the bride. The bride beat her because of the Hanzo steel not the sword skills!<br/><br/>But after such a great set up why did Tarantino kill her off like that? Exposed brains cheapens the character and that's so unsatisfying. Why didn't he stick to the Samurai ethics and have her die a more honorable death is beyond me.<br/><br/>#4 reason: There is a fine line between theft and paying homage. I've seen everything in this movie done better and more effective in films of directors like Suzuki Seijun and Kinji Fukasaku. The fact that he copied their superior movies isn't the point, it's how he used the theft that cheapens it. It's like he went ballistic and tried to top these masters with his $55 million budget. He's all technique and sloppy execution.<br/><br/>#5 and last reason: The story. I reserve judgement till I see the resolution, but I say the story doesn't warrant a three hour movie. This is a trend of many directors who have final cut. PT Anderson comes to mind. As a genre movie about revenge it doesn't earn it.<br/><br/>As a whole, this movie could have been a smashing 139 minutes had they cut off Vivica Fox's character and peripheral stuff and just concentrated on the Bill and O ren Ishii characters. Miramax robbed me for paying twice to see one movie. Once again the joke's on us, the audience. But like I said, I give Tarantino benefit of the doubt and juicy stuff might come on volume 2.<br/><br/>There you have it. Those are my reasons. The movie will make a truckload of money but that won't hide the fact that this movie sucks. I'll skip vol 2 and rent Sword of vengance instead. Now that's a Samurai movie!"
"bdiablo151","6","0","1","23 October 2003"," Not Violent Enough
","I finally went to see Kill Bill yesterday at my local googolplex, I had high hopes due to all of the press it had been getting, being called the most gory, bloody, and violent film ever made, well Just off the top of my head the original Nightmare on Elm Street beats it for blood and gore hands down.<br/><br/>There is a lot of blood in Kill Bill, to be sure, so much that they converted a few minutes of the film to black and white to reduce the impact. But blood is not gore, there are only like 4 or 5 gory moments in the film, the rest of it is all blood.<br/><br/>Like my title said it wasn't violent enough, but maybe I need to qualify that statement, it wasn't brutal enough.  Hell, violence could be just people yelling if it's filmed properly.  Brutality is another thing all together, violence in a film keeps people watching, brutality makes them wince and turn away.<br/><br/>So as far as violence goes, Reservoir Dogs was a more violent film, when you look at all the yelling Harvey Keitel does, than Kill Bill.<br/><br/>All in all this film rates above Jackie Brown, but way way below Reservoir Dogs, and Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>6/10"
"BobsBrotherFutureman","10","0","1","23 October 2003"," Nothing short of a masterpiece
","I was lucky enough to have seen Kill Bill the night it was released and with that, I was so blown away I had to see it again the following day. I am sure you all know the plot so I will not bore you with a summary. The opening of the film grabs us immediately and does not let go. In fact it hasent and will not until we see Volume 2.<br/><br/>For those afraid that Quentin Tarrentino lost his swing, fear not. His love for old film certainly shines through. He distorts the scenes as he did in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and leaves us off with a cliffhanger that would make The Wachowski Brothers blush.<br/><br/>The film certainly is violent beyond all reason. Many are calling this the most violent American film ever made and i find it hard to disagree. Still, a fair amount of the violence is done in such a surreal and stylized way that it wont give us nightmares. All the ladies look like they endured months of training and it<br/><br/>shows.  The film is so epic and beautiful that it is in the ranks of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, not a simple low brow cliche rip off as some may think from seeing trailers.  Sure the film is unrealistic but campy it is not. Everything is so well done we are not bothered too much by Uma Thurman fighting and killing all 88 of the Crazy 88s.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is simply beautiful, it sets the mood for the scenes so well that all filmmakers should take note.<br/><br/>This is one of those films I can only recommend seeing on the big screen a few times.  The cinematography and editing are some of the best ive seen in recent years and aside from The Magdalene Sisters, this is the best movie I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Nicks Rating: 10/10"

","As much as I enjoyed his previous films, I wouldn't exactly say I'm a great fan of Quentin Tarantino. After seeing Kill Bill Vol. 1, I would say he's one of the greatest writers of our time.<br/><br/>The plot and story has been detailed elsewhere, so I will simply give my impressions of the movie.<br/><br/>For starters, it has literally been years since I walked out of a cinema smiling, gushing and feeling inspired. It's not an original movie, and in many ways the style outweighs the substance, but it was so brilliantly executed that you can't help but feel wowed by it. The impressive fight scene is very similar to that in Matrix Reloaded, although it actually engages the audience with humour and peril rather than simply trying to dazzle them with special effects. Like that scene, it does go on a bit too long, but the duel afterwards makes it worthwhile.<br/><br/>The music throughout is perfect, the animated portion was stunning and I even found myself lusting after Daryl Hannah, who would've thought it was possible?!?<br/><br/>So yeah, while I avoid adding to hype to save people being disappointed, I really do suggest you see this movie. In a cinema if you can."

","If you have not already, GO SEE `Kill Bill Vol. 1'!!! I have only written about a movie once before and that was to rant on the insulting lack of effort Lucas put into Star Wars: Episode 1: The Phantom Menace. A `film' when compared to its Star Wars predecessors, I judged to be a sophomoric video game on crack only worth seeing for the stellar computer effects. Kill Bill is the opposite, Tarantino put his heart and soul into this film and it shows.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol. 1 is the most enjoyable and visually stunning action film I have ever seen. Quentin Tarantino's visual craftsmanship transcends perfection. From the first seconds of the opening scene to the credits it's a 111 minute hold-your-breath, armrest-clenching, roller coaster ride. Tarantino takes all that is great from the Japanese classics (Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Lone Wolf and Cub, etc.) and the violent beauty of Sergio Leone's films, adds his own bold style and visual genius and creates THE perfect action film. It's a violent, poignant, funny, film with great acting (always a bonus in an action film) that is worth seeing multiple times."

","Kill Bill is probably the most outlandishly silly tribute to good old time kung fu movies. full of insane amounts of blood (no, not gory blood, silly blood), and not too much dialogue, it's so over the top you'll either laugh yourself silly, or leave early. I stayed, and am glad i did, though wondering, since the Japanese version has even more blood throughout, where would they put it? <br/><br/>The only part i wasnt' as impressed with, was when the direction of the movie got down to the hard plot. it seemed to lag in some parts, or decide on taking too much of the story in detail. but maybe that's just me. the silly action sequences and sarcastic wit, pop culture references in the background (her heartbeat at 69!) more than made up for what was lacking.<br/><br/>
 i think alot of people were going into this expecting another Resevoir Dogs, or Pulp Fiction. These movies are similar, but this is borderline comedy, where the other two are overtly sarcastic.<br/><br/>I would have been ready to sit through the other half, by the time the movie ended.."

Some didn't like it because they were thinking too much about his past projects like Pulp Fiction and Resevoir Dogs. This film is not like these. I liked this film as it shows a different side and talent to Tarantino, and shows he can write and direct anything. Other people didn't like the film because they said it didn't make sense, but this is because the film hasn't even finished yet! The directing style is definitely there, but if you're expecting a story like Pulp Fiction, then you may be disappointed. Ignore that factor. Not Tarantino's best i'll agree, but good none the same.

"phil0011","10","0","1","24 October 2003"," Violent, bloody, brilliant.
","10/10 I don't think I've seen a film this well made in a long, long time. Every shot seems to be a masterful stroke by Quentin Tarantino, and everything is framed beautifully by the cinematographer, Robert Richardson. I think this is one of the most wonderful looking film I've seen since The Thin Red Line. Also, like The Matrix before it, this is a master class in style; what takes this film above the Matrix, however, is Tarantino's ability to write wonderfully entertaining dialogue (rather than philosophical meandering and musings in The Matrix). You only need to go look on the 'memorable quotes' section of this page to realise the pure joy you can get from Tarantino's writing. What we are looking at during Kill Bill is a man that has very nearly perfected the art of direction.<br/><br/>There is a warning that must come to you people that haven't seen Kill Bill yet: you will be soaked with violence and blood. However, the violence here is not intended to shock you. Tarantino even decided to do one of the more horrific scenes in the movie (a young girl who sees her parents murdered) in manga animation. Whether he solely did this to lessen the shock value of the scene (which it does) is debatable  I imagine he also wanted to pay homage to Japanese manga animation. Which brings me on to this  the whole film is one giant homage to Japanese samurai/Hong Kong kung-fu films, to Akira Kurosawa (amongst other great Japanese directors), to Sergio Leone and to many others whose films have brought us great joy by watching two people hit each other, really rather hard. Tarantino even includes a wonderfully inventive and kooky device in which he bleeps out the real name of Uma Thurman's character whenever it is spoken. Even something as subtle as this is what separates Tarantino from everyone else; he's never afraid to be a little different.<br/><br/>There is one beautiful scene, during which Lucy Lui and Uma Thurman go head-to-head (this after one very long and very blood-soaked fight scene). Tarantino frames every shot perfectly, and with a great touch  in an unforgettable ten-minute long scene - has snowflakes slowly falling down as the girls feet crunch into the fallen snow around them.<br/><br/>This is one of the best 'action' films I've ever seen, perfectly balancing the emotion, the action, and the comedy. While this is not as good as Pulp Fiction (whose complex storyline reshaped 90's cinema, and provided a film our generation could call, 'revolutionary'), it is Tarantino's second best film. The question now is, will Kill Bill Vol. 2 open its credits with: 'The 5th Film by Quentin Tarantino'? Either way, let's just hope it is not his last.<br/><br/>I gave this film 10/10"

","I am not the average Tarantino fan.   Reservoir Dogs was an excellent film exploring alot of realism, Pulp Fiction was just a good film and there's nothing else I can say about that, Jackie Brown I think is Tarantino's best work with a killer soundtrack until I saw Kill Bill. before entering the cinema to see this latest offering from QT I was expecting an ok film with alot of good action scenes, but what I got was something completely different.   the opening scene was quite scary and disturbing with the Bride just laying there battered and bruised and the second the gun shot to her head goes off everyone just jumped out of their seats including me, and from then on in I was expecting something special because the moment Nancy Sinatra started Singing the words to Bang Bang I was hooked and it didn't stop to the very end.  <br/><br/>Everyone I have spoken to about the movie have mix feelings, but I can't get it out of my head.   I just saw it as a present day Sergio Leone western with a hint of The Swordsmen.   You either hate QT or you love him and after watching this I think he is nothing but of pure genius.   I mean he has taken all the great concepts of all his favourite films and put them to together to make one, but what is so bad about that.   Every film maker is inspired by somebody and they take there heroes ideas and put them into there own films, like Martin Scorsese, Leone and even Spielberg. <br/><br/>
Kill Bill does leave you annoyed in a way because like Matrix Reloaded it leaves you wanting more and feeling angry you have to wait 5-6 months to see what happens next, but I actually like that because it gives you time to reflect on the the first volume of the film which I have really enjoyed, but it is hard to to judge Kill Bill because it's not actually a film, it's the first half of a film, but from what I have seen already I shall leave it in my head that what I have seen so far is nothing short of a Masterpiece."
"FilmOtaku","10","0","1","23 October 2003"," The wait was more than worth it
","Being a Tarantino fan going way back to the early 1990's, I probably was more cynical and critical going into this film than those who may have discovered him during his Pulp Fiction heyday.  From the first seconds of this film however, you know that you are in for a wild ride, and I fell in love immediately.<br/><br/>Admittedly, this film had a couple of strikes against it before I saw it.  I am *not* a fan of Uma Thurman, and I was not crazy about the Tarantino/Miramax decision to turn his one film into two.  Now is my time to (delightedly) admit that I am wrong.  Thurman's `The Bride' exudes so much strength and power that I could almost see the testosterone dripping from her.  Not only did Thurman handle this multi-dimensional role, she *owned* it.  I want a `Bride' action figure for my car dashboard.  I want to be `The Bride' for Halloween. My adulation of this character is unprecedented since the age of oh, 4 years old when I wanted to be Princess Leia.  I found myself emulating Uma with any stick or vaguely sword-like object for the next week like some kind of drooling fan-girl.  Additionally, the decision to turn this into two films was indeed a wise one.  As a three hour film, this film would have caused spontaneous combustion of random movie goers due to sensory overload.  While watching this film, I still had a nagging feeling of dread that the ending would be unsatisfactory, but without providing a hint of a spoiler, you can trust me that it was *very* satisfactory and clean.<br/><br/>As for the direction itself, Tarantino proved his mettle as a master.  Kill Bill is stylish, action-packed, humorous and intelligent.  Above all, it is just plain *cool*.  Once again, Tarantino provides us with a film laden with pop-culture and a killer soundtrack that accompany the scenes brilliantly. While the entire film is superb, the last final major scene in the House of Blue Leaves is like a 30 minute orgasm.  The various trailers and television commercials feature certain parts of this scene, but blessedly do not give away the full impact the entire scene has on the viewer.  The incredible blocking and the rapid fire change in cinematography are two elements that make this scene so good it is literally shocking.  An honorable mention for the un-win-able fight for greatest scene in the film is the anime sequence: a remarkable, shocking and most of all, creative method of telling O-Ren's back story.<br/><br/>There is so much more to applaud about Kill Bill, but it is truly a film that needs to be experienced in order to understand why it is a brilliant piece of filmmaking.  It is easily my favorite film of 2003 and finally brings back masterful imagination and fun to cinema.  Kill Bill is like a love poem to the great martial arts movies of the 60's & 70's and it made me fall in love with Tarantino all over again.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","When I said that I 'didn't really like Kill Bill' I was met with confused and often offensive retorts. I acknowledged the style, I took on board the cinematic quality and merit. I grimaced, jumped and became enthralled in what has been billed as THE film of the year. However, for me, it didn't seem to click. It had everything I needed but it felt lacking. Tarantino's quirky dialogue was sporadic and often abscence, although its merit in this picture could be questioned. I also became bored and my mind wandered as The Bride took the length of my life to get Hattori Hanzo out of retirement to then construct her weapon of choice. It seems that this will indeed as the title reads require a second viewing and hopefully results will vary."

Kung-fu movies have already been seen, in the ´70s AND the ´90s. A couple of years ago it was sort of refreshing to see the old ideas being warmed up again using new technology but enough is enough.

"notarepublican","10","0","1","21 October 2003"," Simply Awesome, Pop and High Culture Seamlessly Combined into a New Cinematic Form
","The 70s are often lauded as the era in which American cinema first reached the status of art as a new breed of director/auteur snatched the reins of film making from the old studio system.  Lucas and Spielberg and the emergence of the modern blockbuster would mark the end of that era, as the corporatization of the movie industry would reshape the very rationale for filmmaking itself. The work of contemporary directors like Tarantino, Fincher, Smith, Favreau, etc. may now be categorized as a new cinematic form, one that self-consciously reflects an appreciation for film in all of its varied manifestations.  While Coppola, et al honed their craft under Corman, their later work abandoned the simple forms of exploitation cinema.  Tarantino, more than any of his contemporaries, found something to appreciate in all forms, and nowhere is that more evident than in ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1."" While his previous work embraced 70s film aesthetic, here Tarantino is wearing his heart and influences on his sleeve. ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" is a modern spaghetti western with heavy Asian influences.  The film follows the path of revenge taken by a character referred to a both ""The Bride"" and ""Black Mambo,"" her code name as a member of DiVAS (The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad).  The DiVAS are a parallel universe version of Charlie's Angels, a genius conceit through which Tarantino also takes issue with modern cinematic violence.  ""KBV1"" is one of the most violent major American films of all time, but its bloody aesthetic stands in sharp, unsanitized contrast with the modern film versions of ""Charlie's Angels"", where the protagonists often engage in bloodless unarmed combat, and violence is easily dismissed as something can occur without the benefit of permanent injury if not death.  In some sense, the exaggerated gore in ""KBV1"" serves as a constant reminder that combat is rarely bloodless, and always injures someone, whether physically or spiritually. All this aside, I can't recall a more enjoyable time spent at the movies.  The plot is crisp, the acting fantastic, and the action scenes are unbelievable.  The back stories are alternately tragic and touching, with O-Ren Ishii origin story and The Bride's encounter with Hattori Hanzo being particular standouts.  This is film as it should be, artfully constructed, without drawing attention to the often arbitrary distinctions between high and pop art.  This film in particular forever shatters the significance of that distinction."

","<POSSIBLE SPOILERS> Oooh baby!  I've been a fan of Quentin Tarantino since I first saw RESIVOR DOGS over ten years ago.  In my Intro. to Cinema class I took my freshman year at college, in the fall of '94, I did a report on RESIVOR DOGS. When I was asked by my classmates on what film I was doing my report on, I replied RESIVOR DOGS, directed by Quentin Tarantino.  I got a blank and expressionless reaction after saying that, with a response of ""who's he?"" I had to answer, ""he's the man who wrote NATURAL BORN KILLERS,"" to get a full response from the classmate. Then two months later to my pleasure and enjoyment, Quentin Tarantino became a household name, and PULP FICTION would change cinema history. Then to my displeasure, EVERYBODY loved PULP FICTION.  People would dress up like the characters, quote the movie, even explain philosophical sub-text of the movie. The film attracted the same people who thought Ferris Buller was a ""righteous dude"": sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, waistoids, dweebies, etc. In the later part of 1994 until 1996, a cinema geek couldn't go anywhere without hearing the name Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino surprised everybody with his follow-up to PULP FICTION with JACKIE BROWN, a well done and intelligent homage to the blaxploitation film of the 1970's.  A majority of the people that were attracted to Tarantino from PULP FICTION (like the people associated with Ferris Buller) felt Tarantino didn't have what it took to make a entertaining movie.  But JACKIE BROWN did deliver a great story with detailed characters and great dialogue. It was just a film that needed to be seen more than once to enjoy.  Years later rumors and spectulation began to arise on Tarantino's whereabouts. Causing a mystery surrounding a man who was claimed to be the man who ""talked too much."" Now, 2003, six years later, Tarantino returns with his 4th film, KILL BILL, and for those who felt Tarantino ""lost his touch"" will be reborn again, and for those like me, who always enjoyed all of Tarantino's films, will have their expectations surpassed with this film. The plot for KILL BILL Vol. 1 is very simple, it's a revenge story. However, since Tarantino directs the film, it's not important on what the story is about, but how the story is told.  Look at RESIVOR DOGS and PULP FICTION.  Both films have stories that are pretty simple, a diamond hiest gone wrong, and two men delivering a briefcase to their boss.  But seeing the way the storyteller tells those stories is what makes Tarantino a brilliant director. The story is about The Bride (AKA Black Mamba; Uma Thurman) is shot and left for dead on her wedding day.  The Bride was attacked by the team she use to work for The Deadly Vemon Viper Squad: O-Ren Ishii/Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu); Vernita Green/Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox); Budd/Sidewinder (Michael Madsen); Elle Driver/California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah); and their leader, Bill (David Carradine).  Four years later, the bride comes out of her coma and immediately seeks revenge on the people that tried to kill her. But, since this is a Tarantino film there is his usual style of filmmaking including: fantastic shots, complex characters, great dialogue and monologues, a groovy soundtrack, wonderful settings, and even a style of its own. The characters are explained their background in detail as well. However, with BILL the actors then display impressive and amazing acrobatic movement as they fight. Tarantino even does a Jean Luc-Godard approach by manipulating the audience with having total control of the film and even the viewers.  Such a case is by having the dialogue of the Bride character name ""Bleep"" out when characters speak it.  It similar to the ""what's in the briefcase"" theory of PULP FICTION, it's left up to the viewers opinion.  Then there is the tast of retro-feel with the beginning title have the ""Shaw Scope"" and the 70's style music and title card with the words ""Our Feature Presentation"" appear. And like a Tarantino film, watching the film a second time around, one could pick up on things that they missed. (i.e. CHAPTER ONE- 2 <the number 2 is circled>). There is the flashy and stylish scenes, such as when O-Ren Ishii and her crew, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), and others as they arrive at ""The House of the Blue Leaves.""  With the people moving in slow-motion to the cool beat of Tomoyasu Hotei's ""Battle Without Honor of Humanity,"" then Tarantino giving the film a great tracking shot following the character's around the club. Should I not forget the fight scenes?  Which I say make THE MARTIX RELOADED look pale in comparision (since the MATRIX resorted to being a philosophy movie instead of action) and even surpasses the upcoming LAST SAMUARI with Tom Cruise (yes, I've already seen that film and KILL BILL's fight scenes are more impressive).  And why shouldn't they be, it was advised by the legendary Woo-ping Yuen who also did all three MATRIX films and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON.  Yet, while the Wachowski focused on the complex meaning and mystery of what the Matrix is, and give less action, Tarantino gives more action and having the viewer decide the meaning, which makes the film more meaningful and<br/><br/>enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, I highly enjoy MATRIX and MATRIX RELOADED, but the action in those films are not as impressive as KILL BILL. Then there is the discussion of blood, is there a lot?  Well, the blood ratio in this film makes PULP FICTION look like a PG13 film, and no I'm not kidding.  There is blood in this film, a lot of blood.  Then Tarantino hints to the audience that the blood factor shouldn't be taken seriously, such as a decapitation with blood shooting out like a fountain.  That obviously could never happen, we know that and Tarantino knows it, and makes that point clearly with this film.  Tarantino even makes it more clear about the violence by having a Japanesse animatied sequence showing massive blood and violence.  Yet to inform the audience that it shouldn't be taken seriously. I haven't been excited watching a movie the second time around more than the first time since last years GANGS OF NEW YORK.  This was one fantastic and highly entertaining film.  It's a point that most Hollywood and studio filmmakers should acknowlege when it comes to filmmaking.  It's not important on what the story is about, but how you tell the story. Tarantino believes in that statement and it shows with KILL BILL.  My only complaint is that I could have easily watched another 100 minutes or so of this film being how entertaining it is.  I will say this and stand by this comment.  I think KILL BILL would be more entertaining as a whole than watching any one of the LORD OF THE RINGS films. Which isn't really a fair statement to make, but as for pacing and enjoyment, it is a true statement.<br/><br/>It's a shame that Tarantino doesn't release Vol. 2 by December 31st, since the quality and satisfaction Vol. 1 shows, it could have easily been a contender for this years Oscars.  I might be dreaming and off in la-la land thinking of that statement, KILL BILL nominated for Best Picture, since there is a lot of violence (the Academy ignored the modern masterpiece CITY OF GOD).  But hey, PULP FICTION was nominated for Best Picture.  With the exception of SEABISCUIT, LOST IN TRANSLATION, RETURN OF THE KING, FINDING NEMO, MYSTIC RIVER and maybe LAST SAMUARI and MASTER AND COMMAND, is there any other film that should be nominated for Best Picture?  Until then, if KILL BILL gets any awards or not, there will be a following for it for the next couple of years, making the PULP FICTION following becomming a thing of the past.  ***** (out of five)"
"WheezyJoe","10","0","1","21 October 2003"," Wham, Bam, Thank You Mam!
","I love the way Quentin Tarantino knows how to open a movie. I was anticipating a patented face-slapper of an opening sequence and boy did I get it. The movie starts with a quote, `Revenge is a dish best served cold' - a Klingon proverb, taken straight from the movie `Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.' Now, from this point, before the movie had actually begun, I was ecstatic with anticipation. To quote from Star Trek as if it where history was just way too cool for thought. And the following scene, a singular shot of a bloodied Uma Thurman as 'The Bride' shown in Black and White, manages<br/><br/>to sum up the tone of `Kill Bill' right from the get go.<br/><br/>
And bang, you're in. The film wastes no time heating up the screen and getting right into the thick of things. Violently tolerant Tarantino commands your attention with every last shot. It's a return to his infamous form whilst also creating something original and challenging. His approach to this film is unlike any of his previous efforts. It's a little less concerned with itself and is vamped up to ballistic mode. This time around he has spent a lot of vigour tweaking the visuals and bending the style to his own unique fashion. Elements that were not so important in his other films have come to be vital in the telling of `Kill Bill.' The colour, tones, choreography, design and the explicit attention to detail all convey a very precise pitch of expression. For a change this film is without much of the usual attention to dialogue Tarantino gives, he instead focuses that energy carefully on movement and body language. The dialogue this time supports the film and doesn't carry it.<br/><br/>Director Quentin Tarantino is a film buff at heart and finds pleasure in identifying that in a personal way channeling it through his films. Flying at ya from every avenue possible in the medium (visuals, audio, etc.) are references, homage's and clichés in every shape and form. It's one thing to visually reference something or indicate it through dialogue; it's another to feel it. And music does just that. Together with RZA, Tarantino once again shows you the power of music in motion pictures. The music changes, sometimes dramatically, but never feels wrong. Like the very story itself the song and score selection takes obvious inspiration from cult genres such as Spaghetti Westerns and classic Kung Fu pictures. And like the movie the styles change and weave in and out in perfect rhythm that, on its own manages to inspire.<br/><br/>The fourth film by Quentin Tarantino is grandeur filmmaking from the master. His directing style is incomparable and proves that he is indeed the commander of his own domain. I'm in awe of the way he has made this film and believe now, more strongly than ever, that he is a rare maverick in the world of cinema. This film is wonderful martial arts mayhem in an organized and timely manner. How can I say this, there's plenty of kung fu but it's not a kung fu movie. It's something unto it's own. `Kill Bill: Volume 1' is respectful of the many genres and cultural styles found here, and has evolved these old influences into a new breed of film. The biggest annoyance though is that even with the knowledge that `Kill Bill: Volume 2' is to come early next year the ending was still too abrupt. It just stops without warning or closure. It's as though Tarantino literally snipped the movie in two. Oh well. The action is a warm change from the CGI (computer generated image) revolution `The Matrix' brought with it, I think because it's all so very traditional. `Kill Bill' is a smart, witty over the top action spectacle that will knock you flat. It's extra violent though so be warned if you can't stand the sight of blood. This isn't `Pulp Fiction' - phase 2, it's `Kill Bill' a whole new chapter in the book of Tarantino, one worth reading over and over and over again. Now bring on Volume 2 you scumbag!<br/><br/>

","IT SLICES!!! IT DICES!!! IT JULIENNES!!!! Ron Popeil's latest kitchen invention? No, we're not talking infomercial here, but the 4th film by tyro filmbuff-turned-filmmaker Quentin Tarantino: ""Kill Bill.""<br/><br/>If the opening line of this review made you chuckle even a little, then you are already in the right frame of mind to watch this movie. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then every director from Woo to DePalma to Scorsese, Leone and at least half the working directors in Hong Kong, will get a major case of ""swelled-head syndrome"" watching this movie. Quentin has begged, borrowed and stolen from the best with this, and what he has wrought is one of the best examples of live-action anime ever done...even with a top-notch short anime feature thrown in, that would've been powerfully effective all by itself.<br/><br/>Unless you've been living in a cave outside Iran for the past month, you already know the basics about the story: The Bride, a.k.a. Black Mamba (Quentin's muse, Uma Thurman), was once the lead member of the DiVAS, or Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Once she got preggers, though, it was all over but the garroting, as she decided to retire from the business of butchering, settle down and become a nice little housewife.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, her former boss and lover, the ""Bill"" of the title, (the barely visible but very sinister David Carradine), doesn't have a very rewarding retirement plan, as Mamba finds out to her chagrin, when Bill sends her associates to the wedding rehearsal to give her a real sendoff. As in PERMANENT.<br/><br/>But this Bride takes a lickin' and keeps on kickin'. Even after being brutally beaten, bludgeoned and even shot in the head by Mr. Bill himself, (not to mention having her comatose body sold into sexual slavery), Mamba has the wherewithal to survive for four years after the fact, get back on her feet, and go after her would-be killers one by one.<br/><br/>
Volume One finds her pursuing the first two targets on her ""Death List"": Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox,) who herself has become Little Miss Suzy Homemaker (and you oughta see the way she has around the kitchen!), and probably her most formidable opponent, the deadly Queen of the Tokyo Underworld, O-Ren Ishii, superbly played (of course!) by ""CHARLIE'S ANGELS"" alum Lucy Liu. And take my word for it, she's no ""Angel"" here. What her character is, though, is the subject of the startlingly good 'anime' portion of the movie, a revenge story in itself as brutal and disturbingly beautiful as the one that surrounds it.<br/><br/>And no, as a now-often run scene from the preview suggests--the goal of The Bride's quest is not as easy to achieve as it may sound. Before the well-earned dessert of O-Ren's bloody demise, there is still the appetizer: an incredible battle with insane schoolgirl and Ishii's bodyguard/assassin, Go-Go Yubari, (Chiaki Kuriyama), who has a way with a ball-and-chain that no mere parochial student should. And the main course: one of the most violent setpieces ever commended to celluloid, Black Mamba's epic battle with O-Ren's personal army, the Crazy 88's (at which point, those not well-versed in anime, uncut samurai movies, or the skittishly squeamish should leave the theater IMMEDIATELY.) If anyone was wondering why there were so many audible chuckles during the credits, when the words ""Special Makeup Effects by KNB Studios"" flashed across the screen, this scene will solve the mystery for you.<br/><br/>Welcome to FanBoy Heaven. We have always known about Quentin's love of the art and artifice of ""grindhouse"" classics, the kung-fu action and exploitation films that were the staples of a lot of Saturday mornings for red-blooded American moviewatching males. What makes ""Bill"" so special is what drives the film so relentlessly: Tarantino's unbridled, and thoroughly un-jaded enthusiasm, which its beating (and yes, bleeding) heart. All the excited, long-after-midnight discussions about the fantastical images every fanboy would love to see if THEY could only make the ""ultimate"" movie, is exactly what Quentin has done, and those audience members who just don't get it, probably never will.<br/><br/>Witness all the homages on hand, from the themes resurrecting the dusty ghosts of ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,"" ""Ironside"" and ""The Green Hornet,"" to direct lifts from Tobe Hooper's ""Eaten Alive,"" Brian De Palma's ""Dressed To Kill,"" and Scorsese's ""Casino."" And you couldn't possibly miss the cackles of glee that must've echoed across the ""Bill"" set, as he directed scenes with yet another legendary childhood idol: the Toshiro Mifune of the ninjitsu grindhouse drama, Sonny Chiba, who stars here as the reincarnation of his most beloved character, Hattori Hanzo, ""the Man from Okinawa,"" and a pivotal part of The Bride's quest for bad blood.<br/><br/>So for those who would whine about the lack of thorough character development, and deftly written plot points, LOOK ELSEWHERE. ""Kill Bill"" is more style than substance, because that's exactly what it's all about. Personally, the intellectual in me who loves ""Rashomon,"" ""Knife In the Water,"" ""The Piano"" and ""Day For Night,"" had a really difficult time respecting myself in the morning after seeing this.<br/><br/>But the Mr. Hyde half who loved ""Death Machines,"" ""Flying Fists of Fury,"" ""Enter The Dragon"" and ""Cleopatra Jones,"" grinned maniacally back at me from the mirror, already capering with glee at the prospect of ""Kill Bill, Volume Two."" (Next on the Death List: Ellie Driver (Darryl Hannah), the sexy nurse with a blood-curdling bedside manner, Budd, a.k.a Sidewinder (RESERVOIR DOGS alum Michael Madsen), the only male DiVA in the group, and of course, Big Bill himself.)<br/><br/>So whether you take that as a recommendation or a warning, is completely up to you. The effect that seeing this may have will be no different."

","As if Pulp Fiction didn't confirm it, Kill Bill finally certifies Tarantino as a genius.  What is a genius?  Someone who possesses uncanny knowledge of his medium, and has the inborn skills to master and tranform his artform.<br/><br/>With Kill Bill, Tarantino references everything from grindhouse cinema, to sphaghetti Westerns, to early Brian De Palma, giallos, and even Kurosawa's Samurai movies.  However, in the process of referencing these movies, what makes Tarantino so brilliant is that he reveals the artificiality of movies, thus forcing us to laugh at, instead of be repulsed by, the copious amounts of gore and bloodshed.  Why?  Because all the spurting limbs, beheadings, and scalpings exist in a parallel, cinematic universe totally divorced from the real world.<br/><br/>To prove this point, Tarantino opens with a scene of intense bloodshed, which culminates in the Bride's first victim lying in a pool of blood, and a pool of ""Kaboom"" cereal.  The cereal, with its fake facade, and sugary coating, is the ultimate symbol of the pop-culture world of movies which Kill Bill exists in.  Just like the tacky cereal, the violence and blood in Kill Bill is so over-the-top that anyone who takes it seriously is totally misguided.<br/><br/>So, for anyone who argues that Kill Bill is too violent, they should stop eating cereal, and leave the rest of us to indulge in our junk food!<br/><br/>That, I suspect, is why Kill Bill is receiving negative reviews from some highbrow critics (The New Yorker, anyone?).  Instead of referencing ""high"" art, such as Shakespeare and James Joyce, Kill Bill references what many refer to as trash cinema.  But, the true geniuses are the ones, who, like Tarantino, see the beauty in popular culture.<br/><br/>Kill Bill proves that Tarantino is both insane, and brilliant.<br/><br/>I also suspect that after Kill Bill, Tarantino may head in a completely different direction, as he may run out of things to reference, or he may start referncing his own movies.<br/><br/>To all the naysayers, go watch your six hour movies about rich snobs eating and killing the masses."

","You don't need a description of the plot.  You don't need to hear about how it's been released in two volumes.  You could certainly happily, no, joyfully live the rest of your life without ever hearing Kill Bill Vol.1 described as a cinematic 'homage', 'movie-movie', or any of the other scripted answers to scripted questions that Quentin Tarantino has sadly been forced to repeat endlessly.  You most definitely are no longer interested in the phallic symbolism of Samurai swords or Uma Thurman's tracksuit.  What is it that you really need to know? How will it make you feel? If you're anything like me, from the second you hear the siren wail as The Bride looks into Vernita Green's eyes, you will be entranced.  Your muscles will tense but when you notice you no longer care.  Any aches and pains will seem mere memories, shadows of what they were earlier that day.  Your eyes leap from one end of the screen to the other, the human muscles incapable of keeping up with the speed on screen.  You frequently see actions only as consequence; you were too busy reeling from the last scene to register Uma's sword movement when she chopped that writhing body to pieces.  Unable to keep still, you may start tapping a couple of fingers or biting your lip; by this time you will be perched on the edge of your cinema seat, craning forward to immerse yourself in the House of Blue Leaves, jerking back when Gogo descends a staircase swinging a lethal ball and chain.  Just as you feel you will never leave the cinema, when you reach the point that, if questioned, you would swear allegiance to The Bride and follow her trail of revenge blindly till your dying day, it ends. It's not enough, you are still tensed like an animal ready to attack. People around you start talking and, like a sick joke, you are hurtled back to the reality of a burgundy plastic seat with a slice in the cushioning. I know nothing about all these Kung-Fu films that Tarantino has been referencing - I can't even remember the name of the company who made the aforementioned siren sound their trademark a few decades ago.  I have never watched a Samurai film before, but if that was just a homage, my God, I'm going to start."

","In true Quentin Tarantino form, this film takes you for a ride into uncharted territory. Twisting and turning down a narrow mountain pass in the dead of night, blind folds on, at Mach I with your hair on fire.<br/><br/>The gore is disturbingly funny, almost of Monty Python genre. Several times I laughed out loud during the film, while most of the theatre was quite, in shock I suppose. Uma pulled off her part in a most convincing manner, you believe she could kill you with the wink of an eye. Much better than Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider. Uma was scary and sexy at the same time.

"Bailiff","10","0","1","20 October 2003"," Isn't this the ultimate definition of 'cult film'?
","I'll make this short since no one wants to read another acting/cinematography/tone/story/direction recap...Kill Bill is so fantastically vibrant and different from most (all) American action movies today that it's no wonder so many people (arthouse snobs *cough*) DESPISE it. I mean, being neutral to it is fine, disliking it, sure, but to hate it on the level some people do...well, I question their priorities, it is just a movie, after all.<br/><br/>The film is one big homage, like it or not.  It's all style, cold stares, quirky humor, dizzying fight scenes.  A wee bit of editing might have helped a tad I guess, but this is Tarantino, for god's sake...yes, naysayers have established time and again that he's often self-indulgent, but who cares? He's good at what he does.  And to endlessly compare him to Kubrick (demigod to many film buffs) or any other director is pointless.<br/><br/>Quentin wanted to make a film that was a sort of lovechild of all his fond memories of watching old-school martial arts and samurai epics...that means minimalist dialogue (and any dialogue has to have some sense of self-aware homage), buckets of spraying blood, and fighting, lots of fighting.  If QT had put his usual prophet chic into Kill Bill, it wouldn't have worked...like he said in several interviews, KB takes place in a twisted universe different from our own, even different from the 'magical realism' of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction (by the way, Jackie Brown is not his best work, as so many non-fans love to espouse for some reason.  It was a misfire, a well-intentioned one though).<br/><br/>To be fair, I think the fact the movie was 'split in two' does lessen the overall story somewhat...it had to be done, I know, but hopefully once Vol. 2 comes out, there will be a splicing together of the two films similar to the Godfather Epic for the DVD.<br/><br/>So people (esp. Tarantino fans!) should stop comparing this to his other work, because he wasn't trying to 'top' his previous films, he wanted to do something different, and the result is a movie that I think is the epitome of 'cult-appeal'- you like it or you loathe it.  I loved it: it's not trying to whittle us down with unbearably asinine philosophy like Matrix Reloaded, because that's, quite simply, not what Kill Bill is...believe it or not, every movie doesn't have to have an omniscient morality permeating through it, if they all did when would we ever just enjoy ourselves at the theater? Aren't movies, first and foremost, an escape?  And although I guess I'll be labeled an idiot by the snobs, I honestly don't care.  Let them wallow in the self-congratulatory crap they usually do, often just so they can affirm themselves as smarter than everyone else, I mean that is human nature, after all.  I personally like movies of all kinds...and if every movie tried to be American Beauty, I think this would be a pretty bleak and downcast world, wouldn't you?<br/><br/>Equally horrendous are those people who call themselves 'true' grindhouse fans and then bash QT's film as 'lacking': the fight scenes are crap, Uma can't handle a katana (this smacks of subtle racism against non-Asian female action stars, methinks), there's too much blood...even if those claims were true (they're not), why nitpick?  Anyone who really is a fan of these genres should be thanking Tarantino, not spitting in his face.  Or maybe you want your hobby to stay buried under the mainstream public's radar, because otherwise you won't be so unique?  In that case, shame on you.<br/><br/>
Kill Bill IS cult, just like Master of Death and Street Fighter (Sonny Chiba's, not Capcom's) are cult, just like The Evil Dead and Pink Flamingo and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert are cult.  And it's damn good cult, too.<br/><br/>Eh, that wasn't so short, oh well.  Go support this movie if you like the genre is the summation.  Because if you don't, QT will fade away and lesser filmmakers will take his place, crapping out cookie-cutter remakes of the A-Team and Rollerball and God knows what else.  And then we really are in trouble.<br/><br/>Bring on Vol. 2."
"Gracioso","10","0","1","20 October 2003"," As brilliant and subtle as it is pulpy and visceral
","I've noticed that many people, even those who loved the film, have said that this film is ""just"" an homage to grindhouse films, and is the celebration of style over substance.  While agreeing that the style of the film is so breathtakingly original as to potentially overshadow the substance, I believe the idea that there is no substance to this film is gravely mistaken.  When I watched it, I saw archetypal images and themes filtered through an imagination with a real understanding of the zeitgeist of our culture, creating an entirely new perspective on ancient, even primeval issues.  I saw a story--simple on the surface--in which women rebel against their sexual oppression by men (almost every man seems to want sex with a main character--the rapist, Boss Matsumoto, the goofy guy in the bar with Go Go) and every one of them who does is subsequently brutally, killed.  Go Go's line, ""Do you still want to penetrate me?  Or is it I...who have penetrated you?"" encapsulates this them with typical Tarantino economy and style.  I see a story of lost innocence...every young character witnesses a horrible act of violence, and the question is perpetually asked: ""how will they deal with it?""  I see a movie that exhibits the idea in our social consciousness that the world is shrinking, and the rise of Eastern ideas in our Western culture.  I see an undercurrent of the immense repercussions when a great potential (The Bride's) is violently repressed, and then unleashed.  I see a stylized mediation on the catharsis of violence, as well as a film with a deep understandings of the very real effects of that violence in the real world.  And somehow...that thing that makes this film brilliant...it's supremely, unequivocally, immensely enjoyable to watch. It is a movie that tells us why it's okay that we love to see violence--brutal, visceral, bloody violence--in our art, even though we know that violence in the real world is a terrible, terrible thing.  10/10."

He is not a coming-of-age movie type guy.  His interest lies in movies that inspired him as a youth, and his focus in cinema is on violent, sarcastic, action flicks with smarmy dialogue.<br/><br/>The only downside is that I have to wait until Volume 2 to see what happens next.

","That Tarantino has a real passion for the movies, we all knew. That he loves his quirky left-of-center soundtracks we were never in any doubt. That he could successfully pull off another ultra-stylish genre-busting event movie whilst From Dawn Till Dusk and Jackie Brown, good as they were, still withered in the dazzling light of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction we wondered and wondered.<br/><br/>Has Quentin Tarantino, writer and director of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction still got what it takes? Has Kill Bill been worth the wait. Or is it merely a ""good movie""?<br/><br/>Well relax. Because Kill Bill Vol.1 sees Tarantino back to his true form.<br/><br/>The story is simple. A basic revenge movie. But this is only a structure on which Tarantino can hang his stylish visual feast.  From the outset, his influences come thick and fast; martial arts; 70's baxploitation; Akira Kurasowa; Alfred Hitchcock; Sergio Leone and many more. However, how many would have ticked the checkbox marked ""Japanese Anime""? That many, huh?<br/><br/>Kill Bill is ultra violent, but in a graphic novel sort of way that is hard to take offence. Anyone who has seen 'other' Asian exploitation movies such as Battle Royale (with cheese!) and Ichi the Killer, even Monty Python and the Holy Grail, will know what to expect.<br/><br/>The film constantly surprises and always entertains. But the biggest revelation is Uma Thurman as 'The Bride'. She not only kicks ass, she also gives a performance which constantly walks a tightrope between seriousness and parody with such skill, she gives Johnny Depp in Pirates... a run for his money. So much so, the Tarantino/Thurman partnership could almost be the new Scorcese/De Niro for the New Millenia! We'll see.<br/><br/>To say Kill Bill 'kicks ass' is no measure of its success: Pulp Fiction doesn't 'kick ass'; Reservoir Dogs doesn't 'kick ass'. What they do do, however, is to showcase a blinding storytelling talent that excites and inspires a new generation of kids all around the World into being film directors like the movies of Peckinpah, Hitchcock, Kurasowa, Leone, Scorcese did for the present generation of filmakers.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's unabashed passion for the movies is there for all to see. It excites, inspires and above all, rekindles OUR love in the movies.<br/><br/>That is success. That's what Kill Bill does."

","You wait six years for a new Quentin Tarantino film and what happens? Two come along. But, on the strength of Volume 1, I'm really looking forward to the second and maybe some cinemas will show both parts together, giving a whole new meaning to the term 'double bill'. The whole project is a tongue-in-cheek homage to samurai films, kung fu movies, and spaghetti westerns that will revive Tarantino's cult reputation.<br/><br/>From the throat-grabbing opening to the jaw-dropping closing, along a gravity-defying, blood-spurting, limb-chopping journey of retribution, this is classic and unmistakable Tarantino, down to the use of chapter headings and labelling, the non-linear nature of the narrative, the graphic deployment of an anime sequence, and the inevitable idiosyncratic choice of music. Writer and director Tarantino was right to wait a year until his preferred star Uma Thurman was available, because this talented - as well as sexy and sassy - woman carries the film as the one-time pregnant bride who becomes a vengeful assassin in a yellow cat suit with a very special sword.<br/><br/>The whole thing is something to do with a strange and fearsome group called The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Two squad members - Vernita Green who is actually black (Vivica A Fox) and O-Ren Ishii who is actually a Chinese-American and not Japanese (Lucy Lui) - pay the price for messing up the wedding, with a veritable orgy of death and dismemberment in between, and I don't think that the other squad members (including former lover Bill) will have much of a chance in Volume 2. But I want to see how they meet their well-deserved end and hopefully in the process discover where the bride learned her martial arts, what exactly was her relationship with Bill, and why was her wedding day the subject of such savagery."

The infusion of comedy, anime', the Japanese language with subtitles and a great soundtrack added even more enjoyment and excitement to this wonderful movie. Tarantino has outdone himself as well as all of the actors, choreographers, special effects, etc..  I can't wait to see it again and again.  If you liked or loved Pulp Fiction, you'll go crazy over this.  The same is true in reverse though.  If you did not like Pulp Fiction, you might not like this either although I just cannot imagine anyone not enjoying this movie.  I don't have any complaints.

"TheNorthernMonkee","8","0","1","20 October 2003"," Style over substance? Perhaps, but it's stunning style
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>So here he is again. Mr Tarantino has released another movie, and as with the rest of his works, it's a gem.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Volume 1 (I'll never get used to there being two volumes, but then, it'd be enourmous if not split in two) stars Uma Thurman as ""The Bride"" who is attacked on her wedding day by Bill's Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and placed in a coma for four years. Awakening to the realisation that her unborn baby, and the entire wedding contingent have all been killed, she sets off in an attempt to get revenge on those five people responsible.<br/><br/>In this film, Tarantino pays homage to all those Bruce Lee types of films which he adores (and which the Vega's and co from his other films would also adore, hence ""I'm writing a film my characters from my other films would probably watch at the movies""), and he does it very well. The fighting is almost constant, incredibly gory and extreme, but cleverly done and without any cgi (makes a good change). The outfits are stylish and well suited to the film, the same going for the stunning soundtrack, and the acting is up to the standard required.<br/><br/>To be honest, the one flaw with Kill Bill which everyone will pick up on is the relatively little ammount of quality substance regarding dialogue. These people would have a fair point, as I admit that for the first time, Tarantino has made a movie which doesn't make you want to quote it every five minutes (unlike the Royal with Cheese from Pulp Fiction, the tipping scene from Reservoir Dogs, and many many others). Ultimately though, that is ok. To make Kill Bill, Quentin Tarantino has been incredibly brave and I sincerly hope it pays off for him. It's a bit of an epic film (or at least it will be once both parts are together on one video or dvd), but compared with all the other enourmous epics going around at the moment (Lord Of The Rings, The Matrix, etc), it's a pleasant change of pace and it's enough to make everyone smile.

Ladden with references aplenty, it was well worth the wait. The violence on display is very much in the style that QT is doing a Homage (Lucas Pronounciation) of and when I went to see it it p***ed me off that alot of the audience could only relate to it as parody of that style of movie making and so laughed through alot of the action when this was not in any way a comedy. I hope they release the uncut version in the west and (freshly amputated head)roll on Volume two!"

","Kill Bill: Vol. 1 from the beginning until the end was perfect. The presentation of the film in chapter form is ingenious, the storyline is intelligent, leaving just enough to your to one's imagination,even the casting was flawless and the directing is breathless. This film is about a pregnant lady who gets tortured and left for dead. She awakes from her coma four years later with one mission, to exact revenge upon her attackers. It's a simple and justified story, but with raw talent of actors and actresses that the parts seemed to be constructed for them. The fighting scenes, shot partially in black and white, had a comic book effect of the injuries caused. Blood shot out of the wounds instead of splattering, and Tarantino's signature of Sonnie Chiba's cameo appearance, cool. All in all, I wish I could say something bad about this film, unfortunately, I am completely biased and can't wait to see Vol 2.<br/><br/>9.2/10"

"usocker13","Null","0","1","20 October 2003"," Classic Tarantino
","Kill Bill successfully encompassed everything Quentin Tarantino has become famous for. The plot is relatively simple. However, the intrigue of the film arises from the eccentric characters, surreal scenes and chronologically disjointed editing. The uniqueness of the action scenes was riviting. They featured an excess of blood and gore. Although bloodshed is typical of Tarantino's other films, Kill Bill seems to elevate it to a slightly higher level (and at times, intentionally comedic/unrealistic). Despite being an exteremely shallow film, it is also quite fun and entertaining. Once again, Quentin Tarantino leaves the audience with a topic of discussion. 8/10."

","To those who give Kill Bill bad reviews because of gore, I say pish. I mean, it's a Tarantino movie... if you've seen such films as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, or Natural Born Killers, one should expect the maximum amount of violence in the film. To say that it is a bad movie because of the gore is overlooking the cinematic masterpiece that it is. Kill Bill is so well-done cinematically that it is a viewing pleasure throughout the whole film and unlike anything else you've seen.<br/><br/>Also, to those who complain about it being over-the-top and unrealistic... it's a movie. And while it is over-the-top, at least it is consistent throughout the whole film.

Some say this movie isn't for everyone. Yet, it is. Who wouldn't want to see a movie about revenge? Trust me folks, the best part of this movie is that you will agree with the character's motives. You want,""The Bride,"" to have her revenge. You want every last one of those shameful pricks to pay for what they did. This movie is driven by it's audience's need to see justice.<br/><br/>Tarantino bravely tries to tell a story without even having a story. In this film, we have straps of a story. It's as if we all have amnesia along with Uma. The only thing we can remember throughout this film is that someone has to pay.<br/><br/>This film has several laugh out loud moments.

","I totally agree with the guy who says that Kill Bill vol. 1 is a movie with both good and bad scenes. Some parts of the movie are very well done, with class, and style like only Tarantino can do.  He makes the goriest scenes look like an art form. There's good japanese music that creates the perfect atmosphere and a lot of blood. However you won't find really interesting dialogues between the characters and when k.b. turns into a sensless kung-fu action movie , it's a little disappointing.  15 minutes of swordplay and wired stunts are boring, and spoil in part the rest of the movie. I would still recommend it because it's highly entertaining but if you are not into martial arts go with low expectations. Kill Bill v.1 is much better than Jackie Brown  but doesn't even come close to Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs."

When I went to see this movie I didn't know what to expect but this movie truly lived up to the hype. Uma you kicked so much ass in this movie that Neo is jealous, you deserved an Oscar nomination. Quentin I have to admit you are a f*****g genius and you deserved a Oscar nomination. This is probably the movie with the most gore and violence in movie history. This movie deserves mega attention in the Oscars for every Big Category including Best Picture. Quentin you did the right thing splitting this into two Volumes.

"paul_mampilly","10","0","1","19 October 2003"," Homage to martial arts movies, Tarantino Style.
","After waiting six years since his last piece of cinematic genius, Mr Tarantino has come back to the limelight with a bang and some arterial spurts. It is seemed like the director had just wanted to become the prodigal son, walking the Earth and to rediscover himself, before allowing himself again to be loved by the mainstream again. However this time, he is does not have any witty lines amongst a couple of gangsters, but a bunch of kick ass martial arts ladies kicking the crap out of each other. A kinda of anti Charlie Angels, (a sense of irony there, since Lucy Liu also stars in this movie.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I digress and I would like to explain the concept of the movie. Before then, I would like to warn; POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>It starts off with a black and white close up of The Bride (Uma Thurman) left almost to die. Off screen, you hear Bill (the mysterious boss of assassination gang DIVAS) trying to justify his actions upon her, before placing a bullet in her head. This sets you off for the big rollercoaster ride. The Bride awakes from a four year coma, and boy is she wrathful for what has happened, and so she tries to seek revenge. The first person that she gets medival is Copperhead, who is an ex DIVAS assassin who was involved for the near death of The Bride. Enter a superb knife duel/ bitch fight set amongst the leafy surburbs of California. After annihililating her opponent in front of Copperhead's pre school daughter, The Bride makes a move to Toyko to seek and hunt down the next on her list, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). The movie then turns into first how the O-Ren has become what she has become, in a style of Japanese anime. Afterwards, it shows how the Bride seeks help from the old but wise master Harroti Hanzo (the legendary Japanese actor Sonny Chiba) by obtaining a hand made sword by the man himself. After this, it is all fun and games martial arts style. Violence come thick and fast like blood spurting out of a freshly severed head, (which happens many a time in this movie, but this is a Tarintino movie)<br/><br/>I will not try to give too much away, which at this moment of time is gonna be quite hard. However, from what you have read from this review I would hope that you would see this movie. The acting in this movie is not thespian style acting and the dialogue is not all to what Tarintino can give, but it is the martial arts scenes and the visual medley of cinematic art, in which would should be shown to budding film students and veterans alike. This movie would have to be said to be the greatest Westernised martial arts movies (if not the most violent) and it should be watched by anyone who loves a good cinematic experience. That includes all the Daily Mail readers.<br/><br/>
Rating 10/10"
"lynton","7","0","1","19 October 2003"," One big reason to see it--but thousands not to.
","From the outset, this is Tarantino's movie--although Uma Thurman almost wrests it away.<br/><br/>Uma's a bride seeking revenge on a group of assassins who killed her entire wedding party at the altar. Pretty much, she just hunts them down and with sword fights and severed limbs, tries to kill them all. What's staggering is Thurman manages to inject a resigned frailty into what's essentially the role of a cold-blooded killer. Somehow, amid the fountains of blood, this is Oscar contender acting.<br/><br/>It is extraordinarily violent, possibly one of the most violent Western movies of all times. The blood gushes and heads roll, and while in the earlier parts of the movie, Tarantino merely hints at the violence, he shows it all in living colour and black and white (and Japanese animation) toward the end. He's not making a point. He's saluting the just-as-violent Hong Kong and Japan movies many 'whities' have never seen.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is brilliantly made. There are thousands of reasons not to see this movie, but only one to see it. It's very difficult to take in the sheer amount of lightning-quick Tarantino touches, such as Daryl Hannah's eye-patch. This needs to be seen more then three or four times. You may be tempted to either go home in disgust or watch it again right then. The direction is amazing--the music, mistakes and jumps in film, costumes and colours, the fight scenes, it's all made brilliantly, albeit without a trace subtlety. But Tarantino is hardly known for that.<br/><br/>And if anyone wants to claim he stole wire-fight ideas from the Matrix.just remember, the Matrix stole it from Japan first."
"shea_bennett","5","0","1","19 October 2003"," Disappointing, flawed, occasionally ludicrous martial arts homage/parody
","Wow, what a major disappointment.<br/><br/>I bought the KILL BILL original soundtrack a few weeks back, played it once, and never played it again. Tarantino's OST choices are some of the best CDs I've ever heard; the KILL BILL one, while not terrible, was so forgettable and background-music-lite that I should have seen this as some kind of omen.<br/><br/>
KILL BILL, the movie, in short, is actually pretty terrible.<br/><br/>
I know what Quentin was attempting to do; I grew up watching the Asian martial arts flicks of the 1970s and early 1980s and I loved them. There was something incredibly satisfying about the incredible physical realism of seeing those guys strut their stuff; guys like Sonny Chiba, who features in KILL BILL, left an impression on me that will never be forgotten. Their all-around coolness, with martial artistry that topped anything you'd see from Hollywood, was a revelation.<br/><br/>However, I hated the wire work. I hated ninjas that could leap thirty feet vertically. I hated the fact that they possessed super-strength, and never seemed to tire. I hated the fact that, for some stupid, code-of-honour reason, the bad guys only ever fought the good guys one-on-one, despite overwhelming odds. And I hated the ridiculously over-the-top bloodwork.<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, Tarantino, in his quest for the perfect homage, concluded that KILL BILL would have to feature all of these awful traits, and more. And for someone who has openly criticised THE MATRIX movies for their use of 'wire-fu', I thought it was pretty rich indeed that KILL BILL featured so much obvious use of wire-assistance.<br/><br/>The plot is simplicity itself; it's your basic revenge thriller. The Bride, played by Uma Thurman, wakes from a four-year coma to find herself not only less the child she was carrying, but at the receiving end of God-knows how many unwarranted sexual advances as her sure-thing, dormant body was leased out to hicks for a straight $75/throw. This obviously p**ses her off big time, but when we learn, through flashbacks, of the massacre of her husband-to-be, and entire party, at her wedding four years prior, well, she's really not very happy at all.<br/><br/>The killings were orchestrated by her former employer, Bill, leader of the much-feared Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, which includes O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox). At the wedding, the Bride is beaten severely, the final blow coming from a bullet straight into her head, at close range, from Bill. Her final words, ""The baby is yours,"" before he pulls the trigger. Nice.<br/><br/>The Bride draws up her 'death list'; the five members of the Viper Squad that she will kill, leading up to Bill himself.<br/><br/>KILL BILL, like PULP FICTION before it, isn't told in sequence; it's not as clever as PULP, but the opening scene, for example, is actually the end of the movie time-wise. It works because you move straight into the action. And if action's your bag, then you're laughing baby. The film is pretty much non-stop action, bar a few necessary plot movements and pauses. And initially, you're grateful, because this is what you came to see. By the end of the flick, however, you're praying for it to move on. Like most films of this type, ultimately, the reason you came to see the movie is lost; fights blend into each other, and you find yourself checking your watch.<br/><br/>
However, in other Tarantino movies, these endless battles would have been saved by the little slices of genius in between. This is so not the case in KILL BILL; for someone who has built his career on dialogue, some of the shite uttered by the cast in this flick has to be heard (or read - lots of subtitles) to be believed.<br/><br/>Mostly, it's the Japanese translations that fall totally flat. Sonny Chiba, for example, utters the immortal:<br/><br/>""I can tell you, with no ego, that this is my finest blade. If, on your journey, you should encounter God, God will be cut.""<br/><br/>Hello? God is Jewish - of course he's cut! ;-)<br/><br/>As you have probably read, this is a very violent movie. Quentin got the film past the credits for three reasons: one, the blood and gore is so over-the-top that it cannot be taken seriously at all. It's cartoon violence. Two, the most disturbing scene of the movie, which traces O-Ren's history, is shown entirely in anime. Obviously, this was necessary because it features a young child, and includes the notion of paedophilia. However, the scene is so sleazy that it will leave a terrible taste in your mouth. Again, I know what he was doing, but anime is so awful, so ridiculously dated, that it just plain sucked. Finally, a concluding scene of the movie is shown entirely in black and white; this gets the critics past the most over-use of blood that you're going to see in any flick post BRAIN DEAD. It's also played for laughs and, you guessed it, pretty much sucks.<br/><br/>
That's what really gets to me with this film; Quentin, as I've repeatedly spewed, was making a direct homage to those Asian movies of the 70s. However, while these films hold on an important place in the heart of many a fan, these films could never be described as good pieces of work. Fun? Sure. Important? Maybe. But as I laid out above, so much of them was utter garbage, and even as a ten-year old I found myself shaking my head repeatedly throughout a viewing. By not removing these parts and, indeed, highlighting them, Quentin has taken what could have been a fantastic homage into a near-parody. You want blood? Sure, here you go - let's take Johnny Depp's death scene in A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and make everybody shoot blood out like that when they die! You want chopped off limbs? Sure, here you go - let's make everybody lose at least one limb, and have arms, legs and heads flying all over the place. You want our hero facing ridiculous, overwhelming odds (in this case, of eighty-eight to one) and still come through, even though the bad guys could have just rushed her and - God forbid - pulled out a gun at any time and ended the battle in seconds? Sure, here you go - and let's not only let her beat them easily, but have a laugh while she's doing it.<br/><br/>Worse, Tarantino sets up these concepts in the movie, but then breaks them. OK, so people bleed ridiculous amounts of blood before they die - fine. But then don't have somebody dying within minutes of having their tongue bitten out, only for someone else to live out half of the movie with several limbs missing. Duhhh. In the case of the latter, she must have been in possession of eighty or so pints of blood because she lost at least twenty with her first arm. Yes, it's not meant to be taken seriously, obviously. But it should have been. This should have been a serious movie.<br/><br/>
The acting is decent enough; I'm not totally convinced that Uma Thurman was right for this role, but Quentin worships the ground she walks on (almost literally; the close-ups of her disgusting, chimp-like feet turn your stomach). Clearly she was in good shape, but more than once it was obvious that the distance shots of her fighting were actually some geezer in a blonde wig, only for the camera to then zoom in for a grimacing close-up of our Uma.<br/><br/>You don't see much of Bill (David Carradine), or Budd (Madsen), but the female members of the Viper Squad are given serious screen time. And with ""beauties"" like Uma, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox, nobody was really complaining. Except me, I guess. I don't find any of these women all that attractive; Liu and Fox stand above the reason. Thurman used to be gorgeous, but now she's a walking skeleton. Hannah has always looked like a walking skeleton. Her character is terrible; an eyepatch has never been cool, especially on a woman, and a medical eyepatch even less so (a TERRIBLE scene!). Aside from the Bride, Liu's O-Ren gets the most background, and she's the second best part of this movie, both from an acting and character perspective. Outside of the posse, and getting sound applause all round, Chiaki Kuriyama's (BATTLE ROYALE) Go Go Yubari, armed with ball and chain, is perhaps the one genuine reason to go and see this flick; she's uber-cool, and you gotta love the insanity in those eyes. You'd love to fuck her, but you know that pretty much for sure you'd never survive it (ease up, cowboy, Kuriyama is 19 years old). She kicks arse. You have to respect a woman who knows how to handle balls so masterfully. I loved her.<br/><br/>
The film is split into five chapters, and the final part shows us the long-coming battle between the Bride and O-Ren. It's a nice scene, prefixed by the Bride single-handedly beating O-Ren's Crazy 88 without hardly breaking a sweat, and then facing O-Ren herself. Clearly, there's much respect between the two, and the Samurai-inspired scene, filmed outside in a beautiful, snowy landscape, is very attractive indeed. If only it handed ended so lousily; Quentin, mate, you set it up so wonderfully, and then pull the snowy rug away and leave us with farce. I saw shades of HANNIBAL, and wouldn't have been surprised if it concluded with the Bride tucking into a cerebral snack when she got back on the plane. And WHAT was the deal with the Bride being allowed to have her sword next to her on every flight? Hello? HELLO? Quentin? Is anybody home??? Shocking.<br/><br/>A few Quentin-esque touches were nice; a big poster that the Bride walks past displays Red Apple cigarettes. The Bride dons a pair of Clarance's, TRUE ROMANCE, Elvis sunglasses. I like that. But, overall, the usual feeling of cleverness so eloquently expressed by PULP FICTION and JACKIE BROWN was missing.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, usually Tarantino's choice of music is pretty much spot-on. Every time I hear ""Stuck In The Middle With You"" I'm sent straight back to that cop's hell at the hands of Michael Madsen's Mr Blonde. Likewise, the PULP FICTION OST is about as good as it gets. In this movie, Quentin, once again throwing a nod towards the 1970s Asian flicks, chose to set up a scene pretty much exclusively on the back of the music. The O-Ren Ishii/Bride final battle is totally dominated by a very loud, and in my opinion, poorly chose theme that totally undercuts the beauty and impact of that fight. It just didn't work at all. There's some good stuff on the OST, but it pales next to his other movies.<br/><br/>As does KILL BILL as a whole. It's easily Quentin's worst flick to date. My gut reaction when it came out as, ""That was bollocks."" But I told myself to go away and think about it. I have done. It was bollocks. Sure, it was stylish bollocks, and there is some really good stuff in there, but overall, it's still bollocks. Quentin-worshippers will defend the superficiality of the movie with the same force that they would have torn-apart a Jean-Claude Van Damme flick that featured the same identical, ridiculous scenes. And that's their prerogative. But however much you look at it, and want to like it, this film is flawed, and it's for the very same reasons that inspired Tarantino to make it in the first place. The truth is, as I said, and this comes from a big fan, that those films of the 1970s just aren't really all that good. And despite the cool fighting and style, when you get below the surface, there's very little underneath indeed. Sure, I'll go and see the sequel - I do want to know how it pans out. But no matter how many times you watch this flick, it's never going to open up for you like PULP FICTION did."

","KILL BILL: Volume 1<br/><br/>From the opening titles we know we are in for something different.  From the first line we know we are in for something special.  From the first image we know we are in for something powerful.<br/><br/>Do we get it - HELL YEAH!<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino has delivered to the screen a martial arts, tour-de-force, ultra-violent, cool-as-hell cinematic masterpiece.  He has returned in fine form after 1997's blaxploitation flick 'Jackie Brown', giving us what is sure to be the most original film of the year - interesting considering he uses so many homages and retro references within the body of his work. Tarantino is master of his craft and he has proven this once again.<br/><br/>The plot is not overly-complicated: 'The Bride' (Thurman), massacred on her wedding day along with nine others, including her husband and a 'coloured organ player' (watch out for this reference as there's a great cameo in Vol. 2), awakes from a four year coma to reek revenge on those responsible - The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS) headed by the mysterious Bill. It is the way Tarantino takes this revenge plot and delivers it to us in non-sequential temporal order, with delicious turning points and mesmerisingly choreographed fight sequences that makes this a true work of art.  This is definitely an exercise in style with a perfectly manipulated collage of techniques; including black & white, split screens, title screens, chapters, bleeping out a character's name, altering temporal order and an amazing anime sequence to deliver the back story of O-Ren Ishii (Liu).<br/><br/>Lucy Liu delivers possibly her best performance but it is Uma Thurman who is at the top her game - she owns this role.  Even the supporting characters leave an impact and include cameos from Sonny Chiba (who I first realised Tarantino was a fan of when I saw the theatre scene in 'True Romance'), Michael Parkes (one of Tarantino's favourite actors - playing a role similar to that in 'From Dusk Till Dawn') and Michael Bowen from 'Jackie Brown' making an interesting appearance as Buck.<br/><br/>But it is not just Tarantino and the actors who excel, as Oscar winner Robert Richardson finds a nice balance of his and Quentin's style in the cinematography; some of the lighting is distinctly Richardson, some of the shots distinctly Tarantino.  And this film is a visual feast; beautiful shots, exquisite sets and appropriate costume designs help digest the story - the final act in (and out of) the House of the Blue Leaves is perhaps the best example of the consummation of these filmic elements.<br/><br/>The final act especially, but not restricted to, also lets martial arts gurus, fan boys and film geeks have a field day with the various references to martial arts and pop culture.  From costumes to characters, music, sets and opening titles, Tarantino manages to take elements that are familiar and make them feel fresh, unique and original - similar to what he did with the stories in 'Pulp Fiction'.<br/><br/>If I have one complaint about this movie it is that it is not long enough and you are left begging for Volume 2.  Although, what would be the mid-act turning point at the end certainly has impact - a question posed by Bill that, if you have being paying attention has been answered.  The trouble is now Tarantino has set the standard, Volume 2 is going to have even higher expectations - but at least this way he does get to show his complete story (in a brave move by Harvey 'Scissorhands' Weinstein).  Not many directors would be allowed this privilege - but when you see it you'll know why.<br/><br/>This is not for everyone's taste - and if you thought 'Reservoir Dogs' was too graphic then perhaps you mightn't appreciate this - but personally I think it is the best film of the year.

","Kill Bill Volume One is definitely on my top five favorite movies. The movie tied everything together so perfectly, making everything flo together with such ease. The fighting scenes were amazing! Some people say this movie is too violent, but i disagree. This movie is rated R, after all, so what do they expect?! This definitely earns a 10, and I'm still suprised that it's only at 91/250! I'm sure it's ranking will go higher, though, I mean, why wouldn't it?<br/><br/>I definitely CAN NOT wait until the second volume will be released."

","What is the deal with Quentin Tarantino, he is haled as a God by pretty much everyone in Hollywood (apart from Spike Lee maybe), he is so good at self promotion that he has the world fooled into thinking that he is Maha Raja of La La land when in fact he is nothing more than an average movie maker. Resevior Dogs was a pretty good movie when you concider that it was his first, Pulp Fiction had everything you could want in a film, Jackie Brown, well to be honest I can't remember much about it which says everything really, and his latest, Kill Bill is just...................straight to video tosh. The action is no where near as good as the hype would lead you to believe, it simply cannot compare to the likes of Crouching Tiger or the earlier Jackie Chan flicks, he relies way too much on very shody wire work and crap camera techniques and the script which in his past movies have always been brilliant was just, well not very good really. And what was with all the gore, I like a little blood and guts just as much as the next guy, but only when it's used properlly, the film was so bloody that it actually got really boring by the time you saw the 20th person have a limb hacked off. Ok so the film had one or two redeeming features, Lucy Lu being one and Sonny Chiba being the other but that was about it really. One thing that I did find very funny though, was the fact that most of the audience didn't realise that the movie was part one of two, the abrupt ending left people wondering what was going on, that was funny. I know that I'm going to have annoyed quite a few movie geeks out there who worship at the holy shrine of Tarantino, but hey, get a life, if you want to see really visionary movies check out the likes of the Coen Brothers instead of those made by a self publicising brat. I thank you."

","Wow, Quentin Tarantino is back with a vengeance! Director Tarantino has created a film that incorporates many styles into it, with a heavy nod to the martial arts of the Far East.<br/><br/>It was a stroke of his genius to cast Uma Thurman as the protagonist of this tale of revenge. Ms. Thurman has not played anything before with so much relish and verve, as she does here. In this film she continues to show that led by a good director, like Tarantino, can work wonders for her, as it was the case in Pulp Fiction. These two belong together, and doubt, they will collaborate more in the future, only next time, don't show us her toes!<br/><br/>The cast assembled for the film is very effective, although this version shows too much of Lucy Liu, who is as blank, as a white piece of paper. Perhaps she should be paired next time out with Keanu Reeves; just think of the possibilities and what a great couple they would make!<br/><br/>The master is back, so now, give us Part II."

This movie had everyone in the theatre by the throat from the opening scene and didn't let go until the movie credits rolled.

","To give Tarantino credit, Kill Bill Vol. 1, like his other movies, is a well crafted, stylish, and entertaining picture. Technically speaking, it is solid on virtually every level. Unfortunately, it is also a literal blood bath of fetishized violence on par with the goriest of horror movies.<br/><br/>Normally, I can handle seeing limbs chopped off, or geysers of blood streaming out of a decapitated torso, or a close up of a handgun blast to a head, but that's because usually there is some kind of meaningful reason attached to it. In other words, I accept some degree of violence to tell a story.<br/><br/>Sadly, Tarantino just seems to really like violence for its own sake, and Kill Bill appears to be just another vehicle for his desire to bring carnage to the screen. It's basically another iteration of ""From Dusk til Dawn"", which had a flimsy story constructed to justify a slaughter of humans and vampires. The notable difference is that instead of self-defense, the Kill Bill ""protagonist"" is motivated by pure revenge.<br/><br/>Perhaps if we knew what was going on, we could really get behind our ""hero"", and rationalize all the killing as good. But the film tells us nothing. We don't know why she is involved with her enemies, what she has done to earn their hatred, or what kind of person she is. Is she honorable? Is she a modern day samurai? Or is she just a psychopathic killer with a penchant for swords?<br/><br/>If you want blood, you'll love this movie. If you want some kind of context for violence, a good story about honor in battle, or something with any kind of meaning, don't waste your time. Check out ""Ghost Dog"" or ""Gladiator"" instead.<br/><br/>KB Vol. 1 gets a 5.5 from me."

I walked out thinking I can not remember one line of dialogue; The characters were all two dimensional just like the anime in the middle and the talent on show was a complete waste.

","Kill Bill did not live up to its promise. Interestingly, preceding the movie I saw previews for Lord of the Ring: The King Returns and Matrix Revolutions. Both films rely heavily on film technique, martial arts/fighting, and violence. The difference between Kill Bill, and LOTR and Matrix, is that Kill Bill has no substance and invokes no emotional resonance with me. LOTR and Matrix in contrast, tell a compelling story on multi-levels. <br/><br/> Unfortunately Kill Bill is all flash, all technique, all form (borrowed and copied), and no story that resonates with the audience. I felt nothing on walking out of the movie. I never got involved with any character. I sat back and watched the movie noting and appreciating its technique, music, and staged fights. More importantly, I felt sad that Tarentino's considerable talents are wasted on copying and inflating the martial arts form instead of using that form to tell a compelling story. Kill Bill is that classic movie Â– style over substance. Maybe Q. Tarentino Is not interested in stories with emotional content. Maybe he is just interested in the technique of telling a story."

True to his craft, Mr. Tarantino has succeeded in creating an askew version of the widely-used revenge plot, making it fresh, interesting and entertaining.  I think everyone should see this film twice -even if you didn't like it the first time.  It's amazing some of the things you'll catch on viewing it a second time.  Just when I think I've got this one figured out, he goes a throws another curve ball, making the whole thing like a story from an alternate genre, all together.<br/><br/>It was so nice to see Uma's return after... how ever long it's been.

The role was perfect for her and the music is really great; if not at times somewhat comical (like the theme to 'Green Hornet' playing shortly after the mention of the 'Kato masks' -classic).<br/><br/>Anyway...

Some Scenes are so disturbingly sad that you want to burst into tears, but then you remember, you can't, because something gross just happened. Now you want to throw up. But you can't, because that joke that just happened is so funny, you might choke on your puke and die. And that's just one minute. From the moment you walk into the theater and see the opening shot, you realize that this movie has a hold on you, and its not about to let go. Tarantino proves himself as one of the greatest directors the world has seen, making a huge deal about this being his 4th film. Symbolism and metaphors are commonplace in this film, but not in the sense you'd expect. he uses them not as a way to make the audience understand what's happening, but rather, it seems, as entertainment for himself. And what entertains him sure is going to entertain you. Don't expect to leave the cinema feeling good about yourself. The devil inside you will love this movie, and will force you to go back in 2004 to see the conclusion, which, if we're not careful, could end up competing against part one for an Oscar. Who knows?

","One of the ways by which I qualify these types of movies is by noting if a sustained state of exhilaration is manifested.  Kill Bill came through with loads left over, like receiving metered doses of crank at just the right moments, without the inevitable crash afterward.  Now, for this to be effective in my eyes, the film must have a certain sumptuousness to it....a certain quality of beauty and artful delineation woven into the action. It was there.  Also, the action has to be delivered in a freshly innovative pace without being noisy.  Tarantino pulls this off, as well, using an almost breezy humor to keep the mood from becoming morose with all thematic violence (i.e. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon).  Those who would call this violence ""gratuitous"" are being flip.  Gratuitous violence is uncalled for, typically used to illicit some type of reaction when the film is failing on all other fronts.  One may not like the style of Kill Bill, but the film has integrity with the violence being an integral part of the whole piece. I urge those with thicker skins to check this one out.  It was a clever and rewarding riot.  All you ""socially responsible"" viewers, check out Mystic River....another wonderful film with a whole different agenda."

","The first time I heard about ""Kill Bill"" or knew anything about it was when I bought the ""Gangs of New York DVD"" and watched the Sneak Peeks.

I was convinced that the 4th Tarantino film would be the World War II film, ""The Inglorious Bastards"", since last I heard of him, he was still working on the screenplay. ""Kill Bill"" was a mighty surprise for all Tarantino fans. I saw ""Kill Bill"" on October 10th at 4:30, the first show to be shown at our theater (I even took off work to see it). Seeing Uma Thurman as ""Bluuoop"" ,or ""The Bride"" as they call her, reprising her role in a Tarantino film since 1994 got me so excited since ""Pulp Fiction"" is one of my all time favorite movies. The references in ""Kill Bill"" showed how dedicated Tarantino was to this and the rest of his films. ""Pulp Fiction"" fans will roar with laughter once they see the things that Tarantino snuck into ""Kill Bill"". When you see ""The Bride"" walk though the Tokyo airport, you see an advertisement for Red Apple cigarettes: the same brand Bruce Willis bought at the bar in ""Pulp Fiction."" And the relation between ""The Bride's"" secret organization DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) compared to Fox Force Five (Uma Thurman's character in ""Pulp Fiction"" starred in a pilot TV show with this name)will bring joy to all fans of Tarantino's works.<br/><br/>Tarantino is back with an amazing action flick, a great cast, and a brilliant screenplay and this is my favorite movie of the year.

","After seeing Kill Bill twice now, I can honestly say that Tarantino is one of the most talented directors in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>The film Kill Bill just works.  It is one of the most entertaining films I have seen so far this year.  I'll tell you what, watching Kill Bill was also fun!  This was a fun movie loaded with GREAT music and lots of references to how movies were made some 20-30 years ago.(SPOILER ALERT)<br/><br/>One of the biggest kicks I got out of watching Kill Bill was some of the little things that were strewn throughout the movie.  These little things were references to how movies were made in the 70's, references to action heroes of the 70's, references to styles in the 70's, references to ""bad"" music scores in the 70's, and references to bad special effects in the 70's.<br/><br/>
There was one scene where The Bride was pushing her way through a parking garage, looking for the ""yeah"" Wagon (for those of you who have seen Kill Bill, you know what I am talking about).  There was this really bad 70's tune playing.  You know, the generic 70's track that goes along with some action related moment, in a 70's action film?  The shot is then cut (in a really bad edit) from The Bride wheeling her way through the parking garage, to the inside of the ***** Wagon.  That bad 70's track I told you about comes to an abrupt end - I mean the track is just cut off in mid tempo.  I can't tell you how many times I have seen this same kind of edit, not done on purpose mind you, in some of the 70's action films I have seen.  Too me, that was just fun!<br/><br/>There was another fun scene where The Bride is in an airplane.  There is a shot of the plane flying through the skies.  It clearly looks like a phony special effect.  How many times have you watched an old movie that has a special effect of a UFO or Airplane flying through the skies which is attached to black thread?  It was hilarious.<br/><br/>I also thought that the movie was very well acted.  None of these characters seemed to ""wink"" at the audience.  Whatever was happening in ""their"" world was very real.  Tarantino was doing all the winking but the actors were very serious.  I really got into the story and could understand why The Bride was bent on revenge.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a simple story with a simply plot, but Tarantino has a way that he tells this story which makes it really interesting and fun to watch. Just you wait and see, other directors will try and copy this film and it's style.<br/><br/>This is a fun movie folks.  It reminds me why we go to the movies.  I anxiously await Kill Bill Vol 2."

So when a film like Kill Bill comes along, you make a point of seeing it. Especially when maverick-director Quentin Tarantino is at the helm.<br/><br/> In his forth (and easily his most ambitious) venture behind the lens audiences are treated to what Tarantino himself describes as his `grindhouse epic', a film which ricochets through a wide range of genres such as Kung-fu, Spaghetti Western, Hong Kong action, Yakuza gangster thriller, Japanese anime and theatrical samurai saga.<br/><br/> Any wonder it was chopped into two parts!<br/><br/> Uma Thurman stars as The Bride. Formerly a key member of the elite ViPER assassination squad, headed by the mysterious Bill (David Carradine.) When she attempts to break free and start a new life her plans come crashing to a halt when her former colleagues (Lucy Liu, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and Vivica A. Fox) show up at her wedding and slaughter everyone in sight.<br/><br/> They leave The Bride and her unborn child for dead not realising that they have only put her in a coma. Four years later when she comes to, she seeks a bloody revenge. And hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, her ultimate goal being - to kill Bill.<br/><br/> Nancy Sinatra sings: `Bang bang, I hit the ground. Bang bang, that awful sound. Bang bang, my baby shot me down.' as the opening credits role, and watching the screen intently, I find it hard to believe that nearly six years have passed since Tarantino has released a film.<br/><br/> So was it worth the wait?<br/><br/> Absolutely, Kill Bill will divide audiences like a civil war, with the word `violence' a major player. More blood is witnessed on screen than in any other mainstream movie I've ever seen. But you can take it or leave it.<br/><br/>And if you were happy to name drop QT after the success of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, but didn't `get' his '97 adaptation of Elmore Leonard's `Rum Punch' the film that became Jackie Brown.  Then Kill Bill may not be your thing, with the pop culture references and the witty repartee taking a back seat in Volume 1.<br/><br/> Miramax big man Harvey Weinstein should be congratulated for giving his full blessing to this project and Quentin Tarantino deserves even more recognition for his artistic merit and brilliant work here. I sincerely hope his critics do, as is suggested earlier: `Take it, or leave it.<br/><br/> When Clockwork Orange was released in the 70's it was easily the bravest film to come out of a major studio. Then came Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers in '94 (an early Tarantino script.)

","Here Here,<br/><br/>That feeling I got when watching Matrix (the first one...let's not even delve into what I felt for the second...) was this tickle in the spine. I knew right there and then I was watching something that was amazing and would be remembered for a long time. I looked on in amazement of the shots, the angles, the effects, etc. This same feeling doesn't come along often and it reminds you why you go to see movies (or make them if you're anything like me). I've got that tingle only a couple of times, but when you do (any film lover knows what I'm talking about here) you know its a classic film you're lucky enough to be watching. Remember the feeling in Fight Club when Tyler's real persona was revealed? In Clockwork Orange? In Apocalypse Now when the helicopters fly over? In the opening sequence of Citizen Kane? In the Godfather? We all have those moments...<br/><br/>Now, to Kill Bill... The film either gave you that feeling or it didn't (or won't)...<br/><br/>
Personally (like anyone cares about my opinion) I knew it was - at the very least - 'something' special when I realised I was on the edge of my seat during the daring and shocking fight sequences. During the Matrix Reloaded I was (shock, horror!) actully bored with the film's fight scenes. They seemed to be involved to much within themselves and (this is the crux) they forget about the audience watching. Whether you liked KILL BILL or not is irrelevent (okay, it does matter a little) but you have to respect the use of the art - that is film - to engage the audience so well. Tarantino respects the audience (he's been watching countless films so its only expected) and this is why so many people respect him. I won't describe how he does it so effortlessly in KILL BILL (as you really have to see it for yourself) but rest assured some people WON'T like KILL BILL and some will fall in love. Please, see this film and decide for yourself, even to see how film can be used to engage the audience so well.<br/><br/>I only hope that you fall into the latter, and that you are lucky enough to get that tingle in the spine all over again.<br/><br/>Have a good one."

","As much as I enjoyed ""Kill Bill"" the first time I saw it, I enjoyed it exponentially more on second viewing.  This is a movie that shows us the road to revenge in its most straightforward, but it's never been brought to the screen more effectively than in this film.  Every single aspect of filmmaking has come together under the genius direction of Mr. Tarantino to create a unique, compelling, stylish vision of this world.  It's a world I'm glad I'm not in (I can't even wield a sword in a videogame without cutting myself on the controller) but one that nonetheless draws you (and quarters, dices and minces you) into ""pulpy"" submission.  This is more pulp fiction than ""Pulp Fiction,"" more doggish and rugged than ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and, well, more Brown than Ms. Jackie (sorry, i hadn't one for that).  It's the most thoroughly enjoyable film (if you've a somewhat strong stomach) of Mr. T's four and I imagine will go down in the annals of ""cool movie"" history. Whew what it'd be like to hack the limbs off of 88 people at the same time, all the while sporting a playful yellow jumpsuit, perfect for showing off blood and entrail stains.  It's utter craziness but regardless a collection of incredibly cool scenes that set the tone perfectly for the next film. If that weren't the case I might well have ranked this to be my favorite film of the year, but I still feel somewhat cheated by the ""sliced in half"" concept of Volumes 1 and 2.  Can't wait for February, though."

","Whilst Quentin Tarantino is undeniably masterful at forming the shorthand of cinema into stunning imagery and unique characterization, his adolescent preoccupation with misogynistic violence has become both wearisome and troubling.<br/><br/>As an auteur, Tarantino quite rightly has complete artistic freedom, but his own ability to sift the post-modern references in his work isn't matched by that of his core audience, who are no doubt comfortable with the familiarity of the computer game violence, pithy dialogue, and MTV promo wrapping.<br/><br/>It's interesting that Jackie Brown is described by Tarantino fans as his most `disappointing' work.  Could this be because Grier and Forster's characters were the director's most sympathetic and mature yet?"

","I'll never trust those awards again.  This has to be one of the greatest movie of all time.  For those who complained about the excessiveness of the blood, it is precisely the excessiveness of the blood in the movie that made it campy, silly and fun.  I for one has never been a big fan of the gory hack and slash genre (I hated Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th...etc.)  But Kill Bill is done with such style that made it tolerable and even poetic.<br/><br/>I think people who complained about the excessive violence might have taken the movie a bit too seriously.  Honestly, I don't believe for a minute that human blood gushes like a geyser when one of the limb get severed.  I think it's this unrealistic over-done that made the mood so fantastical.<br/><br/>I do find one flaw in the logic of the movie though.  The way O-Ren Ishii died.  I know for a fact that people have survived worse injuries.  So she could not possibly have died from that.<br/><br/>I think QT has really outdone himself this time.  I think people who complained about the movie might change their mind after watching this movie a few more times later on.  I for one actually walked out in the middle of Pulp Fiction thinking that it was one of the stupidest movie I've ever seen only to find it to be one of the most enjoyable movie later on when I watched it again (and again and again...).<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, everything in this movie is done perfectly.  The music is simply divine.  The scenaries, the costumes, the characters, the choreographies, the script....etc.<br/><br/>As an avid movie goer (I watch about 4 - 7 movies (in theatres) a week and owning at least 200 some DVDs + my family used to own several video stores), Kill Bill is one of those rare film that left me wanting more (and thank QT there will be more)."

Finally someone has captured all the great things from Spag Westerns,Martial Arts and Manga and put it all together into a great movie(or Two). It is truly a stylish movie with great directing and camera work,(sadly the two main things that lack in most of the genre films that Qt has drawn from). This movie is not meant to be a dialog master piece but a straight out action style movie with real style. I hear people going on about the blood and violence but this is spot on to what Manga etc. are like and the very nice black and white action scene was amazing , I mean using what I think looks like water for blood (as we all know blood would be black) what pure magic. It was nasty in some places but that as I said is the genre and it but compare it to most rubbish movies out there (ie Resident Evil) it doesn't rely on the blood (and no guts) to make people go see the movie for pure shock value ( but I think some people will go just see it because of the fuss made) for me the story did drive along with the action so well that I was most upset over the fact I've got to wait several months to see part two. Finally it's great to see a movie that delivers everything I expected and more , for once.<br/><br/>To all the people who didn't like it see a pile of manga , Sergio Leone, Kurusawa's movies and see Kill Bill again , then you'll see the light....I hope."

","""Kill Bill"" is an interesting film in that it's in a genre I consider a guilty pleasure yet many other people consider incredibly stupid or without merit... until a name writer / director does it, then it is valid to enjoy. If QT wasn't attached to this project, there would not be the cry of ""ART!"" that seems to surround ""Kill Bill"".<br/><br/>Incredibly brutal in parts, sometimes tinged with black humour, ""Kill Bill"" is an experience I enjoyed very much, but will need to see the conclusion before being able to decide exactly what to think of this movie. At the moment, it is certainly not a masterpiece. Personally, it is more like a rollercoaster - thrilling, shocking, enjoyable - but hardly high art.<br/><br/>
For all its fans, this movie is just another blockbuster albeit done with style. QT's talents at framing scenes is working perfectly and there are some very memorable moments, but it's a martial arts film. For all the talk of homages and referencing, there isn't any real soul to this movie. You get on, enjoy the ride and get off, not once stopping to think about the greater ramifications of it.<br/><br/>I am certainly looking forward to seeing Volume 2; let's hope it is worth the noise that has surrounded the decision to split it."

"dmkay","10","0","1","19 October 2003"," Exquisite, astounding, compelling, but...
","...there's something not quite perfect about Kill Bill.  For the first hour I went back and forth between liking it and not liking it, especially between the first fight scene (which is wonderful, especially when the school bus appears) and the anime sequence.  The movie is missing something in that space...maybe it's too slowly paced, or takes too much time explaining a plot that is so simple it could be explained in 5 seconds.<br/><br/>But starting with the anime sequence, Kill Bill was unflappable.  So much of this film is a homage to other films, and yet it manages to be one of the most original films I've seen in years.  The images and music in some scenes, such as the final swordfight in the snow, are simply beautiful. Exquisite, even.  And even the minor characters, such as the sushi chef and the Texas sheriff, are interesting people you want to know more about. <br/><br/>
It IS violent and bloody.  Most of the blood is so over-the-top, it's just a geyser of red and not very disturbing.  But some of it IS disturbing, and although I've seen much more gory movies like Dead Alive/Braindead and Day of the Dead, I actually wish Kill Bill had toned it down a touch.  It's so bloody that many people have focused only on that aspect of the film, which is a shame.<br/><br/>Kill Bill has moments that are among the best ever filmed, but I don't think the film as a whole is as good as Pulp Fiction.  I give it 9/10."
"zetes","7","0","1","19 October 2003"," Don't go too far in your praise: it's merely okay
","I have, for a long time, been skeptical of whether Quentin Tarantino was a worthwhile talent. Certainly Pulp Fiction was a seminal film of the 1990s, for better or worse, and Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown were at least worthwhile. But it was my burgeoning opinion that his style of goofy, self-referential filmmaking was already irrelevant, and that the cinema, even American cinema, had moved beyond anything he could accomplish. And, watching Kill Bill: Vol. 1, I realized pretty quickly that I was absolutely correct. With a new crop of young proto-auteurs that has been born since QT made Jackie Brown in 1997, Kill Bill seems awfully trite. I predicted a while back that, if Tarantino didn't make a masterpiece this time around, it would be the end of him. Well, now I think I was wrong about that. Kill Bill is far, far, far from a masterpiece, but it's not a disaster. It's somewhat mediocre, but entertaining enough that I will see its second installment (and the fact that it comes in two parts doesn't annoy me at all, in fact, as I believed it would; it ends very well), and probably the next movie Tarantino decides to make. As for the film, it's all style, no substance. I spent most of the movie wondering whether I liked it or not. And there was plenty in the film that I didn't like. The story is very poor, not compelling in the least, and the characters are dreadful. The pacing is way too slow, and the dialogue is extremely awkward at times. But the action sequences are fun, if too bloody (I'm not that big a fan of violence, to tell you the truth). I, very unfortunately, had to go to the bathroom during the longest action sequence. I don't think I will ever see this movie again, but I might just to see everything in that balletic melée. But what tipped me over from dislike into indifference was mostly the technical stuff. The costume design is fabulous, as are the cinematography and music. And the production design is some of the best I've seen, a shoo in for an Oscar nomination. Some of the editing during the fight sequences was annoying (this certainly doesn't compare to real martial arts movies, so the Shaw Brothers logo at the film's opening is a huge tease), but a lot of it was very good, too. While the shifting in time wasn't necessary, it worked well. What pushed me from indifference into approval was the animated sequence. It is the only exceptional thing in the film. It reminded me a lot of Peter Chung's work (he created Aeon Flux, which is perhaps the greatest work of animation in the last decade; this sequence seemed particularly influenced by the silent Aeon Flux cartoons from Liquid Television), but my theatergoing companions did not allow me to stick around and watch the full of the credits. I did see that it was animated in Tokyo, but any other info would be much appreciated. So, in full, Kill Bill is very worthwhile, hardly great (I'd already call it extremely overrated  some of the reviews I read last week I find a bit embarrassing), but a decent, Sunday afternoon entertainment. You might even want to wait for DVD, as you'll most likely get to see both installments as one long film (although I have doubts that it would even work as one movie, considering that this first part is nearly two hours long as it is). 7/10."
"kingtanichi","10","0","1","19 October 2003"," Whoa
","The Oscars can say whatever they want, but Kill Bill is the best movie of 2003. It's a total movie; a work of art that could never be realized in any other medium. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction would have worked as novels (though no prizes for guessing which kind), and Jackie Brown was adapted from one. There's an immediacy to it rarely matched elsewhere -- one brilliant conceived set-piece rapidly follows another after another. Quentin Tarantino knows how brilliant he is, and is not afraid to show it, making narrative leaps other directors would retract into the fetal position just contemplating.<br/><br/>Case in point: the samurai swords. I can't imagine anybody in Japan uses samurai swords as practical weapons anymore, to say nothing of their being the weapon of choice for the Yakuza. Tarantino overcomes this logistical roadblock by totally ignoring it. And after the climactic fight scene, lasting probably twenty minutes and with more thrills and intense choreography than The Matrix Reloaded could ever dream of, we're more than happy to let it go.<br/><br/>I've always felt there is an art to the integration of pop music into a movie by skillful editing, but its been grievously weakened by its poorly-conceived overuse in recent years. The credo seems to be that faster and more chaotic is better, and the tone of the piece isn't as important. Tarantino knows better, exercising the same brilliance in picking tunes and editing the movie around them that helped Pulp Fiction be as great as it was.<br/><br/>Even the smallest touches are masterful -- Coppola's oranges have nothing on Tarantino's breakfast cereal. Uma Thurman, for her part, dominates the screen in a performance that's far more difficult that it looks. And speaking of difficult -- don't even get me started on waiting for Volume Two."

I'm more than happy to see him broaden his palette. The performances are spot on, despite criticism the soundtrack is next on my shopping list and the direction is sublime. A neat Anime back story in the middle, brilliant and numerous moments of black humor combined with lightening fast swordplay rises above every other film i've seen in the cinema this year. <br/><br/>I can't wait to see how Tarantino tackles the War genre but most of all i look forward to Volume 2.

The beginning when it showed the Shaw Brothers logo was simply wonderful.  <br/><br/>     The story is about a former assassin (Uma Thurman) who is left for dead by her former cohorts and put in a coma.  She wakes from her coma four years later and goes on a revenge spree on each member of her former assassin team that left her for dead.  Miss Thurman locates her second victim (Vivica A. Fox) and kills her with her child watching the entire scenario.  Then Miss Thurman (in flashback sequence) kills her first victim (Lucy Liu).  At the end of this great movie, Bill (David Carradine) informs one of his associates that the Bride's (Thurman) child is still alive.<br/><br/>     This movie has it all, comedy, action and a great anime sequence that tells the origin of Lucy Liu's character.  The anime was simply realistically done to a perfect tee.  Also, Mr. Tarantino uses a lot of 70's references like the theme to Ironside and Shaw Brothers logo.  This movie has to be one of the bloodiest in cinema history but its more comical than horror.  <br/><br/>     The Dark Gengar gives this movie from one Gengar to Ten Gengars: Ten Gengars   Plus the soundtrack has a very eerie cut that was used in the opening of this movie which was done by Nancy Sinatra and overall good.

","That little summary phrase is Japanese for ""extremely awesome.""  This movie proves yet again how Talented a director and writer Quentin Tarantino really is.  The previews for the movie do an excellent job of keeping people in the dark about the most of the movie, and I'll try to do the same.  Kill Bill basically centers on ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman)and her quest for revenge. She was an assassin betrayed by her former comrades.  This movie is full of action.  In fact, it's quite refreshing to see such an action-packed movie that relies very little, if at all, on firearms.  The special effects may not seem to be state-of-the-art (you'll see what I mean), but I beseech you to disregard such vain things.  There's much much more to the movie than the violence and action.  Unlike most action movies, the plot proves itself quite riveting.  The twists and turns, while most movies have them, mask themselves so well and when they finally do make themselves known, they do so in a surprising manner.  Being only Volume 1 of a two-part franchise, I eagerly anticipate Volume 2's February release.  I can't say in good faith that this is my favorite Tarantino film, as I'm a sucker for the land of the rising sun.

I liked that we got to see what kind of person The Bride was (""It was not my intention for you to witness that..."") right off the bat.

","I've never done heroin, but I imagine that first hit, the one that gets you hooked, feels a bit like how I felt watching the massacre at the end of Kill Bill Vol 1.<br/><br/>I was skeptical. As a big QT fan I felt six years was too long to wait, and I really didn't believe the anticipation and the hype would be rewarded with a great movie. I was expecting merely a good movie, and for QT good isn't good enough. Luckily he knows this, and instead he delivered what is, if not his best film, certainly his most energetic, exciting, stylised and downright fun film.<br/><br/>There's been a lot of dissing of QT's motives with this movie. The hyper-stylised look of the film has been criticised as too fan-boy centric. This is a good point, but it's certainly no more so than Robert Rodriguez's Desperado, or the Coen's Blood Simple, and I don't remember anyone accusing those of being fanboy movies.<br/><br/>Whatever your take on the movie, you surely have to admire the man's technical ability and sheer audacity. The tea house battle that ends the movie is a masterpiece, a real example of 'the ballet of violence' that John Woo fans have always loved.<br/><br/>I did get the feeling from the crowd I saw it with that many were not sure what they were watching. Crouching Tiger... this most definitely was not. Pulp Fiction is was not. Hell, even Dusk til Dawn it was not. This was unlike anything QT has ever done and for that alone he should be applauded. On the release of Jackie Brown many critics had decided that he had run his course and he couldn't do anything else. Well Kill Bill is the samurai sword up the arse to those who believed that.<br/><br/>Anyone who loves cinema should see this movie. I won't say that everyone will love it, but it has everything that Hollywood has forgotten how to do: a good story, adrenaline pumping action, and a sense of awe. Remember how you felt when you first saw Star Wars, the Imperial Destroyer roaring over your head? Or when Indiana Jones was being chased by a giant boulder? That kind of excitement is captured here as hordes of Kato-masked villains fall at Uma's sword, or the sight of legendary Sonny Chiba bestowing on her the sword that could cut God!<br/><br/>Thankfully, the pop culture references that were his trademark have been toned down. Unfortunately, they've been replaced with an almost Airplane-style desire to reference other movies and TV shows. It's nice when it works (Ironside music, quotes from Eaten Alive (""I'm Buck, and here to f***""), even the girl from Battle Royale wearing the same costume as she did in that movie), but there is the potential danger for it all to become a little self-parodying, something Kill Bill most definately is not.<br/><br/>
See it and regain your faith in cinema."

","...will hopefully be.. Err.. Hang on. How does that go?<br/><br/>As a standalone film, this doesn't work for me. It's fairly entertaining, but goes nowhere. A revenge film, with huge amounts of death-dealing, but the whole tapestry is left unfinished and we've only seen a few threads. Hopefully when the second volume comes out, it will come together.<br/><br/>Much as I can't stand Tarantino as a person (not that I've met him, I just imagine from the interviews I've seen that he's one of the most annoying people on the planet) I think he's a pretty good craftsman in this industry. He's certainly thrown a few good scenes in here. But there are a few things that are jarring, like the anime and the black and white.<br/><br/>Another reviewer mentioned the sherrif's sunglasses as an example of Tarantino's depth. Every character is thought out in great detail. The way I see that is that Tarantino finds it impossible to be subtle. If it were a throwaway moment, fine, but it's right in our faces, and then for good measure the deputy is the sherrif's son. Why isn't he out looking for the Bandit?<br/><br/>The cast was great and the soundtrack excellent, but I'll give this a 7 until I see the whole thing."

","With the cost of seeing a film reaching an unGodly amount, a film has got to be totally worth it, its got to deliver and Kill Bill delivers in spades. Does this mean that its a movie you recommend to everyone? No. I am not going to recommend it to too many girls I know, or anyone over the age of sixty five. I am however going to espouse its virtues to any true lover of films. Is it better than any of the other three films Tarantino has created, its hard to say, it will be easier to determine once Volume 2 is released and then wait for about 10 years. Right now it doesn't matter because its recaptured that feeling I had when I first walked out of Pulp Fiction, although Jackie Brown is my favorite by a slight margin and I did walk out of that viewing totally thrilled, Pulp Fiction was like a drug and Kill Bill has that same effect.<br/><br/> I had read the screenplay when it was first on-line and I wish I hadn't in a way but really it didn't matter because it did not prepare me for what was on the screen. This movie isalive and knowing that the best is yet to come I can't wait. Every positive has been talked about and touched upon by every scribe in North America so I will quickly go over the obviously great aspects of this hyper active revenge tale.<br/><br/> Uma Thurman - Sexy as hell and f*****g bad ass. The female Charles Bronson. I can't understand how some people feel that her character is underwritten and undermotivated, I don't get it. What more do you want. She was a killer, she got shot in the head by her Ex husband and boss, her new husband and family were killed, she was pregnant at the time, she went into a coma where her body was peddled by a depraved orderly, she wakes up to realize this little detail then realizes that she lost the kid. She is super pissed and has more need for revenge than any character I can remember.<br/><br/>The music - This might be the greatest part of the film, because it is stuck in my head like a ten inch blade. I love the use of Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang"", The Enrico Marccone score is used to great effect and the one that really gets me going is the ""Green Hornet"" theme that plays as Uma heads to Tokyo. It all just kicks ass.<br/><br/> Go Go Yubari - Every scene she was in she stole. Those eyes, that face. I love that little asian school girl giggle she gives as the ball and chain hit the floor. Like I read somewhere, I think on ""Chud"" she is the Boba Fett of the new millenium.<br/><br/> O'Ren Ishi's anime backstory - Unreal, I love how the animation gets better as she ""gets better"". Its completely involving and creates such a unique tone to the film without really taking you out of the story. Its  thrilling.<br/><br/> The dialogue - now alot of people are talking about how it isn't Tarantino's best, how there isn't enough of it and the stuff that is there seems forced or too contrived, too ""hey look at me"". I don't buy it, I would buy it with a critique on ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", but not here. There is no need for long witty pop culture referenced sililoques. Whats there is enough, anyway it does serve a purpose later and you know with Michael Madsen there we will get a taste of some original verbiage. Its a different film from his others.<br/><br/> Is there anything I didn't like? Well there are some aspects as with all great films. One of them concerns her obtaining of the Hanzo blade. It lacked the whollup, the scene as a whole was great, but maybe too quick. I was one of the people that didn't like the switch to black and white during the ""House Of Blue Leaves"" battle, the obvious body double didn't help and the use of the steel sometimes did not seem right. These were all small details, overall the film was great.<br/><br/> Lucy Liu was beautiful, what a great character. I love the little Sonny Chiba scene ""The Man From Okinawa"", but like I said it might of been too quick.<br/><br/> Now to all those that bitch about the film and how its cut in two and this sucked and that sucked, just wait, I guarantee the next film will be unbelievable and then we can sit back and judge it as a whole, and just like Jacki Brown people will come around. Tarantino is not God but he sure can make going to the movies fun as hell."
"Viz79","10","0","1","14 October 2003"," A sublime scintillating experence like none other
","Kill Bill - Episode One... here was a movie that I had been looking forward to for such a long time. And what hype... I personally am a huge Tarentino fan... I was convinced by Reservoir Dogs and I was completely sold and enamoured by the truly excellent Pulp Fiction (and then later liked Jackie Brown but not anywhere near the level of the others), and now here is the fourth of his films, or at least the first part of it.<br/><br/>After watching it, I sat there thinking.. this movie has not let me down one bit and I simply cannot believe how it delivered exactly what it said on the poster - 'a roaring rampage of revenge'. If anyone comes out of the cinema and claims that all it was was about 'killing', firstly, they would have missed all the undertones and issues that were present (and displayed in a number of superb ways including anime) and secondly, next time read the poster before you go in!<br/><br/>From the sweet singing sound of the samurai blade being pulled out of the sheath by the master that crafted it, to the superb perfectly choreographed fights to the sensational dialogue, I can say that the only thing wrong with Kill Bill is that I know for a fact that when Episode 2 finishes, I will be dying for more. I am glad that Tarentino is likely to do an anime prelude because in all honesty, I can't get enough of these characters and this 'fantasy' scenario.<br/><br/>But the main thing is - it is not just some movie with lots of deaths that is just a good laugh to watch. It manages to supercede even Pulp Fiction in the simple fact that what is created on screen just makes you bite your tongue and love every second that the film drips out. Well Pulp Fiction managed to do that too, but mix that with a great andrenalin rush and theres Kill Bill. With classic salutes to so many genres from Westerns to classic 70s Martial Arts to so many other things, I get the feeling that this film will be *especially* special for those that really love the kung fu martial art movies of old (and yes I did grow up on films like 'Snake in the Shadow of the Monkey'!).<br/><br/>And then theres the anime - beautifully drawn, and haunting in its execution of the emotional issues. The music is superb and is a part and parcel of the fights to create a sensational experience. Ahh this can go on and on.. in truth, this film is simply a masterpiece and one I will be seeing countless times again. What can I say, just like the razor sharp Hattori Hanzo blade, the movie manages to inspire me and drive me and I could sit there for houts watching it with its monumental soundtrack.<br/><br/>Bah this is too much.. go watch it for heavens sake and see what the fuss is about. Simply one of the best films by one of the top film makers ever. 10/10."

"akhon","6","0","2","14 October 2003"," Disappointing
","***SPOILERS***<br/><br/> Being a fan of Tarantino and Pulp Fiction, I had been eagerly awaiting Kill Bill for months.  Maybe my expectations were too high because when the movie was over, I was disappointed.<br/><br/> Fist of Legend (1994) is still the standard by which I compare all other martial arts movies to, and although the tone of Kill Bill is different, it doesn't hold up.<br/><br/> Like his previous films, Tarantino uses non-linear storytelling, a technique that became so prevalent during late nineties.  A straightforward narrative would have been more appropriate for this revenge epic.<br/><br/> As many other people have commented, Kill Bill is all style and no substance.  Character development is one Tarantino's strengths, but there's barely any of it here.  In fact, the character with the most depth is O-Ren Ishii, whose background is told through a beautifully animated sequence. But so what?  All that information that we learn about her serves no purpose and is negated because she's killed off at the end of the movie.<br/><br/> Although the fight choreography by Yuen Woo-Ping is good, it doesn't compare to his previous efforts like Snake in Eagle's Shadow, Fist of Legend, or Tai Chi Master.  The finish to each big fight is anti-climatic. Vernita Green got a knife thrown into her heart,  Go Go got a board with nails stuck in her head, and O-Ren Ishii got the top of her head lopped off. For three villains that were supposedly lethal assassins, they died like chumps.<br/><br/> As it stands, I can only give Kill Bill a 6/10."

","When it comes to alcohol, Absinthe comes in two main varieties, distilled (which is the purer form) and ""Mixed and Macerated"", where the additional herbal ingredients are blended after the distilling process.  In general, pure distilled Absinthe is both more palatable, and more effective.<br/><br/>A master distiller of any intoxicating beverage draws on tradition, and experiments to not only pay tribute to that past, but to give the world his own creation; to leave his mark.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is a heady mixture of pure action, drawing on numerous inspirations, blended to perfection, and distilled onto film.  From an unlikely mix of anime, spaghetti westerns and grindhouse comes a concoction in which each ingredient can be tasted and identified on sampling, but the sum is what makes it unique, and more than it's parts.<br/><br/>At the same time, it is infused with Tarantino's unique brand of humour and emotion.  The liquid flows freely from the screen to the bloodstream, leaving one both intoxicated and wanting more by the end.<br/><br/>The more familiar you are with the ingredients at work here, the more you'll appreciate the fine blending techniques that Tarantino has used to achieve the end result.  Even if you aren't familiar with any of the genres at work, maybe a taste of Kill Bill will whet your appetite for more, as there is a reason Tarantino IS paying tribute to this stuff.  If you want to know the history behind it, I'd suggest looking at the imdb message board with all the reference being listed.<br/><br/>It's not a drink for everyone, and most definitely an acquired taste, but if you don't try it, you'll never know.

","A Very long wait but once again Tarantino (The man!) has delivered!<br/><br/>Every single one of his movies have been brilliant (With Pulp fiction and Reservoir Dogs setting standards). I really didn't know what to expect when he moved towards the Action genre. But after seeing the movie ( booked in advance :)), I realised that the film is in a genre of its own. I don't believe I have seen a film quite like this for a very long time.<br/><br/>
What impressed me about the film is the audacity Tarantino had not only the way he had written it but also some of the beautiful directions in the film. Most directors these days have forgotten why and for whom they are making movies. Throughout the film it is clear to see Tarantino has kept the viewers' eyes in his mind. He shot it in a way that will intrigue the viewer throughout. A lot of directors these days have ignored the viewers and have been directing in a way they feel is good enough (hence a lot of bad movies!!).<br/><br/>I loved the music he used and would like to give praise to those who worked on the soundtrack / Score (I'm downloading it as we speak - but I'll also buy it so don't get mad at me for downloading). Robert Richardson, Cinematography, must also be given credit.<br/><br/>A fantastic film by a genius geek!I would recommend the film to anyone (over-age) who loves movies but who isn't easily shocked.<br/><br/>

","Quentin Tarantino is to cinema as The Who is to music.  While you can call their works art, the truth is both are entertainers who concentrate on creating things that they like to see/hear.  Quentin Tarantino is really nothing more complex than the world's biggest Quentin Tarantino fan.  That is not a negative - I too am a big Tarantino fan.<br/><br/>One thing I found interesting is there is a children motif in ""Kill Bill"". Uma's character starts the film pregnant, Lucy Lui's character endures unspeakable horrors in her youth, Go-Go is only 17 and already a world-class killer, and Viveca A. Fox's child is left alive to perhaps avenge her mother someday.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest twist is that Kill Bill will at least be nominated for many technical Oscars even though the film and sound editing are at times deliberately bad."
"darkwolfe-dcn","10","0","1","14 October 2003"," Bloody homage to classic 70's kung-fu with a Tarantino twist!!
","First things first. If you loved those old 60s and 70s Kung-fu flick you will in all likelihood love this movie. If you hate those type of movies, you may hate this movie.<br/><br/>With that out of the way, Tarantino beautifully takes memorable scenes from classic movies and gives it a Tarantino twist. Scene and music homages range from the old black and white samurai movies from the 50s, the aforementioned kung-fu movies of the 70s, Bruce Lee movies/tv show, classic western 70s action movies, the Night of the Living Dead, Sergio Spaghetti westerns, modern Japanese anime and culture, HK action operos, and on and on! Knowledgeable viewers will love picking out the little tidbits of classic movie icons (both visual and sound) in this gem! Only Tarantino can do this and make you smile (unlike other directors, in which viewers scoff at their lame rip-offs). I loved the scenes when Uma does something cool in which a corny 70s sounding ""bionic"" sound fx plays--absolutely fantastic!!!<br/><br/>For the detractors of this movie, see my above statement. One thing viewers have to realize is that since this movie is a homage mainly to the Shaw Brothers and other Grindhouse flicks of the 70s (did you notice the intro of the movie?) that it's going to be heavy on action and short on Tarantino's usual dynamic dialogue (which I missed except for the excellent scene with Chiba-sama). This movie doesn't take itself seriously and expects the audience to do the same! There is a reason for the corny 70s music and sound fx. It is to put the reader in the mindset that what will be seen will be over-the-top and dare I say--""goofy"" for your average western viewer (for lack of a better word). When I first saw glimpses of the trailer (I didn't know it was a Tarantino flick) I knew it was going to be a action-heavy movie short on narrative. Obviously, seeing Uma wielding a samurai sword wearing a Bruce Lee ""Game of Death"" style jumpsuit surrounded by masked Kato men told me that this movie was going to be a comic book style flick. And in that, it did not disappoint at all. A great action flick from the man himself!!"

","I haven't experienced this sort of exhilaration for a long time. So many memorable scenes. One thing many people seem to forget is that while the impact of a play is largely determined by the performances, a movie can arrest an audience through sound and images. Tarantino has taken the latter and riskier route here, and he has one hell of a vision. The marriage of the music and the editing is just breathtaking. The scenes without music are just as compelling. Every shot seemed carefully designed, edited, and finetuned for maximum punch. This is one movie that demonstrates the difference between a large screen and a television set."

","Rating *****<br/><br/>QT does it again with his different & brilliant style of filmmaking. Kill Bill is not as great as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs in my view but does come close in at 3rd place for me infront of Jackie Brown (which i still liked very much). However what i do have to say is that Kill Bill is Tarantino's best looking/sounding film in terms of visuals & sound. He has once again (like he did in Pulp) changed the order of the film which i believe makes this film even greater but what blew me away was the visual look of the film & especially the sound effects. Ok i watched it at Leicester Square with a massive screen & tons of speakers but i still feel the sound would of been excellent in a smaller cinema. In the scene before Uma Thurman wakes from her comer a mosquito is flying about & it actually sounded like there was one in the cinema & all the sword slashing & stabbing was awsome & the gunshot Uma Thurman takes to the head (i hope no one takes this as a spoiler as you should know she gets shot and wakes up from a coma as that's the whole point of the story) was very good & made tons of people jump in the cinema,me including, as it seemed to come out of no where. I heard it was meant to of been one of the goriest movies ever & although it was fairly gory it still isn't as bad as many people have said it is & was just like the Japanese Versus & was no where near as bad as The Story of Ricky or Braindead! The cast isn't as slick as Tarantino's other films not as good as Jackie Brown (which had a great cast) although Uma Thurman was excellent. Bill Caradine isn't seen visually in the movie (well you don't see his face) Michael Madsen & Daryl Hannah are barely in Vol. 1 & Vivica.A. Fox isn't in it much also whereas Lucy Lui is in it quite a bit & is the character the movie goes into the most although she didn't seem right to me in this part, she had the looks but not the acting ability. Overall Kill Bill is a stunning & amazing achievement in Filmmaking with a terrific ending (which i won't spoil for anyone) to lead to Vol. 2 & with it's fair share of gore, humor & Tarantino trademarks (Shot from car bonnet).<br/><br/>5/5 - I can't wait for Volume 2"

Kill Bill is the best film that I have seen in 2003. It even beat out Matrix Reloaded for me... and that's saying a lot. All throughout the film, every scene just drenched with Tarintino's imagination and charm. To me, I just saw a little boy growing up in California watching Kung Fu movies and now he gets all these awesome toys to make his own.<br/><br/>Some of the acting was a little corny, but that was his intention. He wanted it as authentic as possible. Quentin Tarintino has done it again, and he knows just the right people to act in his films.

","I will spare people the spoilers. Let's just say that I have seen this movie 3 times already and am going a 4th time tonight. I will clarify that as a movie theater employee, this was for free. This is one movie, however, that I would gladly plunk down money for. This film is the best fusion of comedy and violence I have ever seen. It is at times very twisted, some times poignant, but practically always amusing. On one hand the violence is cartoonish and so over the top so as not to be taken too seriously, but on the other, it seems almost as though ""The Bride"" really is dispatching people at a pace that any nefarious serial killer or mass murderer would envy. Honestly, I would have rated this movie NC-17 without a second thought. Kudos to Quentin Tarantino for finagling an R rating. Maybe the MPAA liked it so much they gave him a pass. Say what you want about QT's homage paying, cribbing, amalgamating - What have you. All I know is that he has once again delivered a solid, entertaining movie. I think all those people bashing Harvey Weinstein will have to eat their words. First off, I think his primary reason for splitting Kill Bill is so Tarantino could make a full movie that would not have to be cut down for time, and thereby we are getting the real deal. Even if a big part of the reason is to increase profits, so what? That is Mr. Weinstein's job after all. I think it is a win-win for both audiences and Miramax.

The stories were all unique, but had a basic formula, Kill Bill vol.1 follows the style and story of these movies. Characters that seem one dimensional, but actually are deeper then what we have become shown in the movies as of late.  We follow ""the bride"" in her journey to seek retribution against those who did her wrong on her wedding day.  Unlike most action movies, she goes after her prey with precision, patience, and control.  It is a delightfully rewarding film for any kung fu fan... the movie has Sonny Chiba... what else needs to be said?  The soundtrack is perfection, the songs chosen, and the score is by RZA if I'm not mistaken, fits the movie so well.

The film opens with these old logos that looked to be re-used from the 1970's. That set the tone, and from then on i could not keep my goosebumps down.  I knew that it would be a good film just because it was Tarantino, but it beat my expectations ten fold.  During the film, I looked over at one of my friends to see his reaction, he looked over at me with a with his jaw dropped and we just turned back to the film.  The words were not spoken but we knew how one another felt about the ridiculously amazing cinematic masterpice that we were witnessing.  So I guess that is kind of my metaphor towards how much this film meant to all of us and to everyone else I have talked to about it.

Although I would have been bummed about that for a while, Kill Bill killed my petty jealousy and fueled my desire to create (plus i went back the next night to see it again). Kill Bill is up there with some of my all time favorites along with 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dead Presidents, Foxy Brown, and of course Pulp Fiction."
"xerospy","Null","0","1","14 October 2003"," Great Movie....
","...i don't understand the bad comments.  I can see how you might think it's bad, but it's a TRIBUTE to like 70s asian martial arts cinema...did no one notice the paper cut outs of the city and the string on the plane??  It was all just blood stimulating that you should expect from a movie like this, you can't take it seriously, just have to have fun with it.  FYI, QT is a big Asian Cinema fan, Resevoir Dogs was based on City On  Fire, a Hong Kong flick with Chow Yun Fat way back in the day...."
"Nuada7","8","0","1","13 October 2003"," Just wow.
","A cinematically beautiful work by Tarantino without the flashy CGI effects and realistic gore that plagues contemporary film, the main thing that stands out about this movie is the absolutely ridiculous amount of bloodshed.  All the (rather bloody) gore in the film is meant entirely to be over the top, and at that it succeeds.  It's just that the bloodshed is over the top to the point of being one of the most memorable things (if not *the* most memorable thing) about the film.<br/><br/>Wonderful camerawork, extensive use of color, visual irony, beautiful women (from Darryl Hannah with one eye to the jaw-dropping Chiaki Kuriyama), a killer soundtrack, marvelous swordplay, but above all, enough fake blood to fill a lake.  There's even an incredibly bloody anime sequence thrown in for good measure.  It's entertaining enough to keep your interest, but bloody enough to make you feel like showering afterwards (so long as you're not too much into ""Doppelganger"", as that would just continue the trend).  I personally have a very active imagination and am quite open to sympathy pain, so I probably won't watch this one but perhaps once more (right before vol. 2 comes out).<br/><br/>8/10.  It would be 9, but you honestly don't understand how freakin bloody this film is until you've seen it."

","I'm sorry, as good as this film is; the dialogue is so below par I am shocked that it was penned by the same man who wrote the snappy patter, and grand soliloquies of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>I can only assume that he's either doing it on purpose, in an effort to emulate the lousy subtitles of his favorite Asian action films; Or that much of the dialogue is stolen from various sources; OR that he has lost his gift for it altogether.<br/><br/>Come to think of it, all three reasons could be valid to a degree.<br/><br/>Still, the bottom line is this: The trick he was trying to pull off didn't work.<br/><br/>Amazing dialogue would have catapulted this film to greatness.

","From the beginning to the awesome fight scene to end it (well Volume 1) this is just a great movie. Everyone has been complaining about the violence, blood, and gore in this movie. While I won't preach about one way or another, all I have to say is that it's a rated R movie, what do you expect? While I had no problems with it, some people may. Like anything, you have to decide if the risk is worth it.<br/><br/>But more importantly, the cinematography and script is just plain awesome. From the subtle nuances and tributes to Hong Kong Kung Fu Films (See if you notice the Bruce Lee homage for example), the influence of anime, the humorous dialogue and most importantly the emphasis on the Samurai Code makes this beyond just an awesome action movie.<br/><br/>If you take the time to see what's going on outside the great fight scenes, you'll have that better of an experience. But if you want just the great action, see it the first time for that, then see it a second time to appreciate all the underlying depth.<br/><br/>Can't wait for Volume 2"

"Kevin_Maness","7","0","1","14 October 2003"," Kill Bill has soul, but it doesn't have A soul
","I really enjoyed Kill Bill while I was watching it, but the more I think about it, the more I feel certain that Kill Bill is not a truly great movie.  Here's why.<br/><br/>I think I have to consider two aspects of this movie when critiquing it: the style and the substance.  Style includes things like the music, the visual quality of the movie, the references to other movies and genres, and even the tone of the<br/><br/>dialogue.  Substance, though, includes the quality and the originality of the narrative, any moral or philosophical dimension, and whether the movie offers anything actually to think about when it's over.<br/><br/>Put simply, Tarrantino is a stylistic genius.  If all I wanted were style, this movie would be beyond a 10.  No one matches a soundtrack to the feel of a movie like Tarrantino.  No one can make an audience think ""bad asssss"" like Tarrantino;<br/><br/>there were some lines of dialogue that made the audience laugh and cheer<br/><br/>because they were so bad ass.  The fight sequences are great, the animation<br/><br/>sequence was extremely cool, the black and white scenes worked.  The feel of<br/><br/>this movie is simply amazing, and that's what keeps the audience engaged<br/><br/>while the movie is playing.  The movie has soul, without a doubt.<br/><br/>But it seems that Tarrantino put all his energy into the style of the movie and spent little time on anything substantive.  He uses the standard revenge plot that's served as the narrative backbone for thousands of movies and books over the years, and he adds very little to it.  It's almost as if he wanted to save time and energy on the actual writing so he could devote more attention to making<br/><br/>the film look and feel really really cool.  To tell the truth, I care very little about any of the characters in this movie, and I don't really wonder all that much what's going to happen to them.  In fact, using the standard revenge plot line even<br/><br/>takes the interest out of Tarrantino's so-called ""non-linear"" storytelling<br/><br/>sequence.  I mean, since it's a revenge plot, there is a correct sequence, even if Tarrantino chooses to show the events out of order; the result is that his non- chronological sequence seems like more of a gimic than anything else.  When it comes down to it, Kill Bill has soul, but it doesn't have A soul--something that powers the movie from deep within, something that lives on when the movie is<br/><br/>over.  What I mean is that there's really nothing under the surface of this film.  It's empty spectacle.  <br/><br/>Maybe this is what ""genius"" has come to in our times.  We're so cynical about things we can't see that surface spectacle is all we ask for, as if that's all that could possibly matter.  But I think that movies like Crouching Tiger, Pulp Fiction, Hardboiled show us that a movie can be quite violent and visually stunning but with some actual thought-provoking substance.  I think Tarrantino managed to<br/><br/>develop both aspects in his previous three films, but he fails in this one.<br/><br/>One caveat with something of a SPOILER: if Kill Bill, vol. 2 gives us some truly incredible breaks from the typical revenge plot, stuff that we never could have expected (maybe the missing baby will prove to be significant in this regard), this might redeem the disappointment I feel after Kill Bill, vol. 1.  If vol. 1 is just a set up for the surprises of vol. 2, all may be forgiven."
"TXastorian","7","0","1","13 October 2003"," Here's where an editor might come in handy
","I enjoyed ""Kill Bill,"" but I found myself rolling my eyes a lot. Quentin Tarantino seems to think that if a scene is stirring once, then it'll be equally effective if he repeats it half a dozen times.<br/><br/>There was absolutely no need for ""Kill Bill"" to be divided into two films. What Tarantino needed was an editor smart enough (and tough enough) to say ""There's a lot of unnecessary, repetitive crud here, and it needs to go. ONE decapitated body spraying out a fountain of blood is fine, but not six. ONE huge samurai sword fight is plenty. There's enough film here in the can to make one great movie or two mediocre ones. I say we make one great one.""<br/><br/>But Tarantino didn't have such a capable, gutsy editor. Too bad."
"allisonium","10","0","1","13 October 2003"," This movie is true modern art.
","This movie was an astonishing visual treasure.  Tarrantino's deep enthusiasm with the martial arts genre shines through in the story, but it is masterful use of story that haunts you after you leave the theater.  Tarrantino is unflinching when it comes to showing true grit.  There is a rape scene that instills the viewer with a complex array of emotions; fear, disgust, rage, and, ultimately, triumph. Most directors shy away from visuals that make the audiene feel vulnerable, but Kill Bill puts you right in the same state you felt when you first watched Marsellis in that white-supremacist dungeon in ""Pulp Fiction"".  Beyond the Tarrantino edge, visuals in ""Kill Bill"" are superlative, an absolute visual treat.  Battles are fought in delicate snow-dappled gardens and against simple shadow-on-backdrop 3D-screens. His focus on even the faces of the warriors when they are dying and killing are gorgeous.  And there is a scene done completely in incredible animation. Tarrantino has spent his life ingesting film, and he has in turn expressed something that is both a wonderful homage to his influences and a totally original sensation."

My favorite thing about the movie was the music and how it just played along with the storyline.

","Tonight I decided since being bored outta my mind, I would catch the newest Entry by Quentin Tarantino..... KILL BILL.<br/><br/>So at approx 10:20pm I decided to leave the house and haul A$$ to the Loews Cineplex to catch the 10:45pm showing.<br/><br/>After sitting thru some of the most boring trailers I have ever seen, It was Feature Presentation Time.<br/><br/>I loved Quentin's Use of the Old FP backdrop's, but what followed was not worth my time or trouble. The first 15 mins of the film was utterly boring...... Quentin, What are you doing? you are better than this. Then the film begins to pick up pace..... Now the film actually does have it's moment's... Such as The Bride's arrival in Okinawa.... And some of the film's best moment's are played out between the Bride and the Sushi Bartender. Once those comical bits are thru we begin to slip back into the boringness of what is to be the 4th entry for Quentin.<br/><br/>(I hope you notice I am not trying to get into detail about the film so I don't spoil it for those whom have not seen it.)<br/><br/>Now the Fight scenes are pretty decent..... The Gore is outrageous and at times Extremely over the top...... Come On...... How much blood can you lose, and still be alive. Many Kudo's to KNB Fx..... You can See How much Tom Savini has influenced this company. anyway.<br/><br/>Other than the fight scene's.... which are very good. The film's Pace and mood are destroyed by the Use of the obscure Music Quentin Dig's out of the Ole Vault's. The Trailer entices us with a very catchy rhythm...... and it is Featured in the film for about Two minute's....What a shame. That music Is why I wanted to attend Kill Bill in the first Place. Instead I am treated to Music that neither fit's the scene's or provides any help to the film's Story. Maybe I am missing something... Cuz Quentin is Usually very good at music Placement...... But this time...... WOW is it off.<br/><br/>My other Peeve is the fact the music is soft.... then Blaring Loud... which in turn makes the film less enjoyable.<br/><br/>Kill Bill Vol 1. Should have just been Kill the Volume .... or Kill the DJ..... My other peeve is the fact Miramax made Quentin Cut this film into 2 film's...... I believe had this played in it's entirety..... I think I would have enjoyed it more.<br/><br/>Sorry but this is Quentin's Worst entry... So far! and I would not recommend this film to anyone, Especially a QT fan.<br/><br/>So in February 2004..... Will my opinion change? No... Because KB should have been left uncut. Sorry QT. I love your work.... But this I cannot enjoy.....

"dnorris113","10","0","1","12 October 2003"," Stylish, violent, and exciting action film by Quentin Tarantino.
","Kill Bill Vol. 1 definately lives up to the expectations.  Kill Bill is the story of The Bride (Uma Thurman).  Everyone The Bride loved was murdered on her wedding day by the groom, Bill (David Carradine), and his henchman. The Bride, who was also pregnant, is also shot in the head by Bill but she survives, the baby does not though.  So she now seeks revenge on Bill and his four henchman (Played by Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Michael Madsen).<br/><br/>This film has a great plot but the action definately is the highlight of Kill Bill Vol. 1.  The action is extremely stylish and is supported by great music.  This makes this action movie many steps ahead of any other action movie.  Another thing that stands out in this film is the violence.  This film is by far the bloodiest film out there.  In all the action scenes blood sprays everywhere and body parts are being cut off.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is great.  Uma Thurman is awesome as The Bride. Her only emotion is sadness and revenge, and she makes it very clear thats all she feels when you see how she interacts with the other characters.<br/><br/>
The supporting cast is also just as good as Uma Thurman.  Lucy Liu is great as O-Ren Shii.  Her character is very well developed and she alot of humor and sadness to her character.  Daryl Hannah is extremely humorous and has one of the coolest scenes in the film and is the most stylish character. Her character will have a bigger part in Volume 2, however.  Vivica A. Fox is good as Vernita Green and her one scene in this film is awesome and funny.  We get a good feel of Vernita, but she gets killed off way to quickly.  David Carradine is good as Bill, we never see his face but we get a perfect sense of how sadistic he is from hearing him.  Michael Madsen's character only says one sentence but he seems to play the nice villain. His character will definately have more screen time in volume 2.  Julie Dreyfuss was amazing as O-Ren Shii's translator.  She is extremely funny and adds so much to this film.  Sonny Chiba is good as the swordsmaker.  Lastly, Chiaka Kuriyama is funny as the sadistic and young Go Go Yaburi.  She is pretty sick and vicious.<br/><br/>The film does end perfectly and it has a suprising twist that will make you wonder how this is going to affect volume 2 of Kill Bill.  It is definately the perfect twist for this nearly perfect film."
"TheAntiHeist","10","0","1","13 October 2003"," Best movie of 2003
","Finally, Tarantino has proved to me that it is worth it still to see movies in theaters.<br/><br/>After seeing much of the garbage released this year, I started to wonder why I am even wasting time shelling out the 8 dollars it costs to see a movie in the theater.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything, but if you have not seen this movie and consider yourself even a bit of a Tarantino fan, you should go see it. You will not be disappointed."

"Shabadoo-2","10","0","1","14 October 2003"," A Film for Martial Arts Fans
","None of the reviews I read mention that the film opens with the old Shaw Brothers logo, and that is the key to what this movie is all about. It's a tribute/update of the great martial arts movies like ""36th Chamber of Shaolin"" and ""Street Fighter."" The stars of both of those films feature prominently in ""Kill Bill"" as gangster general Johnny Mo and swordmaker Hattori Hanzo, respectively.<br/><br/>Those who grew up on Saturday afternoon martial arts movies should appreciate not just the appearance of these two stars but also the ways in which Tarantino has learned what made those classics great. He films fight scenes so that we can see all the action, as opposed to the close-ups and quick cuts we get from Hollywood action films. Watching the fights is satisfying, not frustrating.<br/><br/>There's not much of a plot, and that may be another cue from classic martial arts movies. Not that it matters--this movie is a series of vignettes tied together by one event: The murder of former (?) assassin Black Mamba (aka The Bride) by her former colleagues of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAs).<br/><br/>Uma Thurman does a surprisingly convincing job as the unbeatable fighter, as do all her opponents. The stunts are handled excellently and there weren't too many shots where it was easy to tell that it wasn't Uma.<br/><br/>Sonny Chiba is excellent in the film's mellow interlude as he creates the ultimate weapon for Black Mamba to exact her revenge. And while I would have liked to have seen a lot more of Liu Chia Hui, the few minutes of him fighting Uma were worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Those who were not raised on Shaw Brothers and samurai films will either love this movie (for the sylized violence) or hate this movie (for the stylized violence). I loved it and can't wait for volume 2."

"ilovedolby","10","0","1","13 October 2003"," Overall, `Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is an excellent film as Tarantino proves once again that his talent is unbeaten in this brand of cinema. ****
","Quentin Tarantino returns his talents to theaters with the much anticipated `Kill Bill: Vol. 1.' In a `Charlie's Angels' meets `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' way, Tarantino has crafted a film with excessive violence and gore. Yet, the film is a marvel for its homage to samurai movies, as well as the commonly referred to 'spaghetti westerns,' westerns made in Italy such as `The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.' However, don't expect the entire movie in this showing-it actually runs over three hours and Tarantino cut the film in half. `Kill Bill: Vol. 2' opens in February. `Kill Bill' tells the story of Black Mamba (Uma Thurman), who's referred to as 'the bride,' a member of a band of international assassins whose boss, Bill, and team turn on her. On her wedding day, and being pregnant with her boss's child, she is brutally attacked and shot in the head. Luckily, she manages to survive and wakes up after being in a coma for four years. With the memories of the assault, she manages to escape the hospital seek out her killers. The first of them is Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox), who would appear to be a happy homemaker if it weren't for her deadly intentions. After Black Mamba takes care of Copperhead, she still has unfinished business with three other assassins of Bill's-the only other one we see her take on is Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu). She has to go after the assassins Budd (Michael Madsen), the California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), and Bill (David Carradine). But we'll see those in volume two. Whether you're a fan of Tarantino's style or not, one can't deny his talent. His direction is astonishing, as well as his screenplay. The violence level that he incorporates isn't for the faint of heart. However, it's far more humorous than revolting. Its intention is to be satirical to violence in society and to ultimately pay homage to samurai films that inspired it. After all, don't most films that try to pay tribute to their inspirers by exaggerating the original intention? This is Tarantino's style-he wants us to be shaken and disgusted by the violence. He wants us to the leave the theater feeling tired and affected by it all.<br/><br/>Among other creative aspects, there is an anime sequence that shows the history of Cottonmouth. Assassins murdered her parents as she watched it all happen. It's the primary reason she becomes such a bloodthirsty person in her adulthood. You can expect witty dialogue that made `Pulp Fiction' so famous. This film's isn't as ongoing as `Pulp Fiction's,' however, this is only volume one, and Black Mamba hasn't gotten to her conspirator Bill, yet. Undoubtedly, she'll have some choice words for him. Also, consider the fact there's really only one story here. `Pulp Fiction' had several stories intertwining that required a great deal of dialogue to make the connections.<br/><br/>Other creative aspects of note that are smaller in scope, but equally important to the greatness of the film are the general format of the film, and the music. The film plays out like that of book. Tarantino splits the film into chapters as it focuses on character and plot development. The music fits the film like a glove. In traditional Tarantino style, he uses a great deal of 70s music that reflects the film's western and samurai impact, with a strong dose of disco which gives the film a hip feel.<br/><br/>Overall, `Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is an excellent film as Tarantino proves once again that his talent is unbeaten in this brand of cinema. ****"

"EagletHarbin","10","0","1","13 October 2003"," A perfect 10
","Alright, I'll start this review off by saying that I am rather biased on the issue of this film. I'm one of those Tarnentino-followers that you hear so much about, that would follow him to the grave as long as it meant they could see another one of his films. The difference for me, of course, is that I've (gasp) never seen a Tarnetino film. Yes, I know, this is terrible, and it will be remedied soon. However, Kill Bill Vol. 1 just made me know WHY I am a Tarnetino fan.<br/><br/>The second reason I am biased is because I read the script before seeing the film, a couple weeks before, in fact. Why does this make me biased? Because I can view the film as the whole that I wish it was, rather than the half of a film that it turned out to be. Okay, let's get down to the nitty-gritty, and hopefully I'll explain a little bit more of that in the review.<br/><br/>THE ACTING:<br/><br/>I've not much to say about the acting in this film. It was perfect for what it was supposed to be, it was perfect with what I was expecting from the script. There were some awesome moments, Uma's first line in the film still haunts me to this day, because of the way it was written, yes, but also because of her delivery. I have no complaints with the acting in Kill Bill, so it deserves a 10.<br/><br/>ACTING SCORE: 10/10<br/><br/>THE WRITING:<br/><br/>I love Writer/Directors. I hate it when a bad director takes a good script and makes a bad film out of it. I hate it when good directors mid-understand a script, and make a bad film out of it. Neither of those can happen when you've got a writer/director. Tarentino knew what he wanted to write, and he wrote it. Perfectly. The brilliance of the script is not understood, I don't believe, until you've seen Vol. 2 (I love the script version of Vol. 2 a bit better than Vol. 1), but once you see it, the amazingness of Vol. 1 is shown. Yes, it is a revenge film, but it is THE revenge film of all time. Every line, every scene, is perfect.<br/><br/>WRITING SCORE: 10/10<br/><br/>THE DIRECTING:<br/><br/>And this is where the film truly shines. Every shot is amazing, every shot is what it should be, every shot delivers exactly the right sensation to the viewer. Okay, I had some different shots in mind from when I read the script, but it's okay, because what Tarentino has delivered is better than what I could have come up with. Everyone imagining going into the film industry must see the chapter entitled 'The House of Blue Leaves,' simply for the four amazing styles in which the fights are shot.<br/><br/>DIRECTING SCORE: 10/10<br/><br/>OVERALL:<br/><br/>I admitted at the beginning that I was biased for this film before I saw it, but I don't think that that means I think a crappy film is a good film. Any film that puts this much effort into being good deserves to be seen, and this film not only tries to be good, it accomplishes that goal stunningly.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with this film is not a problem with the director, actors, or anyone...but MIRIMAX. I have a problem with cutting the film in half. Yes, it is a four hour movie, and yes, people don't like four hour movies. I don't know what the solution was, but I hate that they had to cut the film in half.<br/><br/>Just know that you will not be disappointed when Vol. 2 rolls around. It is better than Vol. 1 through and through.<br/><br/>So, should you see Kill Bill Vol. 1? I would say 'yes' for sure, but I do want to say: there is a LOT of violence in the film. Not as much as I was lead to believe was in it from the script, but still a TON. Some of it is unrealistic (and meant to be so), but there is a lot that was so realistic that the more squeamish among you may want to skip this. The rest of you: yes, go see the film.<br/><br/>OVERALL SCORE: 10/10"

This is the best martial arts film I have ever seen although I must admit I have limited experience with the genre. Everything about Kill Bill is unbelievable. The powerful soundtrack by the RZA that completely fits and compliments each scene. It's perfect and I think I'm going to have to get it. The masterful performance by Uma Thurman, I think an Oscar is not out of the question here. Daryl Hannah surprised me with her acting because acting is not a skill that she is known for. Vivica A. Fox on the other hand, was the same person that she has played in every movie and I was glad that she died early. Lucy Liu was also good although I don't think she is a particularly good actress. Sonny Chiba turns in a great guest appearance and Chiaki Kuriyama....wow. I think that this girl should get her own movie. Evil schoolgirls are not something you see every day. It came as no surprise to me that she also starred in Battle Royale. Although I have not seen Battle Royale yet,(can we get a US DVD release please!!!) I know of it's reputation. This film pays the proper respect to the Kung Fu movies of the seventies down to the vintage opening of the film. Vol. 1 is divided into five chapters and chapter three is the only one I had a problem with as it is entirely in anime and I despise anime. It was well done, I just don't like anime. Michael Madsen's character Budd is not really in Vol. 1 at all and the same with Daryl Hannah's character. We'll have to wait to see them in Vol. 2. The violence that everybody is going on and on about is not as bad as I thought. I thought that some of the blood gushing was actually a little cartoonish but this is how films were done in Hong Kong and so Tarantino is remaining faithful to that. The showdown with O-Ren Ishi's henchmen was shot in black and white I think because if it were in glorious blood soaked color it might have A. turned fragile American audiences off and/or B. gotten Kill Bill stamped with an NC-17 rating. Bottom Line: This movie kicks so much ass and I think it beats the Matrix at it's own game. Go see the best movie of 2003. You won't be able to wait for Vol. 2. I sure as hell can't!"
"rcavellero","10","0","1","12 October 2003"," THE WAIT BEGINS...
","I just returned from a screening of Kill Bill vol.1 and I must say that I was completely impressed and pleasently suprised.  Quentin Tarantino has revived the entire action genre.  Although there wasn't anything completely new in this film, it managaed to do everything in a new and creative way. However, I must say that to most it will seem completely original and it is. But people just won't get the many homages and sincere throwbacks to the grindhouse and splatter classics of the 70's. Pretty much the best decade of film. The suprisingly talented Uma Thurman(gattaca) gives a heartfelt and kick ass performance as Tarantino's title charachter bleep!( that's what happens everytime they speak her name.) You see four yrs. before the film starts her own assasination squad turned on her and she was brutally beaten with her husband and unborn child and murdered on her wedding day. Or so they thought. She wakes up out of a coma after four years and the revenge begins to gush. And does it gush since this by far the bloodiest R rated film in probably forever. But it's done in a respectable, cartoon like manner. So that it doesn't come off offensively but more light hearted. Now I definatly don't wanna soften this movie down. Cause it is indeed an extremely graphic genre picture. But it also has extremely sentimental and passionate performances from it's cast, powered with great dialogue and a brisk and bloody revenge tale.  Go see Kill Bill right now! The wait is on the cliffhanger at the end of this one rivals any other cliffhanger ever created. The wait is on!"

","Let's face it... Quentin Tarantino is a guy that you either love or hate. If you love him, this movie is going to blow your mind.  Be prepared for a mindblowing experience at the theater.  Tarantino defies the norm by not being Tarantino-esque.  He removes the catchy language presented in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.  He is a bona fide action director with Kill Bill.  The special effects are nothing short of amazing.  Uma Thurman delivers a heartless performance not seen on screen since Clint Eastwood in Dirty Harry.  This is certainly a revenge movie full of humor and in-jokes. Much like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back was for Kevin Smith fans, Tarantino delivers a movie packaged for fans of his universe.  Many in-jokes and catch phrases are included.  Tell your friends to see this movie.  If you're not a Tarantino fan, all I can say is that this movie is one thousand times better than the Matrix sequels ever will be.  Volume Two can't come soon enough.<br/><br/> 8/8 (My scale only goes to 8.  No movie can be a perfect 10.)"

","Throughout this long, relentless contest of wills with his audience, Quentin still displays flashes of skill.<br/><br/>But it feels like he's been out of the game so long he isn't even going to try to compete with the edgy movies of the last few years, and retreats headlong into the 70s ethos he knows so well instead.<br/><br/>As a Hong-Kong splatter flick, it's too long and emotional, with a few good scenes stranded in otherwise lackluster writing and directorial choices, coming up well short of the genre's best.  As a witty Tarantino neo-noir, it's *too* gory to be chilling or effective, too straightforward to be really clever or engaging, too monotonous to impress an audience with Matrixes and Ring-quests fresh in their minds.<br/><br/>Simply put, 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' (and even 'Jackie Brown') *resembled* classic noirish gangster movies, but were actually *much better* than the source movies that inspired them.<br/><br/>Sadly, Quentin may now be far gone enough to want to pay such loving tribute to the 70sploitation era that he will completely hide his talent to create a *true* b-movie, one that hits every note so (im)perfectly it's just as forgettable, meaningless, and poorly assembled, as the movies to which he's paying homage.<br/><br/>I'll reserve final judgment until Vol. 2 comes out, but until then, I'd only recommend this one to indiscriminate fans of action movies and bad, really bad, 70s fare."

"WriterDave","8","0","1","13 October 2003"," Kill Miramax--A Movie Like This Would be Best Served Whole
","Here's my major problem with QT's long awaited ""Kill Bill.""  While the film is always interesting from a movie buff's perspective (a QT film always is even when you end up hating it in the end), it doesn't get really interesting until the last thirty minutes (which are wildly entertaining) when Uma (stunningly beautiful and vicious as the revenge fueled blood lusting Black Mamba/The Bride) and the action move to Tokyo.  So in my mind, even if all of Volume II (to be released in February of 2004) is as entertaining as the last thirty minutes of Volume I, why in the world didn't the hire an intelligent editor who could've easily chopped out some drawn out exposition (does a B-level revenge fantasy really need an hour and twenty minutes of exposition?) and delivered us an all out go-for-broke extravaganza of over-the-top violence and action in one two and a half to three hour volume?  The only answer I can come up with is that Miramax is greedy and QT is full of himself.  He thinks every cool idea (and he has some really cool ones here from the retro opening credits to the battle to the death in a Japanese garden snow-globe at the end) that pops in his head needs to be filmed, and every spec of film he captures needs to be in the movie.<br/><br/>All these things aside, ""Kill Bill"" is pretty fun if you like gruesome cartoonish violence, a simple plot line (revenge is a dish best served cold), compelling visuals (I didn't care for the anime sequence, but found my jaw drop at the stunningly beautiful cinematography and set design in the Tokyo sequences), non-linear story-telling, and an ultra hip soundtrack. This really just is a fetish film for fans of kung-fu flicks, death wish fantasies, and spaghetti westerns, and there ain't nothing wrong with that as long as you realize that's what this is.  The casual movie-goer will probably be dumbfounded, as the film is virtually void of the trademark QT dialogue which is what I think made the over-rated ""Pulp Fiction"" so oddly endearing to mainstream audiences.  I ultimately plan to see Volume II when it comes out, because I finally would like to see Uma Thurman Kill Bill. Until then, our bloodlust will have to be satisfied by this mixed-bag of cinematic tricks."

","Ohhh Quentin's a genius he made a 4 hour 75 million dollar grindhouse movie, that had to be cut into two films to preserve his vision....<br/><br/>NO! what he made is his most stylish film to date with the weakest dialouge I have ever heard him write. This script is such absolute crap its hard to believe they say those lines with straight faces. But NO! you scream it's an homage to 70's Shaw brothers films. He could have written it so much better. Have you seen the Baby cart movies?(lone wolf and cub)The dialouge in these huge Samurai gore fests is far superior to What Quentin tried to do with this. KILL BILL comes off a little confused to me. Is it an Homage? is it a spoof? does it take it self seriously? It's all of the above. I usually rate a movie by the emotions it gets out of me. Did I smile, did I laugh, did I say Wow, Did I cry, The only time I said anything to myself in KILL BILL was ""wow look at all that blood-spraying"" blood-spraying I might add that had to be in be in black and white so the MPAA wouldnt slap an NC-17 on the film. Clips from this fight scene are in color in the trailers weren't they or am I just crazy. Don't get me wrong I'm a huge fan of Quentins work and I enjoyed this film (kinda) But Sooo many people are calling it genius and his best film to date. All of these people should dust off their copies of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Both of these films are beautifully crafted and wonderfully written. This one is not."

","I've seen Kill Bill twice so far and there's no doubt that we are in front of the best film of the year and one of the most exciting piece of cinema to come in a long time.<br/><br/>Just as it happened with Pulp Fiction, the movie will go down on history and it's destined to become a cult classic in a blink of an eye.<br/><br/>Being said that, that it is a cult film, it will no doubt polarize audiences in a very violent way, just as it happened with such bold works of art as Magnolia, Dancer In The Dark or even Pulp Fiction. Art should be subversive. Kill Bill is.<br/><br/>What's the most amazing thing about Kill Bill? To me, it is Tarantino's extraordinary ability to ""steal"" from every possible genre and make them his very own.<br/><br/>Let's face it, this could be material for a B movie or worst, but through Tarantino's vision, Robert Richardson's masterful cinematography, the sharp dialogue, Uma's one of a kind performance and the epic soundtrack that makes you feel like you're watching a Sergio Leone / Ennio Morricone film on acid, Kill Bill feels like the most original, extravagant and hyper cool movie we always wanted to see.<br/><br/>Kill Bill it's already there, in my top ten list of all time, along with Rosemary's Baby, The Godfather, Dancer In The Dark, Pulp Fiction, Vertigo, and all the movies that, for being such strong works of art, you either love them or hate them, but you can not be gray about it. And Tarantino is not mediocre."
"afterglo","Null","0","1","14 October 2003"," I just loved Kill Bill, Vol. 1!!!
","Many people will consider this Quentin Tarantino's best film yet. Others will hate it. It certainly has more style and focus than any of his previous efforts, which were frequently burdened with subplots. Well, no subplots here. The plot couldn't be simpler. Uma Thurman as ""the bride,"" is the subject of an execution-style massacre carried out by her former associates in an elite assassination team, which is headed by the mysterious and faceless (at least in this first installment) ""Bill."" Unfortunately for them, she survives in a coma from which she awakes after four years, to discover that not only is her groom dead, but so is the baby she was carrying at the time of her wedding. The rest of the movie is simply her revenge as she knocks off the team one-by-one. If you have heard that the movie is violent, it is. However, the violence is extremely cartoonish and stylized. For example, when she lops off someone's head, arm, or leg, blood spurts out as if from a shower head. While the blood is stylized, the fight scenes are very good. In fact, Uma Thurman, an actress with a very uneven career, who never ever gave us much hint of exceptional talent, pretty much carries this entire movie on her back. Not only is she on-screen acting about 95% of the time, but she engages in several extended and strenuous sword- and knife-fighting scenes, many of which she obviously had to do without benefit of a stunt double. She's an absolute revelation here and if her career was a bit on hold the last few years, you can bet it's back on track with this flick! It's not just her fighting, either. It's her acting. She shows in this movie that she can deliver a line as well as any actress around. There are several classic scenes in this movie, but one of the least violent ones has her delivering some of the best lines. This is where she goes to Okinawa and drops in on the sushi shop of a man who also happens to be a master samurai swordsmith, played delightfully (and with incredible comic timing and charm) by Sonny Chiba, a Japanese martial arts actor with almost no presence in Hollywood cinema. Which raises the question of how he got the name ""Sonny."" Anyway, there's a moment when he's still acting the role of the sushi chef and he's engaging in some banter with her, and he asks her why she needs to to find ""Hattori Hanzo"" (him). Her reply is that she needs some ""Japanese steel,"" by which she means a samurai sword. (Digression: the samurai sword is regarded by most of those in the know as the deadliest and finest sword ever made. It is unique in terms of being both thick-and thus heavy enough to deliver forceful blows-and yet almost razor sharp. Made of very high-grade steel, they are very difficult to break. At the same time, a good samurai sword is also a work of art. Each one (of the fine ones), with its grip and scabbard, is made by hand and decorated uniquely. It's ironic that one of the most efficient hand-to-hand combat instruments ever made can also be one of the most beautiful objects of art in the world. This movie, despite its rampant references to other movies and to pop culture of the past, is more than anything else a celebration of the samurai sword and bushido, the code of the samurai. The last major action scene of the movie is the swordfight between Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu. Liu has become (probably to her chagrin) a character actress who normally plays either bad girls or evil women. In this case, she's an evil woman, and she plays the role to the hilt. She also puts up a hell of a fight in the final scene, but of course, there would be no Vol. 2 if she prevailed, so I hope I didn't spoil the movie for you. (Postscript: The usual humorless suspects think there's too much violence in this movie. To some extent, Tarantino has fanned the flames by saying (I paraphrase, but pretty accurately) ""I want thirteen year old girls to see it. I think they'll find it empowering."" This has appalled some social critics. Well, first of all Mr. Tarantino is not the most serious dude on the planet. Secondly, with its ""R"" rating (which should arguably be ""NC-17""), a thirteen year old shouldn't be able to see it anyway. Tarantino really knows how to stir up publicity, and I'm fairly sure that's the true intent of his comment. The violence in this movie is caroonish and stylized and totally unrealistic except to the most naive and hypersensitive of people. Even so, I don't think there's as much harm in seeing Uma Thurman extract well-deserved justice at the point of a sword as there is in the brain-dead plot and action of the Charlie's Angels franchise. Uma looks like what the Angels merely play at: a woman so good at what she does that she can't be ignored. My daughter is a young woman, and I think she'll learn more about life from Kill Bill than Charlie's Angels. Some critics have said that this movie is much more violent than any of Tarantino's previous movies, and on one level that's true. However, the violence in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were much more realistic than the violence in Kill Bill. These hypersensitive critics need to get a life.)"
"Sfpsycho415","8","0","1","13 October 2003"," Best Movie So Far This Year!----8/10
","A refreshing and very original movie is what we always expect from Quentin Tarantino and that is just what he delivered. This year was full of generic action movies and sorry sequels. Maybe that fact made Kill Bill seem better. Either way, this movie kicks ass. Tarantino mixes his love of Japanese and Chinese action movies, spaghetti westerns, and even a little anime to craft his own action masterpiece. Uma Thurman is outstanding and the rest of cast is great especially Sonny Chiba. The action sequences are just as good if not better than those from The Matrix, and done without the help of loads of computer effects. Some say the film may have been better if it wasn't split in two, but the cliff-hanger ending was done excellently and makes you mark your calender for the second half. This movie is sure to be an instant classic and a great new addition into Tarantino's wild and crazy family. 8/10"

As with other ""contemporary"" films the dialogs suck (and I am not talking about the Japanese which seem to work better) but is not the dialogs what will get you going but, the mix of action, gory humor, and visual candy (I loved the anime part).

In terms of style, character and story this movie develops like a traditional anime movie; there is an abuse of culture though, as everything in this movie seemed exagerate.

","""Kill Bill"" is an awesome movie! It starts out with an action scene and does not let up.  The film is sort of gory, but that is typical Tarantino.  The fight scenes (especially the martial arts ones) were captivating.  It did not feel like you were in the theater for almost 2 hours.  My vote is a 9 (out of 10) because even though I know there is a Volume 2 due out next year, the ending was still too abrupt. I also always love the soundtracks to Mr. Tarantino's movies."
"LithKnight","8","0","1","13 October 2003"," Ok, so some people will not appreciate it...
","It is clear that this movie was not designed by committee to appeal to everyone and their little old auntie. I think most fans of QT will like this movie to. <br/><br/><spoilers ahead ... you have been warned ><br/><br/>Plenty of people have explained what is good about this film. There is no need for me to repeat it. Instead, I would like to respond to some of the negative reviewers who appear to have missed some major points or simply went to the wrong movie (for them). <br/><br/>For those who do not understand the use of animation in the middle of the film...  The young girl of eleven kills the man who murdered her family. To do so she preys upon his pedophile nature to get close to him and kill him. How could this important back-story have been filmed any other way? With a real 11 year old girl? No thank you. The use of animation allows QT to examine this subplot without flinching. I thought it was very effective and the animation was very well done. The animation also served to highlight how those scenes might be perceived by a child... Surreal.<br/><br/>
As for QT just cashing in, I would say the opposite is true. This film shows such loving craftsmanship in every second on the screen that even if I hated the film I would feel like it wasn't due to a lack of QT trying. Every detail, every scene, every musical note seems hand selected for effect.<br/><br/>
The bleeping of the character's name makes poetic sense. She is nobody. She is vengeance. She is the weapon as well as the wielder. Her individual name will not be hers again until she has done what she must do, or perhaps it never will be. Bleeping her name highlights this fact better than simply not saying her name. It is done to make a point. (she who must not be named?)<br/><br/>We are not necessarily supposed to be sympathetic with the bride. She was, after all, a hired killer herself. Instead, we are supposed feel sympathy for what she represents. Or perhaps we are to fear what she has become. Perhaps a little of both. <br/><br/>For people complaining about the lack ""reality"" (yakuza using swords, etc.) I really think they went to the wrong movie. This movie is a visual portrayal of the fury of pure vengeance manifest as the human we know only as ""the bride"". In kabuki the bride would probably have been wearing a demon mask! It is not supposed to be realistic in the physical plane at all. It is realistic on an emotional / metaphysical level. It is not about the physical appearances, it is about the feelings and the motivation. (besides, do we really need ANOTHER gun shoot-em-up movie?) <br/><br/>I will agree with the detractors on one point. This film does not have the punchy dialog and snappy pacing of Pulp Fiction. I was slightly disapointed in that area. However, this might not have been a mistake, but rather by choice. The bride is alone. She does not have confidants or friends. Even the sword maker (sonny Chiba!) who helps her has very little to say to her. Having been ""killed"" and reborn as a demon of vengeance she is now apart from the world. Perhaps the lack of dialog was intended to add to that feeling.<br/><br/>Lastly, to those who are preoccupied with the notion that there was too much blood.... What did you expect a sword fight to produce? Puppies? When people fight to the death with swords I think the ONE thing you can be sure of is that there will be blood and gore. Modern movies and television skirt this issue and perhaps have tainted people's expectations."

The surealistic passes are a nice touch, spelling the need to think beyond the surface--If you so incline to go there.  I personally think the plot would have been tighter if Bill remained faceless, as the protagonist was nameless.  And, I would have liked a little more of the sword maker's story. Notwithstanding, I would recommend it to those who think like I do, who seek sub-cultural archetypal parallels. For me, this is a picture of those giants of hell, who seek to transcend thier just deserts through child birth and family, or through rising to the pinpoint of power.  They find the mysterious hand of justice will recycle the worst of them only to maintain the rest in a rising line of cruelty."

","Seriously, I love this movie.  Out of Tarentino's other films, I've only seen Pulp Fiction, so I wouldn't go so far as to call myself one of his fans, but this movie looked interesting.  I walked out of the film loving it.  This movie has everything that I wanted and more.  Homages to kung fu movies, anime, a rocking soundtrack...and action beyond belief!  I walked out truly loving it!<br/><br/>You can all read about the story in other posts, but I think that it was really well done and I had no problems with it.  I thought the actors worked wonderfully in it, I thought that it was stylistically and aesthetically beautiful, and I really had a good time in this flim.  Some parts can be pretty brutal, but some are just so over the top that you can't help but laugh at them.  The Origin of O-Ren Ishii was sadistic and brutal, but done so wonderfully in the style that Tarentino chose that it couldn't help but be emotional.<br/><br/>Reading over some of these other comments, I notice that the movie is pretty hit and miss with most people.  Everyone seems disappointed for some reason, and I just wonder why?  So, the story is more linear and less complicated than his other flicks...who cares?  Not every movie needs to jump around in time and tell a horribly complicated story.  Adding elements from Pulp Fiction and other films into this would have made it less enjoyable, I believe.

","I thoroughly enjoyed ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" for what it is and plan to see it again before it leaves my local theatre, and I'm looking forward to `Vol. 2.' It's a shallow movie with nothing underneath the surface, but the surface is so lovingly made--I just ate it up. It was a fun ride. A good ole fashion revenge flick. Uma Thurman going out to get everybody, and she gets 'em good. And that's it.<br/><br/>Criticizing the movie according a to more complex criteria than that seems foolish.<br/><br/>Which seems to be the case for most of the negative criticisms I've read about the movie. James Berardinelli's review of the movie, for instance, is a perfect illustration of a movie critic taking himself, as a movie critic, too seriously, and the movie, as a `film,' much too seriously--and judging the movie all wrong. (http://movie-reviews.colossus.net/master.html)<br/><br/>For example, the protagonist in a revenge flick is defined more by their ability to kick *ss than their ability to carry on witty conversation. As entertaining as it might be to listen to two gangsters discuss the deeper meaning of a foot massage, that kind of extended dialogue would most likely slow down the kinetic energy of the all cool kung-fu that's going on in `Kill Bill.'<br/><br/>So the movie doesn't have a lot of memorable dialogue. So what? `Kill Bill' isn't `Pulp Fiction,' nor do I think it is meant to be. It is a wonderfully crafted kung-fu, Samurai, kill-em-all and kill-em-good, revenge flick.<br/><br/>When I hear criticisms like `it was too bloody and too violent,' it reminds of something I inadvertently heard Kathy-Lee Gifford say about `Pulp Fiction' one day while I was flicking as fast as I could through the channels: `Did it really need to be so violent?'<br/><br/>That's like asking, `Does a musical really need to have so much singing?' Yeah, it does. It's called `The Sound of MUSIC.' What did you expect?<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino's latest movie is called `KILL Bill.' Kinda tells you what you're in for, don't you think?<br/><br/>If you don't like gory and violent revenge flicks, you won't like the movie. That's it. Don't go. But for what it is, it is extremely well made, stunning and amazing at times, and--I hate this phrase--but a pure cinematic delight. It's like Homer Simpson discovering triple-chocolate ice cream. Kung-fu revenge flicks don't get any better than this."
"waltergl","Null","0","1","13 October 2003"," Tarantino matches Leone
","Well, he's halfway there, anyway. Only the release of Volume 2 will show whether-what am I talking about, of course Volume 2 will be amazing. Anybody who doesn't think so should have their head examined. <br/><br/>Kill Bill is quite simply the greatest action movie of this or maybe any other generation. It elevates trash to art, and then elevates art to trash, turning over everything we thought we knew about film, action, kung fu, exploitation, and Quentin Tarantino. Actually, it confirms what we already knew about Quentin Tarantino, but who would have thought that such a movie was possible?<br/><br/>For the one person who doesn't already know the story, Bill and his cronies take out Uma Thurman's wedding party, she survives, and she's out for revenge. But really, that's besides the point. Revenge is the vehicle for Tarantino to throw more stylistic flourishes and homages on the screen than any other movie since Tarantino's last movie. It may take several years before serious film scholars can finally lock down just how many references occur in this film, although film is so deeply built into Tarantino's subconscious that we may never know how much this movie owes to everything from the Spaghetti Westerns to the films of Sonny Chiba and Bruce Lee.<br/><br/>
The action sequences are the best ever filmed. Period. Never have technical expertise and pure artistry intersected so beautifully as in these sequences. After a summer in which audiences were bombarded to no end with mindless car chases and banal shootouts, Kill Bill offers massive, stunningly choreographed fight sequences that never miss a beat. Tarantino manages to keep the pure exhilaration of his film at fever pitch until the false ending, intended to raise expectations for Volume 2 but succeeding only at reminding me of the epic that could have been. But if half of the greatest action movie ever made isn't enough to get you to slap down seven bucks, then you must really hate movies.<br/><br/>My subject heading was in reference to an article I actually read on this website, in which Tarantino said that he would not be satisfied with his career until he created a scene that matched the raw power of the final showdown in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. I don't know if he quite matched it in Volume 1, although in several moments which I will allow you to find he came awfully close. If he doesn't match it in Volume 2, no scratch that, if he doesn't blow the final scene of The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly out of the water in Volume 2, I may just be disappointed. But Tarantino is not one to disappoint."

","This film is so much fun!  There are so many different, sometimes subtle, sometimes obscure, but always unique places this film brings us.  Just like you heard, this film is an homage to the best revenge themed films ever made.  Outside of the sublime screenplay - just looking at the settings is a trip down memory lane.  <br/><br/>Of course, movie critics never had the patience for Tarantino.  Apparently, the entire country has contracted ADD or something and the idea of a 3 1/2 hour movie is frightening to them.  Well, if you like short movies, I am sure that ""Gigli II"" will be out soon.  <br/><br/>My biggest complaint of this film is directed solely at the soulless minions of evil running the MPAA and Miramax.  WTF?  When can an ""R"" rated movie just be for adults and contain whatever the director wanted?  Why does some censorship squad get final say over someone else's artistic vision?  And why are films that have no sexual content whatsoever being picked apart?  Why? Because some stupid impressionable idiot somewhere might emulate what they see on the screen?  Because some sheriff in Hayseed Alabama might get offended?<br/><br/>The rating system needs to go.  If you like a director, producer, actor or screenplay, go see that movie.  If you get offended, leave.  There are plenty of PG and PG-13 films that completely inappropriate for young children, and some R rated films that children should see - but because some censorship Nazi believes his value system is more important than yours, too bad.  Of course, why would the studios complain?  They can sell the original mangled copy, and then pimp the ""Director's Cut"".  Which is what the theatrical release should have been anyway - that's what you pay the director for."

"bibleboyiam","10","0","1","12 October 2003"," Amazingly Stylish Film
","*****Possible Spoiler, but Probably Not*****<br/><br/>Wow! What a sexy movie! I greatly enjoyed Kill Bill Volume 1 the first night that I saw it, and I enjoyed it even more upon second viewing. Quentin Tarantino has a real knack for making films of amazing precision and jazz, and this one is no exception.<br/><br/>After reading some negative reviews on this film I can feel nothing but disgust for those that insult this movie. I have seen many movies in my day and I can honestly say that this one ranks among the top, possibly the best as far as the style, choreography, and musical score go. DAMN this movie had great music. The scene in Tokyo with Lucy Lui and the Japanese Yakuza was nothing short of amazing. All of O Ren's (Lui's) crew were very hip and sexy, especially Go Go, her top body guard in the school girl uniform. Lucy Lui's character, O Ren, was beautiful and brutal, its just too bad that she died in the film. I'm actually considering renting Charlie's Angels after seeing her performance in this film, and Im not the least bit interested in the Charlie's Angels franchise, but if her performance is anywhere near what it was in Kill Bill, it would be worth watching. The acting was very believable and enjoyable, which brings me to wonder what the critics of it are basing their standards on, apparently they had forgotten to take their Prozac that day. Lastly, the choreography of the fight scenes put The Matrix Reloaded to shame, in other words it was fantastic.<br/><br/>The endless gushing, squirting, and gurgling of blood may offend some viewers (as it was likely one of the bloodiest films of all time), but the gore wasnt to be taken seriously, it was a semi parody of old Kung Fu movies. Other critics were angry over the slow pace of the film, and the fact that it is cut in half. They feel that the producers are trying to rip off the public by making them pay for two tickets to see the whole story. Well, as far as that argument goes, if you want to see a movie that is the length of two typical movies, paying twice only makes sense. Besides who the hell cares that you have to pay an extra $8.50, I would have paid double the price just to see each half. We arent Somalians (most of us anyway), were Americans (the vast majority) and we have disposable income, I dont care who the hell you are, or where the hell you work. So stop bitching like 6 year old girls who didnt get their favorite Barbie doll for Christmas and keep your idiotic opinions inside of your seratonin deficient brains!!! So if you work for 30 cents a month, as so many other U.S. citizens do, then DONT GO SEE PART 2 AND SAVE YOUR ANNUAL SALARY FOR A BIGMACK AND FRIES!!! Its that damn simple. (I feel better now).....Ok, where was I?? O yeah this movie was bloody, but it really had to be in order to be all that it could be.<br/><br/>I could go on all day about how great this film was but I have better things to do. So go see it, love it, when its over drool over what you have just seen, go home, turn on the computer, type imdb.com into your web browser, click Kill Bill Volume 1, vote on it, give it a 10, write a comment about how wonderful it was, then go see it again!!!<br/><br/>10/10"
"doctorcaptain","9","0","1","12 October 2003"," pleasant mush
","I just returned from the movie theatre, having seen by far the most violent film I've ever sat through. As far as sheer gore goes, it was hardcore pornography. Everything was shown, and done with comic book intensity (that is to say, at times unrealistic, over-the-top) one would think killing would become boring and repetitive after a while, but Lord no! Tarantino's Kill Bill oozes with so much style and originality, you will find yourself chuckling at a clever camera angle, the odd and exciting music, or even massive overhauls of entire sequences, done in such completely bizarre and wonderful ways, death becomes everything...something to fear, and at times, something to shamefully look forward to.<br/><br/>I don't want to give anything away as far as the plot goes, but it kind of jumps around the same way his other movies do. Also, the acting is very good and there are some hilarious scenes, especially the dialogue.<br/><br/>
Seriously, if you like action movies, odd movies, martial arts movies, anime, or 70's camp...SEE THIS FILM. It will floor you. It will make you sick. It will excite you, and it will turn your head to mush...but pleasant mush. That's the state I am in right now.<br/><br/>Some people took dates to see it...some people had their elderly parents with them. I cannot believe any of these people enjoyed the movie. But I did. I cannot wait to see part 2."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","0","1","12 October 2003"," Samurai with an Edge
","According to Master Sword-Maker, Hattori Hanzo, in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"":<br/><br/>""Revenge is never a straight line. It's a forest. And like a forest, it's easy to lose your way... to get lost... to forget where you came in.""<br/><br/>This pretty much embodies Director/Writer Quentin Tarantino's whacked, edgy, adrenadalized, and exquisitely crafted ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". It is one of the best movies of the year, and by far the year's Coolest Movie. Like the quote from Hanzo (played by the great action star/ martial artist Sonny Chiba), ""Kill Bill"" is singular in purpose: a vengeance tale with a stylized narrative which includes some awesome use of Anime. Tarantino is in masterful form with his trademark expletive alliterated dialog, and over the top whacked sense of humor. This is genius, given the Bushido virtues of Justice, Courage, Benevolence, Honor, and Loyalty [""Bushido"", Inazo Nitobe]. Sense of Humor is NOT one of the distinguished virtues. Therefore, having one is good for us in Vol. 1. Tarantino did his homework on Bushido (The Way of the Samurai). Inherent in the Samurai culture (and Japanese culture) is the dichotomy between exquisite beauty and extreme dispassionate brutality. Tarantino nails this in Vol. 1. In a movie scene O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) wearing an impeccable white kimono, recites a haiku in the middle of a snow covered garden before a fight to the death with The Bride (Uma Thurman). This is simply mesmerizing.<br/><br/>In Vol. 1, The Bride (amazing Uma Thurman) embarks on her path of vengeance. The joke is that we really don't know her name-- Director's choice. She has one over on Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone movies. The Bride was a member of an elite group of assassins all working for the mysterious Bill (an unseen David Caradine). However, when she decides to leave, her crew (Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, and Vivica A. Fox) put the hit on the pregnant Bride, and her husband at the wedding in an El Paso church. The Bride (Thurman) miraculously survives, and is in a coma for 4 years. Upon awakening from the coma, The Bride, vows to call it ""square"". A critical element in her path of vengeance is finding Hattori Hanzo (Chiba) to make her the classic katana to dispatch those who betrayed her.<br/><br/>Tarantino's ""Bill"" is an homage to classic samurai movies and westerns, and at it's heart is Uma Thurman. Uma Thurman is awesome. Her character is strong, smart, and singular in focus-- the ultimate in single tasking. She also has a wicked wry sense of humor in her delivery. She is so good at masking any of her character's vulnerability; thus, making her empathetic. The scene where she awakes from her coma is both hysterical and chilling. She looks great, and is in great shape. Her fighting scenes are Bushido. She fights with expedience, precision, and dispassion. There is an obscene beauty in dispatching one's opponent with a single strike. It's great to see Sonny Chiba as Hanzo-- the spiritual anchor. Perhaps in Vol. 2 he will display his technical prowess? Lucy Liu as the half breed Japanese O-Ren Ishii, Yakuza Leader, is stunning. Liu delicately balances bi-polar Ishii's beauty and ruthlessness. Liu has a classic scene in which one of her subordinates questions her leadership, because she is an American and... half Chinese. Again, Tarantino did his homework. The fight between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii will be a movie classic, much like Thurman's astonishing battle with Ishii's henchmen. The joke seems to be that The Bride is really learning to use the katana, so she sometimes holds the sword like a baseball bat. However, in battle she uses the more classic form.<br/><br/>Props to Tarantino, Thurman, Liu, Chiba, and Fox on killer movie. This is the year's best. Really. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" is the zenith of pop culture movie-making. Can't wait until Vol. 2 in February."
"brodie_kashmir","10","0","1","12 October 2003"," SLAM BAM THANK YOU MA'AM!!! <<","Where do I begin. The music? The action? The directing? The Acting? The writing? Or just the plain bad-assness of it? I think that I'll go in order.<br/><br/>Tarentino once again proves that part of the story can be told through music, that it's not just there as filler. A handy trait that he taught Robert Rodruguez. Every piece of music that Q.T. uses is not just fill space, it is there to set mood, make it more intense, that sort of thing. And I'll be damned if he didn't pick some great music to go along with his film.<br/><br/>HO-LY SHIT!! That is all I can say about the mind blowing action that was well choreographed, rehearsed, and orchestrated. He takes cinematic martial arts to a whole new level, by kicking it old school in 2003. In a world of CGI's and the Wachowski Bros. (don't get me wrong, I love the Matrx films and am eagerly anticipating the new one), it is inspiring to see a film use wires to make them fly, and training to make them fight. The fight between Black Mamba and The 100 minions was one of the best i have ever seen in my life. The way she moves through them with ease, and the use of the camera is damn good too. Who didn't love the silhuetted portion.<br/><br/>Q.T.'s attention to detail has made him one of the most respectable directors (in my opinion) in film today. My favourite scene is the simple scene ""Wiggle you're big toe."" That sort of intricate scene would be overlooked, and probably not done had it been another director. And to be able to make me, a guy who doesn't enjoy anime at all, get really into the anime sequence, takes some talent.<br/><br/>Everybody turned great performances in this film. I can't wait for Volume 2 to come out so I can see more of Carradine and Madsen, as their characters were underplayed. But Thurman's intensity is only matched by Lucy Liu and (can't remember her name but...) Gogo's ferocity.<br/><br/>Great script. Q.T. took a cliche plot and made it original, adding a twist anywhere it fit. His love for film-making and classic martial arts films really shine here.<br/><br/>Bad-ass movie. I give it 10/10"
"personguyman","10","0","1","12 October 2003"," I saw it three times already....
","*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I put the spoilers heading on the top of this review, just in case there are people who are really hard core about that sort of thing. But, I also must say that it is impossible to really spoil this movie for anyone by telling them plot elements, because you know what's going to ultimately happen by just reading the plot description. Eventually, The Bride is going to Kill Bill and everyone associated with reuning her wedding day. This is not a movie that you watch for the plot, and not a movie that you can enjoy being told about. This is a movie that needs to be watched, it demands it. Roger Ebert described it best when he refered to it as ""story telling without a story"", this is exactly right because we have all seen this story before, hero gets wronged, and wrongs the evil doers. But, because Tarantino is so good at what he does, he uses every element he can to make this the most interesting thing imaginable. I have already heard people complain about the amount of blood in this movie; these people obviously didn't get the point: this is a MOVIE about MOVIES that has NO grounding in reality. It is a throw back to very low budget Kung-Fu films and also to film noir and spagatti westerns. The movie is almost a thesis on the simularities between the genres; by combining the elements together, you get to thinking that there were already many elements there in the first place; in all three genres, somebody has been wronged, usually someone important to them has died or they have had an attempt on their life and they are out for quick justice by killing everyone of them. In fact, many spaggeti westerns took plots from samari movies and vice versa.<br/><br/>Quentin makes it very clear that the audience are his puppets and he is the puppet master controlling every aspect of the film. He of course has always done this to an extent, as in Pulp Fiction in Res Dogs where he jumps the story around simply for effect. He of coursse does that here too; but, in this movie he even goes as far as to bleep The Bride's real name out simply because he doesn't want you to know it yet; and he wants you to know that he doesn't want you to know.<br/><br/>This is a tribute to the asian art of film making; he even goes as far as to make one of the chapters (if you didn't know yet, the movie is divided into chapters, five in this movie, five in the next) an anime sequence. This helps him bring home the idea that this is not an emotionaly serious movie, that the violence is cartoonish and that should be accepted, what better way to do this then to have a cartoon in the middle of the movie? This also helps him tell elements of the story, that if he tried to tell in live action, he would have gotten an NC-17 or X rating as opposed to the R rating he did recieve.<br/><br/>There are slow motion shots in this movie, there are black and white shots in this movie, there's a shadow fight sequence in this movie, and a snow fight sequence. And those are just a hand-full of the elements that he uses. I've seen it three times already and plan on seeing it several more times before it gets out of theaters, this truly is the most entertaining movie to come out in a very long time. A+"

","The reviews for this movie are mixed, as one would assume they would be. Some critics have pointed out that the story is empty, that the characters exist as plot points that help move along the next ferocious, bloody action sequence. On the one hand, they are right; the story takes a back seat to the action and the film is based on a simple theme, revenge. Tarantino has no need to develop characters to deeply but when he does, he does so stylistically and with bravura (witness O-Ren Ishii's anime back story). A common complaint is that this film is not like Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown, or Pulp Fiction and it is clear that Tarantino does not intend it to be like them. On the other hand, this film deftly welds together yakuza crime films, Leone, Kurosawa (see Sanjuro), Scorsese, Peckinpah, Hong Kong crime dramas, kung fu flicks, and samurai honor stories in such a seamless, visually breathtaking pastiche that griping about story and character development seems to me to be roughly akin to having a wonderful fusion meal in a seedy little joint and proceeding to complain about the decor.<br/><br/>As a child of these genres, having seen everything the late 70's and early 80's had in terms of the B movie, I found Tarantino's bricolage to be amazing. For those who grew up on a staple of exploitation films and kung fu, this film is required reading as an attempt to throw it all together and succeed."

","Kill Bill vol. 1 sadly isn't a movie comparable to Quentin Tarantino's masterwork Pulp Fiction.  Where Pulp Fiction polarized audiences who either thought it was great, unlike any movie they had ever experienced, or just too violent, disturbing and not their cup of tea, Kill Bill lowers the bar and expectations of what Q.T. can accomplish in a film. Volume 1 will have fanboys loving it, fundmentalist hating it for the violence, and people like me who just think something is missing. Pulp Fiction was long on great dialogue, memorable characters, and ingenious interlocking stories and fates.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a comic book full of cool looking over the top violence played for laughs, cardboard characters, and an entirely uncompelling story. Despite decent acting and beautiful style and cinematography, Kill Bill's main appeal is its action packed battles, meant to be homage's to crappy Kung Fu flicks, and jokes based on long blood spurts after heads and other body parts are cut off. I like that stuff, but I need a good story too, and Kill Bill Vol. 1 for all the love and skill that was used in making it, just feels empty. Q.T. seems to be taking the pressure off himself by aiming low."

","Kill Bill is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It presents the theme more so in its gory action than in the scant (yet adequate) dialogue. Fight is the art that conveys the emotions of the characters. Tarantino has effectively remade the samurai revenge movie, a true tribute to classic grind house films that we all know and love. In this remake, Tarantino presents a stunning theme which it applicable to everyday life and our world today: revenge begets revenge. This is clear right from the confrontation with Vernita Green and also through the History of O-ren Ishii. Only Tarantino could take such and apropos theme, mix it with the best actors and actresses, and wrap it all up with awesome fight choreography and oftentimes hilarious special effects.

Lucy Liu especially was brilliant. Her character O-Ren Ishi was easily my favorite. Uma Thurman was the perfect for 'the bride' and proved to be as talented as she is beautiful.<br/><br/>Michael Madson's character Budd is very mysterious and am eager to hear more about him in Kill Bill Vol. 2 which comes out February 20th.

I'm sure there is a more technical way of saying that, but anyway, you get the idea.  And the whole opening of the film is great too. So, yeah, I absolutely LOVED this film."

","KILL BILL: VOL. 1 is one of the silliest (and goriest) movie I've ever seen. That being said, the excellent production value and tongue-in-cheek nature make the film highly entertaining.  The whole movie is one long attempt to be cool.  Uma Thurman gives a pretty good performance as the Bride and Vivica A. Fox stands out as a suburban mother who also happens to be a deadly assassin.  Quentin Tarantino reaffirms his status as one of the strangest and most interesting directors now working.  The director of photography, Robert Richardson (who worked on many of Oliver Stone's movies) deserves some special recognition as well."

","If you only see 87 Crazy Japanese people maimed by Uma Thurman this year, watch Kill Bill Vol. 1... and close your eyes for half of it.  This movie starts off very violently, perhaps inappropriately so, but the violence gets less intense as the movie progresses.  Tarantino does a great job of slowly easing you into the outrageously fictitious world of Kill Bill, and had me believing nearly every second of the film.  The cinematography is equally brilliant, and unparalleled in any movie I've seen this year.  The variety of shots, angles, and clever camera work never cease to amaze and amuse.  The film is very stylized, and only for those who enjoy wanton violence, however if you've ever wanted to see Lucy Liu decapitate a Japanese war lord, this movie is definitely for you.  Many people are protesting this film because they think that it is just half a film, and that Kill Bill Volume Two will also short change viewers with an incomplete film.  These fears are totally unfounded, I left the theater as excited as I came in.  I don't want to give any more details away and you've probably already made your decision on whether you will attend this fine piece of cinematic genius.  I would only like to recommend this movie to anyone who can stomach the occasionally intense violence, and wants to be entertained the way all movies ought to entertain."

This movie is an homage to Samurai movies, and as such, it's not so dialogue heavy or witty as you might expect.  The movie is, however, very visually stunning, which is great for Tarantino, because he's stepping out of his box, as if to say ""I'm not going to make the same film over and over"" and it works.

","Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, Jackie Brown...  all these films had great scripts/dialogue.  Tarantino captivated audiences around the world with his writing.  When watching these films you were never bored - you just wanted to know what happens next and what classic quote was going to come out of whose mouth next.  These movies touched parts other movies couldn't reach.<br/><br/>But what about Kill Bill?  It hasn't got a complex plot, in fact the plot is so simple it can be summed up in a single sentence.  Kill Bill doesn't even have much of the classic Tarantino dialogue that we've grown so fond of.<br/><br/>So is this movie any good?  In a word: YES!  In two words: HELL YES!<br/><br/>Tarantino seems to have chucked the rule-book of normal film making out the window and has made this film HIS way - and he makes it work.  Kill Bill is over-the-top, it plays with the audience, it's extreme, it's comical.  But it works... it's Tarantino magic!<br/><br/>The basic plot is made up for by a lot of action and a great cast. And the film still has great quotes - they're not hostile, vulgar or ""in-your-face"" quotes like Pulp Fiction or Jackie Brown, but they're still great lines that sound almost poetic at times.<br/><br/>And how could I forget the soundtrack - the music is fantastic.  Some classic forgotten hits from past decades that are instantly likeable.<br/><br/>It's great to see Tarantino back in action, I can't wait for Kill Bill part 2!"
"dominguezm014","10","0","1","11 October 2003"," Brilliant!
","Quintin Tarintino's ""Kill Bill"" is the gorist yet funniest film anyone could see this year.  It is also the best film of the year so far.  The way he writes the dialogue, the intense and extremely bloody action, and the use of chapters and black and white shots are what made ""Kill Bill"" the best film I have seen all year, exceeding ""The Matrix Reloaded"", ""Seabusicuit"", and ""Finding Nemo.""  Uma Thurman's portrayal of the emotionally and physically scarred ""Bride"" is one of her best performances.  She alone, along with Tarintino's brilliant writing, is number one on why the film literally kicked a**.  Also watching Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu as her first two intended victims are just as great.  The battle of Blue Leaves is an amazing fight sequence that easily impressed me more that most fights in Matrix Re. Trust me, ""Kill Bill"", will easily win you over as obsessive fans."

The Animated sequence with O-Ren was done by Production I.G One of the biggest animÃ© studios in Japan.  They are responsible for such movies/series as Ghost in the Shell, Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade, Evangelion (in combination with Gainax), Blueseed, Fooly Cooly (FLCL) and Love Hina.

"JB_Soler","8","0","1","11 October 2003"," Kill Bill: a ""meta-movie""
","Watching ""Kill Bill vol.1"" last night I couldn't help but paying attention to the many styles, genres, and movies that it refers to and pays tribute to. While I'm not sure yet if it's my favorite Tarantino, I did have a lot of fun watching it. As a movie buff, the constant referencing to other movies and genres just added to the fun, turning it into a ""meta-movie', a movie about movies.<br/><br/>Despite the obvious references to the karate movies of the 1970s, the Takashi Miike and Fukasaku hints, there were a lot of tributes to Sergio Leone and the ""spaghetti westerns"" of the 1970s. At times, even the music reminded me of the iconic compositions that Ennio Morricone made for Leone's films (I was expecting Clint Eastwood to show up with the poncho!).<br/><br/>
Also, I noticed the stylistic similarities of ""Kill Bill"" with ""Natural Born Killers"" (which Tarantino also co-wrote). Like the Oliver Stone film, ""Kill Bill"" uses different film textures, colors (B&W, color), bullets flying in slow motion into people's heads, animated sequences, etc. I couldn't help to be reminded of that movie at times.<br/><br/>
Overall, I think the jury is still out regarding how this movie rates compared to other Tarantino works. I still regard ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" higher in the scale, but ""Kill Bill pt. 1"" was very, very good. Before I saw it, I was way over-hyped by some reviews (particularly the exaggerated review by the guys at the Village Voice, that called it ""the best American movie in the last 30 years""...), so maybe I'm just adjusting my own opinion after so much hype.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was great fun, an incredible exercise in filmmaking and editing, and the type of dialogues that only Tarantino can get away with. It's definitely one of the best times I had at the movies in a long, long time.<br/><br/>9/10"
"gyoza1138","10","0","1","11 October 2003"," By all rights this movie should not rule.
","As I sat in the theatre yesterday seeing KILL BILL Vol. 1 for the second time in the same day, i could only wonder why the heck this movie is so entertaining. The plot devices, visuals, and in some cases dialogue delivery are so cliche` and stolen that they repeatedly inspired an (unvoiced) groan... but there really is little to groan about over this movie. (except groaning in sympathetic pain with the unprecedented level of violence for this type of film.) While it will probably take me years to fully come to grips with everything Tarantino has done in this film, it has become apparent that this film stands out because there has simply never been anything like it. This is tarantino doing fan-service for himself, and for every genre he invokes, he always manages to find something to push it just a little further into the light of cinematic legitimacy. Things that were corny or even absurd in their original context (i.e. kato masks) gain an air of seriousness while at the same time retaining their original novelty... Tarantino not only gives us the things HE loves, but somehow manages to 'explain' these things so we love them too. This movie has unseated Jackie Brown's outstanding dialogue as the finest example of filmmaking, and The Bride doesn't even need to say a word. 10/10"
"endeyequote","10","0","1","11 October 2003"," Don't go see a movie you are not going to understand and then proceed to bash it.
","Let me first say this: this movie was FANTASTIC. Don't let the title i gave my review mislead you. That title is directed at all the people here who have submitted nonsensical reviews.<br/><br/> KILL BILL is, from start to finish, a bloody master piece. Those who didn't like it simply didn't get it.<br/><br/> Tanatino's favorite films are old school Sonny Chiba/Bruce Lee-esque ultra violent movies classics. Anybody who has seen said films will know, as bloody as Kill BIll is, it does not even come close to some of those old classics.<br/><br/> SPOILERS LOOM AHEAD - YE BE WARNED<br/><br/> KILL BILL is a movie that blends together Tarantino's engrossing cinematic style with the favs of old school martial arts flicks with ease and genius. Tarantino was looking for nothing more here than to bring to the big screen for a mass audience in present day the sort of film that inspired him to create films. What can one say about this in a negative fashion in this respect? He has succeeded. The negative reviews prove that. Too much gore? Too much violence? If i had any complaint about this movie it was that it didn't have ENOUGH, and that was only because for the first half of KILL BILL Tarantino was shooting for an R rating. Believe it: if he could have gotten away with as much blood and guts as he wanted there would have been a lot more. Oh and fasten your seat belts kiddies and come to the theatre in a parka because KILL BILL vol. 2 has an NC-117 rating. That means more blood guts and mayhem than probably any Hollywood big budget movie ever.<br/><br/> For those who commented that there was too much blood and guts and nonsensical violence i say this: why do you continue to go to movies that you don't understand? I knew from the moment i saw the first trailer what was going to go down in this movie and i couldn't wait. Those that say its wrong to laugh at such scenes as a woman writhing on the floor with missing limbs, or sex fiends getting eviscerated i say this: sometimes its good to laugh at such things. With such real life horrors going on in the modern day its healthy to sit back and watch and laugh at over the top carnage. We laugh because we know how ridiculous it is and that is what makes it entertaining. And remember this as well: everyone one you saw writhing in pain or covered in blood was either a rapist, pedophile, or murderer. They are getting what they deserve anyway so what do you care? Not ONE innocent bystander was killed in this movie by the hero. Even the young yakuza kid got to get out with his life.<br/><br/> So enough with the simpletons. Let me get on with a legitimate review.<br/><br/>From the very first scene this movie sets the tone for the direction it will follow, and follow along a straight line it does. From the `Presented in Shaw-Scope' intro everyone should know that this is going to be a highly stylized trip down movie memory lane (apparently some didn't but i won't go there again) As i have said, Tarantino has masterfully blended together his pulp-action style with martial arts mayhem. Each scene moves fluidly to the next, one is never left with the feeling that something is missing or out of place. Again he moves in and out of chronological sequence as in Pulp Fiction, but this is one trick he has mastered. All it does is serve to deal the audience the story in a more intriguing way. The cinematography and imagery here is beautiful. Tarantino teams with Robert Richardson (of U-turn and Natural Born killers fame) superbly.  From white picket fence american suburbia, to tilted angel, eye of the victim, trunk shots, to sweeping well placed fights, to a classic Japanese garden climax; one can tell that each scene was given careful consideration to how it looked and it shows. The story doesn't deviate from the traditional vengeance plot that many of the movies that inspired it followed. You know just why The Bride wants her victims dead and you are behind her all the way. Tarantino usefully recaptures the spirit of the warrior code and what it means to them to play the dance of life and death battles. It is their religion, and if that seems silly to you i encourage you to someday see a kitana in action in reality. The amount of damage these blades can deal in a single blow is frightening. Tarantino captures the idea that the perfect blade to the warrior is their ultimate prize and i applaud Tarantino for the scene where The Bride sees the collection of master work kitanas, for you truly get a sense of how beautiful they are to her. Tarantino doesn't let you go for a second through this whole film, and he has you believing every second of it. Those who were made uncomfortable i again assert: you simply just didn't get it and you never will.<br/><br/> The acting in this movie was equally on par with Tarantino's film making. I am not a huge fan of Uma Thurman so i had my doubts, but she has earned a new level of respect from me here. She played the vengeance seeking warrior to a T. I like the choice that Tarantino made here to go with an american blonde woman as the hero. With this subtle choice he came out on his own. Very few of the movies that inspired this had women heroines, and i cannot think of one that had an american. One thing that can be said about Tarantino: the man is certainly not gender biased and not afraid to give the audience a strong woman as the lead rather than a man. This movie probably would not have been as interesting if it was a man. Lucy Liu also gave a perfect performance and portrayed her character in the exact light it needed. Sonny Chiba was a nice reminder of the old days when this sort of movie was in its golden age. Even Karadine, who at this point is only voice acting, was excellent. The one who stole the show though was Chiaki Kuriyama as Go Go Yubari. Very few in american audiences will know her but she is most well known for her excellent performance in Battle Royale, an incredible piece of Japanese cinema. I was excited when i noticed her in the previews because much of the acting in Battle Royale was excellent and it is good to see that at least one of these you Japanese actors/actresses was noticed by Hollywood. Indeed, hers was one of the best performances in Battle Royale and she brings that same intensity to KILL BILL. Her character was truly disturbing, probably more so then all the others in the movie, and she played it in excellent fashion.<br/><br/> As for the music, again i was skeptical. When i heard the RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame was doing the score i wasn't sure what to think, but it proved to be a perfect fit. There was no hip hop style beats here, the RZA truly created music that fit the movie taking obvious inspiration from the musicians that adorn the soundtracks of past Tarantino movies, 70s funk, and the music in the kung fu classics. He blended the styles in a way that was almost hypnotizing. In the end it wasn't surprising considering the Wu-Tang clan is inspired themselves by the same movies that inspired Tarantino.<br/><br/> There are only very mild criticisms for this movie that i and my fellows had, and none of them warrant taking off any points from a ten out of ten. I thought the movie dragged in a few spots, but upon reflection i went in expecting something a little different. One tends to romanticize older movies when one hasn't seen them in a long time and when i look back at Sonny Chiba, Bruce Lee, and Akira Kurosawa classics all i remember is sweeping samurai battles, and brawl after brawl. One forgets that these movies were not all fights. They relied heavily on thick drama in between to tell the stories of warriors, not just show case their battles. So in this respect i was anticipating non stop action from KILL BILL, but i am glad i turned out wrong. Without the drama and characterization this movie would have been the bland blood bath that others seem to think it was. The only other complaint is purely aesthetic in a film making sense. One of the draws of Tarantino is his engrossing dialog. We believe in his characters because of the lewd jokes and the foot message anecdotes. It brings them to our level as we see them concern themselves with every day things. This is lacking just a tad in this movie. Albeit there wasn't much room for it. The movie was crammed to the bursting point with content. Did it make the charac ters feel any less human? No because there was just enough of the Tarantino charm to still feel it. He still manages to add his genius details in characterization. In fact there was one point when i actually turned to my friend and said `Tarantino is a genius.' When the sheriff who came to survey the carnage of the church drove up in big 70s style smoked sunglasses and we then see on his dashboard several more pairs in varying colors, it was a brilliant touch. Here we have a character who is on screen for all of five minutes and yet Tarantino still feels the need to make him his own individual with his own unique personality and quirks. He isn't just a throw away character to serve a purpose in one scene as a transition to the next. He is a real life sheriff to us, a character that had enough personality that Tarantino could make a movie just about him if he wanted to. Its these little things that make Tarantino stand out from the ravenous pack and stand out with style, the style of a 70s 14th street pimp, and that is why we go see him.<br/><br/> 10 out of 10"
"maoche","10","0","1","11 October 2003"," A plethora of things to like, excellent film
","Kill Bill: Volume 1 is the best film of its genre - although it is difficult to try to categorize this movie (like most Tarantino films).<br/><br/>Kill Bill conveys many of the usual Tarantino traits, such as unique and clever style and witty dialogue. Aside from the obvious, the quality of the soundtrack might suprise you. The rapper and hip-hop producer The Rza did an amazing job with the Kill Bill soundtrack. In some scenes The Rza slowly transforms erratic sounds into well orchestrated and rythmic music. At other times he captures the intensity of the situation and gets you amped up for what is about to follow. In a few scenes he completely side-swipes you with a suprisingly out of place tune, given the situation. The music is always in perfect sync with the action. All in all, The Rza did a spectacular job.<br/><br/>As far as the movie goes, it is a highly entertaining action flick. It is clever and fresh, a welcome hour-and-a-half diversion from the Matrix inspired crud that has been hitting the box office in waves lately. It was amazing to see both Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu in a major US production (both of which had great parts). The interaction between The Bride (Uma Thurman) and her enemies, the other assassins especially, was some of the best dialogue in an action film in years (since the first Matrix). The anime scene detailing O-Ren Ichii's past was amazing.<br/><br/>Even my powderpuff loving, gore hating girlfriend enjoyed this movie. 10 out of 10, great movie, it succeeds in everything it set out to do."

The movie was just as ass-kickin as I hoped and expected. The anime was fantastic.<br/><br/>Only two lowlights for me- 1) The two guys from Okinawa going off at each other was a little too much comic relief to fit comfortably with the rest of the film & 2) The fight between Uma and Lucy was a bit anti-climatic (especially when Uma was on the ground, about to ""Die like a Samurai"" .. what happened then?

Yes, the language which is usually a packaged deal, with all of Tarantino's films, is cut down a little, but he makes up for it with stomach-turning violence and non-stop blood all over the place.<br/><br/>As a director, Quentin has become more risky, using more techniques, and camera angles, rather in Pulp or Dogs where most scenes are one shot. As a screenwriter, he has become more mature. Don't expect any gangster chats about Big Kahuna burgers, madonna, and female foot massages, because it's all gone here.<br/><br/>Kill Bill may not be as great as Tarantino's first two films(some violence may seem unrealistic, but that's what makes it so cool), but it still shows that QT is a force to be recond with, and I can't wait for volume two."

The problem with this film is simple: too much blood.  Too much blood spray (and I mean spraying like a hose), too many severed limbs and too many kills.  The film opens with The Bride (Uma Thurman) killing an important character in an intricate knife fight, by the end of that fight that kill really meant something because she worked hard for that kill.  However, the closing scene of the film is centered on an immense and implausible sword fight in which The Bride kills about a hundred goons with swords in just a few seconds more than it would take Rambo to do the same with a machine gun.  When the scene climaxes with The Bride in a sword dual to the death with another important character it's boring; we have been so convinced that she is invincible that when the fight concludes it is no surprise she won the villain's death is not all that impressive. When a character can kill people like she does housework, watching her kill is like watching her do housework.  There were a few other little things that could have been neater, but they're not worth mentioning.  Over all it was all right and I am going to see `Kill Bill Vol. 2' when it comes out. 6/10."

","Kill Bill grabs your attention from the very first scene and never lets it go.  This film's blood and gore content are on a higher level than most other films out recently.  That doesn't stop it from being an awesome movie. Possible Tarantino's best work, I give Kill Bill 10/10."

There was enough blood in this movie to fill a swimming pool, yet presented in such a campy manner that my girl did not vomit.  Great job in the directing by Tarantino, he gave it a great comic book feel without over doing it like The Hulk. Cannot wait until KB2 is out"

","I saw this movie last night, and all I can say is wow.  This is by far the best action movie ever.  The fight scenes were unlike anything I have ever seen in a movie.  Plus when you and in the cool dialogue it makes for one great experience.  Tarantino has taken a lot of flack.  Critics saying he was washed up and a one hit wonder.  This should prove them wrong though.<br/><br/>Tarantino will go down as one of the gretest directors of all time."
"vsemenov","10","0","1","11 October 2003"," Wow This movie Kicks Ass
","I went to watch Kill Bill thinking has Tarantino burnt out yet or not? Well the answer is most definitely not. Every part of this movie reuses something from other movies (mostly martial arts) and yet as a whole manages to feel fresh and original. The plot is there for the same reason it was there in Pulp Fiction - to give Tarantino an excuse to show us how great of a filmmaker he is. The action scenes are amazing, excessively violent and way over the top, just like I love them, the main heroine (Uma Thurman) is gorgeous and generally a pleasure to look at. And the universe of the movie is bitter yet humorous and manages to make sense in its own twisted kind of a way. Anyone who does not object to the words 'Gorgeous Babe' and 'Katana Sword' in the same sentence will absolutely love this. 10/10"

","Theoretically, one could go into this movie knowing jack-all about the ""Grindhouse"" & Shaw films that it's a homage to. But knowing about those movies, makes this one all the more better. I'm a tad of an afficionado on the aforementioned films, so the first 2 hours of ""Kill Bill"" knocked me on my keister!! It was like a movie geek's (blood) wet dream. Hopefully the last 90 or so minutes will do the same in February. As it stands now, it's my second favorite Tarantino film ( right below ""Jackie Brown"" & a smidgen above ""Pulp Fiction"")<br/><br/>My Grade: A"

","I can't imagine having a better or more thrilling experience at the movie theater, except perhaps in February when Volume 2 comes out.  Tarantino proves once again that he is without a doubt one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.  He takes the audience on a trip unlike anything they've ever seen.  I can't remember ever hearing so many verbal responses to a movie. People laughed, people moaned, and people gasped constantly.  One reason for this is that Tarantino goes through so many styles of filmmaking that no one knows what to expect.  His mixture of reality and unreality is unlikely to be topped by anyone unless he does it himself.  The movie constantly and consistently blew me away.  Thanks Quentin."

","This is a funny, intense, and wild movie.  It's pretty much a revenge story loaded with gory cartoon violence, great fun music, and incredible effects. Tarantino is clearly having a lot of fun with making this movie, and he's employed several techniques for the action sequences.  He loves playing with the mood and tells the story in many different ways.  Unfortunately this movie doesn't have an ending, but the plot is pretty predictable so it isn't really that much of a cliffhanger.  Still, it's great fun to watch.  When the DVD comes there will be plenty of fun with slow motion.  If you don't like gory cartoon violence (namely itchy and scratchy/Monty type violence but more brutal and realistic), don't watch this movie.  But if you're a guy, watch it.  It's fun."
"cmukhopa","9","0","1","11 October 2003"," awesome awesome awesome
","This movie is packed to the teeth with awesomeness, what more can I say? Hard-hitting, raw, over-the-top action sequences, stylistic flourishes as only Tarantino can provide, and an orgy of extreme, comical violence, it's a feast.<br/><br/>There were moments during this film when I would spontaneously laugh at the overwhelming coolness of it all. Of course it's an exercise in style, of course it's excessive, that's the point. Tarantino knows he's made a hyper-cool film; it shows on every frame. The arrival of KILL BILL VOL. 1 is a breath of fresh air in mainstream cinema. After a decade of sub-par imitators and annoying tangential side projects by Quentin, his return to the screen is nothing short of a revelation. Finally, the re-arrival of a filmmaker who simply takes so much joy out of making movies. I would put the Coen brothers in that same category as well, so their return to the screen is another dream come true.<br/><br/>Granted, the film has some problems - it drags at times, but only rarely. Otherwise, I'm hard pressed to think of another negative. The cast is solid, especially Uma, who has this incredible, larger-than-life magnetism here. She is manifest badass. She must have gone through hell training for this movie, because I'd really believe she could take on 88 guys at once.<br/><br/>
This movie lives up to the hype and then some. An adoring homage to Asian martial arts, Blaxploitation, Grindhouse gore, and especially the Shaw brothers films, KILL BILL is Quentin Tarantino acknowledging the influences that have informed his work all along, and, with a stroke of a samurai sword, totally surpassing them."

","""Kill Bill"" is not going to entertain everybody. The movie is very violent, and that violence has graphic consequences. Horrible things happen to horrible people throughout.

"sansmerci","10","0","1","11 October 2003"," A slick, stylized, glossy, brilliant and beautiful bloodfest!
","There are those who can look at this movie and see nothing more than a huge, violent blood fest.  While I can see where these people are coming from, the simple fact that they write this off as merely a bloody action film is proof of their total ignorance towards the art of film.  Yes, there is a lot of violence in this film and there is a rather weak plotline.  However, Tarantino does this intentionally because, in making this film, he decided that he was going to devote all of his attention to one aspect of his filmmaking technique:  style.<br/><br/>What people fail to understand is that, artistically, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this if it is done well.  Every aspect of this film uses a style so original that it is destined to change filmmaking for years to come.  From his separation of the film into chapters, to his integration of Japanese style animation, to his easy transition from black and white to color in the big fight sequence, to the breathtakingly beautiful cinematography, the film plays out like nothing that has ever been seen before on the screen.<br/><br/>::WARNING, VERY MINOR SPOILERS STARTING HERE::<br/><br/>The film follows a stream of consciousness narrative rather than a chronological one.  This is a sadly underused device in filmmaking that is strangely much more popular in literature.  The fact that we know after only ten minutes of the film that The Bride will successfully kill O-Ren Ishi is reminiscent of such literary works as Gabriel García Márquez's Chronicle of a Death Foretold or even Thornton Wilder's Our Town.  And strangely, this knowledge doesn't seem to take away the suspense we feel during The Bride's fight with Ishi and her henchmen/women.  This is because of the fact that the desperation of the character's predicament (which somehow is not countered by the character's cocky attitude) is portrayed so well that we feel the desperation ourselves and become worried about the character vicariously, even if The Bride herself doesn't seem as worried as we are.<br/><br/>::SPOILERS STOP HERE::<br/><br/>So why choose to chop the film up and present it in a stream of consciousness format rather than chronologically?  Well, one could simply say that it's all about style, but style needs to have a purpose if you're going to do it right.  The stream of consciousness style forces us into The Bride's mindset so that we can relate to her more.  This becomes a necessity because of the fact that the character is by nature so cold and distant that, no matter how effective Thurman's portrayal of the character may be, the acting alone can't give us the necessary sympathy for the character.<br/><br/>Another claim people have made against this movie is that the brutal violence and the glamorization of it is irresponsible on Tarantino's part. But, as glamorous as the film is in its portrayal of this violence, there is also an element of surrealism in this film, although it's not the surrealism we've come to expect, even in artistic and experimental films.  The surrealism is in the exaggeration of certain aspects of the film, most notably the color scheme.  The beautifully rich color scheme of this film is strikingly artificial to the point of being ridiculous.  The Bride, who is known as the Blonde Killer, rides a yellow motorcycle and dresses in a yellow jumpsuit.  This all seems far too convenient to be real.  And that's the point.  The artificial color scheme gives the film a sort of plastic gloss so that it becomes impossible to take things such as the violence of the movie seriously.<br/><br/>::MINOR SPOILERS RESUME HERE::<br/><br/>There are also several other obvious examples of exaggeration which render the movie unrealistic in the mind of the viewer.  The fact that The Bride survived a bullet to her head somehow, a fact which is the basis of the whole film, is utterly ridiculous.  The fact that The Bride can somehow bring a samurai sword with her onto a commercial airplane and not raise any suspicion is another glaring example of exaggeration.  Because of these exaggerations, the viewer is put into a separate universe with the understanding that none of the events taking place in this film have any bearing on reality whatsoever.<br/><br/>::SPOILERS END HERE::<br/><br/>So, no, Kill Bill is not just another of the mindless, testosterone-driven action films that our culture is constantly bombarded with despite their lack of artistic and intellectual integrity.  The film is a masterpiece of visual style from a director who demonstrates that he knows how to carefully craft a film to best convey a sense and a feeling he wishes to get across to his audience.  And most of all, we have to understand that this is an extremely experimental film in terms of style.  So much so that it will not only shake up the film industry, but will entirely shatter every unwritten rule about the visual and narrative aspects of filmmaking.  It is thanks to this film that we will soon see a sudden and massive influx of directors willing to experiment and stretch the limits of visual style thanks to this monumental achievement, this action packed masterpiece, from Quentin Tarantino."

","Has anyone seen the Japanese version?  I was curious as what the differences might be.  I read the ending cliffhanger was more violent.  My guess is that you get to see the damage the Bride does to Sofie (camera is pulled back to reveal ""Boxing Helena"" type body).  Would be a nice nod to Browning's ""Freaks"".  Of course, hearing about the damage, IMHO, much more effective than seeing it.<br/><br/>Movie was outstanding.  I was hoping it followed more along the lines of ""Pulp Fiction"" as opposed to ""Jackie Brown"", and it did.  Welcome back QT!<br/><br/>If this was addressed in previous post, my apologies.

He use of action and gore in a comedic fashion was outstanding.  He backed up a lot of eye candy was a great plot too.  I can't wait until volume 2 comes out.

"EvilDeadBCfan86","9","0","1","11 October 2003"," The best movie of 2003
","This film is a masterpiece.  You need to go see it!  As you might know, it is broken down in 2 parts; Vol 1 and Vol 2.  If they were combined to just one movie, it would be over 4 hours long.<br/><br/>The choreography in this film is superb, as well as the acting.  Tarantino yet again shows that he isn't afraid to use violence in his films-there is a lot of it in Kill Bill Vol 1.  A lot of the violence in the film is somewhat slapstick in my opinion (ex. when someone gets a limb hacked of, blood literally squirts everywhere...an unrealistic amount of blood).  That, however, is one reason why the film is so special.  Also, the film throws in some comedy.  I was laughing several times during the movie.  The wisecracks and comedy theme isn't found throughout the whole movie however, which is good.  What gets me is the fact that this movie is at times funnier than movies that are actually considered ""comedies.""<br/><br/>All in all, if you are not offended by violence, and if you appreciate great movies you should go see Kill Bill Vol 1."
"pasgris","9","0","1","11 October 2003"," Beautiful
","Beautiful, extremely stylish and hugely funny. I haven't really been a fan of Tarantino (I fell asleep during Pulp Fiction, but rather liked Jackie Brown and I haven't seen Reservoir Dogs) but I have always admired his vision, even though that hasn't touched me, before now that is. Kill Bill may not be a mainstream Hollywood drama/action flick but it is almost perfect as a work of art, as a film. It's hugely enjoyable to see Tarantino play with different parts of pop culture, art, style etc., because Kill Bill: Vol. 1 really works in bringing all those different parts together to a unique and strong experience. This film works.<br/><br/>Wonderfully crafted piece of art, very enjoyable. I wanna see it again."
"Tim-130","5","0","1","11 October 2003"," Moments of flash, with a lot of trash...
","I know the point. I grew up on many of the films he hits upon in the movie. But you know what, he went too far. It's all right to give your nods to the filmmakers you love, but there were just so many, that it's not even his film anymore. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed much of the movie. Great camera work, limited use of wirework, the music was amazing, and it is very stylish. But there is no need for two movies. There is so much that is wrong with the two-movie plan. Without even seeing Vol. 2, I can say that his could have been edited into a very crisp, butt kicking 2-½ hour rock 'em sock 'em powerhouse film.<br/><br/>His non-linear timeline is obviously an attempt to structure Vol. 1 so as to get the huge fight placed at the end. When actually it's the beginning, (after the church massacre). While it is a cinematic treat of excess, it could have been honed down, and given its proper place to hook you in one long flick. See my personal opinion is that something went to QT's head during the making.  Far too many references are going to go right over peoples' (the average moviegoer) heads. There were things I recognized right away, things I knew but couldn't place, and some things that I missed. And I've seen most of the movies he has referenced in articles, the credits, and movie connections listed here at ImdB. All in all I would have to say I was disappointed. I gave it a 5 here for average. There were parts that bored, parts that were very very good, and parts that could have been dropped completely. Like the anime; sorry, it was out of place in the context of what he was doing. I know some will disagree with me on that. But for what he was working with, Revenge/Samurai/Shaw Brothers, anime did not belong there. And considering how well done it was, it was probably a fair size chunk of the budget. If he had done away with that 10 minutes, removed some of the repetitive narrative, trimmed down some of the excess, then combined the 2 films, I think it would have worked, and would have been great. Oh well..."

"Rican Moldes","10","0","1","11 October 2003"," Quentin Tarantino at the height of his career
","After absolutely taking Hollywood by surprise with in your face cult films like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino hasn't showed any signs of slowing down- with the knew and long-awaited Kill Bill Volume 1, he kicks ass once again.<br/><br/>Being a huge QT fan, and an admirer of the martial arts genre, this has got to be the best (and bloodiest) film I've seen this year. The story is simple, a vengeful mother & wife wanting her revenge against her former husband and his crew for attempting to kill her... However, the film is anything but short and simple, and QT displays it with nothing less than brilliance.<br/><br/>The opening scene is a prime outline of what to expect for the rest of this one part series, and is an immediate attention getter-- Uma Thurman, as the lead character, just known as 'The Bride' or Black Mumba (her actual name is bleeped out when characters refer to her) steals the show with her emotionally and physically packed performance. Other characters, such as her much hated husband Bill (who you never actually see in this volume) stays a main plot driven character, but is mostly just mentioned-- staying an outsider, giving the audience more curiosity as to what he's capable of.<br/><br/>The entire film is full of the general B martial arts action flick clichés, with a Tarantino twist full of humorous and ironic dialogue (see: Pulp Fiction) His love of the martial arts genre bleeds onto the screen so apparently, but doesn't change the films impact a bit-- His influences are obvious, and incorporated them in the movie, for example Thurman's Yellow Suit used for the majority of the film was obviously taken from Bruce Lee's costume in the film 'Game of Death' Many elements of the film sort of (tastefully) rip-off other kung fu martial arts films... (It is an original script, influenced greatly by other films...) such as his (over)use of blood and the manner in which it 'sprays' when characters are killed or injured.<br/><br/>
However greatly influenced, the film stays true to Tarantino's style. It even has some simple and short homage's to his earlier films: such as a brief advertisement of 'Red Apple Cigarettes' (the cigarettes that Bruce Willis smokes in Pulp Fiction.) Also, the films soundtrack is the perfect classic Tarantino (see: Pulp Fiction/Jackie Brown) who tends to use (and mix) western guitar/contemporary rock, in this case influenced by a simple Chinese sword fighting tune... as well as the main theme song-- a hard core 'rock & sock em' single used in fast battle sequences etc...<br/><br/>
As most of you may have seen or heard, a section of the film is done in anime, which I thought was artistic and creatively achieved... as well as risky and dangerous, but he pulled it off.<br/><br/>The fight sequences were long and brutal-- need I say bloody, and beautifully choreographed and edited. The cinematography was outstanding, beautifully shot and colorfully tainted (even the, yes, black & white scenes) Robert Richardson (who is also a DP used by such directors as Martin Scorsese & Oliver Stone) also seems to improve in his work, giving Kill Bill a sort of glowing and interesting feel (see also: Casino/Bringing Out the Dead). The fight sequences are greatly interweaved throughout the film-- shown in the beginning, and then more towards the end of the film. Tarantino loves to mess around with structure, and not surprisingly mixes it around in this film, making the anticipation for the battle scenes grow, and the characters more interesting and dynamic.<br/><br/>The film, as most of you may or may not know, was cut in half due to length issues, and Tarantino- in my opinion- ended Volume One at the perfect spot, giving the audience just enough information to anticipate whats going to happen next, but at the same time leaving us hanging and hungry for more.<br/><br/>Personally, the film was so entertaining and well done, that I did not notice the time go by and wouldn't have cared to have sit through 3 1/2 hours of Kill Bill... but splitting it into two films may have been the best business deal I've heard of considering it was a last minute decision.<br/><br/>This film will undoubtedly make loads of money internationally- and will possibly (or most likely) influence a second coming of the martial arts genre in the U.S.<br/><br/>--Basically Quentin Tarantino is at the point in his career where he can do whatever he wants. And as Stanley Kubrick once said: ""The movie studio is a director's playground"" -Tarantino is living proof, that with the right approach, connections, script, and talent- you can do whatever you want. I wouldn't expect anything less from QT-- 10/10"

","Okay, I'm not sure if this is because of the crap that went down last night afterward, but my heart is still beating like crazy after my first viewing of Kill Bill.  This movie was completely insane, evil, traumatizing, and excellent!  Some director is really gonna have to pull something out of his @ss to top this movie off within the decade, and I've only seen the first half!  I just have to say that part 2 has a LOT to answer to, and I trust Quentin and everything, but this movie was just larger than life.<br/><br/>Some great parts (****WARNING!  MAY BE SPOILERS****):<br/><br/>The very beginning where Bride gets shot in the head surprised the crap outta me.<br/><br/>The evilest moment in this movie is when Vivica Fox all of a sudden blows a hole right through her kid's cereal box at the Bride.  That was sooo surreal, it still feels like it didn't really happen.<br/><br/>There were a few great songs in this movie especially the one that was simply whistled by Elle before it was time to finish Bride off.  There was one more song (aside from the trailer music) that was so cool but I can't remember where it was in the movie.  It kinda sounded like that Tears for Fears song ""Head Over Heels.""  What are these song titles?  I want them!<br/><br/>The whole anime sequence was just mind-boggling.  I'm not much of an anime watcher, but I've never seen the camera shake like that in any animated sequence.  The best part was when the girl, under the bed, ""Whimpered"" and shoved the actual word that floated out right back into her mouth so they wouldn't hear her.  The guy in the white cloak who kicked that cigar butt into the alcohol was one of the evilest looking villians I've ever seen in animation.<br/><br/>The whole sword master part was hilarious!  And that was one of the most natural conversations I've ever heard in any movie to date.  It had a lot to do with the writing and acting as well, especially the ""Now you're making fun of me"" line by the Bride.  I know we've all heard chicks say that in real life before, but movies just don't like to be realistic I guess.<br/><br/>Hilarious part...""Silly rabbit--"" ""--tricks are for--"" ""--kids."" Almost like one person saying ""Catch"" and the other saying ""22.""<br/><br/>And finally, the moment I realized that this movie was unbelievably larger than life was when all of the kung-fu guys were lying in a huge mass of blood and lost limbs whimpering (hehe) and moaning while Bride stood on the balcony to curse them all.<br/><br/>Lucy Liu was beautiful in this movie. Great.  Just great.  Everyone go see it.  Support the talented man that is Quentin Tarantino for all of his great work.<br/><br/>P.S. If one more person, regardless if they've see it or not, says this film is ""Croutching Tiger Hidden Matrix"" I will slug them because they are obviously jealous of all the attention Quentin deserves.  They feel perfectly fine paying 7 bucks multiple times to see Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle though."
"Balakalakalaka","7","0","1","11 October 2003"," Fun, Exciting, and definitely a step up from Jackie Brown
","Kill Bills one crazy ride. I know a lot of bad critics always say some crap like ""a roller-coaster ride of a movie,"" but here that saying actually counts.<br/><br/>As much as I love kung-fu movies, sweet jazz soundtracks, and anime, however, I can't like this more than Pulp Fiction. Where Pulp Fiction had originality in large doses, this has blood in large doses. In fact, there's so much blood in this movie it starts to get funny. Do people really spurt out that much blood when you chop off their arm?<br/><br/>As for the anime side, this movie feels like one big, giant episode of Cowboy Bebop, except with a much simpler, B-movie plot. But the plot never bothers, this movie is a kung-fu flick all the way, meaning that the plot is secondary to the beautiful cinematography and excellent writing. The anime sequence alone blew my mind more than that annoying Matrix crap could ever. It seemed like a mix of Bebop-esque action sequences with Lain-style animation and a hit of Rurouni Kenshin/Samaurai X sentimentality at one very sad point.<br/><br/>Overall, Kill Bill is a great B-movie, up there with Raiders of the Lost Ark and the Evil Dead movies as one of the greatest B-movies ever made. I'd hate to say what so many stupid critics have said already, that this is a comeback for Tarantino. For God's sake, this is only his fourth film, and only one of them sucked!<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

","BILL is a surprisingly lame and mostly useless film that should have either been cut to about 88 minutes or left at 180.  whoever thought of chopping it in half (harvey, i'm pretty sure) should be punished for two reasons: 1) this thing is probably ten times better when seen in one piece, and 2) charging us twice for one film is borderline immoral.  it's bad enough that i get force fed advertisements and promos for tv shows now at every theater i go to, now the actual films are conning me?<br/><br/>it seems that in order to keep [the pompously titled] Vol. 1 at a decent running time, it has been generously padded.  i assume that one day, after ripping off all the dorks with separate dvd sales for 1 & 2, QT will re-edit the thing into one tight little movie, which would be shorter than the combined run times of what we got in theaters.  this would of course be known as the super-ultimate-golden-premier-special-deluxe edition that will hit stores about 10 months after sales of the split version taper off.<br/><br/>this is the version i will hold my breath for.<br/><br/>finally, i'd like to complain about one last thing.  i hate pointless format changes in films - going to b&w when there is no reason, for instance. the best fight scene in this film goes b&w for a good 5 minutes.  my guess is it was to obtain an r-rating, by turning the blood black (includes the opening shot of bloody uma -- none of the other wedding shots were in b&w).<br/><br/>
so, here's to the house of blue leaves going back to color when this gets to home video (at least when the definitive KILL BILL comes out - i probably won't see it again until it does).<br/><br/>sadly, for now this film not only lags behind QT's other films, but it lags far behind TRUE ROMANCE as well.<br/><br/>bo svenson is great in his one scene!"

I can't really pin point it, perhaps it's his style, or uniqueness, or just plain memorable charachters...but something places him at the front of the herd. Kill Bill isn't a perfect film, but it is by all means engaging. It has an epic feel to it, The Bride is on a quest for vengenance. And at the end of volume 1, she still has a few left on her list. It takes a good part of the movie for her to finish off the first assasin, like a movie within a movie. Perhaps the best part about the end of volume 1, is it leaves something to look forward too.

"Mulliga","8","0","1","12 October 2003"," QT, why oh why couldn't you have made this one movie?
","I'm not entirely sure if the decision to split ""Kill Bill"" up into two parts was artistic or financial, but whatever the cause, the fact that ""volume 1"" is only half the story quickly demolishes any hope for an epic QT Asian trash-action film homage. Instead, viewers are left hanging until 2004(!), and that's not conducive to good cinema.<br/><br/>What's here is mostly great. Uma Thurman turns in an inspired performance as an avenging angel of death, and the many fights are pleasing and gory as all hell, though not quite up to the standard of movies like ""The Hidden Fortress"" or even QT's inspiration, ""Kage no Gundan"". The soundtrack and visual style ooze cool, but one senses QT has lost some of his creative steam somewhere after the gigantic ""Crazy 88"" fight - after all, there's only so much that can be done with samurai swords. Give us some guns, Quentin!<br/><br/>The anime sequence explaining O-Ren is beautiful and well done, but some of the other gore effects don't work quite as well. The problem here is that QT decided to put much of the main fight in black and white for the American release (reason is still unknown - perhaps U.S. audiences can't handle gore?). When gallons of blood are lovingly crafted to splatter onscreen, the viewer almost aches to see them in vivid color...<br/><br/>The casting of Lucy Liu was a huge mistake, and the Charlie's Angel still hasn't learned how to act. Vivica Fox is basically tossed aside after the first sequence, though hopefully her snappy character will return in the second movie. The trademark time shifting works well, as do some original camera angle flourishes, but it's not enough to make ""Kill Bill"" a classic. Overall, the first half of the fourth movie by QT ends up being an 8/10."

Never has a truer thing been said when in relation to this movie.<br/><br/>This is the definately the bloodiest film ever, including the blood geysers in The Evil Dead movies. Truly, I have never seen so much blood on the screen. Parents are going to have a field day with this.<br/><br/>The comedy is SO dark it's positively bleak. The hospital scene with Buck is one of the most shocking scenes I have ever witnessed. I mean, the dialogue between Buck and his customer was the crudest thing I have ever heard from a human being's mouth and the whole Vaseline thing killed me let alone Bill.<br/><br/>After seeing this, I think QT made the right decision in cutting this movie in half as the movie is so rich it needs to be appreciated in smaller slices.<br/><br/>Thank you Quentin.

"simon_booth","6","0","2","12 October 2003"," Not as good as I hoped
","Well, maybe it's backlash syndrome, but I spent most of Kill Bill's 1h50 thinking ""when can I leave?"". Although there were a few great moments (especially the anime section, and the fight with Chigusa from Battle Royale - i.e. the parts where QT had the least direct involvement?), I thought it was mostly... self indulgent, and unengaging?<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had was with the dialogue - is this really the same guy that rewrote the book on dialogue in Reservoir Dogs? Some of it is just so banal I wanted to throw things at the screen. The editing of the film is also suspect - some scenes are interminable, and the mild non-linearity seems contrived and accomplishes little. I know we're only half way through the story, but I still have *no* idea who The Bride or Bill really are, anyway - the only character in the film that gets any real development is Lucy Liu's.<br/><br/>I never thought I'd hear myself saying this, but the violence and swearing just seemed gratuitous too. I have nothing wrong with enormous quantities of both when used well, but here it just didn't seem to serve a purpose or achieve anything.<br/><br/>So, maybe it's just that my expectations or hopes were too high - I guess the film is more interesting than most Hollywood efforts, and there were some things I liked - it was cool seeing people like Sonny Chiba and Gordon Liu up on the big screen, the soundtrack was v. good, the anime section was superbly done, and most of the fights were good.<br/><br/>I'll be going to see Pt. 2 in February anyway, and will probably pick it up on DVD, but I was hoping for something more."

","Maybe a few *spoilers* herin...<br/><br/>First off, let me say that I first heard about this movie about a year ago and have been awaiting its arrival ever since.  The decision to split the movie into two parts I think was a very good one.  I don't think many people could watch three hours of that movie straight through, though I could have easily.  That being said, lets get to the movie... This is something that has not been done in the US, so many people are not familiar with this type of over-the-top violence.  However, violent as it may be, I would not call it senseless violence.    Everything in the movie was justified.  As for the spurting blood from severed heads and arms, well that is just part of the style.  So, if you like violence you'll probably love this movie.  If you are even a little bit opposed to it, then steer clear of this one. The acting in this was also very good and it fit with the whole over-the-top style of the movie.  Thurman did a wonderful job as the bride and the supporting actors were all very good. There was one bit of anime in the movie that told the story of Oren's past which also fit very well.  One thing that puzzled a lot of people was the fact that the movie went black and white for a scene, in particular probably the most violent in the entire movie.  If you look at the context, you'll probably understand why, though most people in the theater didn't. It ends with a real cliffhanger which will leave you wanting to see more. Overall, 10/10...Everything I had hoped for and more."

","As this film opens we read in the credits that this is Quentin Tarantino's fourth film and he again shows us an updated version on a certain genre of film that he grew up on and obviously loves. Film starts with The Bride (Uma Thurman) already beaten to a bloody mess and talking to Bill (David Carradine) who shoots her in the head. She somehow survives and lies comatose in a hospital bed. She was pregnant before her attempted murder but when she awakens her baby is gone. Bill finds out that she is still alive and instead of killing her while she lies in a hospital bed he admires her toughness and orders his hired assassins not to finish her. The Bride sneaks out of the hospital and upon regaining her strength she makes out a death list for her revenge. The list has Bill and the four assassins who shot and beat her. The four assassins are Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen). She first goes to Vernita's and is involved in a knife fight. After she dispatches of her The Bride gets on a plane to Okinawa, Japan and tracks down a master sword maker named Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba). Hanzo allows her to stay for a month while he makes her a special sword. Then The Bride heads to Tokyo and finds Ishi who has become a crime boss in that city and surrounds herself with several henchmen and women who all have a special fighting talent. The Bride follows Ishi into a nightclub where a very violent stand-off takes place.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>The bride finishes off Ishi but keeps her lawyer Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus) alive so that she can send a message to Bill. The film ends with Bill talking to Sofie and asking a very revealing question that sets up a very interesting second part. Tarantino has always shown so much enthusiasm in his films and there is an abundant of energy in each scene. While the story for ""Pulp Fiction"" was more complicated this is not. It's strictly a revenge film and all the ingredients from the samurai action films of the 1970's are here. They were all basically revenge films then and it's why Tarantino choose the plot. While the story is relatively simple there still is a lot going on around it to make it a fascinating film to view and one of the things that jumps out is the music. Tarantino uses several bits of music from television and other films like the themes from TV shows ""The Green Hornet"" and ""Ironside"" and the film ""White Lightning"". Thurman wears a yellow outfit while she rides a motorcycle and it's exactly like the one Bruce Lee wore in ""Game of Death"". I don't think this is Tarantino's best film by a long shot but it is his most impressive looking. It doesn't have the grit like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and it's not groundbreaking in the way it tells it's story like ""Pulp Fiction"" but visually it's a cinematic spectacle. Thurman shows what a strong and versatile actress she is. She seems comfortable in both starring and supporting roles. Here she's not only the star but it's her most physically challenging role to date. She's up to the task and her tall physique adds to her performance. All the little things that Tarantino throws in like the music and the unique casting and the locations make this a fun film to view. This is extremely bloody and limbs and heads are chopped off in record numbers so the squeamish may want to steer clear. But for Tarantino fans and those who are familiar with the samurai films that this is an homage to than your in for quite an experience."

","For those of you who do not get the reference, Samurai Jack is a cartoon whose creator developed it in response to the lousy action cartoons he suffered through in his childhood.  You know the shows: where the characters sit around half the time, and only have a small battle at the end.  Well, Jack is nothing but action, and the same can be said for Bill.<br/><br/>The plot here is thinner than the paper it's written on, but it just doesn't matter.  In fact, that's the point.  Why try to constrain all of the great action with something as useless as a plot?  Just give Uma a list of people she needs to kill, and let her do it in the goriest way possible.  All action films should be so simple.  So often the plot just gets in the way, and big showdowns, for example, seem ridiculous and forced, instead of tense and dramatic.  This movie was made for the sake of big showdowns, and it delivers.  It's refreshing to have a movie dish out what it advertises.<br/><br/>In fact, there's so much action and violence I'm surprised they were able to get an R rating (not that I'm complaining.  Personally I think these people need to lighten up more often).  I guess the blood spray was so exaggerated that they decided it was more humorous than traumatic.  But the body count seemed better suited for a video game, or Antietam.<br/><br/>But I digress.  If you want to see action for the sake of action, here's your movie.  If the sight of blood makes you sick, bring a barf bag.  As for me, I give it two thumbs up."

","Even if this might paint me as a sick, animal-torturing fiend, I must admit that the violence contained in ""Kill Bill Vol. One"" brought a strange and twisted smile to my face. And why not? In the graphic callousness that has become director Quentin Tarantino's trademark, ""Kill Bill"" surpasses anything I have ever seen on the scale of bloodshed. But what makes it forgivable is how the whole thing is set up, with the brilliant use of color and also of camera styles that just makes the whole thing so SLICK. The plot thus far is pretty shaky, but I imagine that it will be tied up nicely in Part Two.

Her fight scenes are remarkable.  The touches of QT humor throughout are quite the contrast to the ongoing bloodbaths and severed limbs.  His use of black & white and cuts make the violence tolerable and some of the shots are pure magic.  The flashback scenes provide most of the story line for us and the Death List 5 are all given glimpses, while a couple are featured in this most entertaining part one.  We have come to depend upon Tarantino to deliver something new to us - this is tremendous pressure, yet he continues to deliver.  His long list of outlandish characters is added to with Lucy Liu's bodyguard, GOGO.  She is right up there with Samuel L. Jackson from ""Pulp Fiction"".  I must advise all to pay special attention to QT's use of music throughout.

Since very minimal CGI was used (and I mean minimal), it made the movie even better. Directors and producers should take a page out of this movie and cut down on the use of visual effects, because it can seriously kill the appeal of a movie such as The Matrix: Reloaded did. If you go back to movies in the early 90's when CGI was just coming of age, it made those movies appealing and even better then present day CGI overloaded movies because it was amazing to see what was done without the use of CGI, and you start thinking ""how did they do that?""

","Once again Quentin Tarantino brings us a well thought out high imaginative masterpiece of cinematic art, violence, mayhem, gore, comedy and story.<br/><br/>In a Pulp Fiction like fashion the movie seamlessly (and violently) moves from the past to the present and back to the past.  The movie uses cinematic techniques and elements from the classic (black and white) samurai movies, the spaghetti western and Japanese anime to tell a colorful story (not just because of all the blood and gore - but it would be remiss on my part not to mention that there's plenty of it - some comic - some not so comic) of a woman (Uma Thurman) betrayed by her associates and mentor who is out for revenge.  All of the characters are cold blooded killers with little or no remorse about what they do and how they do it, while applying a very warped sense of east Asian Samurai-like honor to it all.  In truth, we don't even know much about Uma Thurman's character and while she is portrayed as the heroine in this film, she may be for all we know the worst of the entire bunch (she does appear to be completely encased by her need/desire for vengeance and is following her path with a passion and cold logic that if you take a moment to think about should make this character that much more suspect as a true ""good"" heroine).<br/><br/>Could people that seem to be truly this evil really be considered honorable? In some strange way maybe they can, but these are not good people.  They may say there is no honor among thieves/criminals but maybe in some strange sort of way at least for this small group there does seem to be just that.<br/><br/>We don't find out a whole lot about Bill except that he's the one that wanted to have Uma's character dead and buried, which if it had worked would have made this a very short movie.  Bill appears to be some kind of evil mastermind with students and protégées littered all over the globe who had been trained in the martial art of the samurai long ago by a sword master and maker.<br/><br/>The movie is a very comfortable hour and a half (figure up to two hours depending upon how many previews your theatre runs) and doesn't leave you hanging as far as the story goes.  The ending is dark and very good and neat making the movie by itself a complete item - it doesn't leave you with the lack of wrap up one feels when watching the Matrix Reloaded or any of the new Lord of the Rings movies (they made me feel like - what? that's it? its over?) - and allows you to excitedly look forward to the coming sequel because you truly feel as though this ""Volume"" is truly complete."

Remember how ridiculously lame the big fight scene between Neo and the thousand Agent Smiths in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" looked? You won't get any of that here. There's no CG, and that makes the fight scenes so much more satisfying.<br/><br/>Uma Thurman gives one hell of a tour de' force perfomance. She is both fragile and delicate then in the next moment she is lets it all go. If the Gods smile upon Uma she could be looking at her 2nd Oscar nod next year!<br/><br/>And Volume 2? I can't wait."

","I  was thinking that this might supplant my favorite movie pulp fiction.I was going to be disappointed if this wasnt the best movie Id ever seen. It was great.  However, it is not for everyone.  I think if you like Pulp Fiction you will like this movie.  Its far more violent.  But in the same way that Tarentino captured ""cool"" in pulp he did again here and more so. the satire was brilliant the homage was brilliant.  all the little touches were amazing, from camera shots, to anime, to the japanese surf rock band."

","Volume 1 of Kill Bill Uses Many Different Styles.  And in the end, this might be what turns many people off.  I feel that most people could identify with QT's first 3 films.  They follow storylines that are common to American Cinema. Kill Bill is a total different animal though. SEMI-SPOILER: I don't know if the average moviegoer can deal with Japanamation in a live action movie. I don't think the average moviegoer has seen more than 1 or 2 martial arts films. Will the average moviegoer be able to deal with hacked off limbs left and right?Will they be able to relate to this film? I hope so, but realistically I don't think so. And that's fine with me because I GET this movie. I see what QT's doing and I love it. 8 out of 10."

","I'm going to keep this short and sweet....<br/><br/>Anybody who has seen Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown know what kind of director Tarantino is.  He is so unique.  Kill Bill is exactly what I thought it would be...Brilliant.  The music, the dialogue, the performances, all define him as a director.  Uma Thurman steals the show, obviously.  Let me get to the point:  SEE THIS MOVIE.  You owe yourself that.  Even if you hate it, you will never see anything like it...."
"cafesmitty","10","0","1","11 October 2003"," Kill Bill Thrills
","Yuen Wo Ping should get half the directing credit for this movie because half the film is his remarkable choreographed fight scenes.  This is a stylish, slick, wonderfully artistically violent film.  Uma Thurman is not only amazing but believable.  Tarantino is very much aware of the importance of music and just like in his previous films I think he did in outstanding job in choosing each musical number for each scene.  <br/><br/>Basic synopsis: Uma Thurman wants revenge on a former employer and her former coworkers who shot her up during at her wedding.  She spends the rest of that movie planning and exacting that revenge.<br/><br/>As I said before, there are some amazing fight scenes in this film, in particular with a young 17 year old, but deadly Japanese school girl with a ball and chain.  This is Tarantino's homage to the violent Asian action films of the 70s.   Pretty much everyone knows that Quentin is a big movie buff and freak and his whole career in film making has been paying homage to the films he loved while growing up.  This guy sees the beauty of the uberviolent, smashed nose, low budget films such as Cleopatra Jones, Game of Death, Fist of Fury, The Killing Machine (Japanese its - Shinkansen daibakuha).  In fact if you ever get to see The Killing Machine you will understand much about the violence in Kill Bill.  Anyway, the fight scenes in this film are nothing short from brilliant.  My biggest detraction of this movie is that the way it ends.  It felt, very much so, that it ended in the middle.  I know Volume 2 will be released in February and I understand some aspect of splitting this film in half, but that is the problem.  Most films that have sequels attached to them are films that have a definite ending themselves.  But they were made with and ending.  Volume 1 of Kill Bill was original made to be a single picture and thus the ending for the movie is actually in Volume 2.  What we have here is a film that ends on its crest.  We only get half the plot, we only get half the character development (what little Tarantino usually have in his films).  What we get is half a movie.    I am sure that Tarantino has a final cut clause in his contract and thus ended up with a 4, probably 4 ½ hour film.  And I am sure he as willing to release it as such, but Miramax came up with the (not so) brilliant idea of releasing the film in 2 parts.  I guess in a hope of doubling its profits. I know theater chains hate 3 + hours films.  They would rather have 8 showings of a 2 hour film instead of 5 showings of films such as Braveheart or Gladiator.  They make more money during the day by faster turnover rates. So they WILL NOT support a 4 hour film.  3 ½ hours is as a far as they are willing to go, heck they barely support 3 hour films. Now when a director wants to tell a story and it takes 4 hours to tell the only way we get the whole story is through director's cut DVDs (for example The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, 1st two parts added an additional 30 minutes each, it was the same way with Cameron's Aliens).   There is only one POSTIVE light in this whole 2 part nonsense and that is that part 2 is being released in February and not a year later (as in Lord of the Rings).  Will they release the film on one single DVD?  I doubt it, where is the profit in that?  Anyway, I give KILL BILL an A.  I liked it and Quentin Tarantino along with fight choreographers Yuen Wo Ping and Sonny Chiba not only delivers a highly entertaining film but a highly memorable one to boot."
"Bond-33","8","0","1","11 October 2003"," Bloody Good Fun...
","It seems to me that many of the people who take issue with this film expected it to be another Pulp Fiction.  This is rather foolish.  Tarantino will never make a film better than Pulp Fiction simply because we have idolized it so much over the past decade.  It is already a classic, and deserves to be.<br/><br/>Kill Bill is just bloody (in all senses of the word) good fun.  Once again Tarantino manages to take all the cliches from every genre and combine them to make something fresh and new.  No other director today seems to be able to do this as well as he.  My only complaints are #1 - Damn you Harvey Weinstein for cutting it in half.  Albeit, they did manage to end it well and keep the pacing.  Secondly, I wish they had gone one way or the other with the Crouching Tigerness of the fight scenes.  There are brief moments where characters appear to fly or make incredible leaps, but then the rest will come back to earth.  It's unclear.  Certainly don't let that stop you from seeing it.  In an age where sequels and prequels and remakes are dominating the industry, costing millions of dollars and being hyped into deification, only to let us down, Kill Bill finds it's target.  Bloody good fun indeed."

But being as I am a huge Tarantino fan I read a couple for Kill Bill and knew what to expect when seeing it.<br/><br/>Now, that I have seen I loved it.  This film was shocking, disturbing, bloody, and very action packed.  Every actor in this film did a wonderful job.  I am waiting impatiently for February to see the second volume.  This is a must see especially if you are a fan of martial arts.  While there was some wire worked used, it was used in a way that wasn't over the top.<br/><br/>8-10 stars"

Tarantino-san just made exactly what he wanted and give us a movie really exciting with a lot of incredible fights, a lot of blood and of course, a dark humor totally insane and funny. Uma Thurman is amazing, the fight with the 80 bodyguards is visually fantastic,and the music (by The RZA) is a masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino is still alive! Alleluyah!"

","Kill Bill, the long awaited 5th Quentin Tarantino movie, will impress those fascinated with Tarintino's artistic style and quirky surprises.<br/><br/>Out-of-the-gate violence will leave serious fans pleased, and even those unfamiliar with this style of movie will find much of the gratuitous bloodshed has been done to amuse.<br/><br/>Fans of anime will applaud Tarantino's efforts to include an incredible, dramatic, and action packed animated sequence.  Virgins to anime will be treated to a real piece of art here.  This is your chance to go rent Akira, Ninja Scroll, or Spirited Away (for the family man).<br/><br/>Many will be offended, but this *is* a Tarantino movie.  Take note:  If you couldn't handle the Bruce Willis - Ving Rhames scene in Pulp Fiction, this isn't the movie for you.<br/><br/>This is Vol. 1, do not expect business to be finished by the end of the film.<br/><br/>8/10"

"halo_fourteen","8","0","1","10 October 2003"," A cinematic masterpiece
","I wasn't sure what to expect from the ""fourth film by Quentin Tarantino"" (although arguably, his involvement as a writer and producer exceeds this immensely) not because I doubted what he is capable of, but mainly because the critics have hyped this film up so much, and yet there was nothing to really suggest whether the film would live up to it. From what I have read and seen of it, it did look like it would be some kind of a mindless action film and not much else. When Leicester Square offered an early showing in the UK of this film, I jumped at the chance to see it to find out once and for all. And the good news is, I wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>From the second the film starts, you can instantly tell this is a true Tarantino film simply on his trademark way of shooting which takes no prisoners; To anyone that might have walked out on this film, I have to ask ""Did you really think you could summon the devil and make him behave?"" No, thankfully, anyone who was worried that Q.T. might have compromised the violence aspect of the film can put their minds to rest. Not only is ultra-violence a key aspect of the film, but the constant psychological suffering of The Bride herself and the physical suffering of any of her victims won't go unnoticed. You really do feel an empathy for The Bride, and even when you think she's gone too far, she still holds true to her morals drawing the line between those that have done anything to her (or about to) and those who can't.<br/><br/>Next aspect to tackle is the common ""Quentin Mould"" that people have been worried about, which is the lack of dialogue. It's true speech doesn't play a key- role in this film, but what I love about it so much is that the film doesn't play in any chronological order, and because of that, the story makes more sense as it goes along - the characters don't recap on anything that's happened because they already know, so you're left to do a lot guess work rather than having it spoon-fed to you. Any dialogue which is in the film doesn't go to waste for example when The Bride has a running commentary will explain what you need to know, there is still a fantastic element of comedy still in the film, which does provide just the right amount of comic relief when it's needed most, at the most unexpected of places. There's still a lot of room for more dialogue in Volume 2 of the film, so for this half, you should just sit back and watch the blood flow.<br/><br/>The film is split into five chapters for the first Volume, which, as I mentioned, aren't totally in order, however it really does make the film more enjoyable to watch that way. Each chapter has their own tale a la 'Pulp Fiction' and linked to each other in their ways - one of which ""The origin of O-Ren Ishi"" is done totally in Anime (Manga to most) - which was actually animated in Tokyo, and like the most of the film is of extreme violence, but with the added power that the film is allowed to go that little bit further, going to Number 11 on the violence level just when you thought you had seen enough. It's a really excellent touch to the film and just proves that Q.T. is more than willing to spread his horizons more than just being known for doing the same thing.<br/><br/>Anyone who has accused this of ""taking the piss out of kung-fu movies"" will be eating their words very soon. In actual fact, it's more of a Samurai film, which is more appropriate as a lot of the film takes place in Japan (and not Hong-Kong), but anything from the directing for the Kung-Fu-esque scenes in Tokyo, the men with the silly masks to the Yellow and Black suite (worn by Bruice Lee on his last film) should only be seen as a tribute to other great films out there, and when the lights go out and they fight in silhouette, you will only be thankful.<br/><br/>All in all, Kill Bill Volume 1 defeated my expectations, it's great to see Tarantino back in true form, and I can only say that Uma Thurman is probably the hardest female character, shattering the likes of Linda Hamilton in 'Terminator 2' and Angelina Jolie in `Tomb Raider' on all grounds as well as being a fantastic actress all the way through. The cliffhanger at the end will have you holding your breath until Volume 2 comes out in February. I can hardly wait. 8/10"

","I've learned more about the story from the trailer. Apparently, the decision to split KILL BILL into two films happened after the completion of the trailer.<br/><br/>KILL BILL VOL. 1 works perfectly for me. The brilliant excess comes to a close with a neat twist and blunt anticipation for the finale.<br/><br/>The Bride, aka Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) narrates the film. We don't know why or who she is marrying in a church shack in Texas. All we know is that she gets a gun to the head and tells Bill (voice of David Carradine) that the baby is his. Now, after four years in a coma, she awakens and seeks revenge.<br/><br/>The Bride was a member of Bill's Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. The other members are Vernita Green, aka Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox), now a housewife and mother, O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), the Chinese-Japanese-American boss of the Tokyo yakuza, one-eyed Elle Driver/California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah), and Budd/Sidewinder (Michael Madsen).<br/><br/>In Vol. 1, The Bride goes after ex-Vipers Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii. Elle Driver and Budd will, along with Bill, suffer the penalties of payback in Vol. 2. They will be waiting for her.<br/><br/>Like our first back-of-the-head images of the memorable Marcellus (Ving Rhames) in PULP FICTION, we only see Bill's hands clutching a walking stick. We only hear his pimp talk.<br/><br/>Will Bill pimp talk Budd?<br/><br/>With KILL BILL we enter Tarantino's world and it is meticulously handcrafted. This film is so finely tuned and lovingly made that there is not a fabric fold that does not have his Vermeer touch. Every image is gorgeously framed and a statement of fact: This is all about loving filmmaking and loving every character.<br/><br/>Each character is given the decorous attention that The Bride gets. There are no minor characters or supporting players to make the star look good. Every character can command a fascinating storyline. What is on display is Tarantino's extravagant admiration for a particular genre - Asian action `grindhouse' B-movies - and lavishing it with talent and slavish devotion.<br/><br/>What we felt about PULP FICTION, Tarantino has eclipsed. If you don't like blood splattering, be advised to stay home. Tarantino approaches the blood letting in a novel way. It's the garden hose on high blast of blood. It gives the blood flow a surreal appearance and moves it into cartoon violence. The mutilation is another thing altogether. A strong, ruthless woman hacking off limps and announcing the body parts belong to her. Any need here for Freud?<br/><br/>All the women are seething with anger. It is female cruelty as art form.<br/><br/>The women in KILL BILL embody my favorite Hindu goddess - who graces my desk - Kali The Destroyer.<br/><br/>At the center of Tarantino's world is the vicious, cold-hearted Bride. Well, at least she has a good reason to be resentful. Tarantino has fashioned a female warrior with a primordial purpose sprung directly from the Reptilian (or R-complex) brain: Revenge. She is a zealot walking straight into the lion's den without one moment of fear or apprehension. There is no doubt in The Bride's mind. She is also noble. When she kills Vernita Green The Bride tells her young daughter that, when she grows up and wants revenge, she will be waiting. It's the assassin's code of honor.<br/><br/>Ah, Lucy Liu. After her role in PAYBACK, she has entered the sex icon domain. Is there a director who does not want to use her after that stunning turn as a dominatrix? Tarantino surrounds The Bride with females who are just as lethal, exotic, and even more exciting. O-Ren Ishii is flanked by two mesmerizing characters: Her lawyer, Sophie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus) and a teenage bodyguard. I adored the teenager. Yeah, I loved Vincent Vega, but now I want an entire movie about this kid.<br/><br/>The production is gorgeous. The anime episode is wonderful. The opening scene between Vernita Green and The Bride jumpstarts the movie. Fox is mean. Fox is mad and sweating with fury. Her nostrils throb. Tarantino, famously, resurrects Daryl Hannah's career and liberates her from Really Bad Movie Hell. She's older, harder, and tougher than Uma. She is the perfect foil with a flair for clever eye patches. Then comes Liu with a face that, when still, expresses coldness and emotionless resolve. She scared me.<br/><br/>Tarantino has created monumental female characters and delivers the goods as promised."

","The Bride was once part of a group of female assassins: till she changed her life, took a new name and, pregnant, decided to get married, but not succeeded since her former boss, Bill, with her former companions arrived and killed everybody at the ceremony and apparently her as well.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact she was not dead. And she decided to make her revenge. To kill all those who tried to kill her and succeeded in killing all the people at the ceremony and the child she was waiting for as well.<br/><br/>I liked 'Kill Bill' very much. It follows the attempts and adventures of women warriors who fight and hate each other. Like in old epic stories people fight for principles despite concrete restrictions or unlikeliness. As a matter of fact Tarantino does not describe his characters with many details: they are mainly characters, not people meat and bones...And that is what makes the movie so fascinating, throws you in the universe of ideals, of old riders stories. Even the description of characters (Cottonmouth for example), of their past life is addressed to showing the reason of her ideas, of her personal morality, but not of her emotions or sensations as human being. The use of cartoons helps in this sense.<br/><br/>I wait for the second part..."
