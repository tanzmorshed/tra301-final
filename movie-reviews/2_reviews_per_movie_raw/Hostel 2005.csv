","This movie is soooo gross! The eye scene? Puke rising up to my mouth just thinking about it! Blech!!! So much excessive horror nastiness! Sick as heck, but just hard not to watch! Throw in the gorgeous women, and you've got a disgustingly beautiful horror flick!<br/><br/>I loved the Oli character - the king of swing - ""Of course my horse""! And the gang of young boys that want gum! So weird! I also liked the whole Europeaness of the film - the location, language, and overall feel of it! Lent a big piece of realism to it all.<br/><br/>My negative rant is that I wanted to know more about the town, and the people, and the ""why"" of it all. I know money is part/most of it.

"bob the moo","Null","47","66","18 November 2008"," Deeply unpleasant on one level; thrilling on another  it works for what it sets out to do but is a very basic and cynical affair that will put many off
","Hostel was one of those films described as ""torture porn"" and, with my low tolerance for gore, I decided to give it a miss at the cinemas and dismiss it if anyone brought it up. However as it came on TV a month or so ago I decided that maybe I was being unfair by not giving it a try. It did sit on my HDD for a month though as somehow I never was in the mood until I forced myself to watch it. It does what you expect it to do and there should be no surprise that it is very gory throughout. What surprised me was how gripped I was by it as I squirmed in my seat and had the emotional ""flight"" response while sitting there. In that sense the film works because for all but the most hardened viewer it will have you feeling ill and get your heart beating. However while it did achieve this, it did it by simply going direct for being as sadistic and graphic as it possibly could.<br/><br/>In a way there is a ""build-up"" to the main gory bits but this is less of a decision so much as a necessary evil of having any sort of story. The first thirty minute or so are essentially the guys getting honey-trapped into this Eastern-European world of heartless torture and then from there we have gore for varying reasons (and here the makers give us nudity to prevent the male target audience getting bored). You never really care about the characters or the story because the tension is not about ""what is happening next"" as it is about the act you are watching. It is a cynical horror movie in this way as it has a very simple atmosphere and a very simple target or gore. While you are watching it the sheer cruel horror of it might stop you thinking but ultimately it is a soulless affair that reminds me of the viral ""2 girls 1 cup"" video. You see both are the type of thing you want to watch but also don't want to see, both also are entirely about seeing horrible things from the remote safety of your home and of course both generally get a ""hands over eyes, open-mouth but yet unable to look away"" response from viewers. This is all Hostel is going for and this is why I have real reservations recommending it because as a ""film"" it is pretty poor.<br/><br/>Those that love gore will love it though because in this area it excels. The effects are horrifically realistic and are delivered in clear, cruel shots. The actors do a great job of convincing in their pain, horror and fear and this is part of the gore voyeur aspect of the film. As characters though they are poor and can do nothing with the script other than be young and geeky/sexy/beefy/stoned* (delete as appropriate). Hoffman's portrayal of power is the only exception because, while a bit whacked out, he perfectly captures the sheer indifference to live that real evil has. Roth's direction doesn't show much in the way of subtlety but he knows what his audience want and how to give it to them. The lack of anything beyond this in his delivery or script can be easily seen in the way that the film doesn't even try to do something with the fact that we are getting entertainment from watching people torture/kill others for their entertainment. Normally in this sort of thing there would at least be some reference to this conflict but here Roth is part of his audience and sees nothing wrong at all with what he is doing  which is a problem for me, not that he needs to be ""ashamed"" but just that a film should not just be a load of filmed gore with no heart or reason to care.<br/><br/>Hostel is a gory horror movie that is entirely about being repulsed and thrilled by the graphic and sadistic acts portrayed with excellent special effects. Those looking for this will be pleased with it but the majority will be turned off. For some it will simply be too gory to watch and they will get no pleasure from witnessing hell on earth  I totally understand where they are coming from. However the majority of viewers will not be those that struggle with gore but just object to the cynical way that it is put on the screen without any real attempt at using it as part of the film or story  no, here the gore is the all and there is nothing else to watch it for. This factor alone makes me stronger in my decision to ignore this genre for what it is because being good at what you do doesn't mean that it is right for you to do it in the first place."
"requiem2872","3","237","376","6 January 2006"," Unrealistic and not scary.
","I didn't like Hostel. The premise is frightening. The idea of being drugged, kidnapped, tortured, and killed by people who are paying to do it, is a great concept for a film. It's just too bad that the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be.<br/><br/>It starts off like ""Eurotrip"" or any number of cheesy teen sex comedies. Lots of fake boobs and characters acting idiotic, in a fake atmosphere. Scenes in dance clubs that don't look realistic. You know, the types of places where people are dancing to loud music, but somehow can talk to each other in a normal tone of voice and everything is brightly lit so you can see all the movie extras pretending to dance in the background. Just like all the clubs, I've ever been to, right? Anyway, this goes on and on until the bloodshed starts, giving us absolutely no reason to feel anything for the main characters.<br/><br/>Then it turns into the horror film it should be. The scenes of torture are effective and psychologically scary if you imagine yourself in the situation, but in the context of the rest of this movie it just becomes ineffective.<br/><br/>Then the end of the movie turns into an unrealistic revenge fantasy that's played out, for the most part, for laughs. Kids payed in bubble gum help the good guy get away by smashing the bad guys heads in with rocks as they chew away and blow bubbles. The two girls and guy who set them up are easily killed when they luckily appear in front of the getaway car. The man that killed his friends just happens to be on the train on the way home so he can kill him and somehow not get blood on himself, then continue on his way. So is the movie supposed to be realistic, scary, or funny? It's falls short of any of these things. Eli Roth needs to pick one and do it.<br/><br/>The music is terrible. Not in the fact that the music itself isn't good, but for the fact that, A: it doesn't fit the movie, and B: There's way to much of it. There's a scene where the Characters are merely walking across a courtyard, and the music sounds like it should be a fight scene in Harry Potter. Completely out of place and distracting, further telling you this is just a movie no need to feel anything for the characters or get scared.<br/><br/>You can do a good compare and contrast between this movie and ""Wolf Creek"" which came out a couple weeks ago. Everything that is wrong with ""Hostel"", was done right in ""Wolf Creek"". Both movies are about young travelers getting into horrifying situations, however in ""Wolf Creek"" the characters actually act like normal human beings therefore you feel disgusted when they get tortured and killed. It's genuinely frightening and realistic, and by all means not ""fun"" to watch. It makes you feel horrible inside. It's REALISTIC HORROR. To make a stupid analogy. If ""Hostel"" and ""Wolf Creek"" were movies about Viet Nam, ""Wolf Creek"" would be ""Platoon"", and ""Hostel"" would be ""Rambo: First Blood Part Two"". (Note how neither would be ""Full Metal Jacket"" cause it's to good to be used in this analogy).<br/><br/>I gave ""Hostel"" a 3 out of 10 for a frightening concept, and the puke was a nice touch. . . If you're about to get tortured and killed chances are you're gonna puke. . . Realism, Eli. More realism please."
"BigMez","9","547","899","20 December 2005"," Moral Choices and the Dark Side of Humanity
","I just got back from an L.A. screening of Hostel. I haven't seen an effective horror film like this in a long time. My stomach was still knotted up after we left the screening. The last time I felt like that was when I saw ALIENS for the first time about 19 years ago. Since then, no other horror film has ever made me feel like that. I certainly didn't expect it from this one. As much as I loved Cabin Fever, I'm not blind to the shortcomings of its script. As such,I was expecting more of the same from Hostel - dark humor, gore, and a sense of dread. I'm happy to see that director Eli Roth has taken a big step forward in becoming a better storyteller and filmmaker.<br/><br/>Admittedly my heart sank when the film began. The scenes introducing the main characters were blandly shot and edited. All I could think was, 'Oh no. Roth succumbed to some unseen studio pressure to make a normal-looking horror flick'. The style was typical of the what you'd see in crap like I know what you did last summer. But in very subtle ways, the blandness gets washed away and as our heroes enter the threshold of Hell, the style of the film changes as well. This, I learned during the Q&A afterwards with Roth, was intentional.<br/><br/>If you've read some of the other reviews posted here from people who saw it at the Toronto Film Festival, you get the general idea of the story. Contrary to what you might've heard, this is not a 90 minute film on torture. The torture scenes are brief and to the point. Roth doesn't wallow in pointless gore. And this is where I think it shows how he's improved as a filmmaker. He's more interested in scenes and ideas that move the story forward. Yes, there is plenty of gore, but it's relevant to the story and doesn't exist just for it's own sake.<br/><br/>One of the aspects of this film that made it so powerful was how Roth created a sense of helpless and inevitability. He provides the dark setup, throws in a sympathetic character, and begins twisting the screws and ratcheting up the suspense. This isn't a movie where you turn off your brain to enjoy it. On the contrary. The more you think about it, the more horrifying it becomes. You begin putting yourself into the character's situation and wondering what you'd do. When you realize that there is no hope for the character, no way to escape, no 'buddy' who's gonna turn up at the last minute to save the hero, and not a shred of humanity or compassion to the antagonists, real fear begins to set in.<br/><br/>Another great element in the script is how the 'survivor' makes moral choices that define their character. Instead of being merely reactive like the characters in Cabin Fever, the survivor makes several decisions which change the course of the story. It's a sign of well thought-out script and a filmmaker who cares about the fate of his characters.<br/><br/>For horror fans, this is an absolute must-see. It's so refreshing to see a horror movie that actually makes you feel uncomfortable and one in which you have no idea what's going to happen next. As for the gore, I was surprised by what they got away with. Although there were no credits at the end of the film, the cut I saw was rated R by the MPAA and according to Roth, he didn't cut anything out."
"ralph_2ndedition","3","278","458","6 March 2006"," Somewhat stylish, but very trite and predictable!
","The plot, in short: Three backpackers, two Americans and one Icelander, does Europe by train with two major goals: To get high and nail as many women as possible... In Amsterdam they accidentally learn of a hostel in Bratislava, Slovakia where sex-mad women thirst for men in general, and American men i particular. They of course decide to go there and at first it seems the rumors were true. But they soon learn that the hostel is nothing more than a front for a bizarre club, where people can pay a huge fee to get to perform unspeakable acts...<br/><br/>My 2 cents: The director and writer Eli Roths biggest accomplishment before Hostel is Cabin Fever (2002) - weather or not that is something good is a matter of personal judgment. That he got two Evil Dead'ers (Scott Spiegel and FX-genius Gregory Nicotero) interested in his script is not at all surprising. But how he got Quentin Tarantino to executive produce (and thereby act as ""posterboy"" for his flick) is, to me, a total and utter mystery.<br/><br/>Hostel has potential, I'm not going to take that away from it. The thought that a place exists where rich people pay money to torture and kill other people is interesting. And a story about a kidnapped person who finds himself locked in that very place, waiting for his assassin, should make for a great film! The film is wonderfully lit, specifically in the torture chamber-scenes. And the set-dressing in those scenes are marvelous. It really feels like Roth found these places - and just shot them as the were. But the lighting, set-dressing and potentially-rich story, unfortunately, ends the positive things I have to say about Hostel.<br/><br/>It is frustrating to see a story that could have been so exciting and horrific get so utterly fumbled up! The movie is an hour and a half long, and takes a whopping 50 minutes to get to the place that is supposed to be the scene of terror and creepiness. The nearly hour-long ""intro"" is spent observing the backpackers while they party, get high and watch naked ladies in Amsterdams Red Light-district. When the story finally starts to focus on whatever is wrong with the Slovakian hostel it points everything out to such an extensive degree that it feels like Roth wants to put a stupid-hat on every member in the audience. I sat, in vain, and waited for him to take the lid off, go ""ta-daa!"" and show me something intelligent that I had missed. But it never happens and when the lid, towards the end, slowly slides off on its own accord it turns out that the ones you suspected were bad guys were in fact...bad guys. The ones you suspected were dead...were dead. And the entire movie ends the way you suspected it would all along.<br/><br/>Jay Hernandez (Paxton) and Derek Richardson (Josh) doesn't do to shabby in the two leads. But Roth has stayed true to Hollywood formula and chosen picturesque before personality, and the bigger part has unfortunately been given to Hernandez - instead of Richardson who I thought were more likable, and more interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Spanish director Koldo Serra made El tren de la bruja in 2003. A short-film about a man who agrees to partake in an experiment and suddenly finds himself strapped to a chair in a dark room. He hears metal objects being handled and someone pacing back and forth in the room. When the light is turned on it dawns on him that he will probably be tortured to death. Serras short-film is fifteen minutes long. It was filmed in two days and is scary as hell! Hostel is both longer and has, as it first seems, more story to build on. But it still wants to base the horror in exactly the same sort of scenes as Serras short - and fails miserably! Hostel is, probably, made specifically for an American teen-audience, where drugs and naked women represent half of the movies pull. Blood and bodyparts make up the other half. If you watch this and expect anything more sophisticated than some blood and naked breasts you'll be disappointed."
"Charlotte_Kaye","1","118","187","9 July 2006"," Serves absolutely no purpose whatsoever.
","It's not scary. It's not funny. It's not stylish. It's not suspenseful, exciting, thrilling or chilling in any way. It's not intelligent enough to even be viewed as some warped social commentary. It's not ambitious enough to do anything other than present gratuitous T&A and gore in the dullest manner imaginable. Hell, it's not even entertaining. What it really is is an exercise in being completely and utterly pointless aside from presenting violent scenarios and nude women in third world countries with unlikely silicone enhanced bodies. The ""plot"" involves a trio of students (two Americans and a foreigner) vacationing in Eastern Europe who eventually stumble upon a pay-to-slay type business that specializes in making your sickest dreams come true (i.e. customers paying a high price to get to slaughter a real live person). And I am using the world ""eventually"" because it takes around an hour for this movie to get to the real horror content. First we have to sit through an excruciating hour dedicated to the juvenile frat boy antics of characters who stay wasted on booze and drugs and pay hookers for sex. A whole hour of this crap.<br/><br/>Our ""heroes"" are stupid, irritating, immature, one-dimensional and thoroughly unlikable. By the time their lives are in danger, you could care less what happens to them. I know I didn't. I was actually rooting for the generic, anonymous bad guys to tell you the truth. To make matters worse, this film has a tacked on ending that tries to let the sole survivor enact his vengeance. These scenes are absolutely ludicrous and riddled with coincidence. Certain characters just happen to be at a certain place at the right time. Hey, there's three of them now crossing the street right in front of me just as I'm trying to escape the town! Well what do you know? How bout I run 'em all over! There's another one who happens to be on the same train as me as I'm leaving the country! Well I'll follow him into the bathroom... etc. etc. etc. The end.<br/><br/>This movie is absolute garbage from start to finish. It's nothing new or interesting. There is some gore, but it's pretty much what's expected and nothing too shocking for anyone who has already sat through films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Dawn of the Dead. Director Eli Roth may be 35 years old, but his brain functions at the level of someone 20 years his junior based on his juvenile screenplay and uninspired direction. Roth himself later claimed he made this film ""to show Americans' ignorance of the world around them"" and in the process only ended up showing his own ignorance when it comes to film- making. Absolutely the pits!"
"olieclay","8","14","18","19 January 2007"," watch with open mind...
","Just watched Hostel for the second time and thoroughly enjoyed it again though it meanders towards the end and doesn't deliver the catharsis that the degree of vengeance could. I think this is intentional though as we aren't supposed to identify with the characters in a good way, but recognise that their ignorance and chauvinism could be our own. The feeling achieved at the end is liberating in a different sense as in we are still free to heed the main message of the film, and tuck that money back in our wallet before we spend it on an immoral enterprise, such as sleeping with prostitutes who were forced into it, despite the carefree dogma of the age. Barbara Nedeljakova and Prague both look great as well. I liked the nod to the Wickerman, and the more sinister reference of the big ovens (the other thing i got was the feeling of getting more than you bargain for when you delve into a country's history and dig up some nasty stuff. This is particularly true when travelling.)<br/><br/>One final important point is that I think although many viewers will be able to identify to a degree with the blokes in this film, they aren't supposed to be entirely sympathetic characters."
"imajestr","7","211","364","15 April 2006"," Good idea...turned to generic garbage.
","This movie really could have been so much more. The idea would have been much better off with someone who actually wanted to make a decent movie, instead of a porno gorefest. The first half of the movie consists almost entirely of sex, talk of sex, drugs, and talk of drugs. Instead of, hey, maybe develop the characters a little so the audience might care about them and make their plights a little more tense, the filmmakers decided to have a lot of party scenes and annoying main characters acting like idiots until, uh oh, we didn't plan on being tortured, oops! The sad thing is, there are hints of something more intelligent beneath the surface, but the surface is piled so high with garbage that it's lost. For example, while at a sex club (wow, original!) one of the characters mentions something along the lines of ""paying to do anything you want to a person,"" of course he means sexually, but we know the basic plot of the movie involves the same concept with death and torture instead of sex. One of the characters is supposed to seem like a nice guy, but still never really develops enough for us to care. The main character has absolutely no depth other than a childhood story and his shallow interaction with his friend. The last half or so of the movie actually starts to gain momentum, and the first half not been an entire waste of film, I could have walked away with more than a feeling that I'd just watched 15 minutes of an okay movie, and an hour and fifteen minutes of porn and senseless gore. Sadly enough, the idea of this movie was put into the wrong hands. A little less than halfway through, my friend turned to me and said, ""Maybe I picked up the wrong movie..."" to which I replied, ""Yeah, I think you got Eurotrip by accident."" I am baffled as to why they decided to write the first half like they did. I guess I was hoping for something deeper. Don't watch this expecting anything special, be ready for lots of nudity and lots of incredibly disturbing gore mixed randomly, the two not even seeming to fit like they would in a slasher flick."
"stiff5","6","41","63","15 October 2007"," Physiological Scares
","Recently I picked up Hostel at my local movie store and decided to give it a try. I finished watching it and had very mixed feelings. First off, this film is not nearly as gory and disgusting as advertised. It is although, very graphic, and NOT for the squeamish, I just expected more out of it. The pop-up scares aren't effective and the first half of the movie is all soft-core porn. So what makes this movie a decent horror movie? The physiological scares. That is what got to me. The overwhelming feeling of being tied and up and tortured to death. Having no escape. For that was very effective and stomach curdling. The sex and nudity was all not needed, but for people looking for that kind of stuff, it's all here. The acting was pretty good. No bad performances. Hostel is a kind of movie where you'll either love it or hate it. But overall, an OK horror film. Not my favorite, but not terrible."

","I'm not sure if this is a spoiler, so I figured I should do that to be safe.<br/><br/>First of all, I didn't see this movie voluntarily. That being said, it was even stupider than I expected. Probably the worst thing I have ever seen or could even contemplate seeing. The characters were lame(I couldn't bring myself to feel any sympathy for them), the story line sucked(mostly because the story was ""see porn! meet creepy people! see more porn! watch people get their limbs hacked off by psychopaths for fun! escape! REVENGE REVENGE REVENGE!!""), the gore was over-the-top and completely sickening. I alternated between wanting to throw up and just wanting to cry, not because it was sad, or you felt extremely sorry for these poor people who were being mutilated to the tune of $25,000, but because I couldn't imagine any sane, semi-rational human being enjoying this movie.<br/><br/>I want my $7.50 back.

"GloriaT","1","72","120","13 January 2006"," Europe as a sick playground
","The premise of Ira Roth's ""Hostel"" is the European vacation of two All-American college boys, whom we meet in Amsterdam, where they get high but not happy. Paxton (Jay Hernandez), is a law school grad with no qualms about paying for whatever the market offers, which in Amsterdam covers a lot. He tries to cheer up his friend Josh (Derek Richardson), an aspiring author, by telling him that ""life experience"" is grist for the writer's mill. Josh wants badly to hook up with exotic women, but his sensibilities won't permit him to patronize the world's oldest profession, unlike his coarser compadre. His frustration fuels the ""ugly American"" ethos of entitlement that he brings to the party, and hamstrings his chick cruising moves.<br/><br/>Enter Alex, who gives the Americans, and an Icelandic traveling companion, one of those tips that must be urban legend by now: a hostel full of loose ladies that's not on any map, in a country squirming with lonely beautiful women, in love with the American accent. Our pleasure seekers don't care if Alex is a pimp, and they certainly don't suspect whom he's pimping out. They leave for Bratislava, in a Slovakia which, according to Alex, is bereft of men because of ""the war."" Just exactly which war, is something our boys might well have asked, before crossing a continent in search of hot babes. As it is, Roth disembarks them at Poricany, a town in the middle of the Czech Republic, near Prague not Bratislava, where our college educated youth fall victim to their own blinkered view of the world. Seeking frivolity in cold-blooded foreign streets, they end up being exploited to an unimaginable extreme and on a level that is unbelievable even in today's real world of sex tourism, pirates and child predators.<br/><br/>The mentality that wrongful deeds committed in another land somehow don't count, can flow from the mindset, common among some Americans, that other countries do not deserve equal status with our own. The ""what happens in Bratislava, stays in Bratislava"" view of the world is at the heart of the horror here, and to its credit, the film shows this to be a Weltanschauung shared by rogues from a number of nations.<br/><br/>Today, with our leaders supporting the spread of freedom and democracy throughout the world, the hedonistic abuse represented by sex tourism is downright un-American. Paxton doesn't care about anything except making memories to sustain him through the upcoming busy months of cramming for the bar exam. Perhaps the global perception that such selfish attitudes are especially emblematic of Americans is why, in ""Hostel,"" the disturbed torturers pay more to vivisect bearers of our passport than any other group on the albeit limited menu.<br/><br/>When the boys finally enter the hostel midway through the film, a small TV in the lobby is showing an overdubbed version of ""Hostel"" producer Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction."" The claustrophobic tension in that film added excruciating horror to the anticipated violence. In ""Hostel,"" much of the violence is so non sequitur that you never quite believe in these silly butchers or their patient cadre of chauffeurs. The upshot is much less horror, more disgust and, one can only hope, no arousal.<br/><br/>When a victim does cry out ""Why?"" he might be speaking for the audience: Why make this movie? And when the pay-as-you-torture psychos pause to bare their souls to bound and bleeding victims, these scenes visit real torture upon moviegoers in the painful forms of pathetic acting and pitiful dialog.<br/><br/>Here, sadists have ceded their place to wealthy psychopaths, especially German-speaking men, who pay to ""get their medieval freak on,"" that is, if one can get medieval, by definition, with a chainsaw or acetylene torch. During an uninspired escape attempt sequence, Paxton is cornered by an American businessman (Rick Hoffman), whose years of global sex tourism have left him unsatisfied and obviously insane. He is now ready to graduate to torture and murder for his sexual gratification.<br/><br/>Perhaps there is an audience of Americans willing to exchange their ignorance of Europe for the misshapen image that risks becoming the pop culture residue of this movie: a Sybaris for bored backpackers, where women resemble lingerie models, preschoolers gang bang mercilessly, and where the occasional ex-Nazi still hobbles about his same unspeakable errands, more circumspect in his depravity than forty-odd years ago.<br/><br/>To judge by ""Hostel,"" there is certainly a surfeit of silicone in Slovakia. We are shown plenty of gratuitous female nudity, but only between rounds of bloodletting: Tarantino carefully segregates titillation from torture.<br/><br/>Dressed in the anonymous business suit and tie preferred by the weekend torturers, Paxton attempts to practice a bit of ""Old Testament Law,"" before returning to civilization secure in the knowledge that he can ""out-Herod Herod."" Throughout this film ""Josh"" never quite appreciates the jokes; while ""Pax"" never finds the peace that comes from exorcising one's own demons---he just cuts his vacation short, so to speak.<br/><br/>In the final credits, thanks are given to, among others, Chloe and Major League Baseball! These entities deserve harsh censure if they paid for product placement. One star, hacked to bits."

","My English is not very good (and i'm sorry for that), but this ''movie''is one of the stupidest I ever seen! Low budget movie with stupid, simple and awful story about 3 guys going to Bratislava (capital of Slovakia) to have some fun with slovak horny girls and they get killed by unearthly brutal people of small country Slovakia. This movie shows Slovakia like some kind of backward, poor and dirty country. If you know Slovakia, you know that this movie was filming in Czech Republic(there is a lot of signs with czech language on it, also the language they speak is czech), which is lovely country with beautiful history. You can see kids robbing these guys on the street by daylight!?What is that? This is not Kosovo, Afganistan or Iraq. They are not in the war or something. You should check some websites about this. Everybody who knows something about Eastern Europe, and saw this movie, know that this is degradation of this two countries and the producer Eli Roth is moron!!! It is a shame, that they earn money on this lame, full of lies rude stupidity!"
"mockdonkey","1","70","118","16 April 2006"," Hostel is hands down the worst movie of 2005!
","This movie is just plain awful. The violence, sex, and language is gratuitous. The characters are flat, the story banal, the acting stiff, the music contrived, and to top this all off, it's one of the most shallow movie I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Creative writing professor Jack Harrel, in his essay ""What Violence in Literature Must Teach Us,"" defines violence as gratuitous when it is ""free, unearned, or unjustified.""According to Harrell, for violence to be warranted in a piece (whether or not it's in the horror genre), we must care for the characters, the violence must occur for a reason, and the violence must come at some cost.<br/><br/>Hostel meets none of these guidelines. First of all, the main characters are unworthy of any of our sympathy. Backpacking through Europe, the three, all male main characters' main interest throughout the film is getting laid and smoking pot. That's their entire motivation. Isn't the feeling of horror generated from the viewer worrying about a character getting hurt or killed? How is this suspenseful feeling supposed to happen when the characters are constantly saying crude things like ""you're so gay"" and ""pu**y"" and taking pictures on their phone of their sexual exploits in a bar bathroom stall, and screaming when a male character puts his hand on their leg? The only thing this does for me is offend. <br/><br/>Why does the violence occur? Apparently for a fee one can have the thrill of killing someone in whatever means they wish. Unfortunately this has absolutely nothing to do with the ""story"" (I use this term *very* loosely here). All of a sudden the main characters start disappearing from the ""story"" and start entering some kind of green lit ""killing room"" where they get tortured to death by some demonic person who has a short cameo earlier in the film. This is not a reason. When we find out later how this killing is sort of like an attraction for rich adrenalin junkies, the only thing one can possibly feel is apathy. Apathy for the story. All *this* just for *that*!!!<br/><br/>What cost does the violence come at in Hostel? None. The people who get killed are worthless to us and the people who are doing the killing are worthless to us. We care not when some of the people who are doing the killing get killed because we are not sure if they are the ones in charge. There is absolutely no moral bone to chew on here. <br/><br/>Lastly I'd like to talk about one thing in particular that really upset me about this film. Towards the end of Hostel a woman kills herself after looking at the reflection of her newly disfigured face. This is probably the most gratuitous and shallow point of the movie. It's also supposed to be its most dramatic point. First of all this character is only known to us as an Asain women who's friend also goes missing and doesn't want to party. That's it. When the main character rescues her from the hands of the killer due to her screaming, which reminds him of when he let a little boy drown a few years ago, we are surprised to find her in the ""green killing room"".

The only reason that I went to see this movie is because I respect Quentin Tarantino's work in other movies, and just because his name was on this one, I caved. Some of the scenes were so STUPID that I found myself laughing at the screen. One scene containing bloody floor and a chainsaw to a leg was purely comical. Another scene where a one-eyed Asian girl jumps in front of a train after viewing her deformed face had me crying. The large amounts of nudity were also not needed and only added to the lack of morality in this film. I would not see this movie ever again and I would encourage others to do the same."

I walked out of the theater asking, ""What was the point of all that?"" And while this is described as horror, it really should be classified as thriller. There was no explanation or clever twist at the end. Just the end. I'm sure that it will attract an enthusiastic audience of young adults, but the evisceration by the critics will stem any hopes of huge box office.<br/><br/>If your expectations are low enough, and your tastes in gore sufficiently robust, then you are in for a good time.

","I am not a big ""gore"" fan but I love a tense horror movie in which the director creates vivid images in your mind. This movie has both. I was a little surprised how good the story was and how good the actors (all of which were pretty much no-names)were. There is a scene by one of the lead male actors which will stay in your head well after the movie. I watched it at the TIFF at the 12:45pm show and I was at the edge of my seat. The plot was well-developed although I thought that the Director shouldn't have revealed the protagonist as early as he did in the movie and could have developed his reasons for doing what he did more fully. The ending was very good, but didn't hold up to the suspense and action immediately preceding it - the Director said he had a few other endings but felt screened audiences didn't like the other alternatives. In any event, I actually found myself turning away twice in the movie (I never do). There is some major disturbing stuff in this movie and Roth achieved his objective of making the scariest, sickest movie I have seen. What I did like was although the stuff was sick, it was actually plausible - that's the scary part. Sort of like what Friedkin did with the Excorcist - the scary part was that it made you think this crap was possible. Highly recommend this for the gore/horror fans, but I have a feeling that the studio distributor will demand cuts to the film. If it does get cut significantly, I am not sure if you will feel the same impact, but I guess time will tell. Roth mentions it will gain wide theatrical release around November."

The first 20 mins are just full of titties titties titties and yes, there are plenty of homophobic remarks that make us (or at least me) not so supportive our alleged heroes. but after the titties, the real fun begins. --SPOILER -- The torture scenes are graphic, but not as bad as I thought they'd be - they aren't relentless and overdone, but have just the right piquant tastes of grotesque and terror. The scene with the kid pleading for his life in German was very effective - thought maybe i should pick up some German for situations like these. as for the other commentators complaining that the characters were jerks - that's actually part of what makes this movie so good - Usually it's the nice, earnest, innocent hero/heroine goes through hell but always makes it out alive - being rewarded by fate or god or whatever for being good. but here the nice(st) fellow of the three bites it, in a bad way, leaving us to think we've got no one to root for. left with the jackass, we're forced us shift our alligence to a less likable hero - that is unless you're rooting for the torturers. Nice twist really. --SPOILER -- What really did it for me and probably why i give this movie such a high rating are the revenge scenes. In most movies, our beleaguered hero/heroine escapes, we have the one last scare and the hero/heroine kills the bad thing and then we all go home. But we all kinda feel hollow, like the bad thing's death just wasn't enough to make up for all the crap our hero/heroine had to go through. Here, in Hostel- the last 10 mins outta nowhere change from horror into a revenge film and it's quite satisfying, like a big ole bacon cheeseburger. Everyone that brought our characters to their lowly states gets it and gets it good. I wish I had a pack of wild orphaned gypsy children to do my bidding for bubble gum."

","I was one of those people that hated everything about Cabin Fever. I wasn't anticipating Eli Roth's next film, but when I heard the Internet buzz around Hostel, and found it was showing at the 2005 TIFF (Toronto International Film Festival), I decided to check it out.<br/><br/>Eli Roth, who was at the screening, mentioned to the audience that this was the first public viewing in North America. He also told us what we were about to see was a work in progress print of the film. What I saw was one hell of a fierce horror flick that works on every level.<br/><br/>All the actors do a great job in this flick. I was especially impressed with Jay Hernandez, and Derek Richardson, two relatively unknown actors. There are a lot of funny scenes, and dialog in the early parts of the film. It's not that slapstick, forced stuff that was so prevalent in Cabin Fever. There also lots of nudity in the early parts in the film as well. When things begin to turn towards horror, you truly feel the sense of terror the characters are going through. The build up to the climax is just done so well. I loved the fact the story is very believable.<br/><br/>Make no mistake about it, this is a violent, sick, and gory flick. It's not for the squeamish. I haven't seen this type of extreme violence in a North America mainstream cinema. The Takashi Miike, and Asian Cinema influences are clearly seen here.<br/><br/>This is a film that will shock people, and remain in there heads well after the film is over. It will be interesting to see how the film is edited, and rated. In it's current state, I don't see how it could get anything less than the dreaded NC-17 rating. I just hope that it's not butchered too much, as the audience deserves to see the film how it was intended. Eli Roth has completely redeemed himself for what I thought was a very poor film in Cabin Fever, and has made one kick-ass horror film."
"mjk280","2","33","55","18 January 2006"," No Plot + Forced Gore=Bad Movie
","If you watch a lot of movies, you see mostly bad ones. That's the realization I have come to at least. If you give your brain a little bit of credit I would say you would be lucky to enjoy 6 out of 10 movies that come out. I know that going into the experience by now. A lot of movies are just bad and that's okay, but some of them are bad AND they insult my intelligence. This is where I get angry and frustrated at Hollywood.<br/><br/>Before this movie was made I can just picture a bunch of Hollywood executives sitting around a long, oval-shaped table saying ""Hey, everyone liked those 'Saw' movies so let's whip up something similar, and as quickly as possible regardless of quality!"" I mean seriously the lack of plot in this movie is uncanny. The first 45 minutes or so is totally pointless and is more akin to the movie Eurotrip than anything that would be considered scary (there's about 10-15 boob shots for every interesting part in this movie, if that). Then when the movie gets to the subject matter that was advertised, we're subjected to a few ""gross you out just because"" parts. When the only surviving main character predictably escapes he coincidentally bumps into everyone involved in the setup so we can all feel better now that the good guys have been somewhat redeemed.<br/><br/>It's one thing for a movie to simply be bad. Everyone has their opinion. But when a movie with no plot is injected with a few gross-out scenes just to make it more like a successful movie of its kind it gets to the point of the viewer being insulted. Every event has to MEAN something to the plot but when you don't have a plot that creates a problem. In this movie you have characters running around Europe trying to get laid for half the movie and then the rest of it is a shameless imitation of 'Saw' but without any resemblance of a storyline. Do NOT go see this movie, unless you are the type that sees a couple gory scenes and comes out of the movie saying ""That was so cool!"" If you are, god bless you, but I like my movies to have a point."
"car-24","9","179","347","20 December 2005"," State of the art in intense horror
","As a rule, I find horror films a little tiresome, but Hostel starts with a great premise and slowly builds up to some outrageous horror. The film tips its hat to some of the classics, and there's even a delightful cameo of Pulp Fiction playing in the background. It's not good that the premise of the movie is revealed in the IMDb listing as you don't learn the truth until near the end of the movie and it all starts to make a lot more sense. One thing about horror films which has always bugged me is that the bad guys never seem real to me, as if they are some kind of limitless satanic evil or whatever. In Hostel, by contrast, we really believe that the scenario is very plausible and for that, all the more frightening. I wouldn't be surprised at all if this kind of thing goes on in certain parts of the world. As far as maximum creep value, I saw it in a packed house at a screening in Beverly Hills last night, and many in the audience couldn't take it and ran out -- one guy was retching in the bathroom and was too scared to leave! The organizer had to talk him down and call one of his friends to take him home. The director was there for a Q&A which will be on the Creative Screen writing Magazine podcast, and he said that at one test screening they had to call a ambulances for two different people. It appears that the explicit sex, torture and violence will not be toned down for the theatrical release and it will still have an R rating instead of NC-17 which most of us thought it deserved. The trick, is that there is no sex during the violent scenes, and no violence in the sex scenes, which makes the MPAA more comfortable. By the way, this was shot near Prague, and is amazingly beautiful to look at -- I was there a month ago and the place is like something out of a fairy tale (unlike most historic European areas, there isn't a McDonalds every hundred feet). The ending is very, very satisfying yet believable and unforced. The audience was screaming, gasping, cheering, and hiding their faces at all the right moments. Eli's interview was a hoot, also, so check out the podcast once they post it on itunes. It's worth it for no other reason than to hear his anti-Union rant!"

It wasn't as violent as Saw, it wasn't as tense as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, and it's filled with more ridiculous horror clichés than I could list in 1,000 words on IMDb. To have a preview that warns squeamish people with bad hearts to stay away from the theaters, there were a lot of people in my theater LAUGHING. Throughout the entire film.

","Hostel is one of the reasons why horror is becoming a genre of shock value and losing it's creative side. Eli Roth creates a cheap show of nudity, blood, and bland, cliché humor. He definitely purchased the book of typical story lines and merged them all together. How many times have we seen the story of three 20-something-year-olds and the crazy things they do? One should know better if they saw Roth's horrible slop of a film,""Cabin Fever.""<br/><br/>The major problem with this film was the false advertisement. The ads and previews showed this movie to be a promising horror-thriller with depth and originality. They even flashed ""Quentin Tarantino!!"" four or five times to ensure the viewer that this was quality. It wasn't. It did not even come close. The producers and distributors of the movie knew that with a good preview and a good name, people would flock to the theaters. This film is the reason why the box office continues to slump. Cheap and cheesy. You are looking for steak and Eli Roth throws down a raw hamburger.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie has gore. And sex. But with what was given, even those could not keep me remotely interested. Honestly, it isn't very hard to find an waitress/actress who will take her clothes off in a movie and a few prosthetic limbs.

Young males who are horny find beautiful females and then are punished in a horrible way. This is as old as the oldest horror movie. Watch any Simpsons episode where a character goes to a scary movie. The director has said he made the movie to make us think about where society is going in terms of pornography. Bullshit. He made it for the money. The vast majority of characters killed in movies are male. And in most of these, the victim can somehow be blamed, allowing us in the audience to say, ""Well, I would never go that far, so it couldn't happen to me."" The reality is, young children are often the victims of forced prostitution, torture, and murder. In the movie, wealthy people pay to torture and kill. What of those who see the movie and are not wealthy? Would any of us be comfortable watching small children be tortured and killed? What if they reminded us of our own children or young siblings? Would that be a lot of fun? Yet we all know that evil people start out with vulnerable people and move up to young males, if they ever do move up. Their favorite victims are children, then young women, then men, because this is the easiest order to get control over. Movies like this only propagate the idea that those who suffer are guilty. Innocent people in the world suffer just as much as, and often more than, guilty people."

Hell has to literally open up around them, before they take notice. Part horror / cautionary tale, part sadistic blast of jet-black humor, and part social / political commentary, Roth builds the story slowly, revealing the truth in one big, shocking switch.

The idea is that they should get laid as much as possible in order to have 'experiences' they can bring back home with them and perhaps even into their old age. This makes them prime targets for a hellish turn of events especially given their nationality as Americans. The movie is trying to tell us that sex just doesn't cut it anymore for thrills. Women are basically the same everywhere you go and getting laid is overrated. Some people need something more to feel alive. They need an adrenalin rush that can only be attained through an unspeakable act. This movie is not for god-believers or the faint of heart.

"boy_in_red","7","5","6","23 August 2006"," Interesting take on the old ""off the beaten track"" horror film
","Eli Roth enjoys his homophobia- it was there in Cabin Fever too. You can have a character bleating on about being a human who doesn't eat dead things, but he's not afraid to throw out the odd ""faggot"" I swear it's like the return of 80s machismo, except no one really missed it. And it's a shame because it's a distraction. More than that, it makes his characters pretty difficult to feel for. I guess he makes up for it by implying Josh, one of the more likable of the 3 main protagonists, could well be gay himself. It adds a dimension to the homophobia that was lacking in Cabin Fever- though Roth really doesn't follow through beyond vague implication.<br/><br/>The film is effective in building tension and is for the most part engrossing. But it really is nothing new, and certainly not worthy of the hype. Yes it's gory, but the gore is for the most part cartoony in nature. Dismembered body parts aplenty, but these don't guarantee fear or tension and perhaps for this reason I honestly didn't find it too disturbing. Besides, lets face it, we've seen it all before in Saw.<br/><br/>But if you want to spend a couple of hours enjoying a slightly America-centric (bad eastern europeans will do anything for money, unlike wholesome vegetarian American backpackers who just want to get laid and see the world), take on the old theme of ""in danger and off the beaten track"" film it's a worthy choice."

The ending makes no sense at all, we never get any idea of the motivations behind the killers, and the main killer is as scary as Clay Aiken. And how can you run a business about torturing people, hire seemingly dozens of henchmen and skanks to lure tourists, and no one find out about it? Even with the one scene showing that the cops are somehow involved wasn't enough for me to believe that NO ONE WOULD MENTION AT SOME POINT THE FACT THAT THERE WERE DOZENS OF PEOPLE BEING KILLED AND TORTURED. What kind of idiot would have a business like that and have this many people involved in it?

","""Sick, twisted, disgusting and absolutely brilliant"" reads the review blurb on the back of the HOSTEL DVD. While it may sound sensational, particularly for horror flick with a budget under $5 million, every word rings true.<br/><br/>HOSTEL begins by introducing us to three pals, Paxton, Josh and Oli (Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson respectively), on a backpacking journey through Europe of sex, drugs and partying. Horny as can be, they take a newfound friend's advice to check out a Slovakian city that promises to fulfill all their desires for intimate, no-strings attached relations. But once they get settled in, Oli inexplicably disappears, soon followed by Josh. That leaves Paxton to unravel the brutal truth behind this mystery.<br/><br/>HOSTEL is impossible to sufficiently describe to someone who hasn't seen it. It's not because it's so good (though it is pretty good), but because it's such a creative, unusual film experience. Indeed nothing quite like this has ever been done before, at least not this superbly. The film is heavy on the blood and guts, but the blood and guts are entertaining and actually contribute to the film in a this-will-gross-you-out sort of way. HOSTEL is many things, but it's not guilty of gore for the sake of gore.<br/><br/>The direction and acting represent another high point of HOSTEL. The picture is oozing with fresh talent from most every orifice (a fitting way to put it). Young director Eli Roth keeps things running at an efficient pace and gets the most out of what is a fairly basic storyline. It's fair to say he is unrelenting and seems intent in asking the audience how much they can take, but this approach works amazingly well in the film's favor. As for the performers, they are all no-names, but they rank as one of the most talented no-name horror casts in memory. Hernandez is worth singling out, as he has the believability, subtlety and charm needed to carry the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, many have dismissed HOSTEL as another mindless gorefest. That's really too bad, because beneath the decapitated heads and leaking eye sockets lurks a truly original, entertaining piece of work. This one is destined for culthood."

Here we have both Americans and Europeans performing social stereotypes that have been culturally determined for centuries: hunting and fu*king and buying immunity. If you can't handle that, or find it ugly, then maybe you don't want to watch ""horror"" movies. The horror in this film is all human, emanating from within -- there's no supercosmos or grand inquisitor. It's about people who have forgotten that they are human (hyper-alienated), and at least Roth has the good grace to take this on in a loving and spirited manner. I say again, this film is way more subversive (and technically beautiful) than it's being given credit for."

","This movie is to good to be true! It's story is surprisingly original,and from the start brings weird atmosphere that changes from the first 20 Min's to make it even scarier.The porn scenes at the beginning are not over the top,i think it is very realistic, everything put there,from the language they use,like using the f word more then anything,to their hot rod attitude and obsession of having sex with a hot euro chick. I mean,they are from America,OK Oli's from Iceland,but his point there was to lead them to hot-ties.Since Paxton and Josh are from far away,they came to have fun,and they got so excited when they heard about the gorgeous women in Slovakia that they lost their heads over them...some of them really lost their heads. The atmosphere is great as well as the Slovakian pop music that brings the characters in a scary situation for me... ...it kinda indicates they are far from home... I give a full 10 to this movie,cause it really deserves it! The effects and gore are great,and the acting is unreal. Those guys,especially Dereck Richardson ( Josh ),is more natural than i expected and actor to be for this kind of movie. It is to good! THUMBS UP FOR ELI ROTH!"

","I'd thought I'd seen the worst after open water but Hostel wins that honor hands (or stumps) down.<br/><br/>I bought this turkey after browsing the blurbs and pics on the back of the case.

It will not become a part of my collection -- ever.<br/><br/>There is no plot. Nothing believable. No chance for a thriller. Nothing to hold you engulfed in the moment along with the characters. Law enforcement would shut down an operation (no pun intended) where kids from wealthy (or not) families just disappear wholesale in big bleeding batches. No care is taken in the selection of the unfortunates, anyone is fair game. The only requirement is that you be mindlessly horny (never question why the perfect 10 has to have you) and extremely naive so much so that it goes beyond belief.

"dals-2","1","22","38","26 March 2006"," The Great Depression
","You're probably wondering why have I named this review so. The answer is simple:I was in a state of excruciating pain and overwhelming depression after watching this movie. I had SUCH high hopes: ""Finally, a horror film that would bring the genre to its star-spangled beginnings,the era of The Excorsist, Haloween,especially Texas Chainsaw Massacre(NOT the watered-down,awfully directed and an overall piece of donkey-droppings that is the re-make),Cannibal Holocaust,even Evil Dead. Quentin Tarantino? Whoa,this must be something BIG! Man-hunting and rich homicidal maniacs wasting not-so innocent teenage American lives (actually,Eli Roth took the theme after reading about a similar blood-sport occurring in Malasya or Cambodia-I'm not sure-about poor men with families who got a thousand dollars for enacting deer and running in front of wealty,bloodthirsty men who came after them with rifles and machetes.The money would be given to their families of course)The gruesomest film EVER? I have to see this!"" These were just some of the thoughts roaming through my mind at random after I've seen the preview article in a newspaper.<br/><br/>And yet (surprise,surprise!),Hostel was the biggest celluloid disappointment this year for me. Strike that,the biggest disappointment in the last few years would be more accurate.<br/><br/>Reasons? The real question here is: Do you really want to bare with me and hear them all? Where are my manners,of course not. I'll try to reduce this buttload of faults the film has to just a few pointers:<br/><br/>1. The film is too long (or was it so dull and pointless that time just stopped only to keep me in further agony). This normally isn't a real obstacle for me,but for this topic and genre,it's way too overstretched. ESPECIALLY the first half. Absolutely nothing happens (unless,you've never seen a typical Hollywood-teenie movie with lots of cursing,bare, epilepsy-causing breasts,oiled chicks with bad broken-English and American college boys-OK,there's this really stoned Icelandic bloke-filling their lungs with every single hallucinogen they stumble upon) for at least 45 minutes,and believe me,the remaining half ain't a feat for the eyes and the mind either.<br/><br/>2. The first half of the movie was actually THE BEST PART (if one can call it that)!At least there was nudity and semi-funny punchlines in abundance.Although it was a brain-washing,comatose-like experience.<br/><br/>3.The setting. Don't get me wrong,placing the setting into a Slovakian ghost-town was a great idea,I just have serious issues with how it was reallied. The movie shows the residents of an ex-communist country in such a manner that made me physically sick (I'm from Croatia,another ex-communist country). Roth showed those people to be demented, desperate,at the brink of famine and extreme poverty,doing anything in order to survive (Pillaging, murder,prostitution,extortion,children in gangs willing to kill for a bubble-gum). That IS NOT the case there. Actually, Slovakia is a calm,conservative country much like its neighbors,the Chech Republic,Austria and Germany. Even though it's not the wealthiest,it's economy is growing at a fast pace,and unemployment is not that much of an issue there. I can't stand seeing American ignorants patronizing and bullying anyone with a smaller national budget. Eli Roth is,much to my regret,one of those American no-brains.<br/><br/>4.The second half of the film(in other words,the one that made me cry with despair and curse at innocent grannies on my way from the movie-theater). Let's get some things cleared up: Gruesome? Frightening? Not a SINGLE shot in the movie is gruesome or scary(except a shot of a pair of ill-made,Baywatch shiny breasts).If you want to see something really scary,look me up in the morning-not THAT'S gruesome. Tense? I've seen chess games between a 95-year-old man and a bag of chips that was more tense and unexpected. Wait,there was this one twist that surprised me:the confused nerd who doesn't want to get laid is the first one who bites the chainsaw. Bloody? Sure there's blood and cut-off limbs,but it's more bloody boring than just bloody. Some really poor direction there.<br/><br/>5.Quentin Tarantino. Where was he when they made this film? He certainly wasn't on the sets. He's neatly credited and all,and that's just swell,but if I was Quentin,I wouldn't credit myself in this film. I'd be ashamed,very ashamed.<br/><br/>All in all,what is there to say? I'm disappointed,and I think I'll never watch antoher Eli Roth movie again. Oh well,I guess everyone deserves a second chance. And it should better be well-used. If you really want to see a Roth movie,I+d rather suggest Cabin Fever. No masterpiece,but it's witty and bloody,even somewhat original(a flesh-eating virus kills off sexually frustrated teens in a desolated shack) As for Hostel,I'll leave the decision of watching it to you. The only people I'd recommend it to are bulimic models: you get a neat throw-up bag before the film.<br/><br/>The rest of you won't need it,unless you're 45 and have a midlife crisis that makes your testicles swell every time you see nudity-then you can use the bag to support the burden in your groin."

","Hi. I am from Slovakia. Sorry for my English. First I want to say that in the film there is not anything from the Slovakia. It was filmed in Czech. Bratislava is small but nice with many things to see. O.K. There are some dirty corners, but which town hasn't? My opinion is, this is very bad film. But not because it considers Slovakia as the forgotten place but I think it is bad movie at all. The plot is about nothing. I had feeling, that first half of movie is only the beginning. And nota bene I wasn't afraid a second. I hope American tourists will not be afraid of the visit our country. Here isn't war or some cannibals or something. Here lives very generous people. I like Tarantino's film, but I think this is the worst. At least Narnia was better. So don't judge Slovakia by this movie."

","There is absolutely no end in sight for the amount of ridicule this film can bring upon itself. The fact that this film was actually given the green light to go into production says a lot about Lions Gate Films and everybody involved in it. Apparently, nobody saw ""Cabin Fever"" before they let deuchebag Eli Roth spend millions of dollars on this pathetic, unremarkable trip into nothingness. First of all, the script was insanely bad. I read the user review titled ""Excellent puke"" and wanted to thrust my face into a toilet. How stupid can you possibly be? How much bad taste can one have? There are truly NO twists in this movie. The only plot lines that can be related to each other, really, is the story that wonderful, should-be-nominated-for-best-actor Jay Hernandez recounts to his friend that, later on, more light will be shed on (no more information since it may spoil the film for some risking their hour's pay to go see it.) The acting is horrendous. THe script is terrible. The story is non-existent. The direction is horrible. Enjoy"

At times it was almost laughable. The first 45 minutes or so of sex & nudity was so drawn out it got boring. It makes you wish the characters would just go ahead & get killed. About the only good thing I can say is, the acting was decent. Thank god I didn't have to pay to see it, due to a free pass.

Unfortunately, they threw in 2 things that really get young males going: Naked women and blood. I don't mind a bit of either in a movie, if there is a point.

And once the humor dies off (Which'll be when you least expect it), you better hold on for dear life because this movie gets wild!

"oso_travis","8","6","8","16 September 2006"," The very nature of slasher films: Paying for watching someone get killed (or tortured).
","Eli Roth is a genius, and Hostel is a twisted, sick, depraved masterpiece.<br/><br/>I was one of the few that had high expectations when I went to see Cabin Fever in theaters. Boy, was I disappointed. I still thought back then that Eli Roth was a promising guy even if his first film wasn't that accomplished.<br/><br/>Let's say that for that matter, my expectations were kind of ""neutral"" when I went to see ""Hostel"", but I was anxious to see it anyway. During the first 10 or 15 minutes I was thinking ""hey! I guess Roth sold himself after all"". More wrong couldn't I be.<br/><br/>What I found was one of the sickest, darkest and above all, most intense films I've seen in my life. I found out that Roth didn't want MTVish flashy editing cuts, and after seeing this film a total number of 7 times (5 times at theaters, and 2 times at my home theater, and still going up) I see that is true, and works perfectly for the story. Roth wanted the film to have a classic (and classy for that matter) feeling to it and he succeed in every single aspect of it. The editing is just invisible and discreet, the photography is stunningly gorgeous, and the music score is one of the finest and most memorable I've listened to in a long time; there is no need for filling up the soundtrack with your one-hit-wonder of choice.<br/><br/>Kudos to Roth for making one of the best screenplays in recent years. The dialogues feel so natural and real, with every situation grounded in some logic. His directing skills are brilliant too. There is no a single frame or scene that is a waste. Every single shot, every single frame is as beautiful as it can be. And in a horror film that makes the whole thing more disturbing.<br/><br/>What I found more remarkable about this film, it is the amount of intelligent ideas that float around like subtexts, consciously OR unconsciously. One of the most clever ideas is why we like to see horror films: because we like to see people being tortured, chopped, or beaten to death and that is true. As the Dutch Businessman would say, that is part of human nature. We, horror films fans, PAY for watching someone going through gruesome suffering and we don't pay once, we do it twice, thrice, or more, just to feel that adrenaline rush the American Client talks of.<br/><br/>-Some Spoilers-<br/><br/>It is amazing how we come to ""rationalize"" the deaths to suit our beliefs, attitudes and fears. We feel bad for Josh, Kana, Oli, and Yuki, but the audience was clapping and cheering when Natalya, Svetlana, and Alex get rolled over by two cars, when the chasers get beaten to death by the Bubble Gum Gang, and when Pax finally gets his revenge at the Dutch Businessman, in the gentlemen restroom.<br/><br/>-End of Some Spoilers-<br/><br/>I guess it is just part of human nature. Revenge is in our genes. See the trashy state of the world for that matter.<br/><br/>***1/2 And #02 of my Top Ten of 2006 (just behind Love Me If You Dare).<br/><br/>Note: Though I'm certain that Roth and Hernandez won't get any Oscars nods (even if they deserved them for their marvelous work behind (Best Director) and in front of camera (Best Actor in a Leading Role), there are other things that need to be taken ""For Your Consideration"". Editing, by George Folsey, Jr., the beautiful score composed by Nathan Barr, and the gorgeous cinematography by Milan Chadime are such a fine work that deserved some nominations. But they won't get them. Roth's attitude towards American film unions (that could be resume in a big Screw You!) won't let them get the recognition they truly deserve.<br/><br/>8/10"
"JimD73","8","13","21","19 August 2006"," Hostel is the movie Saw wanted to be
","What is it with horror movies these days that believe that simply throwing buckets of cheap gore on a body equals scary? Cringing doesn't necessarily mean fear if it is ridiculous enough to be unbelievable. Movies like Saw have come close, but still never really achieve true fear. Hostel is the latest attempt at the gore flick, and for what it's worth, it is the movie that Saw wanted to be.<br/><br/>The basic plot of Hostel takes quite a while to actually get into. Two friends, Paxton (Hernandez) and Josh (Richardson), are backpacking across Europe with Icelandic hitchhiker Oli (Gudjonsson) in search of drugs and girls. The first forty minutes or so is mainly one sex scene or nudity shot after another, with some smoking pot in between. They get a tip from a man in Amsterdam about a hostel (basically a hotel) in Slovakia that has some of the best girls on the planet, and the threesome head out to Slovakia. While they do find girls, they become trapped in a sick nightmare to satisfy the bloodlust of a group called the Elite Hunters, who torture and kill for fun.<br/><br/>Of course, the torture scenes are meant to be the scariest. However, this isn't the case. It is not the physical act of torture that is necessarily scary. Sure, it is nice and gory, but it really isn't anything we haven't seen before. What is truly scary is that the movie seems as if it could actually be real. We all know there are true sickos out there who would pay for the ability to take a life in whatever way they deem fit. It has a degree of reasonable disbelief that makes the scenario believable, even if some events in the mandatory escape are a tad coincidental.<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, the fact that people watch movies like this in the first place is proof that the urge to kill is present in all of us. There is an inborn bloodlust that begs to be able to take life, much the same as a sexual urge. The sexual urge and bloodlust are even compared in the movie in a great scene where an escaping hostage idly chats with one of the butchers (Hoffman). The movie strikes a nerve deep inside, which is much more powerful than a couple of gore shots could ever be.<br/><br/>Not that you have to look at the psychology behind the movie to enjoy it (I don't even know if the psychology was intentional). If you are the type of person who likes movies that rely on pure gore to unnerve you, Hostel definitely has what you need. The torture scenes are incredibly gory, especially one part where an eye is cut out. There is also the always painful tendon cut, chainsaw accident and drill insertion. Hostel doesn't necessarily break new ground in terms of gore, but it does rank fairly highly.<br/><br/>Where the most effective thrills come from is the escape sequence near the end. The whole time where the survivor is trying to escape the factory is incredibly tense and bloody, with the audience never really sure if the director is actually going to let this person live. The ending does get bogged down a bit after the factory is behind the survivor, as the movie then relies heavily on coincidence and revenge, but it still remains tense, which is a feeling unfortunately missing from most horror movies.<br/><br/>The acting in the movie isn't great, but it is better than the average horror movie. Jay Hernandez doesn't come across as anything special at first, but he actually seems to pull a good performance out of his ass when it comes his turn to face the hunters. Richardson is decent enough as the most three-dimensional of the group, as is Gudjonsson as the fun-loving Oli. Vlasak is very creepy as one of the hunters who meets the group early on. Bit player Rick Hoffman has an excellent cameo as a hunter who basically reveals all about the organization.<br/><br/>While Hostel does bog itself down with a much too long opening and a slightly unbelievable ending, the meat of the movie is some of the best horror movie stuff in a while. It taps a nerve that says a lot about the human bloodlust, and is actually a comment on the film itself. Why do we see movies like Hostel? We see them because we wish to satisfy our bloodlust, and this is the closest we can get, just the same way as someone may watch a porno when they are unable to actually have sex. Even if you don't appreciate the psychology, there is plenty of gore and tension to make the movie a scary ride. Basically, Hostel is what Saw wanted to be. It is a believable nightmare, and that is something truly rare in today's horror films.<br/><br/>84%"

"bensonmum2","4","15","25","19 April 2006"," ""I don't want to drink. I want to look at art!""
","I'll skip to normal intro and jump right into this one. It's been awhile since I was this disappointed in a film. Eli Roth had an opportunity to make a classic with Hostel, but as far as I'm concerned, he failed miserably. Before I get to where Roth went wrong, I'll start with what he got right. The scenes of torture at the factory are as grueling and intense as I've seen. These scenes have an incredibly dark tone and feel to them. Many of these moments are difficult to watch. I was squirming in my seat on more than one occasion. These 30 or so minutes are top notch stuff.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's another hour of this movie that is so poorly written with so many moments that I can only describe as dumb that I did not enjoy Hostel as a whole. Let's start with the three main characters traveling around Europe looking for sex. They're about as shallow a group as you'll find. There's nothing presented about any of the three that led me to care in the least whether they lived or died. There was no emotional attachment. It was like watching a sophomoric Spring Break movie set in Europe. And when our hero goes out of his way to describe the young girl he watched die, it was so out of character (as if he had any character) that I just knew Roth was beating me in the head to set me up for something yet to come.<br/><br/>Or take the whole getaway at the end of the movie. Are we supposed to believe that our hero just happens to pick the one car with the keys in the ignition and a bag of gum and candy on the floor? Sorry, I'm not buying it. And how convenient that the three people who were responsible for luring our hero and his friend into the factory should step out in front of his getaway car. Again, Roth might be selling, but I'm not buying. Finally, our hero trades the convenient bag of candy to the gang of pint-size street thugs in exchange for their help in stopping the bad guys. Oh boy! It's one of the dumbest moments I've seen in a movie in a long time. A lot of people will look at a moment like this and see Roth's attempt to inject humor into Hostel. I'm sorry, but you can't have it both ways. Either your movie is a gruesome, gut-wrenching affair or it's a teenybopper film on the same level as Scream. A change from something like the Guinea Pig series to National Lampoon is startling, forced, and poorly handled.<br/><br/>You don't have to look very hard to find other problems with Hostel's script. For example, how does our hero manage to kill several people and drag around a girl missing part of her face without getting a noticeable and suspicious amount of blood on the perfectly fitting suit he so conveniently found? And wasn't it a great coincidence that our hero should happen to wind up on the same train with the ""main"" killer who so conveniently goes into a deserted bathroom? There are other examples, but you get the idea. It's insulting and, as I've said repeatedly, dumb.<br/><br/>Finally (I say finally because I could ramble on forever), I've got to agree with the critics of Hostel who are upset with Roth's portrayal of the Slovakian people. Yes, bad things can happen anywhere. I'm not saying that Slovakia is exempt from barbarous murder, but Roth would have us believe that most everyone in the town was complicit with what was going on. Apparently we're supposed to believe that a few dollars is all it takes to get a whole town to accept murder as their primary source of income. Wasn't there one decent person in town to speak up about what appears to have been going on for what appears to have been a considerable period of time? And don't you think the travel agents and guidebooks would steer travelers away from this town after the first couple of people went missing? As dumb as this movie is, I wonder how dumb Roth thinks his audience is."

","I did NOT enjoy watching this movie at all, but I'm not gonna say it wasn't excellent because it was. As far as gore films go, this went above and beyond. Not in the bloody aspect coz it feels like you've seen it all before, but in the way this film gets under your skin and forces you to experience the victim's fear, to the point it becomes uncomfortable. And the screams of the tortured men and women...there will be no horror movie to come that doesn't take a listen to the sounds of ""Hostel"". Like a nightmare, the pleas for mercy quickly transform into hysterical shrieks of agony; realistic sounds of pain and desperation that will upset or at the very least, unsettle any person. This movie is about human suffering and the director wants you to know it. For what he and Tarantino set out to do they did it extremely well. They created a good splatter film. A lot of people have mentioned the morals surrounding this movie, who thinks up this stuff, who would want to watch these horrible things but it seems the answer to that is most of the world. I just hope everyone who goes to see this film enjoys where their morbid curiosity leads them :D"

","One of the best horror films I've ever seen, the clever script is the backbone, and Eythor Gudjonsson is a wonderful representative of Iceland. His presence and light spirited humor, is a great asset to the film and makes a good and poetic contrast to the latter part. Now we all know what ""sneepur"" is. I'm still feeling a little sick after seeing the film, and am unable to go to sleep, both because I'm afraid I'll get one of those nightmares and the adrenalin level is too high! There are many very good twists and turns in this film and it is never foreseeable. Many solutions in the script are brilliant, to say the least. Eli Roth is doing a perfect job. I can't even remember when I saw a decent horror film. This film is like a long awaited rain (of blood) in the desert. To set the story in the murky eastern Europe is a good move, because who knows what's going on out there? For all I know there might be such a thing going on right now.

","You can say what you like about Eli Roth, but you can't say he doesn't have vision. Roth has said on numerous occasions that he wants to bring the old-school grindhouse style back to cinema, and while Hostel is no masterpiece - it's safe to say that Roth has achieved his aim. Hostel is one of the grisliest films to come out of America in years; and what it lacks in originality is made up for with in your face gratuity. I'm actually one of the few that rates Cabin Fever as both a good film and a promising debut, and it's safe to say that Roth's prowess has a director has grew in the three years since the release of his first film. It's also safe to say that he's targeted his audience well, and Hostel is sure to appeal to fans of grisly, gory horror that leaves nothing to the imagination. The simple plot follows two Americans and their Icelandic friend on a backpacking trip through Europe. We first meet them in Amsterdam where they are directed to a Slovakian hostel on the promise of beautiful and easy girls by a stoned Dutch man. Everything is going well for the trio...until they start getting killed.<br/><br/>Roth shoots on location in Europe, and this brings a great style to the film. We start off in sleazy Amsterdam, where drugs and naked girls are the order of the day. From there, we move onto a beautiful village in Slovakia, upon which Roth creates a great sense of wonder. The central location is an abandoned hospital, and this setting provides the scene for all the ghastly action once the movie turns into a horror film. Hostel is a film of two halves; we start off with a scenario that reminded me a lot of 'An American Werewolf in Paris', in that wide-eyed American tourists are seen taking in the sights of Europe. There's no horror early on, but there's lots of comedy and this allows Roth to build his characters and show the audience a good time. Once it becomes a horror film, the shocks come thick and fast and the second half of the film is very different from first; but also very good. The characters and acting are both surprisingly well done. Although they're not exactly deep, Roth's teens are easy to like and it actually is a shame once they enter the chamber of horrors. The horror scenes are more along the lines of cringe-worthy torture than any real scares; but Roth makes good of it, as mystery is created early on and then the film breaks into a thrilling climax towards the end. The ending itself is really good, and provides the perfect finale to a grotesque monster of a film. Well worth ninety minutes of your time."

This movie is a cross between soft-core porn and a horrible 70's horror movie. Its like Eurotrip gone bad. This has to be the worst movie I've seen since Frailty. I love cheesy/tribute slasher/horror films when done correctly, but this movie was painful to watch. It tauts itself as gory w/ torture throughout the film, but that was mild at best. Most scenes were cut a fraction of a second before the acts were actually committed. The gore, itself, when shown looked extremely fake in several cases. And let's just say from a logical standpoint without giving away any spoilers, some people should've gone into shock during certain points of the movie. If you believe this movie is realistic and terribly gory, then you need to go watch The Audition. Fast forward to the end and I guarantee the strongest of stomachs will at least feel a little squeamish.

The plot opens slowly in Amsterdam with the presence & allure of drugs, parties & promises of hot sexual encounters. Although dragging on, it leaves the audience in a comfortable & predictable place- & thus lets the viewers guard down. A train ride across Europe ends in a Czechoslovakian town as the first sense of fear bridles the unexpected. The unspeakable of actions wields full reign with the most heinous of mans cruelty to man in a truly believable controlled situation- protected by the auspices of business, power, money, & a private paramilitary protected ""factory"". The unsuspected guest (or audience) falls into a malevolent & uncompromised fear & terror- succumbing to an utterly powerless & hopeless abyss. The realism & potential 'actuality' of a hellhole of such- in today's world is truly believable. I found myself ""in the screen"" being in the party & riding the train- enticed by these animated European actresses preying on the desires of these guys. It is uncanny how drawing these individuals were. MOST GUYS would have taken the gait, which is the scary creepy part. Look- guys are vulnerable in this world also! As the plot developed I found myself, perspiring, as my respiratory rate became shallow & absent as I found myself gasping at times. In Inferring an ""Alfred Hitchcock stand aside for this one"", I respectfully ONLY compare the level of anticipation, anxiety, tension, fear, terror & (the viewers) acquired (& actual) visceral somatic (ism) to Hitchcock.

Plus it's not all potheads and prostitutes here. only in the red light district and thats like 2% of the whole city, let alone of Holland in general. In the eyes of this stupid typically American director Europe is a dark seedy place, made up of sex, drugs and violence, which is totally untrue. Realistic movie?? forget it.

Actually, I watched most of it alone as she fell asleep within 45 minutes.<br/><br/>We watch a lot of horror films, yet this one fell well short of any frights, dream-weavers, or even suspense. I'm being generous in giving it a 5 of 10.<br/><br/>And do not expect it to be a Quentin Tarantino film either. He neither wrote nor directed it, and I can only imagine how much more interesting it would be if he had. There was no evidence of Tarantino in it whatsoever. Now I'm not hating on Eli Roth, I liked Cabin Fever, with it's mix of angst, blood, and black humor, but he took a fine concept for a film, and turned it into a shmozzle of a road-trip movie without any laughs, a soft-porn movie that wouldn't even excite a teenager, a gore movie which just seemed wholly unrealistic and hokey, and a thriller into a predictable outcome without any tension.<br/><br/>Yes there were some scenes that were disturbing, perhaps, to the squeamish, but I wouldn't let my mother watch it anyway. I found Rob Zombie's ""Devil's Rejects"" much more disturbing, unexpected, tense, and story-driven than this yawn, I mean, yarn.<br/><br/>I was expecting much more with Tarantino prominently featured as executive producer. I mean, True Romance, Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, Dusk Till Dawn even, these are all either noteworthy or excellent movies he's written, but sadly, he penned nothing here. I would really be interested in what he'd do with a horror screenplay himself.<br/><br/>To summarize, I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater, and also glad I work in a video store so that I could see it for free. It's barely worth a DVD rental (very scant special features BTW), if only to inspire others to strive to do more and better in writing and directing than this tame might-have-been."

","Let me first qualify that subject line - in order to understand the social commentary one needs to be capable and mature enough in their critical thinking skills to see outside of their horizons of expectation. If one goes into this film expecting a Friday the 13th/ Jason/ Freddy experience he or she will be disappointed. If they are expecting a Kafka-esquire cinematographic wonder they will be disappointed. However, this film stands above the ordinary movie droll for the following reasons:<br/><br/>1. It doesn't rely on clichÃ©s (no fumbling for keys, no long discussions with the villain, no idiotic explorations of dark basements or rooms without lights, no endlessly resurrected slashers).<br/><br/>2. It is believable (crass Americans in Europe, testosterone driven youths, and the commodification of human life).<br/><br/>3. The torture scenes are not shot gratuitously. Other threads have noted that the film ""didn't show much"" and this is precisely why that makes this film great. It leaves the terror up to the audiences imagination. The director focuses his lens on the faces and the reactions of the victim. We experience fear vicariously. Films of this ""genre"" usually spoon feed violence to viewers and are consequently forced to escalate and intensify the methods of death in order to evoke a reaction. Hostel succeeds because it does not rely purely on blood, guts, and gore.<br/><br/>Too many threads on this message board post the opinions of this spoon fed generation. Watch this film. Ask yourself what the Director doesn't show. Ask yourself how the Director defies your expectations. And ask yourself if this couldn't be real in our Survivor, American Idol, Fear Factor world."

","Eli Roth is either a satirist with an amazing poker face, or 12 years old. The man responsible for the execrable ""Cabin Fever"" is back now with ""Hostel,"" another Dead Teenager movie. While the thought of anyone enjoying any aspect of the stinky ""Cabin Fever"" made one weep for the species, ""Hostel"" is a notch or two above that moist pile of rankness. Yet it's still an ugly, ugly movie.<br/><br/>First off, what is it with Roth and the ""gay"" epithets? He populated his first film with smarmy rich kids who called each other ""gay"" with every other breath, as if 1987 (indeed a fine year) had never ended. Now here's ""Hostel,"" with its dopey frat types backpacking through Europe, dropping the casual g-bomb like it's gone out of style. A memo to Roth: IT HAS. As in ""Cabin Fever,"" Roth has presented us with such loathsome characters that we're almost glad to see them get what he has in store for them. ""Hostel""'s young jerkoffs seem like the types to take such a clichéd coming of age trip just to prove their masculinity to their brothers back home. I'm beginning to form a picture of Roth as a once-persecuted bookworm made good, who now can get back at all his childhood bullies and their ""gay"" taunts in multiplexes nationwide. I really hope I'm onto something, as the alternative implies that Roth is simply as retarded as his characters.<br/><br/>But anyway, there's a movie here. Our two young homophobes are Finding Themselves on a tour of the whorehouses of Europe, along with a giddy Icelandic drifter who would likely be played by Peter Stormare in an older, and much better, film. A guy in their hostel in Amsterdam quickly pegs them for the dumb f**ks they are and tells them about a joint in Bratislava; ""girls you won't believe,"" ""will do anything,"" ""love Americans,"" etc. Of course they're on the next train, and find themselves in the titular hostel, which is conveniently populated exclusively with young, nubile women of the type normally found online. The DKE brothers are beside themselves, doing everything short of shouting ""boobies!"" outright (and I can't even be sure that doesn't happen at some point). Drinks are laced, and the Greeks find themselves in one of those dank, wet movie basements in which the only thing not covered in grime is the glistening row of saws, drills, scalpels, and other instruments that are generally preceded with a stern call of ""nurse"" Turns out one can still play the Most Dangerous Game in Slovakia, except the rules have evolved so that the prey is now handcuffed to a chair. I can't wish these gory punishments doled out by the unfeeling rich on anyone, but Roth really seems to dislike his characters, and wants us to as well. If that's the case, he has a lot of bottled up anger to deal with. If not, he's simply a sadist. Either way, ""Hostel"" is cloaked in a weighty unpleasantness that makes it hard to enjoy its few nice touches.<br/><br/>Roth occasionally flirts with statement-making in ""Hostel."" In his pay-to-torture men's club, taking one's aggression out on an internationally-despised American will cost considerably more than hacking up, say, a Russian or European. The idea of the socially numb elite dropping mad coin to slice people up just to feel something echoes, well, all of ""Fight Club."" Roth has some pretty usable material here, but is more interested in icky shock thrills than social commentary. By the end, our lucky survivor has gotten revenge on a character he couldn't possibly have known was involved, and we wonder exactly what is the point of ""Hostel.""

","Kinda crappy. Weak script. Some of the gore was cool, but I wouldn't shell out ten bucks for it as is. The Lion's Gate people tried to get people excited at Toronto, but it was a little disappointing. Ran into some of their people later who said the director threw a fit and had to be baby sat through the festival. Kinda funny for a horror guy to need a babysitter. Always amusing to hear the 'office gossip' at these festivals. I was hoping for a better film, however. Actually, I heard the director was kind of a handful on Cabin Fever, too. There was a really awful draft of the sequel to that one that Lion's Gate refused to even consider. It was so bad it was comical. So they made the guy do this one. Not sure about this, but I also heard someone at LGF wrote this one and they paid him big bucks to slap this guy's name on it, to keep him happy. In any event, I really love the genre, and had high hopes for this one. Loved the premise, but it just doesn't deliver."

","One of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, it wasn't even scary. Nothing made me jump, nothing made me gross out, nothing bothered me. It was advertised that this movie would be the end all to all gory movies. It just sucked, Tarantino should feel like an idiot for tainting his name with this movie. This movie was basically a porn for the first hour, and misplaced badly thought up killing for the second hour. The effects were good, and they should have been. Done by one of the industry leaders in gore effects Greg Nictero. But the acting, the directing, and the movie all together was just terrible. Don't waste your money."
"ThrashAssassin","10","20","39","17 September 2005"," Great, sadistic, evil film, rich with characters and atmosphere.
","I have just returned from watching the afternoon screening of Hostel at the TIFF. It's great. Really great. A bloody, sick, twisted, violent, bloody, violent, gory, violent, violent, violent, sick, and what? sexy? damn right it is. Eli Roth is such a cool guy, and his work seems to border the absolute darkest and deepest depths of inhumanity. I love it. Every second of the film, which was not even fully complete since he really wanted to show it at the TIFF so he brought a temp work in HDCAM or TV or whatever the hell it's called, was very entertaining. The film tells a story of a brutal, fiendish, perverse, greedy and barbaric world. I'd like to dig further into it's rich atmosphere but I don't want to spoil anything. The performances were excellent, especially Derek Richardson. I'm worried that the film may be cut horribly by the ratings board since I really want my friends to witness the truly outstanding film-making and storytelling in the depths of a truly evil world. Eli Roth is one of those rare filmmakers who can mix both storytelling(both character and plot driven, which in fact some filmmakers can't seem to do...) and directing. Any serious Horror and Thriller fan will appreciate this film. I can't wait to see what Eli and Raw Nerve come out with next."
"samseescinema","7","16","30","18 December 2005"," a grim refreshment among the lamely malignant, tired duds that have passed for the Horror genre so far this year
","Hostel <br/><br/>reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>rating: 3 out of 4<br/><br/>I can't attest to honestly enjoying Hostel. In fact, I often had to resist the reflexive temptation to leave. The film is simply disgusting. I worried that my fellow audience members would be drenched in a fresh, steaming coat of my own vomit, to be absolutely truthful. Someone asked Writer/Director Eli Roth after the screening how he managed to convince the MPAA into an R-rating. Roth laughed at this, mentioning off-handedly that Rob Zombie was to thank. After Zombie returned an astonishing nine times to earn his R-rating for The Devil's Rejects, Roth believed the MPAA just didn't care enough to fight a new director. He even wrote Zombie a thank-you note. <br/><br/>The film surrounds three young men, Josh (Derek Richardson), Paxton (Jay Hernandez), and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), and their horrific backpacking trip through Europe. We meet them as they enter Amsterdam, eager to exploit the nation's liberal laws concerning marijuana. But when the night is through, the trio arrive back at their hostel past curfew, only to find themselves locked out. Luckily, Amsterdam native Alex (Lubomir Bukovy) comes to their rescue, offering them a spot at his pad for the night. Alex informs the boys that Slovakia is the untapped gem of Europe for backpackers; that beautiful women simply await strapping young Americans like themselves to steal them away. And, of course, our heroes buy the lie and the next day trek out towards Slovakia. <br/><br/>Once they arrive, they find there are already reservations in Oli's name at a luxury hostel. And when they walk into their room, the boys find Natalya and Svetlana (Barbara Nedeljakova and Jana Kaderabkova) casually nude, sveltely inviting them to the spa. By the end of the evening the group gets itself into bed together, but wakes up the next morning to find Oli missing. No matter, they think, it's just crazy Oli. But things get even stranger when Josh wakes up in a dungeon, only to be drilled through the kneecaps and sliced with a scalpel through his achilles tendons by a businessman-turned-surgeon (Jan Vlasak). What, you might ask, is this dungeon? Well, it's a lucrative business that allows insatiable, adrenaline-addicted citizens of the world's upper tier to pay $5-50,000 to chain an innocent human to a chair and torture them how he/she pleases. Roth read of such a business (explaining the ""inspired by true events"" curtail) on a website, later explaining the idea to Tarantino, who encouraged him to put the twisted idea to paper. Whether or not the web site speaks truth is immaterial, explains Roth. It's just the fact that somebody thought of it. Anyway, Josh meets his destiny quite quickly (in a nod to Psycho's elimination of the protagonist twist) and puts the aggressive, dodgy Paxton front and center. Paxton starts digging deeper and deeper, questioning the conniving girls as to Josh's whereabouts, and soon he finds himself in a similar situation. <br/><br/>Chophouse films like these, particularly those most prominent of the genre from the seventies, have always been hindered by technology. Make-up just hasn't been good enough to make the gore convincing. But Hostel clearly leaps this hurdle. The film is fun and over-the-top, but holds enough solemnity to tug the audience straight into its torture scenes. The film is so gory that when we watch as two fingers are vengefully dismembered with a scalpel in the final scene, the gore seems tamely benign. Roth fondly recalls the most squeamish of scenes as ""the eyegasm scene."" All I'll divulge is that the scene has to do with a blowtorch and only one half of a woman's face. I'm confident with my movie-watching habits to proudly brag at an adept tolerance, and even affection, of quality gore. I'm not one to turn away from blood and flailing limbs. But what Roth does to us in Hostel could cause even a mortician to cringe. In short, it's the goriest film I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Many wonder what the ""Quentin Tarantino Presents"" headline stapled to Hostel denotes. First of all, it doesn't mean Hostel is Tarantino's creation. As Roth explains, Tarantino is a large advocate of the budding filmmaker. He occasionally has ""movie nights"" in which a gaggle of blossoming directors are invited to Tarantino's pad to check out some films. There, Tarantino riles up the directors and gets them psyched for their upcoming projects. After seeing Roth's first feature, Cabin Fever, Tarantino invited Roth to one such shindig and offered to help out with Hostel. Roth pumped out a first draft script, Tarantino helped with the edits, and agreed to offer the ""Quentin Tarantino Presents"" headline. From there, Roth took the reigns during the shooting process, and Tarantino returned to help out with post-production and MPAA rating strategies. Technically, Tarantino played Producer of Hostel, but in more ways than one, he was the film's mentor. <br/><br/>As aforementioned, I can't admit to having enjoyed Hostel. I certainly wouldn't watch it again. But for those die-hard fans of the chophouse slasher genre, Hostel's the American masterpiece. Takashi Miike films have certainly lived up to Hostel's gory watermark, but Hostel is the first American film, to my knowledge, to grace such bloody explicitness. Roth even admits to have been deeply influenced by Miike's work, particularly Audition, and Miike actually makes a cameo as one of the business' clients. But despite my physical aversion to Roth's film, I'll admit that it's a grim refreshment among the lamely malignant, tired duds that have passed for the Horror genre so far this year."

"lkil","10","5","7","11 January 2006"," Nightmare? No -- Brilliant Social Criticism!
","Most commentators and reviewers writing about this extraordinary film cannot see the genuine message of the movie. They concentrate on all the shocking and grotesque violence and gore. But look elsewhere! Look deeper. This film is about at least three things. First, it's about the smugness, shallowness and adolescent arrogance of the contemporary Western youth culture. Second, it's about an absolute moral and cultural devastation of the post-Cold-War Eastern Europe. Third, it's about the collision between the two.<br/><br/>A bunch of Western students are advised to travel to a town in provincial Slovakia, where they are promised to be serviced by the most beautiful local girls. Their interest is piqued by the fact that these ""local girls"" allegedly dream of nothing more honorable than taking care of the sexual needs of horny Westerners. Tarantino and Roth brilliantly show the vanity, smugness and complete contempt thinly papered by shameless bravado with which the trio of Western young men anticipate their sojourn in Slovakia. They have a sense of entitlement. They expect to be treated like ""white gods"" in the land of ""post-communist savages."" Their little pathetic egos are stroked by the fact that they think they do not have to make any effort to even try to appeal to these girls. These girls should submit to them by the virtue of one fact -- the guys represent the superior, victories and rich West. The initial turn of events confirms all these attitudes of smug superiority. But very quickly we learn that the local ""worship the gods of the West"" is nothing but illusory. The defeated and ravaged societies of the post-Communist Eastern Europe have a few horrible tricks up their sleeves...<br/><br/>The creators of the movie do an absolutely fantastic job at portraying the social rot and cultural-moral devastation of post-communism. The picture contradicts the New York Times presentation of post-communism as the age of social and moral revival. But the ""local girls"" (the human symbols of Eastern Europe) are not at all what they are thought to be by the Western horn-dogs. They crave nothing more than to punishment those who deprive them of their human honor and dignity even before they actually see them. They fight the attitude of colonizers and cultural missionaries with which so many Westerners have in all kinds ways treated Eastern Europe. Their revenge is horrible and excruciatingly cruel. But it comes from a deep-seated sense of despair, of struggling to preserve the modicum of dignity in the world where all values had collapsed, where everything is for sale, where whole countries and regions exist only for providing entertainment for the fancy of the foreign wealthy....<br/><br/>This movie is brilliant and politically sharp achievement. Bravo Tarantino and Roth!"

So to me that part about the guys just wanting to go over to Europe to f$%# girls and smoke pot seems pretty realistic to me. Yes I will agree the gore was a little much but besides that it was pretty solid with the exception of the main character's acting but Oli's was Awesome.

","This movie is a clear step above most horror movies. It helps raise the bar for all horror movies by simply having a nice mix of movie elements that work well together.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie is about three American college guys who venture out of Amsterdam and into a region of Slovakia looking for more extreme female interaction. Once they arrive, they begin to suspect that everything may not be as good as it seems when one by one they start disappearing.<br/><br/>Although this seems like a typical horror plot, the movie is well-done and believable. The European scenery, interesting characters, decent dialog and fast-moving pace of the movie completely separate it from the typical ""waste of time"" horror movies.<br/><br/>I also give the director high marks for not making this a gore-fest and overfocusing on nothing but blood and guts.

Personally, I love horror films and don't usually mind seeing gore if it is a significant part to the plot; unfortunately, this is not true for 'Hostel'... poorly written plot (no explanation entire film), far too obvious (audience is not left guessing with ANYTHING!), overly graphic (I don't just mean bloody, but literally the theatre had tons of people puking in the hallways - i saw it and asked), and basically not scary.

"brando647","7","2","2","11 December 2012"," Eli Roth Gives Us a Taste of Humanity's Dark Side
","I don't recall watching HOSTEL in the theater. I'm pretty sure I did, but I have no recollection of it whatsoever. For whatever reason, my brain has totally blocked any memory of originally seeing the movie. All I remembered was that it was brutally violent and helped the SAW series solidify the profitable nature of ""torture porn"". I hadn't watched the movie in years when I saw it sitting in my collection a few weeks back and decided to reintroduce myself to Eli Roth's gore-fest. After watching it again with a few years of letting it settle in at the back of my mind, I realized it's a little better than I rememberand a little less violent. That's not to say the movie seems tamer after watching it again. HOSTEL can never be considered tame. HOSTEL is the story of three friends backpacking through Europe: Paxton, Josh, and their new Icelandic friend Oli, the ""King of the Swing"". These guys are one a never-ending quest to get laid and, when Amsterdam doesn't quite live up to their expectations, they're directed to a hostel in Slovakia that's loaded with available women. Arriving in Slovakia and settling into the rumored hostel, the trio make a connection with two beautiful women, Natalya and Svetlana, who act as their guide to the booming nightlife. But soon, things take a dark turn as Oli disappears one night, supposedly making a sudden return home, and the hostel starts feeling a little less welcoming. By the time we learn the hostel's horrible secret, it's already too late.<br/><br/>Let me start by admitting that I'm not a horror fan. Less than 20% of my total DVD collection might fall into the genre. The average horror movie has nothing to offer me and my personal tastes. So a horror movie needs to have an interesting angle or some incredibly good reviews for me to hunt it down, and HOSTEL has just that. The premise behind HOSTEL is an intriguing one and is rumored to be based on truth (in that the organization at the center of the movie might be based on an existing service). When I watch a horror movie, it's got to be truly frightening and the idea that psychopaths like the ones we see in this movie might actually be out there somewhere doing business is a grim one. We all have the ability to commit horrific acts and the concept that there are people out there that embrace this ability and treat it as fun or a form of release is disgusting. And this movie is, if anything, disgusting. In a good way, though. The movie gives us a solid 45 minutes to get to know these characters before they get to the meat of the film. Even if they do come off as a bit two-dimensional at first, it gives us a chance to know them so when the horrible stuff hits, it's got more of an effect. The first half of the movie is pretty slow and, at times, outright boring but it all builds up to a gripping final half hour.<br/><br/>The gore in the movie is awesome. I love practical gore. I'll take some rubber intestines over a CG disemboweling every time. HOSTEL runs with practical horror effects and it comes off as that much more disturbing. There are a few instances where it might not have looked quite right (for those who've seen the movie, I'm primarily referring to Kana) but it's all part of the fun of going over the top. Eli Roth has an obvious passion for the horror genre and, if there's any doubt, listen to any one of the multiple commentary tracks that come with each of his HOSTEL movies. His passion for terrifying an audience and his solid grasp of storytelling make HOSTEL a pretty cool movie. He uses a bunch of unknown actors in the film which, while I'm sure helped keep the overall cost to a minimum, also helped see the victims in the movie as real people. I'd never heard of Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, and Eythor Gudjonsson before, and, really, I haven't heard from them since. I hear Gudjonsson is pretty big in Iceland though. The real stars of the movie are the villains, who are fleshed out a little better. Particularly the Dutch Businessman, played by Jan Vlasák. Considering that Vlasák doesn't speak English, it's that much more impressive how menacing he comes across. Eli Roth's HOSTEL is a really good movie for what it is, and this is coming from a non-horror freak. The violence is brutal but shot in just such a way that a lot the worst happens off- screen or in quick glimpses, and Roth leaves the audience's minds fill in the blank. If more effort had been put into creating some more sympathetic victims, this movie would've been even stronger."
"bastiaan0740","8","2","2","29 September 2008"," Key horror elements are present.
","I just finished reviewing jaws, and strangely enough, I feel this film has a few elements of success in common. <br/><br/>The opposites: Jaws starts out with a pleasant scenario. People are on vacation, looking for a good time. Same in Hostel. This makes a big contrast with the horror that follows. The helplessness: Like a swimmer being caught in the water, who eventually realizes something bad is going to happen to him, but can't get out and can't defend himself properly against it due to his environment - our tourists are stranded in a foreign country, with people that are unwilling to help them, or are in on the plot to torture them. The suddenness: Like the shark movie, our tourists can be stricken at any point without warning. The isolation: like being alone in the water, our tourists are all alone in the country. The authorities: They don't help much. In jaws, because of the money, in order to not close a beach during tourist season. In Hostel, because of the money - they are in on the torture scheme. The method: all are picked off one at a time. The deaths: all are violent and painful. The solution: the heroes of both movies need to fight and conquer the evil all by themselves. The realism: Both movies feel like it could happen in real life.<br/><br/>This movie obviously differs from jaws, apart from jaws starring a fish, with the element of betrayal and setup; also hostel focuses on the blood and gore. Indeed, the intense gore of the movie turns it from a (psychological?) thriller to a full-blown horror fest.<br/><br/>For a horror movie to be successful, it needs realism. And hostel pulls it off masterfully. It combines all needed elements, and keeps everything brutally simple. The aptly named Eli Roth nailed the essence of the genre with this movie, unhindered by (probably) a low budget.<br/><br/>Well done."

","I was meaning to get round to watching Hostel for a while and yesterday on a boring Sunday afternoon I took the chances of watching it and I was not disappointed. It seem really apparent that anything that gets the Quentin Tarentino's seal of approval is worth a check out. Hostel was a movie that satisfies the gore hound in me , of course if strip everything away it could still be classed as a teen-slasher movie but it is different in the sense where it has these odds moments where one seems to genuinely care about the characters. The plot focus is on 3 back packers trodding around Amsterdame getting stoned,laid etc but then they are given an opportunity to take a ride in the wild side in Slovakia and being 'dumb American teens' they go through with the offer. One thing that Hostel could say has a focus on is the dark nature of humans and how far one is willing to go for the ultimate thrill. Although it as I said earlier one could argue it could be treated as a basic formulaic slasher it just takes the blood and gore level to graphic which makes it all the more amusing. I would recommend this as something different from Europe and is worth a look at , you might be shocked and you might laugh and some bits but it was a ride . My only complaint was that the trailer just gave away a little bit too much so we knew what was coming however Eli Roth has done very well indeed. I just hope that Part 2 satisfies the hunger for my gore better than The Hills Hvae Eyes Part 2 which was just a let down.<br/><br/>HOSTEL 8.9 OUT 10 <br/><br/>THERE IS A PLACE , WHERE FOR A PRICE , YOU CAN SCARE , TORTUE AND KILL!"

","Three guys, one Icelandic and two Americans visited Slokavkia in order to look for chicks. But little do they know the horror that awaits them.<br/><br/>That's the premise of this brilliantly shocking film from director Eli Roth. Roth, who previously directed his horror-comedy debut Cabin Fever, has come up with an excellent gore-fest which took his name by storm.<br/><br/>Produced by Quentin Tarantino, this film is an exploitative tribute to films like Cannibal Holocaust, I Spit on Your Grave, Friday the 13th and several Italian gore fests including Reazione a catena(aka Chain Reaction) and so forth.<br/><br/>The acting is OK. But, the coolest thing about Hostel is the character Oli and Natalya. Oli is a wonderful Icelander, having knew that Icelanders are cool people, he makes one hell of a character. Natalya is also a great character, being a damn hottie. The film is kinda easy to follow, especially when it doesn't have those stupid flashy sequences that has conquered almost every PG-13 horror films.<br/><br/>One thing that bugs me is that the film kinda acts as a social commentary. Eli Roth says that this film deals with the ignorance surrounding tourists(especially Americans) who visited a certain country without knowing what's surrounding them. That kinda bugs me, because i'm a traveler, and me being a tourist, i don't feel ignorant about that country. Perhaps he was talking about Western tourists in general, i might say.<br/><br/>Still, this film is great. This ain't a chick flick, but if your girlfriend is a freak or loves horror films, then you must bring her on a date, bring her back home, watch this film on DVD with her, and get laid. It's simple, and fun."

","This movie, other than all the sex in the beginning, was terrific. It was so real the blood looked real, it all looked real. And the acting wasn't that bad and believe me, this is no saw spin-off. There is no one murderer, there are several. Not just one guy killing people off cause they did bad things in life. No. these guys are sick ******** that pay for it all. They pay to cut people up, they pay to torture people. They pay to hear people scream. And it's really Sadistic in some parts. The guys they don't have any shame or guilt, they just want their body parts, they just want to cut them up for fun and burn their limbs afterward.<br/><br/>This movie was 10 times better than any saw sequels this movie will leave you wanting to see what the main character does after the credits roll. Will he get revenge and kill them all? or will he die off in part 2? we'll have to wait and see. But for now, Quintin Tarrentino gives you this awesome film.<br/><br/>I rate this a solid 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>enjoy the movie!"

","Just bought the DVD for this movie - I use it to get rid of girlfriends I am no longer interested in. I am a horror junkie, and this movie gave me my fill. The true horror that this film shows is the dark side of humanity. Imagine yourself living in some poor, forgotten Eastern European country where every day is a struggle to survive, and then some gangsters give you a few dollars a week to simply turn the other cheek as they lure unsuspecting tourists into their torture chamber for the pleasure of clients who've paid large amounts of cash for their pleasure of murdering the tourists in any way they choose. The townspeople in this film are over-joyed when fresh cash and fresh meat show up at the train station, because it means that they will make some money this week. Who gives a sh*t about what happens to the unsuspecting tourists, because it's not happening to you, and if any one in the town went to the authorities and reported it, then the town's major source of income is lost. This film makes you question yourself: ""What would I do for a dollar?"" Of course, your answer depends upon your particular level of affluence, or lack thereof. As one's situation becomes increasingly desperate, human self-preservation takes over as the individual sinks to deeper and deeper lows. An act is ""unspeakable"" only because your individual situation hasn't yet sunk that low. Think of any ""unspeakable"" act, throw the right amount of cash in, and now you not only ""speak"" of it, you do it because it benefits you. Everyone has their price."

","I rented Hostel expectimg it to be very scary and gross. It wasn't so much scary but it was very sick like I thought it would be. It's about two American guys and an Iceland guy who check into a hotel hoping to stay their for a couple of nights. However they soon find out that they won't be checking out. The first half an hour of the movie or so is just them trying to have sex with several different women. However that seems to be for a reason. Some whores sleep with them and take them to get tortured.<br/><br/>From the 30 minute mark on it is all suspenseful and fast paced. You get to see feet get cut, drill no body, toes clipped, fingers cut off and eyes get burned out. So if you love torture you'll really enjoy this movie."

There seemed to be a preoccupation with porn for some reason. It just didn't fit in the movie, so it made it weird. There are 3 scenes of torture in case you want to know, from chainsaws to blow torches. A few more murders in relation to the tortures. I cannot give away the details. But its not as bad as you expect it to be. I would not see it again though. The makeup effects were done perfectly! Whoever did it should be awarded.

","*possible spoilers* OK OK, it's no masterpiece, that goes without saying. The claims about the film being borderline pornographic in the beginning...are true. I even joked to myself, thinking sarcastically ""I'm sure this will all have some relevance to the plot of the story"". Well as it turned out, it sorta did. It helps if you view it as a satirical piece. While watching it I was reminded of films like ""Audition"" with a bit of humor thrown in the mix. There are times when you want to laugh at certain scenes in this film. There are even some people who assert that this is a ""comedy"", in a sense. Unfortunately, the acting in this film is good, perhaps too good. Whatever laughs are delivered in this film are quickly eviscerated by the sheer pain you can feel these victims take, at least with normal people. There is still an odd 'light' feel to the movie's tone, however. What really ended up getting to me, was not the scenes that a number of people found shocking, but the fact that this film was based off of true events. It was quite blatant that the film was trying to make a statement, particularly with the shots of the hoar house in the beginning, and the ""museum"" in the second half. And that's what I took the film for, an unmerciful delve into human exploitation, whether its sexploitation or torture perpetuated to fulfill a person's sick desires. The film then ended up transforming into a feel-good revenge flick toward the end, fortunately. Everyone loves a bit of vigilante justice. This is certainly a love it or hate film. Is there room in your tolerance level for a pornographic torture flick?"
"kenn-johnson-1","8","2","2","6 November 2006"," Missing important points
","It would seem from the majority of the comments on this film that very few of the people making these comments have any real insight into film production or what some film makers are attempting to communicate to an audience. With that in mind, here are some things I discovered upon viewing this film: (1) The story is new and unique. Thank goodness for any film that is not a sequel, a remake, or a film based on some decades-old television program. (2) The director uses the Xenophobia most Americans have about Europe and the citizens of those countries to very good effect. He plays on those fears, throws fuel onto that fire, much like Tobe Hooper did with rural areas in the U.S. in ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". (3) I was impressed by the build-up of uneasiness leading up to the torture scenes, the prevading sense of something ""off bubble"". If the characters had not been tenth-degree horndog party animals intent only on having a good time, they might have been more suspicious of the strange events taking place around them, which - in my mind - justifies the scenes of debauchery to show how oblivious these guys were. (4) A great number of things often have to be done in a film to appease The Studio. I saw several scenes that appeared to be included seemingly at the behest of The Studio for ""saleability"", and were not necessarily included for story-telling. There is also a desire to ""one-up"" each other in the Studio System, which publicly decries sex and violence while unofficially tells Producers to ""give us more, and make it even more shocking than (fill in the blank)"". All-in-all, while this film is not for the squeamish, it does have some things to say that create discussion and dialogue about a number of things, from how we view foreign cultures to how we treat each other. Any film that can generate that kind of thought while providing innovation deserves applause."

My boyf and I had read up some of the critiques on the Net and thought we'd give it a go, even though most of the write-ups were negative.<br/><br/>It is my belief that if you expect a lot from a film it can sometimes be a disappointment - so with that in mind we settled in on the sofa.<br/><br/>The first half hour is extremely annoying and plays into every cliché in the book - the girls are all hot, the Americans are all loud and obnoxious, the weird German man on the train wanting to take advantage of the USAers - it's your average jocks-going-on-holiday-to-have-sex-and-take-loads-of-drugs movie - but I believe the writer and director were doing this intentionally. A comment on what a section of the world is actually like and leading you into a misguided sense of security.<br/><br/>What really makes this puppy fly is the relentless cruelty that comes out. The gory scenes are actually very well done and whilst the sickest scene of all (Japanese Eye is all I will say) could have been better, the payback is beautiful, tongue-in-cheek and downright nasty.<br/><br/>The main character, who also gets his kit off, is not that wooden an actor and does carry the film well. It's one of those films that if you keep an open mind and realise that yes, there are better films out there, that yes, it is not the most incredible film you'll see this year and that yes, it falls into cliché-territory from time to time, it's actually a thoroughly decent movie.<br/><br/>Plus, it is the only film in 17 years that gave me really bad dreams (I'm talking about being skinned alive here, veins being ripped out of my arms) and any film that enters into my sub-conscience in that way gets more points because those are the kind of films you do remember for longer.<br/><br/>Like I said, keep an open mind, relax into the ride and give it a chance..."

","The horror genre spews out all sorts of films year in and out that aren't horrendous at all. They might be gruesome, bloody, sinister, etc...but rarely do they inspire horror. Hostel deserves the title. I saw the movie a few hours ago and some images from the movie still play out in my mind. I feel this is a good mark for a horror film.<br/><br/>The movie starts off on unsure footing. It feels more like a bad National Lampoon's movie or something. Eventually the first backpacker goes missing and the movie begins to find it's eerie groove. The rest of the movie moves at a much better pace and the story unfolds with a few twists.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil the ending but checked spoiler warning because I'm giving away a midpoint twist which I think deserves mention. The movie leads the viewer to believe a certain character is the lead. The good guy, heart of gold, doesn't want to mindlessly party guy is always the lead. And it never makes sense as this character is typically weaker and must be forced to make decisions though outside forces. The writer kills this guy off after leading us to think he's the one that'll make it out. Very good move in my opinion. There's actually tension from this point on as you don't know who will and won't get killed off.<br/><br/>It's not the end all of horror films, but it's a good one. It's brutal, violent, gory, etc, but not mindlessly so. The film will leave a lasting impression."

","At first I thought I was not going to like this movie, maybe for the simple reason that I had not enjoyed the Kill Bill movies. I watched it because somehow since Pulp Fiction I still feel a lot of respect for Tarantino and feel that I should always give his movies a chance. Right from the start of the film i thought I was going to hate it as soon as I saw these three naive American young backpacking Europe types. However as the film progressed i realized how natural and realistic the idea was and how possible everything that happens could possibly be. There were no clichés after all, the nice guy dies first and the guy I disliked is the surviver. There are a couple of really impressive scenes, its so impressively sick. I don't know if it was just me or if in the end what goes on is actually a twist. There is revenge towards the end of the film towards the evil doers in the end and we find ourselves feeling the same pleasure they were getting in their most terrible deeds for the same reasons. Its a scary thought on my part and I'm not sure if Tarantino was aware of it or not. Evil breeds more evil here like war does and the good don't win by repeating the same acts done to them. Two wrongs don't make a right, Bush must learn these things and a good portion of America."

Roth's scenes of torture are surprisingly effective and the film is gratuitous violent. Which Roth is never seems to be ashame of. The director handle himself better as a filmmaker than he did on his previous first picture (Which is of course ""Cabin Fever""). The film actually takes its time by getting to know the characters before getting into the story of this movie. Which is a good for a horror film, especially these days.<br/><br/>DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Commentary two is the director and the executive producers:Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans), Scott Spiegel (Co-Writer of ""Evil Dead 2:Dead by Dawn"") & Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill Vol.1 & Vol.2, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs). Commentary three is by the director, Producer:Chris Briggs and documentary filmmaker:Gabriel Roth. Commentary four is also by the director, film editor:George Folsey Jr. (National Lampoon's Animal House, The Blues Brothers), Harry Knowles of AintItCoolNews.com, actor:Eython Gudjonsson and actress:Barbara Nedeljakova. Which the all four commentary are all entertaining and worth checking out.<br/><br/>DVD also has three part excellent featurette titled ""Hostel:Dissected"" by director's brother:Gabriel. Which is entertaining and gives you the behind the scenes tour of this film. Also the DVD has an multi-angle interactive feature of the infamous ""Kill the Car!"" sequence. Which is basically long takes from different camera set-ups. Seeing the street kids destroying the car is amusing, depending from which angle to choose from. The two things are missing from this DVD is the original theatrical trailer and deleted scenes. The original darker ending was mention in the commentaries and also briefly seen in the three part featurette. This low budget film has good production values with great locations, terrific score by Nathan Barr (Club Dread, Dukes of Hazzard, Super Troopers) and gory make-up effects by Gregory Nicotero & Oscar-Winner:Howard Berger.

","Hostel is half suspense thriller and half gorefest. Most people won't like the level of violence and blood and such, but for those who are fond of splatterfests, it'll be like a Renoir you'd love to have in your collection of fine, gross art.<br/><br/>Three youths backpacking through Europe find themselves in a Slovakian youth hostel. It's all they've ever wanted - even better than Amsterdam! The girls are gorgeous and (most importantly) willing, especially concerning young Americans. Even better, the boys have to room with two local lovelies who like to walk around naked and party hardy with their new friends.<br/><br/>But strange things are afoot. Ole (Eythor Gudjonsson) goes missing; the front desk says he's checked out, and his pals Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) receive a phone message from him saying he's gone home. And a Japanese guest at the hostel says her friend's missing, too. What's up with that? The first half of the movie is titillating, with plenty of go-thither scenes of fantastic debauchery, wickedly enticing the average male viewer with promises of drinking, toking, and hardcore fornication. I mean, how dare they? Here I am, trying to write a serious review of a nasty horror movie, and they have to muck it up by showing me plenty of gratuitous nudity! Not that there's nothing for the rest of the audience. Okay, there's not much. The first half is aimed squarely at the heterosexual hedonist male. But then we get to the second half, and we get to see what happens when Josh passes out in his room and wakes up in the torture chamber.<br/><br/>This is the moment you'd start covering your eyes, shooing small children from the room, warning people with heart conditions, and so on. Of course, they probably didn't watch the nakedness, anyway, and in fact aren't even in the room, choosing instead to lambaste you from the other side of a thick door. I mean, how dare you bring such filth into their home? Why don't you bring it into your own home, you pervert? For the most part, the blood looks awfully real, but the editing is so well - pardon the pun - executed that you hardly have time to see how authentic it all appears. The point is, it feels darn authentic. Everything, from the actions of the psychopaths to the reactions of the victims feels pretty sincere.<br/><br/>Scary, creepy, and disgusting, Hostel is of the same - ahem - cut as Saw: a polished, well-shot (heh), squishy-sick horror film."

It reminded me a lot of old school horror films that are priceless! Like a film from Mr Raimi or Mr Romero, but with a bigger budget and more up to date effects.

","Indeed, Hostel is a very disturbing movie. Not for its graphic content, nor by its inherited nihilism: these two elements, by themselves, do not necessarily vouch for a disturbing cinema going experience. Instead, what does qualify as shocking is the complete lack of knowledge of the director as far as Europe is concerned. Accordingly, completely by passing important cultural aspects and reducing whole countries to vapid stereotypes, everyone in Amasterdam seems to speak fluent German, Slovakia is peopled with evil hearted creatures bent on exploiting foreigners, and Europe, overall, is the arena for sexual pervasion. Yet, achieving a sad kind of balance, we are introduced to a configuration of American clichés that walk about in the guise of characters. <br/><br/>The joint effect of the process of simplification becomes redundant and ultimately undermines the whole movie, virtually ruining whatever impact it might have sought to achieve. And that impact revolves around, and is centered on violence and how it can dehumanize both those unto which it is committed and those who sustain the injuries. So we are shown a parade of torture scenes that, by themselves, do manage to create a locus of hopelessness and despair and might even make fans of exploitation movies cringe and will certainly earn their praise. Yet these are the only scenes that have any interest and rammed between a slapstick beginning that is painfully bad in terms of both cinematography and content and a random escape sequence that dominates the movie almost right to the very ending when we are presented with a grand revenge. <br/><br/>Overall, the only redeeming aspects of Hostel are its adhesion to the exploitation mode and its somewhat watered down social comment that might be elicited from the similarity drawn between the brothel and the charnel house. And I am afraid these are not enough to save a very flawed movie and give it the cult status I suppose it hopes to garnish for itself.<br/><br/>However, one thing ought to be said about Hostel: at least it wasn't afraid to portray raw violence at its worst, offering a more realistic approach to the phenomenon than we are likely to find in American movies these days."

","As a well thought out plot, it was truly AWFUL. I have never seen so many naked women in one movie. And no, I don't watch porn but much more nudity would've made it a porn movie, I'm sure. It's the kind of movie your typical stereotype of a pre-pubescent boy would enjoy.<br/><br/>If cliché characters get your nerves, you will have a really hard time sitting through the first hour of this movie. We quickly realise who is what type of character, and this (personally) was really annoying for me because it meant the script was very predictable.<br/><br/>The film only gets really good and gives out the much-awaited horror and gore after a very long time. Probably about an hour into it. Once this starts, the film becomes a lot better, but not by much.<br/><br/>To be honest, this film actually made me gag in some places. I like horror movies and they don't frighten me to the core as much anymore (desensitisation, I guess) but anything that makes me jump, scared, tense or sick to my stomach has got to be a good movie. Movies are meant to provoke strong reactions. If you hold this point of view also, then sit through the slow beginning and watch the whole thing.<br/><br/>When the actual gore begins (150 gallons of blood used in this movie, and it isn't surprising at all), it is well worth it. I can't be sure if all the scenes were actually showed in full because I covered my eyes for some of it, but what I saw was totally not censored. I mean, you see every single cut, drill, saw.. whatever.<br/><br/>I thought that once the gory bit started, it would just be meaningless gore and blood. What I got was a few interesting (not surprising, just interesting, so the boring tone is covered up by the gore) plot turns, plus the predictable ones (when the other Chinese/Japanese/I'm sorry I'm not good with nationalities girl is taken into the 'museum'), which redeemed the film as a whole. It wasn't just a stupid plot followed by gore. It was a boring slow beginning redeemed by well thought out reasons as to why people were slaughtered so brutally and explicitly.<br/><br/>It truly creeped me out. I mean, all this is somewhat realistic; not far-fetched at all (like the way the thing in 'Jeepers Creepers' wasn't a man, it was a winged creature. What a load of bull. It made the movie so much more laughable). People paying to kill humans for fun? I think I may have read that the creators of this film found such a website and used it as the basis for this movie. It really wouldn't surprise me if it were true.<br/><br/>On the whole; you should see it just for the gross shock factor. For those who are truly blood thirsty and want to see a film that is absolutely, makes you want to watch through your fingers and then be sick afterwards, disgustingly gross on another level, then this is for you. You just have to sit through a very boring and uninspiring hour beforehand.<br/><br/>I don't think this film is revolutionary (O, Mr. Tarantino, your judgement has lapsed!), unless we are talking in terms of the explicit massacre of humans. I'm not sure I've seen another movie that quite does it in this way (bear in mind that I'm a fair beginner in the horror scene, so more education from others will be much appreciated). If you hate horror movies and blood, then do not on any account watch this, especially alone."

","Is pushing the limits what we are trying to achieve here? Is witnessing realistic torture scenes the whole point of making a horror movie? Do we want to believe this world is a very unsafe place to live in? When we watched someone's being tortured on the screen, how should we feel? Are we on side with the killers when we were sitting there being entertained by the slaughtering process? Should a person be killed if one is 'bad'? Is murdering in a comical way a more acceptable way of killing? Does the R rating only attracting more curios, young minds to a dark movie? Is my dog pooping on the sidewalk a form of creativity? Do we call inappropriateness a proof of freedom of speech? <br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino is the greatest producer/ film maker in Hollywood. His strategy of cashing in through promoting a franchise of violent movies as hip entertainment is undeniable the best move benefiting the youth and society.<br/><br/>I remember it was so funny after Vincent shot Marvin in the car. Vincent: You probably went over a bump or something.<br/><br/>After all, it's only an accident and life of a fictional character. Life is cheap, capitalism rules - think about the dead bodies in the Middle East. Quentin, you are so brilliant."
"cdelacroix1","8","11","20","6 January 2006"," Intense, Twisted Horror at its Bloodiest
","I saw this movie today, the day it opened around here, and I *really* liked it. <br/><br/>What a wonderful kind of its genre (horror). It was bloody, edgy, intense, fast-paced, dramatic ... with a near-perfect beginning and end embracing a wonderfully terrifying story.<br/><br/>How to compare this movie? It's very bloody, in the spirit of slasher movies beginning with the semi-legendary Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It has some of the intensely personalist flavor (ugh) of High Tension. <br/><br/>In the tradition of American scary movies, there's sexuality mixed, in varying measure, with the fear. The sexuality is quite strong even for an R-rated horror movie. Such can certainly be titillating in scary movies; however, I myself didn't find it so in this one ... at least not after the first few scenes. In the early part of the movie especially, the general sense of Something's Not Quite Right was so pervasive, and so artfully mingled into the scenes, that I doubt if anyone will get ""turned on"" by those scenes ... but expect that Something's Not Quite Right sense to coax you to the edge of your seat until the Not Quite Right hits you (and all of us in the audience) in the face.<br/><br/>The real value of the early scenes is exactly that they follow admirably a pattern that is very familiar to horror movies fans: some likable folks (3 kids) are invited to Something That Sounds Too Good to be True. <br/><br/>Next of course the kids experience Something of the Good. And then all hell breaks loose as they discover that it is indeed Too Good to be True. <br/><br/>Part of the horror comes in contrasting the Dreamed of Good, the Taste of Bliss, with the actual Nightmarish Horror. <br/><br/>There are some amazing scenes full of that intense irony that you only find in a well-made horror flick. I won't spoil them by talking about them ... except to say that these are the sorts of scenes that simply leave me wrinkling my brow and whispering ""Oh, NO ... oh, sh** ... !"" If you, like me, like this kind of scene, then hey, you'll have plenty of opportunity to experience more than a few such in this movie.<br/><br/>The entire movie is set near Bratislava, Slovakia, and there are some lovely views, beautiful scenes, mostly of what Americans (like me) would think of as a quiet, almost idyllic, sometimes pastorally peaceful setting. Which produces all the more contrast to the horror of the film.<br/><br/>The pace was good, the action was quick, the dialog and script were both economical and very credible. <br/><br/>Tight, taut, scary, horrifying ... if that's your scary movie taste, hey, check this movie out."
"bonnie91","10","14","27","15 April 2006"," Steps the horror genre up a notch
","I'm reviewing the unrated version of Hostel, now out on DVD.<br/><br/>First of all, let me say that Lion's Gate, responsible for the film's distribution, has come a long way from the days when it was almost exclusively synonymous with bad B-movies. It has become one of the major distributors of good horror movies that push the envelope, such as the Saw franchise and High Tension, and it could now be said that it's a patron of the genre.<br/><br/>Hostel develops an interesting premise and is better seen in ignorance of any plot summaries/background information on the movie. In the style of Asian horror, there is plenty of over-the-top gore, and in the style of campy American horror, there's plenty of nudity, but this doesn't detract from the ability of the director, Eli Roth, to take us to new and ever darker places as the plot thickens, building suspense right up to the gratifying finale.<br/><br/>Unlike many horror movies nowadays, it has an ending that provides some closure and does not leave you thinking that a sequel sometime in the near future is inevitable, although IMO this concept could be taken further and the movie ended too soon for me. Then again I'm somewhat jaded when it comes to horror fiction in general, so maybe it's just the right length to not overwhelm non-targeted audiences.<br/><br/>Because of the level of entertainment, I have to give this movie a 10 within the genre. It has everything the modern horror fan could want, like good direction, great makeup and special effects, an atmosphere all its own. and a main character that is believable because he's not making the cliché, inane mistakes that most horror leads are scripted to make with the inexplicable notion that this somehow adds to the scare factor.<br/><br/>If you are not easily grossed out or offended, I recommend renting or, better yet, buying Hostel. Who knows? You may want to revisit it...<br/><br/>P.S. Support the ""WE WANT MORE R-RATED HORROR MOVIES"" campaign. Go buy it or rent it now!"

This movie, honestly, SUCKED. And I will tell you why. It's one thing to go see a movie that you know isn't going to be that good and then see exactly what you expect. But to go see a movie and expect it to suck (as I did Hostel), only to have it suck twice as much for twice as many reasons, that's a whole new level of suck. Ya see, I expected Hostel to be low on substance and meaning and high in gore. Turns out, this movie couldn't even deliver the latter. That's right, with the exception of one scene, Hostel was weak in the graphic nature department. In fact, Hostel was so weak, if it weren't for the pointless sex and nudity and the pervasive language, it could have been rated PG-13. And I mean that. This movie was so typical and so ""not"" a departure from the norm. In fact, there was hardly any torture. It ended up just being a ""get away from the evil bad guys"" movie, typical of all other proclaimed ""horror films."" I'm so upset I cant even write anymore. The last thing I'll say is this. 1) Eli Roth can't write a script to save his life (check out the scene where the main character talks about a girl drowning, that was a pathetic attempt to create emotion in the audience) and 2) Quentin Terrentino should be ashamed to have his name on this project.

I just arrived from The Sitges Film Festival in Spain, and right now, I am deeply disappointed with Tarantino, who produced this movie and was there as a special guest of the Festival. Tarantino during his speech said people are weak and can't stand the blood and the violence. But concerning to Hostel, people are weak and can't stand such a bad movie. The director abused of people tolerance with detailed murder scenes, and I agree in a B movie that is probably the main idea, but nothing makes me believe his script has any sort of reason to exist."

","Gosh. We are left today with only three horrors. The extravagant slasher movie, the wet Japanese ghost haunting, or the conspiratorial torture movie.<br/><br/>This last seems to have very few degrees of freedom. The setup of the conspiracy can be deep, folded and reflexive, like ""Saw."" The tortures can be increasing gruesome, horrible and explicit  well, that essential. And the manner of the film-making can be excellent, meaning that the cinematic expression increases the rush and horror.<br/><br/>This last is what is advertised here. To judge from the box office success, it does actually push the state of the camera. I didn't see it. There was obvious attention to presenting one and a half torture scenes. A lot of expert attention went into this and I even image that they were shot early as a means to attract funding. The rest is merely adequate on all accounts.<br/><br/>The formula demands that the victims ""ask for it"" by at least making bad choices and ideally participating in one end of the machine for pleasure or profit, that machine turning around and biting. Here, it is sex. We are led to believe these guys are seeking deviant sex; it is mentioned enough and why they travel to this ""dark"" place. We never see any of course, because the formal for some reason allows exposed breasts to represent all matters of sex.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","I first became interested in Hostel when I saw a preview before Saw II on the first night. Hostel seemed to be the type of movie that would beat out all other horrors with it's disgusting tactics and clever screenplay, however, after actually seeing the movie, my opinion was rendered worthless. Hostel does not create any sympathy for the three main characters that get involved in the torture ring. Therefore, the aspect of actually caring what happens to them is lost. When walking out, I realized that Hostel was in fact, the worst movie I've ever seen. The best part may the the ""gangster-like"" children attempting to obtain bubblegum, but other than that, this movie falls far short of horror or the shock factor that was so prevalent in both Saw movies. I expected much more from QT, and if I were him I would be ashamed to have my name listed at the beginning of this empty joke of a movie."
"dan-atkinson","1","13","25","7 January 2006"," Did I miss something???
","From all of the positive reviews I was expecting a very dark, relentless, gory film on par with the best of Asian extreme cinema. Instead, what I saw was a dumbed-down American horror movie trying way too hard to be gory and disturbing but never actually coming anywhere close. The first 45 minutes played like a crappy Showtime soft-core porno. Then, the allegedly ""disturbing"" horror aspect began. There was maybe one scene that pushed the envelope of American gore (still tame by Asian standards). The rest was a ho-hum crap American slasher. There was absolutely no build up or sustaining of atmosphere. The plot was paper thin and totally anti-climatic.<br/><br/>The premise of this film had so much more potential. In skilled hands, this could have been an absolutely disturbing mind-f***. Instead, it was a completely ineffective exercise of mainstream Hollywood cliché.<br/><br/>I don't know what cut some reviewers saw at the Toronto film festival. Many had put this on par with the likes of Miike and other intelligent filmmakers. Perhaps the original cut lived up to what one would expect from a Tarrantino produced film with this kind of hype. The cut currently available comes nowhere near. Save your money if you are looking for a truly disturbing and thought-provoking film."

","Director Eli Roth returns to the horror scene with this horrifically shocking and daring film that makes Roth's earlier film, the outrageous Cabin Fever (2003), look like a light-weight thriller! <br/><br/>Two American students traveling across Europe fall into the clutches of a sadistic madman and his colleagues who make a business out of violently torturing people.<br/><br/>Completely merciless in its brutality and tension, Hostel is Roth's most mature film thus far. Roth's story is well-written with a great set-up and a plot that builds suspense and spirals into madness and extreme violence. To say it's a film that's gripping and edgy is a real understatement! The gore FX are as bloody as can be, producing plenty of truly disturbing (if not downright sickening) images. I couldn't imagine what would have been cut from this film to get an R rating. This is what we horror fans have come to expect from Eli Roth though, and he more than delivers the horrific goods in this film, he pushes the envelope plenty. Roth also adds a strong sense of the erotic, adding lots of nudity. All the while, Roth does excellent direction with great locations, atmosphere, and well-done intensity. Kudos also go to the great soundtrack of European rock songs.<br/><br/>The cast is perfectly good, and often rather bold. The best of them are Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson as the ill-fated American youths.<br/><br/>Once again Eli Roth has delivered excellent old-school horror that pulls out all the stops and gives us horror fans the strong stuff that we need!

"Moviguy","8","13","25","6 January 2006"," Some things are to good to be true...
","It's true. This both applies to the movie and the story. In the case of the movie, well... it's no where near as nasty as the previews would lead you to believe (although it is still pretty violent/cruel/disgusting). It's not the amazing piece of horror film making that the fans would lead you to believe either. It's still good, but it's not the second coming of horror.<br/><br/>In the case of the story it has to do with the Hostel in Slavakia (sp?). These three guys think they have found heaven, when in reality, it's hell. I won't get into the plot to much, because if you don't know it already, then stop reading. The surprise of what happens will be great. If you do, then why should I have to tell it to you all over again.<br/><br/>Basically this movie can be broken into two halves. The first is the teen comedy half, which is the first half. I am not joking when I say that during this section of the movie there is non-stop nudity. Barely a minute goes by before another pair of breasts pop up on the screen. This is also where the characters are established. You have the Icelander who just seems to always be getting laid. You have the sensitive guy who may possibly be questioning his sexuality (more on this later), and you have the jerk, who is the main character. Pretty thin characters, but they work. You never really care about them in the first half though.<br/><br/>The second half is where things get good. This is the balls to the wall horror half. The violence in this section is surprisingly restrained when it comes to the actual torture of certain characters. More is implied than is actually shown, and it works. It makes you feel bad for these characters, even if you hated them before. The stuff that isn't shown is what makes this effective. You can hear everything, you can see glimpses of what is happening, but it's never hardcore in your face. The real gore comes when (Spoiler Warning) the bad guys (and girls) get what's coming to them. That is probably what I loved the most. The audience isn't left just feeling terrible. We are given some form of justice. It's during these scenes that Eli Roth's dark humor emerges, and it works. I was rooting for the hero, and you get to see how these people are dispatched in full detail. It's not as gut wrenching, because these characters deserve what they get, but it's just as fulfilling.<br/><br/>Now, the reason I mentioned the one character who might be questioning his sexuality is because of a review I read. The review went off on how homophobic the film is. The film itself isn't homophobic, but the characters are. The word fag is thrown around constantly, and there are several jokes made at the above mentioned character's expense. Still, as a gay man I wasn't really offended. Why? Because I know how guys like this act, and guess what, they act exactly like that. The sensitive guy is shown being extremely homophobic in one scene and then in another he's returning the same flirtatious gesture with the man he had been yelling at before. It's interesting the way this is handled. It's not done to be cruel or degrading to the character. It's just done to give the character some dimension. The review also mentioned that most of the killers are portrayed has homosexual. That isn't true. The sexual aspect of the killers has nothing to do with the gender of the victim, but instead the violence of the act. Male or female, what turns these men on is the violent nature of the crime. So yes, while the film does frequently use derogatory terms towards homosexuals, I have to say, it's more because that's how these guys would realistically talk than anything else.<br/><br/>So, now that my little rant is over, I'll wrap this up. Hostel is a good movie. It's violent, it's darkly funny, and it has a pay off. It's not amazing, but it's good, and it gives you exactly what you would expect. I would recommend it, but with a warning: I've seen tons of violent horror movies, and I'm a bit jaded. The average movie goer would probably be very disturbed by the themes and portrayals of violence in this film. So, if you have a weak stomach, can't stand nudity, or flinch at extreme violence you should stay away.<br/><br/>And one note to parents. Obviously this is not a movie for children. The adds point this out perfectly. It's rated R for a reason. Still, this doesn't seem to be getting through to many of you. When I saw this movie a father brought three children, all of which had to be around 10 or under, to see it. Please, use the rating system. It's there to help you protect your children from films that they are probably not ready to see yet. This film contains extreme violence and some very dark sexual themes. Be smart, and think twice before taking a child to this movie, because in the end you are responsible for your children."

He may like this feeling but I would like to see what he could do with more psychological material. These are the true forms of horror. The movies that make you hind under your covers when you get home rather than make you sick to your stomach while you watch it. Wes Craven looked into this with Red Eye going from chop and crop cinema to a thriller. I think there is room for both forms.

","I thought I would do an informal review of the midnight screening of HOSTEL in Canada. Eli Roth and some of the actors were in attendance as Eli spent about 15 minutes prior to screening not only introducing the film, but also creating the atmosphere for all in attendance. He spoke of the decline of American horror films with specific references to House of Wax and Exorcism of Emily Rose and how American horror films are not ""ON PAR"" with the Japanese and South Korean horror films. Eli said that HE wanted to change American horror films and finally put America back on the map to compete against the South Koreans and Japanese horror film markets.<br/><br/>The midnight screening of HOSTEL played to a sold out crowd as every single seat in the Varsity 413 seat cinema was filled. After the Movie There was a 30 min Q&A session, At which an audience member called Eli Roth ""a sick motherf***cker to his face"" to which he thanked him and began to answer his question. <br/><br/>Now on to the review:<br/><br/>Hostel is truly ground breaking in the horror American film genre. This is no PG-13 horror,but this movie definitely will get an NC-17 rating from the MPAA. This film IS ""on par"" with some of the South Korean horror (Oldboy, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance) and also some of Takeshi Mike's films (Audition, Ichi the Killer).In fact Takeshi Mike makes a small cameo in this movie which was treated with applause from the audience.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes of Hostel is slow as it tries to establish the feel and mood of the film. The film starts off in Amsterdam and slowly reaches its way to Bratislav , Prague. Essentially there are lots of breasts, and lots of nudity<br/><br/>After the first 20 minutes, be prepared to be disgusted, surprised, and be sweating in your seats. This movie is NOT for a young audience nor is it for teenagers. The rest of the movie which comprises of 2 fairly long torture scenes that I had to close my eyes is very graphic being both Gory and very violent.Also the tension is just supernal, i will briefly describe the tension scenes as follows ****SPOILER*** There are 2 scenes in the movie (just before the torture in the chairs)in which the audience only sees a black screen but can hear heavy breathing, heavy panting as the incumbent is tied up in the chair just waiting for his executioner. The other scene consists of a person just waking up from a coma, however, the camera switches to the perspective of the person in the chair. Therefore,offering only glimpses of the tools that are about to used in his execution. Excellent technique used by Eli Roth as both of these scene created tension within the movie****SPOILER FINISHED****<br/><br/>The film is beautiful to look at, as the scenery (around Bratislav) is almost breathtaking. The main bulk of the film happens in almost like a basement / dungeon-like setting. Eli presents his surroundings in a very scary way. So scary, that after the film,this movie still makes the hairs on your neck stand on end.<br/><br/>There's not much else I can say about the film without spoiling any other parts. This is a major step forward for both the filmmaker Eli Roth and the American horror Genre as most of the light hearted humor portions that were contained in Cabin Fever are taken out in replacement for very tense, gory action / torture / horror sequences.<br/><br/>Again this is definitely a hard R or NC-17 rated film aimed at adults ranging from 23-35.Most women would be disgusted or horrified by the amount of violence portrayed in this film. After I watched this film, all I could think of was the Sound Of Music to try and get this film out of my head. It was that disturbing!!<br/><br/>During the Q&A session, one audience member asked about the MPAA rating for this film. Eli responded by saying ""He feels like the person in the torture chair at the moment as the film has already been submitted to the MPAA and he's just waiting to hear back with their answer"" Eli also mentioned that we (the audience) should comment and write on websites to protect the director's cut version of the film and make sure that the version of HOSTEL we see in theaters will be the directors cut with either a Hard R rating or an NC-17 rating. Eli also said that Harry gave him the idea to make this movie based on a website that Harry provided Eli i would love to know the Url but i guess we will never know.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is great and most certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat both due to atmosphere and visual gore, I personally would put this movie on my favorites list of the year, this certainly is one to watch with the Guys.

","Slovakia is member country of EU (European Union). A M-E-M-B-E-R. Can you imagine how restrictive are conditions for membership in this club? What the amount of hard work was done into transforming the communist-ruled country into a modern, dynamic, parliamentary democracy with stable political system with one of the world's fastest growing GDP? In the fast track, within some 15 years? Would you think that EU membership will be ever possible for a junk country like the one depicted in this sort-of movie? Slovakia is member of NATO. Slovakia is the ally of USA in Iraq. It means, our soldiers are fighting, faced with the same conditions, risking their lives, as US soldiers do in Iraq. Recently, Slovakia lifted whole Iraq debt approaching US$150M, as one of a very few countries, following US steps. Is the movie Mr. Tarantino is presenting now to the world, the revenge for our attitude, to be part of the West? Because, evidently, Tarantino and co. is in war with US government, while we are pro-US, more than most of the EU countries. Maybe, he is in a war with the whole Western civilization, based on Christian concept of LIFE, in contrary to the concept of DEATH, so invoked in his movies, and a country with deep Christian roots is a good target for his aims. Apart of the cash he sucks from the audience, which evidently cannot be aware what plot is a part of."

Men don't scream like that when they're subjected to pain approaching, but not equivalent to organ failure. Their screams are much more piercing and non-human in nature. And when a man is using a power drill to penetrate human flesh, he's thinking about something very different in his mind, thoughts that are physically expressed in a very noticeable manner if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>My wife tells me that it's art and that it's aimed a broad audience rather than simply at experts.

Being a Catholic myself, I still understand that the torture scenes (which, while certainly clipped from the original version, are disturbing and horrible, make no mistake about it) are effective story building techniques. Claims that the movie ""never cuts to a reassuring shot"" aren't true. You don't see everything that happens with the torture, but the movie isn't tame in the least. It doesn't approach the level of Japanese shocker films in what it shows, but again, it's not tame.<br/><br/>I thought the movie had a disturbing plot which was relatively well fleshed out. I've heard people say ""there isn't even an ending"" which is such untrue garbage that it makes me laugh. It's a satisfying, gory, disturbing type of deal that is as far from ""nothing"" as can be.<br/><br/>If you have an interest in original violent horror, go ahead and see the movie.

","I can't believe I watched the entire movie. Lets start with the characters, they were wooden, stiff, almost emotionless even when trying to portray fright, horror, etc. I guess the word that may best fit is shallow. The storyline was weak, but, much more could have been done with it. With stronger three dimensional characters and less cliché' the film could have been a whole lot more than just a below average slasher flick, which is all I can really call this movie. The main turn-off for me was that the characters were almost robotic. I can't say this enough, and that in itself ruined the entire film for me. Sure there were a few turns that may not be in an average slasher film and a tiny bit of suspense, but, certainly not worth paying to see in a theater or even a rental. Wait awhile and it'll be on a UPN station late at night. Some of the gore was decent, but, it was far overshadowed by the lack of a strong ensemble cast. Some similar films that this reminds me of in a round-about way are the Freddy movies,and maybe Halloween although at least they had deep characterization and good casting Again, do not waste your hard earned money."

I never wanted to see anything he did again but this has an interesting premise and I DO like Jay Hernandez. I should have known better! Like his first film we are given characters that we don't know anything at all about (Hernandez and Richardson have NOTHING to work with) and we really don't like. Seriously--we're supposed to give a damn about two horny American boys who only want to have nonstop sex? Richardson and Hernandez are as good as they could be--meaning not very. <br/><br/>The script is terrible. Like I said the premise isn't bad but the dialogue is lousy AND offensive (I didn't like Hernandez saying ""That's so gay"" after anything went wrong) and the script doesn't make a lot of sense. The direction is off too--some shots were framed so badly I couldn't believe it! The gore is effective and extreme--but I didn't know or care who it was being done to.

"erk_68","8","5","8","19 November 2006"," A Fresh Breath of Air in an Otherwise Stale Genre
","Hostel is the perfect film for fans of the Horror scene in a time where a seemingly endless line-up of shoddy horror films continue to dilute the genre as a whole.<br/><br/>What starts off as appearing to be another generic ""fish out of water"" and ""road trip"" story premise, Hostel proves itself by offering something morea feasible and intriguing plot, even if it takes the entire length of the film to reach it.<br/><br/>In the former half of the film, there is a questionable level of nudity even with an ""R"" rating, whereas the latter half provides the same elevated level of subjective material, but in a more tasteful and grotesquely satisfying manner.<br/><br/>The characters, while providing a sufficient, yet inconsistent level of solid acting, lack the development that would have made the film truly stellar. Only one of the three protagonists is easily identifiable for the viewer, yet I still question Eli Roth's choice to turn a potentially memorable character into another bland horror film compilation of shallow human emotions. What is noteworthy regarding the characters however is the apparent level of moral development, which allots the viewer ample forgiveness for the initial shallow character introduction.<br/><br/>Where this film does excel is its ability to convey emotions that are the product of well-planned and well-paced story progression. Rather than succumbing to sudden plot twists to proved a story that ultimately leaves the viewer with little to no afterthought, intrinsic details carefully placed into every scene progress the film at an even pace. As a result, the on-screen character's emotions are implanted into the viewer's minds, which makes for an unprecedented feeling of insecurity and helplessness in the horror genre.<br/><br/>The most surprising aspect of the film is the lack of any final plot twist which has become commonplace in the horror genre. This surprise is strongly welcomed and really concludes the formerly lacking story well. My only gripe regarding the story is that there really isn't one until just before the credits roll.<br/><br/>While there are aspects of this film that could use some fine tuning, the lasting result is a much-needed level of satisfaction for horror fans. Those with weak stomachs are advised to stay clear of this movie, but even casual fans of the genre should check it out."
"cool_cool_1","7","5","8","19 August 2006"," A horror film post 1990 thats actually GOOD!!!!
","Hostel (2005) is a breathe of fresh air for the horror film genre, all we tend to get nowadays is remake after remake, or just general C-grade rubbish with Z-grade actors, so this film surprised and entertained me thats for sure! 80% of horror films that come out these days just don't entertain or thrill me and i lose interest with them before even making it to the end, but this was a great film from an upcoming horror director in Eli Roth.<br/><br/>The story is about 3 young men, 2 Americans and 1 European, who are on their travels around Europe searching for the sexiest and horniest women for lots of fun and hot sex!!!! They get told about this Hostel in Slovakia where the girls are gorgeous and dirty, so obviously they make their way out there to see what it's all about, and sure enough at the hostel there are loads of gorgeous young women with great bodies who are up for fun!!!! Everything seems to be going well until strange things start happening, the Americans European friend suddenly goes missing without a trace............. and it appears that the local's aren't as nice and friendly as they initially seem!!! As the 2 American guys try to work out whats going on, they later discover a run down old building where there is a sick business going on, and torture and killing is on the menu.<br/><br/>Can the Americans survive this Slovakian evil or will they just become another victim!!! I thought Hostel was a very entertaining horror film, the actors all did a good job, the girls were lovely and there was lots of nudity which is always a good thing, and of course the gore....... yep there was quite abit of blood and gore too.<br/><br/>Along with The Hills have eyes remake, i thought this was the best horror film in recent years and i highly recommend it. 8/10"
"jaredmobarak","8","5","8","23 July 2006"," Elite HuntingHostel
","I have to applaud writer/director Eli Roth for what he has created in Hostel. To me this film is not as much a horror flick as a thriller told with all the gruesome brutality intact. There are no scares, no haunting music crescendoing, and no jump in your seat moments that we expect from the genre. Yes, we get blood and gore and uncut severing of body parts, the film is definitely not for the squeamish, however, Roth tells it in such a way that we as an audience are involved and invested in these characters. We saw the torture in the previews and think this is what the movie will be in totality, when instead we are shown a couple of kids backpacking through Europe before grad school. These kids roam free until their better judgment lead them to their destruction.<br/><br/>Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson are perfectly cast. Hernandez's Paxton is ready for a good time, or as many as he can with as many different women possible; Richardson's Josh, on the other hand, has just broken up with his girlfriend and is reluctant to join in the fun. His nervousness is portrayed realistically and you can believe these two guys are old friends and have each other's backs. They even meet a horny Icelander Oli played with comic genius by Eythor Gudjonsson. He is a kindred spirit, although probably a decade older than the boys, and the three are having a blast in Europe when the suggestion of perfect, sex-crazed girls in Slovakia is dropped into their consciousness. They continue their trek east and all goes to plan, meeting two vixens, including the gorgeous, Monica Bellucci lookalike, Barbara Nedeljakova, who show them a good time. A good time, that is, until Oli goes missing and hell begins.<br/><br/>Eli Roth has woven a suspenseful yarn that totally came out of left field. He shows us a more serious take on a premise like the comedy EuroTrip for the first forty or so minutes of a ninety-minute film. We know what is going to happen, and yet he teases us by giving the exact opposite to the gore we have come to see. This tactic allows us to settle in and get to know our protagonists, learn their backgrounds and motives. The attention to detail here makes what happens in the second and final act that much more visceral. These are innocents roped into an underground game of deception and profit. They don't deserve what is about to happen and we root for them that much more. Each small bit of exposition into their lives also pays dividends later on to help us cope with some of the things they do. Remember the memory shared by Jay Hernandez about a drowning girl from his past. This story helps setup why he does what he does towards the end. Old horror rules don't apply here, people don't act stupid and run towards the killers; they have distinct reasons for what they do and the entire film is carefully orchestrated as such.<br/><br/>Other reasons to see the film include actor Jan Vlasák as the Dutch businessman our leads encounter on their journey east. He has the intellectual creepiness his character needs to be a success. The mannerisms and involuntary shake of the hands add substance and layers to a role that isn't explained as much as the others. Each action of his speaks louder than any words could. Also, the cinematography is worth watching on its own. We are treated viscerally by grimy, disease-infested scenery shrouded in darkness. Roth uses abstract angles throughout the film keeping the audience off-kilter and prone, so that the assault has the utmost impact. More than visuals, though, is the aural quality of many scenes. On multiple occasions we are stopped on static framing while the sounds of what's about to happen fill your ears. If you feel any fear during this movie it's in the anticipation perfectly laid forth by the sound preceding every act seen, as with thunder being followed by lightning.<br/><br/>Hostel has everything you could want in a horror/thriller. The suspense is heavy and never overplayed to cause boredom from the waiting. I think this fact might actually hurt the planned sequel being written now by Roth. Hopefully the fact that he is continuing the story at the exact point the first ended will help in getting the audience involved right away; not having the same long period of setup before the payoff, making it essentially the same movie with different characters. Either way, count me in for part two. Any movie that includes great songs like the Sneakerpimps' How Do and pop culture cameos like horror-maestro Takashi Miike is good in my book."

Although Hostel is not as consistently nasty as those films there are a handful of scenes that definitely won't work wonders for the faint-hearted.

It exploited and objectified women, showed lots of graphic violence and was filled with foul language. Maybe you're not familiar with the work of Lucio Fulci, Joe D'Amato, or even Dario Argento but this sort of thing thrived in the 80's. Anyway, about the movie. The only thing that bothered me was the abundance of inane dialogue among the Americans, proving that most of us between the ages of 18-30 can't say a single sentence without using the ""F"" word. But that's what you get when you rent a ""teen"" movie nowadays (Look at ""The Girl Next Door"" for example.). Two American college students take a trip across Europe looking to party and find some girls. They do just that and the audience is treated to some of the most explicit sex scenes I've seen in a while. One is kidnapped and taken to a slaughterhouse to be tortured and killed. Why? You'll have to watch and find out. The second half of the movie is for die-hard gore lovers only. It's got some truly revolting make-up effects, including an eyeball scene that would have made Lucio Fulci nauseous. See this movie if you're tired of those other slick, glossed over, minimal violence, new horror movies."

","With Hostel, Director Eli Roth set out to make the most horrifying film that he could. Pre-release announcements promised that the film would be 'wild', 'ultra violent', 'sick' and 'disturbing' and close in tone to Takeshi Miike's ""Audition"" or Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". The wonderful marketing, including a suitably grimy website and the inclusion of industry whore Tarantino's name on publicity material, suggested that the film would be a milestone in grindhouse horror. Expectations were high, to say the least.<br/><br/>Sadly, Roth has failed in every way possible to achieve his goal. The result is a good example of how a great premise can be thrown away by a poorly developed script and bad direction.<br/><br/>The story follows three backpackers who travel to Bratislava in order to find a hostel in which the women are reputedly super hot and up for sex 24/7. The guys soon wish that they had followed their original plan to go to Barcelona when, one by one, they are abducted, taken to a charnel house and attacked by sickos who have payed for the pleasure of inflicting pain, misery and death.<br/><br/>A talented writer and director could have crafted a gruelling terror classic from this interesting premise, but Eli Roth is neither and he screws up from the word go. The first 45 minutes or so (roughly half the total running time) is spent following the sexploits of the three young men as they sample the delights of Amsterdamn. There is plenty of nudity, but nothing that can be classed as 'wild', 'sick' or 'disturbing'. In the next 15 minutes, we follow the annoying trio to the titular hostel, where we get more nudity (and absolutely no horror).<br/><br/>Finally, Roth decides he has had enough of filming tits and ass and begins the bloodletting. For a while, the film delivers on its promisesthe backpackers are abducted one by one and we get to witness some great gore courtesy of make-up maestros Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger; leg drilling, tendon slicing, chainsaw slashing and assorted bloody gunshots drench the screen with blood.<br/><br/>However, it is not long before the film enters the realms of idiocy again with the escape of the final backpacker. Having freed himself and made his way to a car undetected (it even has the key in the ignition!), our plucky survivor turns back to rescue someone he hardly knowsa Japanese girl he met the day before, who is already being worked over by a maniac with a blowtorch. From this point onwards, any semblance of logic and plausibility goes out the window and the audience is treated to a trio of classic unintentionally-funny moments: the three-in-one hit-and-run, the street children attacking the bad guys in exchange for bubblegum and the 'tragic' suicide by speeding train.<br/><br/>With Eli Roth citing 'The Vanishing', 'Sympathy for Mr Vengeance', 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer', and 'The Wicker Man' as influences, one does wonder what the hell he was thinking whilst making Hostel, a film that has absolutely nothing in common with these masterpieces. Hostel is entertaining in a hokey waytits, ass, guts and blood are classic schlock horror elements and all score points with mebut it is far from the gruelling and relentless shocker that Roth had promised to deliver."

","After hearing people say that this film was a gore fest i had to see for myself. what i found was a truly brilliant example of artistic precision. <br/><br/>this film shows the true ugly side of human nature, it shows that there is a repressed, grotesque side in every human being that is capable of being unleashed. where the idea for the film came from is a horrifying thought process, a truly horrific scenario to be caught in with people that have a truly evil take on life. what this film does is install just a horrifying natter-gram of the feeling that the tortured people go through. some people have said after this film that some of the more horrifying acts are uncalled for, i would disagree and suggest that the degree of torture is only just applicable anything more explicit and this film would be truly terrifying to 90% of the people that watch it. All in all this is a really good film, with the first half being put displayed in a very poetic yet explicit manner. i feel that some parts of the second half could have been done differently but all in all this is a very good film for the film lover not so much for the commercial film lover."

","Before seeing this movie I did not know it was from the same director as Cabin Fever. Realising it was Eli Roth I have to say I have become a fan most definitely. I really enjoyed Cabin Fever and thought Hostel was even better. <br/><br/>At first knowing it was presented by Quentin Tarantino and having read and seen a lot of hype about it on the internet I knew it was a movie I was going to enjoy. <br/><br/>From a cast of almost unknowns or newbies they did a good job in convincing the horror and terror of their situation although I did not like Oli the guy from Iceland who was just plain annoying. <br/><br/>Firstly the movie features some gorgeous eastern European women nude a lot of the time which was a plus for the guys, but as it goes on we're soon presented with the real horror, terror and gore that awaits them presented to us in graphic detail. Makes you kinda think ""does something like that really exist"" and could make you think twice about visiting Slovakia :) for the sole purpose of meeting beautiful women. <br/><br/>I think a lot of the gore could of came from ideas taken from a lot of Asian horrors as being a horror fan myself I have seen plenty of Japanese and Korean horror movies although a lot of them haven't been as good as Hostel. <br/><br/>Another thing was that I found myself laughing at some scenes, not in a bad way though. I'm not sure whether the humor was intended or just me. Although it wasn't the scariest of horrors I have seen I really enjoyed this movie as I thought it was pretty fresh, in particular for the US market. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend any horror fan to go see this movie as I believe it is one that has resurrected the genre of horror. Will definitely get it out on DVD when it is released as I have read there is an alternative ending on it. <br/><br/>A final note I would like to make is that if you liked this you should definitely see Takashi Miikes 'Audition'. Probably the best horror movie ever."
"msquared","7","3","4","25 March 2006"," Amazing - a US horror that's actually good!
","Hostel is that rare thing these days - an American horror movie that actually delivers. Whereas most current Hollywood ""horrors"" are anaemic affairs that sacrifice scares for laughs and tend to have their characters sneer instead of scream, Hostel goes for the jugular with some genuinely harrowing moments (you'll never see toenail clippings in the same way again). Eli Roth seems to have taken a tip from the 1970s, the golden age of horror, by placing his protagonists in unfamiliar surroundings, stripping them of all comforts and subjecting them to such horrendous ordeals that, to paraphrase Tobe Hooper, the audience really doesn't know 'who will survive and what will be left of them.'<br/><br/>Beginning innocuously enough with two fresh-faced American backpackers doing hash and whores in Holland, Roth slowly cranks up the tension by having the hapless teens encounter a guy who tells them that if they're looking for hot chicks then they just have to visit a hostel in a remote town in Slovakia. Mocking the young Americans' ignorance by casually referring to a non-existent war, and making out that the women of Eastern Europe are still living life as though they were in a Soviet state of the 1980s, pretty soon this silver-tongued creep has convinced the teens and their Icelandic buddy to take a chance. One unsettling train journey later, and the boys believe that all their wishes have come at once, as beautiful, buxom, naturist girlies frolic for them at the legendary hostel.<br/><br/>Of course, this is just the flypaper. Pretty quickly, the Icelander is missing, and it gradually becomes apparent that the hostel is the front for something sinister.<br/><br/>Crossing over into exploitation by featuring acres of female skin and full frontal scenes, Hostel fondly recalls the political incorrectness of so many 1970s British horror movies, combining this with the gutsy gore of 1980s American shockers. However, Roth ensures that this is more than just a tribute with some neat directorial touches and motifs, contrasting the light S&M fetishes in the Dutch brothels with the truly awful fate of the Slovak hostelers. He also keeps things interesting with a twist two thirds of the way through the movie.<br/><br/>Hostel's not a perfect film - the script lacks the anger or isolation that defines the greatest genre films. The greatest horror directors (Walker, Kubrick, Romero) seem to retain an ambivalence towards the material that Roth lacks - it feels like he enjoys this to much to be repelled by it. But this is worth more than a hundred Screams or Final Destinations because it does not try to humourise the horror, or make light of the characters' ordeals: no-one can come out of this smiling. Superior to Cabin Fever, most certainly, and pretty much on a par with recent hits such as Wolf Creek and The Descent, Hostel is the best US horror I've seen for some time. See it."

","I have been eagerly awaiting the release of this movie, as it had been a long time since I'd seen a good horror film, so the expectation for Hostel was quite high. I have to say that, after a slow start, it didn't disappoint once the action got going.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film was a bit of a damp squib I must admit, the 3 main characters were just irritating, stock horror movie guys. Once the horror really started to kick in, though I was pleased that they developed to the point where I actually cared what happened to them. With the exception of Oli, the Icelandic guy, who, it must be said, got on my nerves so much that I was thinking ""if he isn't killed soon I'm gonna jump in there and do it myself."" By the end of the movie I was hooked and disturbed, there are some truly gory scenes and the overall premise -people paying to experience the feeling of torturing and killing someone- is an extremely scary one, which could easily have been based on a true story, in my opinion.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend this movie, for horror fans, but bring a cushion to hide behind. It's stuck in my mind relentlessly, which, for me is the mark of a good horror flick."
"hollyr-4","8","3","4","13 March 2006"," Pretty friggin' sweet if you ask me
","Yes, many may think that Hostel was a terrible movie because it wasn't your normal horror film. It starts off slow, but without that the movie would not have the same effect. Evertyhing seemed nice in the beginning for the characters and for the viewers and then WHAM everyone is plunged into this hell in eastern Europe. I personally found the film horrifying and graphic and Quentin Torantino did an excellent job. Another aspect of the film that I really enjoyed was the music. It was electrifying and made the environment of the film ten times more suspenseful. The torture scenes were very graphic and real, it wasn't just about slitting someones throat or putting a gun to their head. It was psychological for the characters and viewers. The whole point of the torture scenes were to mess up the minds of the victims instead of flat out killing them. I thoroughly enjoyed Hostel and will watch it again and recommend it for any horror movie lovers."
"insomniac_rod","7","3","4","6 March 2006"," Roth uses the right influences plus his unique raw style.
","""Hostel"" is one of the new generation movies that tend to bring back to life the exploitation sub-genre, of course, in light, R-rated versions.<br/><br/>I know that comparisons are not always necessary but I have to say that Roth is HEAVILY inspired by Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Don't get me wrong, I give my respect to Roth for being brave enough by creating ""Cabin Fever"" and ""Hostel"". It takes guts to produce these kind of movies in a world that consumes PG-13 Horror flicks. Roth seems to don't give a sh** about making money, but he wants the respect of fans of the genre. <br/><br/>Anyways, I compare it to TCM (1974 of course) mainly because it has the same basic plot elements: torture, sadistic people, symphaty for the main characters, extreme violence, and a creepy setting. <br/><br/>The plot is as simple as it gets: Two American boys along with a drunken fun guy from Iceland plan their ""spring break"" style trip to Europe, not Cancun or Ibiza. A series of events lead them to a hostel in Slovakia where they meet a cruel fate after partying with no limits. One by one these guys are getting slaughtered and butchered by savage town people as a part of an ""art exposition"" or something like that. It's not like they had bad luck, because these people kill any foreign tourists. <br/><br/>Why? and who is behind these atrocious activities? What's behind the purpose of killing? Could it be something with economical purpose? You need to witness the interesting motives. <br/><br/>""Hostel"" isn't by any means a shocking Horror flick for those who have seen exploitation flicks from the 70's or heavily violent Slashers from the 80's. The movie succeeds in delivering extreme violence, glorious blood (thanks to the f/x team!!), and raw violence. We got smashed heads (those children really had a bad behavior, where were their parents?), severed bodies, butchered body parts, and the good old chainsaw violence. What else could you ask for? <br/><br/>* The highlights of the movie, in my opinion * 1. When Paxton witnesses brutality towards people. The events he looked at really looked like scenes taken away from a snuff film. 2. The now infamous ""eye cut"" scene. Poor Kana. The scene is memorable and will soon become a favorite among fans of the genre.<br/><br/>The movie goes directly to the point after you get used and feel symphaty with the characters. After the mix of sex, HOT women, alcohol, sex, and more sex, we are driven through a torture ride without asking for our permission. Now violence, blood, gore, more violence, and violence substitute sex and chicks. I liked the abrupt change! Roth knows how to create tension and make the audience feel disturbed by the movie's events. This guy is going to get far in the genre. He takes the right influences (TCM mainly). <br/><br/>Jay Hernàndez delivers a believable strong performance. The man knows how to demonstrate pain and desperation. Oli was my favorite character. It seems that the actor is really a party animal. Nice casting overall. Likable villains also. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Hostel"" is a decent Horror flick which doesn't relies 100% it's gore and violence on it. The movie does have a plot (minimal if you say) and good production values. I really prefer this new wave of film making than PG-13 or R-rated re-makes."
"qoncept","3","3","4","10 January 2006"," I wanted to like it..
","First of, let me mention that I've never reviewed a movie before. I make no claim of being good at it, I can offer no explanation as to why anyone should listen to me, but here are my thoughts. I've read about 5 of the reviews on here, and I feel like they've missed the mark quite badly. After the movie, I found myself defending Hostel to my wife more than I even felt it deserved. Apparently this is a love it or hate it type of movie, but I didn't do either -- I just thought it was pretty bad.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the film through about an hour was that there was absolutely no plot. A few guys go to Slovakia and get tortured. It wasn't till right at the end that the plot made itself apparent and Hostel finally seemed to have some value as a film. Without giving away any of the details, I'd say, at this point, Hostel seemed to have a great premise for a film -- unfortunately it didn't pull it off.<br/><br/>Hostel in no way attached me to the characters. While I've debated with myself how realistically they behaved, there's no getting around the fact that the characters were about as likable as any random college tough guy trying to start a fight at a bar -- and these are the guys we're supposed to be pulling for, relating to.<br/><br/>The plot setup took almost the entire movie. My wife said it'd be good for guys, because there were plenty of boobs, but we all have internet and can get that for free anyway. Once the action began, it was over in about 10 minutes. The movie wasn't horror -- there was never a moment I even felt like my heartrate MIGHT increase. And, overall, the whole movie seemed to have a playfull, weak, teenage feel to it, just like Cabin Fever.<br/><br/>I wanted to enjoy this movie. It seemed like it could be an intelligent horror/thriller, but from the very beginning it just wasn't. Quentin Tarrantino needs to stop putting his name on crap."
"edwarddfrankenstein","1","4","6","19 October 2019"," A bad influence on the genre
","I think that at this point in time we can all agree that the whole torture fad was an embarrassing period in horror history, right down there with cgi-heavy remakes and pg-13 teen-oriented garbage. During the era, directors thought that merely being unpleasant was enough to make their films scary. Unfortunately for them, that wasn't the case. The films lacked suspense and originality, and they didn't even have the trashiness that provides entertainment value to all but the worst of older horror films. Instead, we got plodding, idiotic, clinically directed films without scares or even unintentional humor. And for everyone who thought that they were original, note that everything they did was done better in the 60s and 70s by movies like The Wizard Of Gore. What the genre needs is to abandon CGI effects, and try to return to proper horror like that represented by directors like Romero, Carpenter, or Cronenberg (or Roger Corman, Herschel Gordon Lewis, and Ed Wood, to go a different route)."
"facebookfredrik","2","4","6","23 June 2014"," Perverse
","Perverse - that's the only thing I can say about this movie. Only sick people would come up with a script like that and only sick people would like to watch it.<br/><br/>It's got absolutely no scare-value at all. The sexual references in the beginning of the film makes the whole movie appear like a movie for real life Hanibal Lecters who get sexual pleasure from watching people being tortured to death.<br/><br/>I don't have any issues with gore *per se*. It's not the gore in this film that disturbs me, but the thought of the people who enjoyed making or watching it. Gore can be scary, gore can contribute to making a story more exciting, gore can even be funny (bad taste, etc). In all those cases, the filmmakers are using our repulsion for gore.<br/><br/>This movie is using gore in the complete opposite way. We're supposed to take pleasure in it, and then it just becomes sick."
"petra_ste","1","4","6","3 August 2007"," Torturing idiots
","What's up with horror movies today? Either they are wimpy, toothless stuff or they rely only on violence, forgetting character development, pacing and other essential elements of the genre. Both extremes stink: Hostel falls squarely in the latter group. <br/><br/>Three sex-starved friends reach a town in Eastern Europe and meet a group of attractive, suspiciously friendly local girls. One after another the friends disappear, only to wake up in a dark room tied to a chair.<br/><br/>Torture is not interesting - and it's not scary or entertaining, just unpleasant. What's sad is the idea beneath Hostel had potential. Every time one of the protagonists vanishes there are intriguing bits with a creepy atmosphere and the growing realization something horrible is happening. <br/><br/>Hostel features also an attempt at subtext about the comparison between sexual tourism and ""torture tourism"" by sadists who pay the hostel to bring them victims. But the movie squanders mood and social commentary and goes for cheap, gratuitous gore. The unnecessarily long first act is a crass teen comedy, the last part essentially plays as a snuff movie - ""tonally inconsistent"" doesn't quite convey it. <br/><br/>Worth no viewings.<br/><br/>1/10"

","This, unlike your typical ""slasher"" is truly disturbing. I found this so, not because of violence but for the representation of hatred towards the fellow man.<br/><br/>This hatred is directed to westerners, specifically American's. It leaves you asking do foreign cultures really think this way? How many people dream about torturing people from wealthier, ""happier"" cultures like that of the U.S.A, U.K, Australia, Japan etc.? <br/><br/>The setting is perfect: Slokakia, known to many as a gloomy, poor nation in Eastern Europe. The victims are perfect: ""Happy-go-lucky"", promiscuous teenagers on vacation. The perfect juxtaposition exists between villains and victims. The poor, angry and jealous Eastern Europeans against these, more prosperous American's. It's one cultures revenge against another, through jealousy.<br/><br/>In the end who are the real victims, who are the real villains? <br/><br/>An ideal infusion of strong imagery, violence, suffering and revenge make this an entertaining film for most horror movie fans.<br/><br/>In the end this is an above average modern portrayal of the dark side of the human psyche and humanity in general."
"giomanombre","8","4","6","5 November 2006"," Discourages people to go on sex tours.
","I think this movie presents a good argument against going on a hedonistic sex tour on a few different fronts: 1) If you go on a hedonistic sex tour, and pay money to bang babes, then equally some sadist may pay money to torture and kill you. The fact is, when an institution is sick or evil, you could also be a victim. The very concept of the sex tour is that a woman is a commodity that can be purchased - but there is no limit on what can be commidified as long as there is a market for it.<br/><br/>2) Second of all, suppose you start getting becoming a more depraved and sick human afterwards. A character that was during the torturing to an Asian woman apparently went on lots of sex tours, and wanted bigger highs and thrills and eventually ended up doing that. It's like some sort of progression. Starts with a hedonistic sex tour with normal women, then more depravity, it goes to sex with children, more depravity, it comes to snuff, more depravity, torture and killing, etc....<br/><br/>As a young virgin guy, I identified with the characters wanting to get laid in Europe, and sure, that's a guy thing. I really identified with them and was totally sympathetic. Although they wanted to get laid, they never hurt or tortured anyone and could never have deserved that.<br/><br/>The movie has a stead progression from an American pie movie, to a horror movie to a revenge movie and had a nice tone to it - but the problem with the movie is that it is just too evil - I felt like paying to watch a movie like that seems sick. It's a sick movie, but it has raised some points.<br/><br/>If anyone ever thinks of going to Thialand, Costa Rica, or any sex-tour places to explore hedonistic pleasure - then in the back of my mind there could be some evil lurking.<br/><br/>Another aspect is that normal types of people can just be diabolical evil monsters. You don't know what people would do if they had no limitations. Super rich people can buy themselves out of anything, and the movie potentially taints rich people as potentially being sadistic monsters that pay to break the law in third world countries where anything can be bought."
"MovieAddict2016","5","4","6","26 June 2006"," It's either a severely mis-advertised comedy or a terrible horror film - but I will admit I was entertained
","I still can't decide whether ""Hostel"" is a mis-marketed comedy or a terrible excuse for a horror film. It's no surprise Quentin Tarantino produced it - he loved ""Wolf Creek,"" which was also very gory - but ""Wolf Creek"" was scary and well-made whereas ""Hostel"" was cheesy, humorous and so unbelievably over-the-top I didn't know whether to laugh or be afraid.<br/><br/>I had heard people talking about the excessive gore - but it's all goofy. The girl with her eyeball hanging out looks like she has a cheap '80s monster movie effect glued to her. A few parts made me cringe in anticipation, because I _thought_ something gruesome was going to happen - but it always turned out being more funny than anything.<br/><br/>Some critics said it's a satire of American tourism. I doubt it. I don't think Eli Roth is that smart. I think he wanted to make something fairly tongue-in-cheek while at the same time satisfying his lust for blood. (He loves blood in horror movies - check out his list of favorites or his previous film, ""Cabin Fever,"" which is what attracted QT to producing this movie.) The first hour is a teen sex comedy with three guys (Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Gudjonsson) traveling to Europe to experience a good time. They visit seedy Dutch locales and see loads of American tourists (""Are there even any Dutch people here?!""), then travel farther east and wind up going to a hostel where they share a room with two hot, constantly-naked babes who apparently are unaware of the material we would refer to as ""clothing."" This is where I began to feel my intelligence become gradually insulted. Was Roth satirizing American stereotypes of Eastern-European countries? Was he satirizing the horror genre's gratuitous nudity? Or was he just buying time to get to the blood n' guts and figured he'd fill up the running time by getting some really gorgeous women naked on set for the hell of it? I think it was probably the last one.<br/><br/>After all the random nudity, sex and American machismo, the movie suddenly veers into ""horror"" territory by showing weird Slovakian perverts slicing n' dicing American tourists for their sick pleasure. Uh, yeah! I forgot to mention something: this film purports to be based on ""a true story."" Riiiight. (According to Roth, he saw a mysterious website once - that he strangely hasn't seen again since - advertising a similar experience for paying customers. I think perhaps Mr. Roth was smoking something at the time, but we'll never know, I guess.) The rest of the movie is pointless to divulge any further into. Suffice to say, if you like really cheesy movies that rely solely on gratuitous violence to scare you, this will be right up your alley.<br/><br/>Personally, I didn't find it scary at all. The beginning - the sex stuff - is scarier than the actual violence later on because it has atmosphere and an air of anticipation - you know something bad is going to happen. And the movie works best in this mode. Once it starts exploiting the torture and violence, it just becomes laughable and predictable. And then, of course, we get the stereotypical hero who is too stupid to realize that if he escapes alone he can send back help for ALL the people rather than risk his life to go back into the hostel to rescue ONE person.<br/><br/>Eh, what does he know, anyway. Dumb American tourist. (See - I can make fun of tourists like Mr. Roth, too!)"

It is a film that shows how truly sickening our race can be, and how truly just we can be. It shows us that the world is not a safe place, yet there is something we can do about it. The film is realistic, smart, and truthful. They would not just make this stuff up and say it was real, if I thought of this idea on my own I would take all the credit for it.

","With so much hype surrounding this movie plus Quentin Tarantino's named tacked on, I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up too high. I did and was let down. Mind you, the special effects used during the torture scenes were exceptional. However, if you make a movie like this and bill it as a torture film with the brutal scenes then that's what it should be. I can understand the absence of character development and weightlessness of the film's plot in a movie like this because typically horror/slasher films aren't concerned with these aspects. But if you leave these elements completely out you have to compensate with excessive gore and violence. Maybe this reveals a dark side of my filmgoing expectations but the torture scenes, i.e. the horror scenes, totaled maybe 15-20 minutes of this 1.5 hour film, that's about 20% of a movie that was hyped to be incredibly graphic and disgusting. There were 1 or 2 moments where I actually did physically dry heave (pretty sure the girl sitting in front of me thought I lost it in her hair), but that was it. Honestly, I have scene more graphic horror sequences in the modern horror staples such as ""Friday the 13th"" and the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Halloween"" series. ""Cabin Fever,"" director Eli Roth's previous horror film is one of the most underrated horror/slasher/indie style films and more graphic and gut-wrenching than ""Hostel"". And I'm not sure why Tarantino is tacking his name onto projects he normally wouldn't be affiliated, but I guess he has a reason. If you're a fan of horror, I would wait until this comes out on DVD. There are some scenes that will make the average person squirm and feel their gut rolling, but the sick-to-your-stomach feeling is strongest as you walk out of the theater realizing you wasted 9 dollars on a sub-par film. If you haven't scene ""Cabin Fever,"" go rent that and wait for ""Hostel"" to join the DVD library a few months from now."

","First off, I'm not a fan of horror movies in general: the acting is usually bad, the plots are too contrived, and the violence (when present) doesn't add very much. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. The acting was believable and authentic, and the story, although still a bit far fetched, was compelling enough to not have one saying ""Oh come on"" every five minutes. The notorious violence that the movie was supposed to showcase in all its graphic glory was actually restrained in my opinion, and not nearly as bad as the commercials make it seem. Still, this movie is definitely not for the faint hearted; some of the scenes will leave you cringing and maybe even looking away for a few moments. But overall, it is not as gory as one might be led to believe. If you can stand some intense but brief scenes, you will walk away quite satisfied, and certainly not wanting to visit Eastern European hostels any time soon!"

"mkw-5","1","9","18","30 January 2006"," A truly sick movie
","First of all, this movie made me wanna go to Amsterdam. All the fun seems to happen there. But it seems to be kind of fun that you need money to. Let's get serious. The set-up for this film is fascinating: It's realistic. The actors/directing are bad, but that doesn't ruin anything, as a matter of fact that fits to this kind of film. Also the photography seems a little pretentiously ""artistic"" or ""raw"", but that's also the usual standard in new movies. The ""after-effects"" (coloring etc.) added to the pictures are also really ugly. (The pretentiousness brings to my mind Steven Soderberg, especially ""Traffic"".) It seems like no-one in the film crews today has any kind of artistic interests, or anything they want to say or do. They just do their job without thinking anything. Actually it's an ugly film in every way; Also the people and the portrayals of the human relations (and of course the ""human condition"") are quite cynical. For example: All the women in this movie are brainless prostitutes. At least to me it remains unclear if the director wants to say something or not. The script is already so bad that I think no director could do a good movie of it. Or even want to try. It's a mystery to me why make movies (with millions and millions of dollars) without the slightest idea, point or inspiration, or any need to do something. Or maybe they just have to make up some work for the thousands of people who work in the film industry. The factories has to keep rolling, even if no-one would need their products. There is no life in this movie. I don't know is this movie supposed to be exciting or scary? The characters are so artificial and plastic that I cannot relate to them as human beings. I'm not interested at all what happens to them.<br/><br/>A funny idea came to me while watching this film: Fassbinder could have done this. It has the same kind of overall feeling of total negativity and nihilism that he had in his films (except ""Angst essen seele auf"" maybe). Of course Fassbinder's movie wouldn't have included this many ""exciting"" or ""entertaining"" plot turns or events, and it would have been visually even uglier than this. This is one of the most disturbed movies I've seen; It doesn't have any humor or balance (which for example all the ""gore"" of horror movies I've seen do have), only total darkness and pessimism. I'm not the biggest fans of Tarantino, but I noticed that he has produced this film (and they try to sell it with his name for no doubt). I really wonder why he wants to support this kind of ****. He could put his money on charity or something. Or give them to me.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie that takes place in a hotel or a hostel, see ""Hotel Rhuanda"" instead."
"cabal699","1","9","18","15 January 2006"," What was Quentin thinking?????
","I have never written a review before on IMDb, so if this sounds stupid you will have to forgive me, I'm writing out of anger. I have just returned from seeing Hostel, and I can't stress enough. Do not waste your money on this film!!! I was so excited to see this! First of all I'm a huge fan of the horror genre, second I think that Tarentino is amazing. So, after reading a lot about this film online I couldn't wait to see it, even though it was directed by Eli Roth. Well all I can say is Cabin Fever II. It was that bad. <br/><br/>Now, because I'm such a fan of horror movies I've sat through a lot of bad acting and cheesy plots. However, as far as I'm concerned that's what horror is all about. I personally think that you only have to follow one basic rule with horror. Either make people love your characters so much that you want them to make it, or make them so annoying that you can't wait to see them die. The rest is free game. If you have that I can sit through the worst acting in the world. I was so bored with this film I didn't care either way who lived or died.<br/><br/>This film basically once again proved to me that American horror is dead. I would say that horror films in general are dead if it wasn't for amazing films like High Tension and the too many to name Asian horror films out there.<br/><br/>Again don't waste your money."
"strain6","10","9","18","7 January 2006"," A Fun Little Shocker
","My first choice for a movie this year was Hostel, and I am glad of it. It has what I like most in an entertainment - sex and violence. The last movie that I saw in 2005 was Wolf Creek. It was darker and grimmer. I liked Wolf Creek but I don't know that I could recommend it. Hostel is a hoot. The element of suspense is well done. The plot tripped me up a few times when I thought that I had everything figured out, and the fun doesn't stop till the final frame. All the actors do an excellent job. Whether technically accurate or not, again to my delight, the actresses have shaved their legs and their underarms. Hostel also functions, in a way, as a great tourist ad for Holland. I definitely want to go there. Not so much Eastern Europe. Hostel is what a Saturday matinée is all about. See it!"
"Boba_Fett1138","9","10","21","1 August 2006"," Is it possible that Eli Roth is the most misunderstood/underrated director of this decade?
","This movie is a more than great one for several reasons. It's not also a good refreshing and original horror movie but also a great, subtle social commentary.<br/><br/>Just think about it. Every horror element of horror movies of the past two decades are present here. Hot girls, lots of sex and nudity, graphic horror and a murderous psychopathic villain. Everything is made out extra large and is prominently present here in this movie, with as a result that it becomes almost a parody on these sort of other recent horror-flicks. Watching this movie really made me realize that Eli Roth understands the genre and sees what is wrong with it these days. He's a horror-fan that also happens to direct movies himself. Especially the first halve of the movie is mostly a parody. It's filled with nudity and sex and really feels over-the-top all. It's also filled with some great humor.<br/><br/>Yet this movie is also so much more than just reflection on horror movies of the past 2 decades. It's also a great social commentary. The Americans are portrayed as ignorant testosterone driven persons who are willing to travel halve over the world just to have sex and they also see the world through their own ignorant narrow minded eyes. For instance Amsterdam is filled with willing-girls at about basically every corner and all the city has to offer are coffee-shops. And everyone in Slovakia is poor and does literally everything for money and the country itself is gritty, cold, gray, boring and filled with old fashioned use objects such as cars, televisions and clothing, like time has stopped there during the cold war. And one of the torturers is OF COURSE a German. Some people call it racist but I see it as a great and perhaps even brilliant, subtle brought statement, made by Eli Roth. He shows how ignorant most Americans are about the world around them, by showing us the world through the eyes of the two main American characters. Everything is cliché filled and stereotypical but with a purpose. Not sure if it was done on purpose that every Dutch characters speaks German in this movie. I think it had more to do with budget reasons. It's easier to let an actor learn to speak German than Dutch. Still it feels pretty weird, since Quentin Tarantino, who was involved with this movie and who lived and worked in Amsterdam for a couple of years and always puts some Dutch elements into his movies (also in this one obviously), didn't pointed this out to Roth.<br/><br/>It's also funny to see how most people call this movie a predictable one. If there is a refreshingly original horror movie of the past few years, than it's ""Hostel"". You don't know who is the killer(s) and why and how things are happening, until like the last 30 minutes when everything becomes FULLY COMPLETELY clear. The movie goes in several directions at times and than suddenly turns the other way around. For instance the movie begins as a tripping, humor filled B-movie, that you can hardly take serious. But after that the movie suddenly becomes darker and mysterious and in the end it also becomes gory. The movie and its style go into several directions at times and the movie takes some great twist and turns. It fools the audience a couple of times. For instance who didn't thought that when they went into the 'torture museum' the main characters would get stuck there and the rest of the movie would be set in there. Or how about it that it's implied several times in the movie that one of the main characters is a homosexual. Nothing is really done with it in the movie but it's a great daring and subtle touch to make the main character look extra vulnerable and sensible. It was not necessary for Roth to put it in the movie, since nothing is done with it in the story but it's obviously put in there to fool us and makes us think that the movie is heading into a different direction with this extra added element.<br/><br/>The movie gets graphic but not until the end, when the movie fully turns into an horror movie. The movie might not be as gory and graphic as expected but it leaves a lot up to your own imagination. But still there are a couple of straight-forward graphic sequences, which are certainly not just for everyone.<br/><br/>The movie is fairly cheap looking which certainly does also add to the unique feeling and atmosphere of the movie. It's style is certainly unique. Although this movie is mostly a horror one, it never looses its sense of humor and is filled with humorous comical situations, dialog and whatever more. It makes ""Hostel"" above all an entertaining and amusing one to watch, even though it certainly also gets heavy in the end.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino calls Eli Roth 'the future of horror' for a very good reason. If there is one person who can bring back the horror-genre back to its roots and to what they were intended to be at the first place, it's Eli Roth. Simple, straight-forward and without a complicated or sensible plot. Hopefully in the next few years more people start to see this and shall this also inspire other directors and movie makers.<br/><br/>Perhaps you have to be familiar with the horror-genre and its movies of the last 2 decades and '70's and perhaps even older, to fully see and understand this movie the way Eli Roth intended us to see it. It's a movie that will most definitely please the fans of the genre, while most casual viewers might probably find this movie nothing more than a formulaic horror movie, with a simple story and just 'don't get' what is so special about it. (also hence the low rating (5.8) here at the moment.)<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"lunar_landing","4","10","21","17 September 2005"," a good idea gone wrong
","Okay, so, three backpackers (two American, one Icelandic) hear about this sexual paradise in Slovakia: a town full of gorgeous, horny women, who are desperate for male company since all the local men have been killed in the war. Of course, they waste no time getting there, where they discover, of course, that things are not what they seem. <br/><br/>The set up is more or less the same as 'The Beach', which is fine. The European locations and the cinematography all seem promising, but the movie falls flat pretty fast and stays there. There are scenes of imaginative gore, there are some beautiful women taking off their shirts, and that's about it. The film completely lacked suspense because we weren't given much of a reason to care about the characters. I found myself completely disengaged. Sure, I'll squirm when you show me someone getting chainsawed, but is that all there is? Increasing gruesome effects and nice camera work does not mean you've got a story. The main characters, who, in theory, we should be hoping will survive all the bloodshed, come off like shallow, annoying frat boys, but not SO annoying that you want them to die, which would at least be some way to connect to the movie. <br/><br/>Horror movies should not just be horrifying, but suspenseful as well, offering the audience a reason to think (or yell) 'Don't go in there you idiot!' Instead I found myself wondering if they shot the whole thing in Europe, or did the torture chamber scenes in a US studio. I was never scared - never even jolted - once during the whole screening. <br/><br/>As a post-script, Eli Roth was at the screening, and seemed like a nice enough guy."

"Quinoa1984","5","6","11","18 January 2006"," the first 'exploitation flick' of the year doesn't strike where it could've
","Eli Roth is a filmmaker I've heard about through the cult film 'Cabin Fever' and his latest film, Hostel, is presented by action-film maestro Quentin Tarantino, and produced by him and horror filmmaker Scott Spiegel. I wondered as the lights went up why Tarantino decided to put his name on the film. I can sort of understand why- as it brings out some grisly violent scenes, with enough gore to pack in his seeming enjoyment for it (see Kill Bill for details)- but also remembered that another film he was involved in, From Dusk Till Dawn, was quite similar. Dawn, also a film where it's sort of two topics converged into one 'exploitation' flick (which Tarantino himself might argue or not, depending on your pov of what's exploitive in the genre), was a much better film, with main characters (one of them played by QT himself) who were also violent, but somehow relatable. Roth's film here doesn't really give much to invest in the characters, and then when the film focuses on its final character's survival, it becomes not so much unbelievable- as I know by some point I SHOULD try to suspend disbelief- as it is empty.<br/><br/>I like a horror film to be something that actually gives me suspense, and if it shocks me then to back it up with something in the story, or with the characters, to give it some leverage. The first forty-five minutes or so of 'Hostel' just shows our main characters, Paxton and Josh, living it up in Amsterdam, then taking a tip on another Hostel (or practical prostitution palace) in Bratislava. There's nothing given at all to the character really, except that one is less inhibited than the other at times. Roth tries to add substance by giving the run-down city an almost Third Man feel (i.e. there's curious, dangerous beings all around, particularly children and other undesirables, everyone possibly 'in' on what the main characters aren't). But Roth as a writer isn't much concerned with spending that much time with these guys, unlike Tarantino did with his screenplay ten years back. If there had been perhaps even more set-up, or more scenes showing the two (err three) friends together, there would've been back-up. However Roth is more interested in what comes in the second half of the film.<br/><br/>To give credit where credit's due, Roth at least doesn't commit the sins of the filmmakers of, for example, 'Saw'. The cinematography and production design is a full notch above those far lesser, laughably bad films. In the sort of 'exploitation' sense he doesn't screw around with the audience by playing too many guessing games. Like QT, he goes for the torture scenes- and there are a good many few of them- by not always showing it, more of showing the reactions to the violence. And I suppose as a director dealing with such subversive, trashy material like sex (lots), drugs (some), and unmitigated carnage, he does film it without too many gimmicks or stupid flash cuts and such. However, his style, which isn't a horrible one, is lacking due to how the substance is too ambiguous for its own good (I only knew what this whole torture building was for after reading a couple of reviews after the fact) and didn't really keep me on the edge of my seat. If he was looking to make me laugh at times as well, which is good and bad depending on which scenes I might mean, its sometimes at far too inappropriate moments. All of the imposed atmosphere is moot when torture just happens for the sake of it.<br/><br/>I know that Roth, unlike someone like Mel Gibson who said his film would be 'good for the soul', doesn't relish in these scenes, and maybe is trying for something gruesome out of the recent slew of ultra-violent Asian flicks ala Fukasaku and Miike. But the wit of those films, albeit quite dark, is too absent here, and after a while one wonders if all of this is more for the filmmakers' benefit than the audience's. Who knows, maybe I can recommend it for a certain quota of the public who are into the take-no-prisoners films like from the 70's (I Spit on Your Grave for example). But it just wasn't for me; after a while even after trying to shut my brain off and enjoy the mindlessness of it all, I got impatient. There's some good stuff in the film, but muddled over by not being able to connect the set-up with the payoff. C+"
"ajdshank","1","8","16","6 January 2006"," This was supposed to be scary?
","I am usually quite easily scared by movies and so I expected Hostel, based on its marketing, to be truly gory and frightening. I was thoroughly disappointed, as were the people I saw it with. I saw it tonight, the first night it came out, and I, as well as the majority of the moviegoers in my sold-out theater, laughed through the entire movie. Some of the scenarios were just laugh-out-loud funny. The acting was horrible. I'm a Jay Hernandez fan and can't believe he did this movie. The plot was incredibly weak and Tarantino's attempts at suspense were not effective. We actually walked out of the movie questioning if it was supposed to be a parody of the horror movie genre. I really wouldn't waste your $9.25 to see this movie."
"moviemanx","8","8","16","20 December 2005"," Overview
","I was able to attend a special sneak preview screening of Hostel last night in the Los Angeles Area. I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I will be the first to admit that I was not enthralled with Cabin Fever, Eli Roth's first horror film, but I was amazed at how well this movie was done. There is something so unsettling about a place that seems to pander to the visceral basis of human nature. The movie was masterfully done, slowly sliding from a place of comfort and happiness to a place of sheer terror. The scenes of torture that you have heard about are just as horrifying as you would expect, definitely worthy of the R-rating the movie received. The transformation of the main character throughout the movie was captured quite well, and the character development overall was very well done. Even though the movie only runs 95 minutes, Eli Roth was able to effectively make us care about the characters and what happens to them. There is plenty going on in this movie, and the short runtime does not detract. There are plenty of moments in the film where you just want to stand up and cheer for the good guys, and go beat the crap out of the bad ones.<br/><br/>And I realize that I am rambling, and my sentences are very disconnected... must be the early morning hours. The point is this is a very good horror movie, and the perfect scary movie to cure the Oscar season slump of artsy films. Come January 6th, I will be seeing this movie again, and if you are a horror fan you should be seeing it as well."

","I have a pretty morbid sense of humor, so I'm not going to grade this movie based on how funny I thought it was, but as a standalone movie.<br/><br/>The movie had a small amount of potential, but unfortunately it was buried underneath all of the shitty acting, and the completely unrealistic plot. I see this movie reaching out to be very ""Old Boy"" meets ""Ishi the Killer"" but it fails miserably. <br/><br/>I thought the death/torture scenes were a bit too hyped up, and I found myself laughing quite a bit.<br/><br/>**HERES THE SMALL SPOILER** Towards the middle-end of the movie, a gorgeous Russian (I think) vacation-lover of the main character lures said main character into an old broken down factory building. How does she do it? She tells him that his missing friends, (obviously something very suspicious is going on at this point the movie) are at an art show. Located in an old FALLING APART factory. It took me a good 46 minutes to believe that the folks that made this movie actually expected the audience to buy into the fact that the main character didn't question the location of the art show at all. This kind of shakiness throughout the entire plot destroys the movie. To top it all off, there are a lot of moments where you say ""I KNEW IT!""<br/><br/>Do yourself the favour, don't bother seeing it. If you're really curious, save yourself the $9 or $10 and MAYBE rent it when it comes out on DVD."

I ended up leaving the theater during the first 30 minutes of the showing because I didn't pay $7 to watch a porn flick with 50 other people. It was nothing but a lot of cussing, smoking of weed, and sex. In one part of a scene, all you can hear is people having sex while one of the stars watches and comments. None of these things were shown in the previews. All that was in the previews was someone getting their 2nd toe cut off, and that's what I paid to see: a scary movie.

Well, I don't think anyone knows why they put in the woman, they don't have any purpose in the movie.. after 45 minutes the movie isn't very, very bad, but just bad. The things you see are pretty repulsing, so that's good, but the movie stays boring and there are no shock-effects..<br/><br/>This really was the worst (horror) movie I have ever seen :("
"dgv1013","1","5","9","4 February 2006"," Stay Away...
","MY TAKE: This is simply one of the worst films I have ever seen in my life. I haven't actually read many of the user comments, but I am sure that most reinforce my own thoughts. I went to see the movie because my girlfriend told me that it had something to do with Tarantino. It's clear that this is exactly the sort of response that the marketing execs were counting on. However, I was aware of his previous ""presentations"" of other films. Thus, it was with a degree of caution that I went to this one. Well, even with low expectations, I was amazed by the horrible smut that was peddled as a film. It basically combines the plot of ""EuroTrip"" with the content of soft core pornography and a little of the newer ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" thrown in at the end for gross out effect.<br/><br/>MY ADVICE: Stay away from this one; it is a true waste of your time despite the deceiving previews. Of course, some people (""Cabin Fever"" fans) like it, which is clear from it's average rating on this site. In fact, to my surprise there was actually some applause in the theater at the end of the film (mostly from horny 15 year old guys who somehow got in). If you want proof that the movie polarizes it's audience, look at the distribution for the ratings, most either love it or hate it. I hate it, and according to the stats there is a 17.5% probability that you will too (keep in mind most sane people will never see this movie so that number is quite low). Well, you've been warned."

The promotion of this movie just made it seem like it was so amazing, But don't let it fool you. There is very smallllllllllll amount of any kinda blood and gore at all. when there is some there isn't much.<br/><br/>The concept was cool, and the locations were great for the first few minutes that is. It is mainly just nudity and a fest of how to kill time before the ending. it takes almost an hour before anything happens. I don't mind the nudity but when i am going to a horror movie, thats what I'm expecting a pure murder ride. major let down.<br/><br/>Don't LET THE HYPE TRICK YOU TO THINKING IT WAS A GREAT AND GORY MOVIE!!!

","This is a terrible film. The first half is Hernandez and his 'loser' friend going all over Europe trying to get laid. There is also a great deal of nudity in the first part of the film which has nothing the story(of which there is little). The second part of the film is the part that is supposed to be completely gross but pails in comparison to either of the Saw movies. The ending is possibly worst part of the movie because it really doesn't end, they just stop showing the movie. I went to this movie the day it was released because of all the hype it was getting and I figured it was going to be about on par with Saw but it's not even close.

The first hour was nothing but nudity, sex, and drugs. Second hour was just blood. This movie was absolutely horrible. The worst movie I have ever seen. And I mean LITERALLY.

","Hi I just wanted to say that this was not a good movie. The nudity is as gratuitous as any Freddy or Jason movie, while the humour is not the cheese found in those types of horror movies its only because this movie starts out like Eurotrip, so no one liners just one sex joke after another followed by an ass in the face. Then the second half being the horror film to be relived in my nightmares, or not. I went into this movie thinking its going to insanely violent, when I would say its probably not the most violent movie I have seen. Now combine that with the lack of even an attempt for a interesting storyline and you find yourself going, alright hit me with your best shot Eli, the shot in this case being a vomit inducing tortue scene, which unfortunately never really came. Now maybe I am being harsh but I just thought it was pure trash and I was pretty well just waiting for it to end, and not because I was grossed.

By ""Hell,"" of course, I mean the horrendous experience of watching this unbelievably bad movie, and by ""save yourself,"" of course, I mean for GOD'S sake don't watch it. One out of ten is about ten times too high.<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Roth, <br/><br/>Listen, keep my $9, you prick, just give me back my 95 minutes, my dignity, and my respect for horror movies. <br/><br/>You have stolen from me.<br/><br/>I happen to believe in the theory that whenever you see someone tied to a chair in a movie, you have a screenwriter that ran out of ideas. Following that logic, this movie never had a thought in its head from the very beginning. I have to admit that in the first act, I was positively beaming at the screen I was so interested in where the film was going (because of the sexual element and an accompanying feeling that the movie was not going to cop out and go where every other horror movie involving sex went).<br/><br/>Had I taken two seconds to see that this movie was directed by the same jerkoff who defecated Cabin Fever into theaters a couple of years ago I would have known not to watch it in the first place, but sadly I just checked the movie times and went out and paid $9 to be tortured through my eyes for an hour and a half.<br/><br/>This movie seems to have been hugely popular at the Toronto International Film Festival, I can only theorize that the people who wrote glowing reviews on the IMDb are either closet sociopaths or were simply starstruck that the director was there talking about this film, pretending it wasn't the revolting sludge that it is.<br/><br/>I promise you, this is one of the absolute worst films of any kind that I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Some Americans go to Amsterdam for drugs and sex as Americans are wont to do, like it or not, and are advised to go to a certain hostel in Slovakia where beautiful women will just pounce on them. They find this to be startlingly true, until the girls drug them, big guys come and take them down into the dungeon and strap them to chairs in separate rooms, and for $25,000, rich people can come in and torture and kill them in any way they can think of (could it be for revenge against those dirty Americans for coming into our countries and dirtying the place up?).<br/><br/>Directed by an American, by the way. <br/><br/>Of course, you can't really claim that the movie is racist against Americans, because you can buy access to other ethnicities as well (for a substantially lower price). One creative individual decides to save some money and just go for a Japanese girl rather than an expensive American, and he proceeds to blowtorch her face until one of her eyes bulges out of its socket and hangs down on her cheek. Our ""hero"" has managed to escape his own torture and shoot and kill his tormentor, and goes into the room and shoots the guy torturing her, then displays a massive surge of brilliant intelligence by apologetically cutting off her eyeball, sending white pus running down her cheek, and THEN tries to get her out of there.<br/><br/>Do you mean to tell me that you find this trash entertaining? <br/><br/>My GOD!!<br/><br/>When the movie thankfully ended, I have never in my life felt the urge so strongly to find the manager and demand my money back, the film is that sick and that twisted and utterly without redeeming value. <br/><br/>I am absolutely baffled at the people who praise this movie on the IMDb. This thing is so disgusting and so cheap and so stupid and so sick that it blows my mind that there are people who really think there is some social value to a movie that makes you wonder how you would torture someone. And to make matters worse, nothing is resolved at the end. We are handed this cardboard resolution that solves nothing at all, the fire is dimmed by dousing a flame here and there, leaving the smoldering source of the torturous blaze firmly burning. <br/><br/>I don't even want to give this staggeringly pathetic mass of congealed stupidity and perversion the pleasure of a spoiler alert, so I'll just give you an analogy. The main character, Paxton, is a man lost in the woods, when suddenly he's attacked by a bear. Ultimately, he is faced with the possibility of picking up a gun and shooting the bear, but instead decides to stomp on the bear's foot, and the movie ends as he runs cowering into the woods.<br/><br/>This film is absolute drivel of the lowest order, a pitiful attempt to do something new in the horror genre by removing all elements of story, character, reason, creativity, tension, depth, thought, and meaning, and reducing itself to nothing but a lot of people strapped to chairs and being mutilated alive.<br/><br/>If this is entertainment to you, you have some real problems. This movie strikes me as the kind of thing that would be enjoyed by someone who gets a real kick out of those disgusting videos that have been coming out of Iraq. <br/><br/>I feel violated just because I've seen this movie."

Its obvious that this movie's only purpose is to continue to chip away at the Amercian public's perception of torture. So maybe we can acquire a taste for torture.

"jjo999","10","6","12","9 January 2006"," FINALLY...something unpredictable hits the theater!
","Before I start writing a long comment about how hot Jay Hernandez is and how awesome his character was in this movie, I have to say that the making of Hostel was a job well-done. First of all, it is very unpredictable. This is a quality we're losing during an era of frequent remakes. It is nice to watch a movie these days and not know how it is going to end until the actual end. When Hernandez's character escaped from where he is staying in the Slovakian city, I figured...hey, that's great, but he'll either die in the end or the evil characters will win. This is usually what happens in most horror movies, and while a lot of people like that, it gets to be quite an overused approach. The one part of the movie that did not prove unpredictable was when the Japanese girl committed suicide after viewing her deformity. (I really did see that one coming.)<br/><br/>Another great thing about this movie is that it is somehow able to mix humor with thrilling and gory scenes. Most intense thrillers do not have truly funny moments that leave you to bust out laughing, but this movie had moments to be scared, moments to laugh as well as moments to clap. <br/><br/>For those of you who have not yet seen the movie, I will tell you that the whole ending portion is truly different from anything you have ever seen in a thriller/horror movie before, but do not be discouraged. Change is good and it proves to be refreshing in this movie. <br/><br/>The acting is great too. When the backpacker friends are scared, they don't give us this special thought out reaction; they just give us a realistic portrayal of fear. One panics and begs for mercy (which is probably what I would do), and the other shows fear, but also tries to use whatever strength he can muster from his brain to develop his strategy for escape (that would be Jay). I will not reveal anymore about this movie, but I will say that you just have to see what Hernandez does at the end. It will truly serve as a surprise!"

Instead all the viewer gets is a good hour of torture depictions guaranteed to make your stomach quell for no reason. Seriously, your money would be better spent on paying a homeless person to punch you in the stomach for the same effect. Don't be attracted to the lure of ""Quentin Tarantino presents"" even though I thought the movie Hero was good. This movie definitely was not.

","Wow, that was interesting. I just got back from seeing that worthless piece of rotting flesh that could have been called a movie, Hostel, were it not a worthless piece of rotting flesh. All this movie is good for is tits and gore. There is an excessive amount of both. Actually, scratch that. There were more tits than gore. Frankly, I could have used a bit more torture than they had. Yeah, its sick to find entertainment from mindless slaughter and torture of one's fellow man, but if the plot is good enough, I don't care. Unfortunately, those are rare nowadays. Well, there were some good points to the movie. I did find some satisfaction in seeing Paxton slam into those f#$kin hostel bitches who drugged him. Hooray for GTA!! Also, there were some weird parts that didn't make any sense. After a sicko f#$ker burned this Asian girl's face, her eye is hanging out, so Paxton cuts it out. Alright. Whatever. Then, while they are trying to get to the train, she happens to see her reflection in a mirror and decides to...jump into an oncoming train...OK...Can I say what the f#$k? Maybe she was trying to get out of the movie. That must be it. You know, it was just like Eurotrip. I swear to god, if you gave every character in Eurotrip a weapon, you would get this movie. You know what would've been more of a torture for those characters? Strapping them to a chair and making them watch the very movie they are in. This movie was so bad that I had to watch Pulp Fiction just to get the taste of this s&*tty movie out of my mind. So anyway, f#$k it.<br/><br/>There are some funny points, and comeback points of this movie which are quite entertaining. Besides being hyped as one of the ""greatest"" horror,suspense, torture movies of all times, this movie is crap... I knew nobody had the balls to create a movie that could cross the threshold that could actually be deemed, and actually have ""paramedics on hand"" I laughed during this movie.

"VoiceOfEurope","5","4","7","4 December 2007"," low budget: no time for research
","Finally, I gave in and went to see Hostel, because it kept being referred to in daily conversation of the young and reckless. Now I know why I usually do not go to see light pieces like this one. It is because however intriguing the first sequels might be, after a few minutes the usual problems surface and keep bugging you even until after the end. Loose plots, fact-defying situations and conversations, and wrongfully chosen backdrops all boost the impression that low-budget also resulted in not taking the time to carry out the necessary researches on the subject, the location etc.<br/><br/>In Amsterdam a wily youth advises three backpackers from the US and Iceland to go to Slovakia if they want to hook up with nice chicks. The reason, he says, why so many easy girls can be found there is that there are no guys in that country because of the war. What?? Come on, the last time there has been a war on Slovakian territory was back in WWII. Eli Roth must have mistaken Slovakia for Slovenia. But there has not been a recent war in Slovenia either, only its neighbors, Serbia and Croatia were engaged fighting one another in the early to mid '90s.<br/><br/>When the backpackers arrive to Slovakia what they find is a run-down country out of the stone age. Not exactly what it is like in reality. I am not saying Slovakia is the European Dubai, but people not having more than three crooked teeth in their mouthes and driving around in cars you would not see anywhere else but in an industrial museum paying tribute to the ex-Soviet era's technological achievements is a bit of an exaggeration. Slovakians also drive Ford, Opel, BMW and Mercedes cars like everybody else in Europe. And they do have state-supported dentistry as well.<br/><br/>No care has been taken to try to find out what the location of the film is indeed like in reality. The sad truth is that the place you would find child gangs attacking backpackers in broad daylight is not Slovakia, but England and the disgraceful outer districts of Paris.<br/><br/>Either American movie makers do not know anything about Europe, or they think we are stupid enough to be depicted as we are in their films. Actually, the only character resembling a European is that of Oli, so why all the hassle to excuse the Icelandic president? And if you intend to make the central train station of Bratislava look like it was in Germany you could at least remove the coke ads written in Slovakian from the background, Mr Roth. I mean, this is what one sensible man would start with, is it not?"
"addaam78","10","4","7","23 June 2007"," American psycho (the book) meets your local butcher!
","Well... let's say I didn't hear a word about Hostel, when I popped the DVD in... I thought this was one of those teenage standard movies. Teenagers go somewhere, they meet some strange individual and he butchers them... lots of screaming and short skirts... blood everywhere... and so on... blah blah.<br/><br/>What I got instead was something PRIMAL. Something infiltrated the walls of my flat that I really haven't felt since I was attacked by a dog at the age of three. It crept inside my stomach and it made it crunch for a very very very long time... and it made me feel sick for a long time after the movie was over.<br/><br/>I didn't realize what happened at first... but then I got it: the greatest introspection... let's be clever with words... the greatest vivisection of fear in this movie is done by portraying a human like a piece of meat... and even worse... portraying a human being as a helpless!!! piece of meat.<br/><br/>The whistling of the torturer... the atmosphere... uh. It's very hard to be indifferent. It's very hard to see it as a comedy. It doesn't try to be a comedy, because Hostel is a true, horrifying experience. I guess it is one of those movies where reality clashes with fiction... and makes your deepest fears blossom into this crunch. This movie successfully attempts to brutally destroy every single attempt to view it in a more comedy-like way. Because it doesn't allow you to laugh. There is nothing in this movie that can take your concentration away from the suffering victims and their demonic torturers. The great achievement of this movie is, that it doesn't try to obfuscate the nature of horror, but tries constantly to amplify it. It constantly tries to push the fear inside of you to the point you cannot take it anymore and you look away. But hey... you are already shivering and feeling awful! And that's why a 10 is far less than this movie deserves.<br/><br/>This is a cult movie. It's so great that in a sense is a true SNUFF movie. Because it makes you sick, just like it would make you sick if you saw torture live in your flat, garage... And that's far more than I was willing to experience... when I popped the DVD in.<br/><br/>Lots of other viewers tried to diminish the importance of the movie, because of the sexual content... calling it porn. Well, I understood... since watching scream, that every good horror movie, needs to have sexual elements... :) But I guess that is not the only thing the director and writer tried to achieve.<br/><br/>Sex and Death are related.There is a sense in all of this. Young teenagers go to Slovakia to get laid... because teenagers are obsessed by sex, while on the other hand... the old (adult men) are obsessed by Death... and the state of arousal (having sex and killing people) are just two sides of the same coin. That's why the sex in this movie has logic as it needs to balance the pleasure of sex with the ""pleasure"" of torture and killing.<br/><br/>That's why I mentioned the Brett Easton Eliss' book ""AMERICAN PSYCHO"", which balanced the sexual arousal with killing and torture in a similar, yet even more disturbing way. When you read the book with graphic depictions of sex it makes your level of arousal so high, that you just don't care if Bateman kills and dismembers them two seconds after. Well, while BEE American psycho has a ""good"" effect... this movies has exactly the opposite effect... it makes you sick. But in a way... like Eliss' book this movie succeeds in transforming fiction into real sickness of the viewer. And that's something very very very extreme. And unprecedented... in my personal experience.<br/><br/>However... some viewers wrote about the ""social"" criticism of the movie, noting that it shows the degrade in post-communist countries. Well... as I am a citizen of a post real-socialist country... I see this movie in a perhaps biased way.<br/><br/>The price tags on people... 50.000 for 1 American, 20.000 for a European and 10.000 for a local... shows that the East Europeans see in Americans a special ""enemy"".<br/><br/>Why would Eastern mafia enjoy so much torturing Americans that it is willing to pay 5 times the price of a local? the movie alludes to the arrogant behavior of Americans which act so bluntly superior to everybody else. 2500 people dead in the WTC attack are far more important than 500.000 killed Iraquis or 1 million killed Vietnamese. The other reason why the Eastern ""wealthy"" are so eager to torture Americans is because it's the Americans that destroyed the Communist utopia.<br/><br/>Torture can mean two things in a social context: as the West is torturing the New Europe nations... so the Mafia tortures Westerners as an act of revenge. It is important to notice, that the mafia members are buying Americans. Communism had the ambition to make everybody equal, while in this movie Capitalism (money) empowers the mafia members by offering them chances to buy western tourists.<br/><br/>The moral degradation that capitalism brought to eastern nations (in a metaphorical way) is in this movie portrayed as a ""pay back time"" with the same methods that the West used to destroy the East - by offering money, by buying people... with the American dream...<br/><br/>I think this movie has some pretty sound pillars - aesthetically and fundamentally. It is not a simple horror movie, because it tries hard to have a background... and all said and done... this is probably one of the best horror movies I have seen in 20 years.<br/><br/>Enjoy it and never-mind the low ratings. I'd give it a 12+!"

","I would hardly consider myself a horror addict or expert, but this was a great flick. It follows three backpackers who are recommended to seek a hostel in Slovakia which is renowned for its beautiful women. I'll say no more than the the Hostek facilitates some sinister activity.<br/><br/>A criticism of this film (which is perhaps well-founded) is that is paints the nation within which the hostel lies (Slovakia) in a bad light. Of course the Texas Chainsaw Massacre doesn't make us frightened of Texas, but people are always scared of environments foreign to them. This adds to to the tension of the film - the fact that the three guys are unfamiliar with their surroundings. The tension eerily builds and the climax is gripping, suspenseful and concludes in a very satisfactory manner.<br/><br/>Not for the faint-hearted obviously. One torture scene in particular is horrific and in fact lessened my enjoyment of the film. But overall it is a well-made, tight and gripping thriller that will have you squirming and looking away at times. The film also makes us feel sympathy towards the victims, adding to the intensity.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a look."

","I've seen a lot of movies. And even a lot of so-called sick movies. But this one was frightening, gruesome, ugly, realistic, stylistic but at the same time funny, entertaining, unpredictable and i don't know the word for ""to think about""... It was like a Rollercoasterride of perversions (and i don't mention the as you Americans would call it ""porn"" sequences, which we old Europeans would call ""evening commercials"") This is IMO very realistic. If you would live under poor circumstances you would deliver your ""guest"" to the butcher for 10.000 $.

","Grade: B-<br/><br/>Not as gory as you might expect, but more psychologically disturbing than anything in recent memory. The first thirty or so minutes play more like a porno than a horror movie (though I suppose the two could often be confused for lack of quality) as three college kids pursue sex and drugs in, where else, but Amsterdam. The very idea behind Hostel is terrifying enough to keep the viewers attention. Once the torture begins, director Eli Roth doesn't stop. To say he creates tension is inaccurate. This isn't Hitchcock. Still, Roth focuses more on the anticipation of pain than in the pain itself. Often he shies away from showing us the torture: we don't see the drill going into the flesh, we don't see the ankles being slashed, but we know what's happening and that is even more terrifying. Hostel is still a horror movie with bad dialogue and useless characters, which is why giving it a ""B-"" is a little generous. It gets the grade because I left the theater thinking about the images and the situation: people being Kidnapped on vacation to be torture subjects for those who can pay for it. That's enough to keep me from backpacking Europe anytime soon."

","Wow, a lot of people seem to either really dig this film or hate it with a passion. I, as a true horror fan, can relate quite a tad more with the latter. I could easily see and emphasize with the major problems that horror aficionados have with this film. It IS unoriginal and rips off so many better films. It IS an exercise of (mtv) style over substance. And it is pretty unrealistic and hokey. However that being said, I still can't bring myself to out and out loathe this picture as it does have bits and pieces to redeem it somewhat, even if said pieces were smaller than the great Takashi Miike's two lines in the film. And trust me if you were among the people that recognized his cameo at first sight than you KNOW this movie wasn't nearly as graphic or 'disturbing' as way too many people seem to tout it as being. Also, as an aside, the children were a major downfall of the film as much as to be laughable. But I did enjoy the movie somewhat if only because of the enjoyment of the people I watched it with, one of which brought the movie over so I didn't have to pay a dime to see it. Plus the nudity was quality.<br/><br/>My Grade: C- (right on the border of a D+ though)"

","I've seen this movie and expected - after Cabin Fever - at least SOME excitement. However, unless you are in the middle of puberty and a fan of male friendship connected with stupid dialogues and the wish to be fooled by unreal scenarios with naked beauties around you, you'll be terribly, terribly disappointed. What a waste of time! Three young Americans are on a trip through Europe and follow some stranger's advice to go to Slowakia, because in some obscure hostel ""they love Americans"" - which means: you'll get laid by awesome girls. Rubbish, bloody rubbish. Then people start disappearing (GOOD and CLEVER idea to take unknown pills that unknown and of course stunningly beautiful chicks pop into your mouth...), and it all turns into some even more unrealistic plot whereby tourists pay money to torture/kill other tourists (those who disappear, what a surprise). Have I already mentioned the ridiculous dialogues? Jeezus, I wasted nearly 2 hours of my life with this rubbish movie. However, you've been warned now! But if you still consider watching it, I'll be a good person and spoil it by telling the end: Only one of them survives (the least likable one!); the Asian girl jumps in front of a train after seeing her reflection with one eye missing, and one of the Bad Men (""I always wanted to be a surgeon"") gets the proper punishment - the best and probably only OK scene in this whole fiasco that dares to call itself ""movie"".

Hostel, if one is honest in their thinking, is just another slasher film with better gore effects, which keeps those entranced with such effects happy. And as always in slasher films, the story is very lame to say the least. But then again they have to be, because to do otherwise might require the viewer to actually think! To be classified as a horror film, Hostel is not.

Later on though I realized some things about the movie that were great.<br/><br/>first: everything is told from the characters views, they don't BS the audience, they don't reveal anything unless one of the main characters witness it first hand. I felt this added a lot to the story telling.<br/><br/>second: they played on clichés even mirroring some scenes like eurotrip (guy getting felt up in the train), in this case (SPOILER)...<br/><br/>The character (Josh) who is setup according to clichés (wont screw around because he is lamenting his last girlfriend, sweet next door innocent type etc) is NOT the survivor. I felt this butcher of his character led a lot of rage to the movie as his character was endeared to the audience. This helped with the vengeance scene at the end. Everyone laughed with glee as Pax ran down 3 characters and bribed the kids to kill (thats how I took it) the thugs of the hunting group. Another shocking scene of brutality that the audience agree's with. Then the bathroom scene, though extremely violent by a lot of measures, again, this the audience's vibe was for.<br/><br/>I don't think I will bother watching this movie again, but because of how it was told as opposed to the surreal content.

"bless_the_fetus","1","5","10","7 January 2006"," pointless garbage.
","This is easily the worst horror movie I have seen since Roth's other excuse for art, Cabin Fever. Eli Roth, in Hostel (much like in Cabin Fever), uses excessive violence to cover the fact that this movie lacks a point, direction, or conclusion. This movie is nothing more than an excuse for Eli Roth to construct a film that people will hail as the goriest of all time. What is the issue that this films represents? None. Is this film making a statement of any kind? No. One cannot tell if the point of the film was to glorify torture or deconstruct it. Beyond the fact that this film only appeals to the most brutish among us, the characters were horribly stupid. The character played by Jay Hernandez, Paxton, is a retard. Why would anyone go to Eastern Europe in the first place, just to meet girls? That almost makes sense. Then there is the part in the movie were he is convinced that an art show is taking place within a dilapidated building surrounded by guards with guns. That makes sense, I can see how anyone would come to a logical conclusion like that. Also, these characters must have an enormously high threshold for pain, because not one passes out from the pain or shock of being tortured, not even the Asian girl getting her face blow torched. In conclusion, the best part of this movie was when the Asian girl jumped in front of the train, because it best displayed my general feelings at the time. Nothing is worth seeing this movie again."
"aimless-46","3","5","10","6 January 2006"," Poor Bratislava
","Poor Bratislava and Slovakia, talk about a place getting bad treatment from the movie industry. First it gets ""armpit of the world treatment"" in ""Eurotrip"", then it gets portrayed as the center of private enterprise torture in ""Hostel"". I saw ""Hostel"" on impulse (seeing Tarentino's name after the film title on the theater's list of show-times) without realizing it was the actually the brainchild of Eli Roth, who apparently intended it as a homage to Takashi Miike's ""Audition"". It is an improvement on Roth's boring first movie, ""Cabin Fever"". Although neither movie (Roth's stuff does not rise to the level of an actual film) is even remotely scary, at least with ""Hostel"" Roth keeps his tendency toward ""Evil Dead"" silliness in check until the last few minutes.<br/><br/>Anyway the first half of the film is pretty much a replay of ""Eurotrip's"" Amsterdam and train travel scenes, including the funny pervert in the train compartment. I found myself wishing very early in the movie that the three guys were traveling with Michelle Trachtenberg. This wish intensified during the sauna scene in the hostel where the only exploitation elements were a skanky Russian blonde and her fat slug-like friend. The movie would certainly have benefited visually from Trachtenberg's presence or even from the ""Cabin Fever"" brunette (despite her nonexistent acting skills she at least looked good). Heck, by this time I would have even settled for Jay Hernandez hooking up with his ""Hang Time"" girlfriend Amber Barretto.<br/><br/>Anyway the three guys arrive in Bratislava and Roth slowly reveals that it is the home ground of a club that provides its members with people to torture and kill (watch 2002's ""My Little Eye"" if you think Roth might actually be doing something original). At this point the thing starts to look a lot more like ""Toolbox Murders"" or ""The Driller Killer"" than ""Audition"" and I began to yearn for an appearance by Angela Bettis. But instead Roth gives us a confused Asian girl who can't speak English very well.<br/><br/>Fortunately or unfortunately you never actually identify with those being tortured. But there is at least a point to all the torture as it gives the hero a reason to inflict ultra-violence once the tables are turned and the audience a excuse to mildly cheer every silly development from that point until the movie itself thankfully expires. There was no audience applause at the end as everyone was in a hurry to get out and have some BBQ down the street.<br/><br/>To make matters worse for the Slovakia Ministry of Tourism, the one thing Roth manages to do very well is to convey the isolation felt by a tourist in a strange place and the target on the back of Americans in foreign countries these days. Given our image in the eyes of the world these days if such a torture business did exist it is likely that American victims would be in great demand and would command a healthy price premium. There are not just corrupt police but a gang of street urchins who extort gum and candy from visitors.<br/><br/>""Hostel's"" wide theatrical release and $18 Million marketing campaign (verses just $4 Million production cost) pay homage to P.T. Barnum's comment: ""No one every went broke 'underestimating' the intelligence of the American people"". There is little danger that Roth will ever be mistaken for David Cronenberg. Save your money for the ""Saw II"" DVD.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."

","The only reason I didn't walk our was because my wife and I were another couple. Apparently they wanted to as well.<br/><br/>Before I go into a rant about why this movie was such a let down. Let me let tell you a little about the perspective this is coming from. I am 32 and a huge fan of horror films. I'm such a fan that for a few years I spent time as a special effects make-up artist and worked on a few major films. I like everything from the classics horror films like ""Nosferatu"" to seventies films ""Last House on the Left"" and ""The Exorcist"", Eighties flicks ""Hellraiser"" and had a good laugh with ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"". And now and again there's been films since then that I have enjoyed.<br/><br/>So why would I hate this movie so much? Simple. There was nothing to it. It was two hours of soft porn and shock scenes. The plot, if you will call it that, was summed up in the first 15 minutes of the film. Honestly, this film could have easily just cut out the cheap dialogs and released it as a part of ""Faces of Death"" and shown the sex clips as a collage on Cinemax.<br/><br/>Who was this movie made for? As a horror fan and I love a good shock and stomach a lot of gore in a film but it just became pointless violence. I estimate that things didn't start moving in the movie until almost 50 minutes after it's start. I say if you want the gore go watch Faces of Death. If you want to see soft porn watch Cinemax. But don't try to splice the two together and call it a movie."

Maybe even pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>But if you want to watch this film for sheer entertainment, and you were not involved in the making or producing this film, you belong in a nut-house.<br/><br/>The story is about two backpackers who (the third one is met on the way), while backpacking through Europe, are invited to an out of the ordinary hostel that is filled with horny girls who desperately want sex with American men. Sounds great, right? Of course! Happiness and good times are short lived for old Paxton and Josh because they become victims of a sick, twisted and depraved individual who gets his rocks off by brutally torturing people.<br/><br/>This film is very dark, sick, disgusting, often at times vomit inducing and takes human depravity to an entirely different level. The violence and blood in this film is off the charts. A portion of the audience walked out midway through the screening. All in all, Hostel is NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.<br/><br/>While the ending was good, it could have been so much better. Why? After sitting through all that garbage and sickness, the ending didn't do enough justice to all that we (as an audience) went through. Sorry, it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>My rating is for all you cats who think this film is the best ever made and gave it anything more than 2 stars.<br/><br/>I will conclude by saying that if you watch this film, you are just as guilty and no different than those rich people in the film who pay to see young lads brutally tortured.

","Having just seen Hostel as the last film shown at the Toronto Film Festival, I was so impressed. Roth has honed his skill as a writer and director, giving us not only a huge leap over Cabin Fever (no mean feat in itself) but also a grand contribution to the sub-genre of Revenge films. Yes, the horror in the film is mundane (that is, not fantasy) but the measure of revenge scenes in the film is just perfect. Yes, the film is very violent and graphic, but for those of us who find a sublime beauty in that, Hostel will reward you in spades!

Yes. Cringe as someone gets a drill in the leg. Gasp as fingers fall off. Scream in terror as a neck is cut. Sure, in real life this would be terrible, but in cinema, in a movie backed by Tarantino and Miike and Peter Jackson, it's just pathetic. If this is as sick as Mr. Roth can get, then he needs to start stealing from some other movies. I almost wonder if Miike cameoed in this flick just to make fun of poor little Roth and his sad attempts at being wild. Though I suppose one could say that Hostel is kind of cute for trying so hard to rip off better movies, like a child imitating Jack the ripper. This had the potential for greatness, but in the hands of Eli Roth and his inability to be creative in any possible way, it's just a dumb waste of time."

With his 2nd movie Roth has created a terrifying eastern Europe nightmare world, but this stuff does go on all around the world that's a fact, anyway 3 backpackers are travelling around Europe & end up in a beautifull luxury Hostel that is a front for an evil institution of torture for money & it's brutally played out & set up by the excellent Roth.<br/><br/>What eli roth has shown here is the evil of the world, the evil that men do & the dark sadistic real world we live in, this stuff happens in real life!!!
I totally agree with Roth, nothing he could put in a Horror film could ever compare to the real Horrors of the world!!!
The world is darker & more sick & twisted than any Horror film could ever try to be & that's the truth, we exist in a living nightmare where the absolute worst things happen to women, Children & men.
It's a very scary world out there & Roth has put that fear on screen, especially that fear Americans have of foreign places & that completely out of your comfort zone is what he plays on with the creepy atmosphere & use of gradually draining all the colour out of the film as it gets more dangerous for our group of backpackers!!!!<br/><br/>I loved ""Cabin fever"" & it's one of my favourite movies of all time & Hostel is an excellent follow up movie,
although completely different it's still exciting & you can feel that Roth has lovingly crafted this movie too just like he did with Cabin Fever.
The musical score is beautiful & exciting by ""Nathan Barr"" & the look & cinematography is excellent.<br/><br/>The stand out performance is definitely ""Jay Hernandez"" he's excellent as Paxton the party womanizer friend, who ends up being a tough smart hero & turns the tables on the hunters.
Now i did like the characters better in ""Cabin fever"" as that group of kids were alot of fun & ""Rider Strong"" was excellent as ""Paul"" but it's still a well paced, exciting sinister survival Horror.<br/><br/>ELI ROTH is a fantastic Horror director as he knows the genre so well so with his first two films ""Cabin Fever"" & ""Hostel"" he really gives you brilliantly made movies for that genre & he still hasn't beaten those 2 films or the impact they had.
Hostel is brutally savage survival shocker with disgusting & disturbing scenes of gore & torture but it's all worth it to see Paxton (Hernandez) get some well deserved revenge later on in the movie!!!
Hostel is an excellent shocking survival Horror film & one that really brought back the blood & guts to Horror back in 2005.
Hostel is great but doesn't beat his first blood soaked masterpiece ""Cabin Fever"" (2002)."

","I'm not going to comment on the plausibility of elements of Hostel's plot, which doesn't really interest me. What's important here is that Eli Roth has made a horror movie that represents a significant step up in style and horror storytelling from the merely okay Cabin Fever, a horror movie that even harks back to the days when quality horror movies were made by auteurs such as John Carpenter and David Cronenberg, intelligent up-and-coming filmmakers with talent, style and vision to burn.<br/><br/>In these days when the horror genre consists of pretty much nothing but lame sequels and even lamer remakes that rarely even achieve basic watchability, it's almost a relief to see a movie like Hostel again. Not because of its unrestrained violence, but first and foremost because it looks and plays throughout like a real movie, with actual characters, interesting and varied settings, genuine atmosphere, steadily mounting tension and an increasingly sinister and threatening sense of mystery. Compare this movie to the hyped-up video game commercials, goofy ""concept"" garbage like those awful ""Saw"" movies and soulless spazzy remakes that the studios have been vomiting forth to capture the ""horror market"" in the past few years, and Hostel almost looks like a Hitchcockian masterpiece in comparison. Of course, in reality, and by any earlier standard of competent film-making, it's not quite THAT good. But it's good enough."

","There are three movies in my lifetime that I have watched that captured the true meanness of the killer. They are ""Play Misty for Me"", ""Dirty Harry"" and ""Hostel"". All three movies do not give much leeway in the killers actions, they are killers, they kill. They may be nuts but let's not get lost in trying to figure out how to rehabilitate their sorry minds. Hostel is true from beginning to end, mean as hell. The beginning is a little slow of a setup but still, this is not supposed to be about Betty Crocker at the Pillsbury Bake-Off. This is a twisted variation of ""The Most Dangerous Game"", and nothing is left to the imagination. The only difference is that this has a good ending. The hero does not end up enjoying killing and become the new Hostel owner (hope this is not the route of Hostel 2) but instead kills 4 of the people responsible for killing his two buddies. The best scene is where the hero runs over the three killers, and the black haired woman looks up from the ground after being run over, just in time to be run over by the automobile chasing the hero. I was like, ""Yeah"", as if Iowa had just beat LSU on a last second toss at a football bowl game.<br/><br/>Endings are the most critical ingredient of a great movie. This movie has it.<br/><br/>Maybe Hostel 2 will be how he goes back and kills the management of the Hostel - or maybe the Asian friends of the two women murdered go back and slice the management up with Samuri swords."

He, I believe, helped to write movies like Citizen Toxie and Terror Firmer for Troma and directed Cabin Fever, which wasn't a bad movie, but could have been a lot more. Hostel, on the other hand, is a sick movie with some good old fashioned special effects.<br/><br/>The two stars of the movie and a Swedish guy go off to Amersterdam to really party it out and get laid. When they check into a certain Hostel their Swedish friend disappears mysteriously. Then one of the other stars disappears leaving only one to search for his friends leading him into a sick world of murder for profit.<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes of the movie just sucked. I hated the main characters and didn't really care about what happened to them. I hate sex craved characters in movies. The last 50 minutes of the movie is quite good and can be extremely disturbing. The special effects were great in the movie and very old fashioned in the sense that it reminds you of something you may have seen in the 80's. No CGI here, my friends! The intensity is spectacular and I actually found myself really hoping that the main lead character made it out alive.

The idea that wealthy sadists pay enormous amounts of money to practice freely their sickest fantasies in countries, in this case in Eastern Europe, poor and desperate enough to accept such money and turn a blind eye to what happens to the victims of these people isn't as off the wall as people would like to believe. With real life horrors like Darfur, Bosnia, Cambodia, the Holocaust, is it so implausible that such a torture pit as shown in this film could exist? Unfortunately, I don't think so."

","If you want to see a lot of naked girls, gore, and a terrible story, this movie is great for you. I think Roth missed the mark when shooting for a horror movie. If you remotely pay attention to the movie, you realize that, basically, everything is predictable. Is it just me, or doesn't that defeat the purpose of a horror flick? To make things worse, the first half of the movie is nothing but a softcore porn that has very little to do with the plot, or lack thereof. All in all, I feel that this movie was a combination of two ideas (sex and gore) haphazardly thrown together into a 90 minute presentation. I challenge anyone out there to watch this movie and tell me that they didn't see how things were going to turn out scene after scene. Roth may have accomplished his goal, but his goal is a terrible film."

","It is not hard to find words for this: Hostel is the worst film I have ever seen in my whole life!!! No characters and very artificial dialogues! A not existing story with a lot of mistakes just to keep the dilemma running! The screen layout is always the same and absolutely boring! Quite the half of the audience left the theater before the end of this movie was there! If you watch the credits, you can find names like Quentin Tarantino and Peter Jackson. I can't imagine why they give their good names for a movie like this! This film is just blood and gore! It shows things you don't have to show to tell what is happening and if this is the only unique selling point - good bye Eli Roth!"

","I'm going to make this quick: Don't believe Hostel's hype. This film will bore you to tears long before it might manage to get a scream. The first half of the film is Eurotrip without the funny, or even the good. Then it turns into a dull, surprisingly violence-light thriller. The film only had about three moments in which I was entertained. At most a rental, if you do a lot of fast forwarding. My girlfriend actually fell asleep during this movie. This movie is all sorts of predictable, uninspired, and dull. If you want to be shocked or disturbed, stay in and watch an episode of CSI or SVU or something. Look elsewhere. This film won't do it for you."

","I've just watched this movie on DVD, what a waste of space, seriously one of the worst movies I have ever seen (it makes the last George Romero flick look like Citizen Kane), it's completely lacking in tension or mood. Isn't this meant to be a horror movie? Is fake blood and by the numbers gore meant to be frightening alone? This is desperate film making, as if the director was clueless how to scare the audience. I guess some people might get a very slight kick out of some of the sub-teen movie sex scenes. 'Quentin Tarantino presents' the poster says, well Quentin you buy every copy back and personally cut his name off this. Save your money and go backpacking in Europe."
"daunted_undauntable","8","3","5","4 April 2006"," the darkest dream of humanity
","What I experienced was pure evil. There are three backpackers who want to live their sexual dreams in different places of the world in the movie. The movie has actually two definite parts. First one is the erotic part which is a very successful transition part before the gore begins.(although it lasts a little long) And when these young people move away from Amsterdam, darkness starts to fall upon them and you can sense the evil atmosphere of the new country they have arrived. Although their sexual dreams come true before it all starts. This movie shockingly demonstrates how human beings could possibly get lost in their darkest dreams (both victims and psychopaths). ""Elite Hunting"" phrase shows how the sickest and animalistic things could make sense in a modern manner. But, I think there's a little defect in the scenario about circumstances in which the slaughterhouse and this secret community makes this mess work through all the security powers in the country. Although, in movies like that, it is impossible not to find something missing or not clearly clarified. It's not an adventure, or an action movie which we wait for all the things to settle. Of course in every movie, events should unfold but in some movies like Hostel, sense of terror dominates people's mind by using realistic fears in scary and dark settings which are unrealistic in a way. One other thing in the movie tells us that terror and brutality don't only stay in the borders of the unrealistic slaughterhouses. Brutality is also possessed by children living in the streets and image of gore is also related with these little people. Not everyone could watch and like this movie honestly. Welcome to the darkest dream of humanity."

","Hello everybody. I am from Slovakia. I saw movie hostel and I was very surprise and sad what a stupid film it is. It is bullshit that this movie is true story. Only thing what is true, that Eli Roth saw an advertisement on internet page from Thailand to kill American for 10 000$. He never checked if it was true or not. He got great idea to do this movie and he need some country to realize it. I have no idea why he chooses Slovakia. But I almost nothing about Slovakia in this movie is not true. We are member of European Union, member of NATO,OECD.It is true that economic is better than our. But we have really great growth of economics and Bratislava is as reach as a average of European Union. I am accepting that a lot of American don't know nothing about Slovakia(as many European don't know about Idaho), but don't write stupid things as It is true story. Slovakia is really nice and safe country(I felt more dangerous in NYC as in Bratislava)-of course we have few murders per year as in any other country. I can recommend to anybody visit it.

","I'm sorry this is probably the worst movie you could ever imagine unless you're the type who loves to just see torture, if you're looking for a horror flick I suggest you see house of wax or something more in the genre.<br/><br/>Lets start off with the plot, hmm well first off the first half of the women is all about sex, drugs, and clubs, which as a teen I can relate to. The second half of the movie is basically like watching something totally different and doesn't share any of the same qualities of the first half. The second half is almost disturbing while the first half is definitely enjoyable.<br/><br/>The reason I bothered watching this movie is because Quentin Tarantino had the courage to put his name on it hoping to promote it, I just have one thing to say to that.. SHAME ON YOU QT YOU ARE RUINING YOUR GOOD NAME!!! This movie lacks motive, plot, has horrible acting (as you can see almost every member of the class had never acted before) the sound was absolutely horrible it was like watching a typical 90s horror film except they replaced the jump at-ya scary parts with horrible images which aren't even worth adding.<br/><br/>All in All I'd suggest sticking with the saw series if you're into this kind of movie. This movie will leave you puzzled and with lots of questions, in most cases thats a sign of a good movie. Don't BE FOOLED it's just really that bad of a movie. No offense to Eli Roth, I know he can do better."
"Ysman","8","3","5","17 January 2006"," Hostel - A Review by Mandrake
","Great horror, at its core, has always been a mirror of the societal values during the time frame in which it was created. What scares us as a collective whole? Those films that tap into that phenomenon have always been the most successful and the most memorable. While not the only interpretations, Frankenstein can be seen as a warning of technology and science gone awry. Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a clear allegory to fear of Communism. Godzilla teaches us to be wary of nuclear experimentation. Texas Chainsaw Massacre can be seen as a flower child awakening in a post-Vietnam US. Even the slasher flicks of the 80's are modern-day fairy tales exaggerating the dangers of sexual experimentation in a time of STDs and AIDS. What we have not seen as of yet is a reflection of our society in a post 9/11 world. One where the terror is in not knowing where the terror may be and one of ourselves being the monster, the aggressor, and the hated. Hostel may be the first to point in that direction.<br/><br/>Hostel begins almost as a light-hearted, albeit X-rated, sister film to 2004's Eurotrip. We begin as our ""heroes"" arrive in Amsterdam looking for ganja and sex not necessarily in that order. Paxton, the alpha male, and Josh, the sensitive one (think Favreau's character in Swingers) during their backpacking trip, have picked up Oli, a do-anything-anyone Icelander who comes along for the ride - so to speak. The trio jumps from dance club to hash bar to red light district leaving no pot unsmoked and no whore untapped. When they arrive at their Hostel after curfew, they are saved by a stranger who guides them to Eastern Europe with the promises of women who are as easy as they are beautiful. Then things, as they say, turn south.<br/><br/>For the first 45 minutes, Hostel revels in its Cinemax After Dark qualities. Tanned breasts, trimmed pubic regions, and voluptuous rear-ends are all on display in various states of coitus however as the groups travels to Bratislava, they begin to encounter the creepiness and perversion that only a piece of the defunct Soviet empire can provide. One by one our protagonists begin to disappear after being lured away from the group by a nubile, young, topless women. As they soon learn, they have been duped. They find themselves on the bad end of a scheme that offers up live subjects that, for a price, can be tortured and killed in any manner in which your sick heart can dream.<br/><br/>Utilizing my SAT skills - What the first 45 minutes are to breasts, the remaining 50 are to blood and gore. Hostel includes, but is not limited to, human drilling, Achilles slicing, unpleasant eyeball removal, chainsaw induced leg removal, and a savage beating resulting in a caved-in skull.<br/><br/>While Hostel may not ever be shown in MoMA, it does present an interesting portrayal of American attitudes of ourselves and those from the outside. Our backpackers are the ugliest of the ugly Americans. Young and wealthy and with no concern for the consequences of their actions, they drink and fornicate their way across Europe and are despised by everyone outside of the young women who are impressed with foreign accents. Americans bring the highest price of all of the people you can torture for a price. Lastly, when the film turns toward revenge, the infliction of pain and torture to those that had hurt the Americans is just as violent and is handed out with an ask no questions, kill 'em all mentality.<br/><br/>Is Hostel fine art? Probably not. Is Hostel great horror? It is close. The problem with Hostel is that is never really presents itself as scary. By the time the main characters get to the place of torture, the audience has been numbed by endless sex scenes and unlike those being tortured, we all know where they are going to end up. Basically outside of inventive ways to mutilate, Hostel offers nothing of a surprise and thus offers very little in the ways of scares (unless of course you are planning a trip to Europe anytime soon.) What we are left with are the elements of great horror; the reckless bravado, the moral depravity, buckets of blood, and the promise of an even gorier sequel.<br/><br/>Hostel is 95 minutes long and stars the linebacker from Friday Night Lights and the guy who played young Jeff Daniels in D&Derer. It is rated R for countless breasts, a single beaver, and many, many other body parts that were not connected to other body parts. Mandrake grade: B+"

These were all reactions during the movie: cheering and whistling, applause, cheering whistling AND applause, disgust, laughter, dead seriousness/anticipation. At the end of the movie, you don't really feel like you just saw a horror film of a type not often seen these days.<br/><br/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!Spoiler!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>For example, when Pax has to cut Kana's (probably misspelled) eye off. You don't expect yellowish... stuff to leak fluidly out of it. Also the way when Pax runs over the 2 girls and the lip-guy, you don't expect him to run the surviving girl over again. The camera work is done beautifully that way.

Not since the 80's have there been a bunch of protagonists who the planet would be better off without.

"fred-fredi","1","4","8","4 April 2006"," Why do I think the movie Hostel was not exactly the best?
","Okay, someone bashed me for my comments on Hostel. I'll picture it vice versa so that I put YOU into my position and you can see Hostel from my point of view. This is how the HOSTEL would look like from the opposite point of view:<br/><br/>Imagine you go to the movies - you want to see a really scary horror movie. Now the movie you've heard of - it is supposed to be cool- is about Europeans coming to the USA. <br/><br/>Imagine you watch the movie: You see two young characters from Paris or London, they are obviously modern guys living in 21st century. They have cell-phones and Internet. Clearly, it's the world today. They set off to Canada by plane. They meet a third guy. Let's say he's European, too. They smoke pot and have sex with some girls. <br/><br/>Imagine you see them travel by steam train to New York City. After they arrive in Big Apple, you don't get to see Statue of Liberty. You do not even see Empire State Building anywhere. No Brooklyn Bridge, either. The river Hudson is a small brook. All you can really see are 10 - floor buildings. No skyscrapers, no highlights, no highways, no junctions. <br/><br/>In a hotel/hostel you see these European trio hook up with pretty ladies. They meet two Asian girls as well, but they don't like them. However, you are forced to notice that they have TVset with no remote in there and the actors on TV speak British. What's more, all New Yorkers speak British. Then the three main characters go to a disco. You can hear Elvis Presley's songs only in the disco. You may even catch a bit from Beach Boys, The Byrds, The Who, Troggs. <br/><br/>On the walls you see posters from Casablanca, Gone With The Wind or Elvis' movies. <br/><br/>After the disco you can see 10-year-old black, Indian and white kids begging in the streets of New Yor City, or even stoning people to death. <br/><br/>Then you watch the European trio end up on Manhattan - here they find a house in which they are tortured for money and pleasure. The sexy ladies torture them, too. Here come scenes exactly like in the actual Eli Roth's Hostel. For some it is scary, someone calls it disgusting, sadistic, still it's a horror scene so let's suppose you are quite satisfied. <br/><br/>After the torture and murders, one survivor and one Asian girl escape. They don't call police for help. They escape riding a 50 years old Ford Anglia. They just happen to run into the sadistic ladies who tormented them before and run them over with the old-fashioned automobile.On their escape, they ride through an old western-like road. They never see any highway and run into a police officer who looks rather like a Sheriff. They see him beat up some white-haired man for no apparent reason. There are 20years old automobiles all around. <br/><br/>Therefore they run past the police secretly and get to New York City steam-train station. The Asian girl sees her one-eyed, tortured self in a mirror-like wall and therefore commits suicide. <br/><br/>The European survivor sets off on the steam train away from New York City, meets the last villain on the train. He catches up with him in Canada, gets to him in the toilets and does his revenge. End of movie. <br/><br/>Now seriously, would Americans call a movie like this ""a very good, professional horror""? <br/><br/>P.S.: And I am NOT against Eli Roth. I would be mad at anyone who lies about my country, no matter whether it's Roth or Mother Teresa."

Why was there so much pointless violence? Why is there no discernible plot? Why would any college-educated young men behave so foolishly? We left the theatre about half-way through, we could not even stay to see if anything would make sense. Do you know what we mean.

"nscoppo","1","4","8","26 January 2006"," Garbage and nothing more
","Look I realize Cabin Fever was an atrocious movie at best but that should not be grounds for saying that Hostel was a great movie. True Eli Roth improved the plot of the move if you compare it to Cabin fever, but Dumb and Dumberer had a more interesting plot than Cabin Fever did. In other words, it didn't take much to improve over the garbage we know today as Cabin Fever. Hostel has very little plot, and if anyone here is saying the ending is unpredictable and exciting then they weren't paying attention. I can honestly say this is one of the single worst movies I have ever paid to see. I usually respect the IMDb reviewers but this time they were far from right. The murders in this movie were pointless, and the senseless gore did nothing to improve the interest of the movie. At the same time the movie did not scare anyone, and it was not as gory as any of the SAW franchise movies have been. The twists were not there and any movie that revolves around guys trying to get as* in other countries should be stopped on the press before it can be viewed by anyone else. It is sad that movies as badly as this one can be viewed as a success. That really shows the difference between people in the world and how we perceive movies. I just don't see anyway to think of this movie as a success, it stunk and will always be complete garbage in my mind."

The rated R rating did not come from the horror expected from this movie. The rating should have been XXX for nudity and swearing. Maybe the writers, directors, and producers will get the horror title correct the next time. When I go to see a horror movie, I expect to be scared, I expect to be jumped, I expect to have an adrenaline rush. When I go to a horror movie, I expect the plot of the story to make me feel for the characters. I expect the movie to make me feel like I am the character.

So I just want to warn the people, who are wondering if it's worth seeing, about the negative comments made toward this film. I've read quite a few of them and their reasoning doesn't really make much sense.<br/><br/>Some of them talk about how the film isn't realistic. Realistic!? Since when has any horror movie ever done in the history of Hollywood ever been realistic? I mean come on, there's always something in every movie that isn't realistic. Even some of the true stories are changed to make the movie more of a blockbuster.<br/><br/>Others say that the movie should not be categorized as a horror film because it's not scary enough. If it was supposed to be the type of scariness where we scream around every corner it would be categorized as a thriller/horror not simply a horror. It is simply supposed to be a hard-to-watch and psychologically-scary movie due to the gore. The scariest part about this film is that I would not be surprised if this (the plot of the film) was really going on somewhere in the world. Now that's scary.<br/><br/>They also think we don't know enough about the background of the characters for it to be fulfilling. Why does ANYONE need to know how some people could be so evil. Would it make it better to know that they were abused as children? No. It's suffice to say that there are some sick people in this world and knowing how they are like that is not going to change it. Also, why do you need to know a lot about where a person came from to have sympathy for them. I don't care who you are or what you did, NO human being truly deserves to be tortured like the way they are in this film. And if you can't naturally have sympathy for someone being tortured like that, then you are just as evil as the men doing it in my opinion.<br/><br/>The rest of the people who gave this film a bad review had no reasons why. They simply said that it was ""horrible."" There's no logic to their opinion, so how am I able to listen to them when they say it's not worth going to see. I think these people just go around to every movie website and put a bad review in because they were getting too bored downloading pornography. Please just stick to pornography because some of us DO actually take films seriously (some of us even get paid to). There's no need to trash a film you didn't even see.<br/><br/>SO, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't pay attention to the low rating this movie received because if you read what I wrote above and/or actually saw this incredible film you would agree with me when I say it is definitely worth seeing."
"lsmother","1","4","8","10 January 2006"," What gore?
","I am a major fan of horror/gore films and in my opinion, this movie was an insult to the genre of horror films. This movie was basically a porno with blood. Sex in movies is acceptable if it adds to the movie, but more than 1/2 of the sex scenes didn't add anything. The gore was weak and didn't even churn my stomach. I have seen old classic horror films that had gore that put this movie's so called ""gore"" to shame. I had so much anticipation and build up for the gore in this movie, I was ready to be throwing-up. When the ""gore scenes"" finally started, I was excited and ready to be disgusted, but to my dismay all of the ""gore"" scenes cut away at just the right part. The story also lacked an interesting enough plot. 3 horny college guys and boobs in my face for an hour is not my idea of a plot. There should have been more focus on the so called gore that this movie was supposed to loaded with. The plot line needed to be developed much more and deepened with some interesting twists and turns. Overall, this movie was a huge let down."

The idea was there, but it just wasn't done properlymaybe better actors could have pulled it off. Also, since it takes place in eastern Europe, it's hard to be frightened by a place and people you can't form an association with. Maybe it would be scarier if it took place in the states in some common city we all, as Americans, can relate to. <br/><br/>It was arrogant in it's approachtrying to bill it as one of the most graphic movies ever! It isn't. There's actually no violence in the film until the last 40 minutes or so...and that ""violence"" is just a bunch of poorly executed, 80's amateur blood-spurting; sophomoric, at best. They practically show you anything one might consider as ""scary"" in the trailer. It's basically Roth masturbating in your face and saying, ""Oh look what I can do! Look...I can squirt blood and puss!!"" <br/><br/>So...watch the trailer and save your money. You'll get the same effect. And if you must see it....wait or the rental. At least that way you can do the laundry while the first boring hour of the film drags on!"

It had a story...the whole college frat boy like guys traveling across Europe...the previews should of showed that, I think they would of got more viewers...I mean the first half of the film is very much like Eurotrip...but with more laughs and better characters. Then about 40 minutes into it your blown away and it never lets go. I actually cared about the guys which made it better then just watching some people get tortured. Some people say you have to be sick to like this or very morbid. It's like the original TCM to me in that way. Some things in it are pretty nasty and it does have a lot of gore...however, people are closing their eyes or letting their imaginations go wild. A lot is not seen, people say the original TCM is the goriest horror movie of all time...when in fact there is hardly any blood...but sometimes watching someone scream and knowing something bad is happening to them is much worse than actually seeing the knife,hammer, or hatchet tear their ass up. So in conclusion...if your a horror junkie like me. You will love it! If you get scared easily or you like Saw...you will love it! If you want to see a movie that your friends will be talking about some of the famous parts -eye scene -and you don't want to feel left out....you will love this movie! If your looking for something to take mom and dad to or watching a balls to the wall horror movie with someone just cause you want to get out ....you will hate this movie! and prob get sick!....So from a ""very morbid"" horror fan,I guess they would say.....Hostel has a spot in my top 25 horror films of all time..number 23...."
"chevyboyb","2","4","8","8 January 2006"," Poorly made
","Right of the bat, this movie sucked, the plot is shaky, and then there is a ton of sex and partying soon followed by gallons of blood. The story just wasn't believable. Not to mention the acting was pretty poor because they couldn't get any real actor to play in such an off the wall movie. Finally the gore. Most of the effects weren't that real. So if I were you I would save my $8.25 and see something else. I think Eli Roth was trying way to hard with this one. He tries to be too much of an artist with his gore, but in the end it just is a little gross, not scary. For this movie to work, it would need better actors and some form of a plot line. Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs, both great films and both had a significant amount of known actors. Also because Tarantino used a unique style of filming and revealing the story, it sucked the viewer in. They still had gore, and they were directed by the producer of Hostel, thats the only reason it seemed promising. Hostel on the other hand was missing most of that. Like I said, poor plot and acting. Not to mention there isn't creativity in the way is was filmed. It just appears the the movie was running low on funds and Roth had to slap something together. Instead of screaming or being creeped out, my friend and I were laughing so hard pointing out all the flaws in this movie."

","First i must say, well done Mr. Roth, you've proved yourself in the horror community. This was the most pumped i've been for a horror movie in my entire life, i read sooooooooo much about it online from all the people who saw the uncut version at the Toronto Film Festival. I don't know how that version was, but this one was great. A slow, but affective start... we got to know the characters very well and learn a little about Amsterdam in the process. I must warn all men, do not take your wives, girlfriends, or mothers to see this film...there are more boobs then all the American Pie films put together plus Euro Trip. I had heard that Eli Roth was a big Takashi Miike fan and that he was heavily-influenced by Audition in the making of Hostel. This got me excited and my excitement was fulfilled. The torture scenes were very similar, but not too similar, still original. The camera did not cut away too often either, we saw most of the action. I was also pleased with the level of gore in this film, during a certain eyeball and puss scene a man in the audience left which is always a good sign. I'm rambling. Well, if you are either, a fresh off of puberty boy, a thrill seeking person, or a straight up horror fan I highly recommend this fantastically made movie. Kudos to Eli Roth, and i hope he continues to push the limits with his film-making."

If you want to see gore I suggest seeing CSI for even that has more gore than this movie. The only ""gore"" that was shown was for a split second as the camera panned, other than that it was just all nudity and blood splatter. The only R rated scenes were the ones that contained nudity and it wasn't even great nudity. I expected this kind of boring PG material from the incapable and incompetent director/writer of cabin fever but not from Tarantino. He has really lowered his standards on this one and hopefully will come out with a GOOD movie to make up for this garbage..err not even garbage, this film is the lowest form of existence, it is useless. I do not think I can bring myself to watch another Tarantino movie without at least having a pillow and a free ticket. I would rather sit in a room of stereotypic blondes scratching blackboards with their long nails and open mouth chewing of bubble gum than watch this filth again. Usually Lions Gate and Tarantino can pick good movies to add their names to but this is the kind of movie that should be taken out, beaten, destroyed, burned, incinerated more, and then launched into space with a heading towards the sun. It is not even worth getting a FREE ticket or viewing. And if I could rate less than a 1 awful, I would, for even awful is an immense compliment for this thing called a movie."

","Imagine. It's only January and already we've got two films jockeying for the Crappiest Film of 2006 Award. Uwe Boll's latest sick-up, ""BloodRayne,"" and now this tedious, dull ""horror"" pic from fast rising mediocrity Eli Roth. The plot, if you can call it that, runs something like this: In a Europe inhabited primarily by nymphomaniacal supermodels, two strenuously annoying American teens are in the middle of some kind of sex 'n drugs tour. While wallowing in the fleshpots of Amsterdam they find out about an even more debauched town somewhere in the ruins of Yugoslavia or Croatia or where ever. Hopping a train with their much older Icelandic friend Oli, the two obviously immensely rich pissants whine and pout across half of Europe (these two make the trio from ""The Blair Witch Project"" seem like intrepid explorers) until you're ready to leap into the film and strangle the little twits yourself.<br/><br/>Eventually they arrive at the aforementioned village which is, predictably by now, inhabited by nymphomaniacal supermodels. More sex and drugs follow until Oli suddenly goes missing and...what? Don't know. I walked out after over an hour of this thick brick of ennui without having seen anything even remotely scary. Roth establishes nothing except 'Here's two annoying teens. Sometime in this film I'll get around to torturing them to death. Meanwhile, here's some more softcore porn.' On the strength of this pic, I see a big career for Roth directing late-night movies for Showtime."

Horror films now should be crazy with the technology. Of the three characters that get tortured/killed, one of them wasn't even shown.

They could have used the 1st half of the movie to do really cool things. If you liked or didn't like Saw 2, at least the very 1st scene was tense and pretty sweet. Hostel was pretty much like watching Euro Trip (which was extremely retarded) and a really bad softcore porno for an hour, followed by really brief SAWish gore. The movie failed to make you forget you were in a movie theater, and make you feel like you were the one in the situations. I would flick on MTV if I wanted to see 3 idiots party for an hour.

Personally, I'm not complaining so much about the fact that there was nudity. I'm not going to lie. I'm a guy, I like boobs just as much as the next guy.

Go see something else..."
"andell","8","4","8","6 January 2006"," An Effective Journey into Depravity in the Tradition of Last House on the Left
","First of all, let me say I didn't want to see Hostel. In fact, if you read some of the discussion threads, I have been quite vicious on the movie: purely from the idea of what the movie is comprised of, asking questions like if the next avenue for horror will be to watch Police films and snuff films for our scares. Indeed, were it not for a nagging voice in my head accusing me of being a hypocrite for writing the movie off without so much as a viewing, I would never have gone to see this film.<br/><br/>But I did, and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>The story you know of Hostel is this: a pair of American backpackers and an Icelandic backpacker are backpacking through Europe, looking for the next big orgy or sexcapade to keep them interested in their journey. In Amsterdam, the promise of the red light district is something they take up with glee until one night, when they return to their Hostel and are locked out. To their surprise, a friendly Russian allows them to crawl up the fire escape and party with him.<br/><br/>He tells of a hostel in Bratislava, Slovakia, where the women are absolutely gorgeous, the sex is free and frequent, and he's quite certain that these two horny Americans and their hornier Icelandic friend can have the ultimate experience. At this point, I feel its important to interject a lesson: when you don't know someone, its best to smile and agree, but not take their advice.<br/><br/>As soon as they can manage it, the trio is on the next thing smoking to Bratislava. On the way, they encounter an elderly traveler who confirms their hopes about Bratislava, but freaks out the nice lad Josh when he makes a somewhat minor homosexual advance. Of course, Josh's reaction will be one that he will wish he could take back, but he will not get the opportunity.<br/><br/>In Bratislava, they are placed in a hostel room that is co-ed, and the two women in the room, both of whom are Russian, prove that their advice about Bratislava is correct. Things seem to be going good when our Americans Josh and Paxton bed their roommates.<br/><br/>However in the morning, they are told that their Icelandic traveling companion Oli has checked out, and they come across a photo of him and a Japanese girl who was also staying in the Hostel, provided by her traveling companion. It all feels too strange for Josh, but Paxton tries to convince him to give in to all of his desires as they didn't really know Oli at all, and he could very well have left them.<br/><br/>It turns out to be bad advice. They will soon find out that there is a torture/murder service available here that allows the highest bidder to live out his/her fantasies of torturing or killing another human being. Josh, Paxton, Oli, and all the others have been sold to be slaughtered for the highest bidder.<br/><br/>To provide anymore detail about the movie would eliminate the tension that the movie works so hard to create, so I will not go any further to reveal what happens. I will however say this: Hostel does have an abundance of gory, disturbing, torturous scenes that sensitive viewers will definitely find over the top, and so I believe a more mature audience is an absolute must.<br/><br/>The story in my opinion resembles ""The Last House on the Left"" not only due to the torture elements, but also due to the conclusion, which I feel actually renders this film as a very good one. Unlike with the abominable ""Wolf Creek,"" ""Hostel"" does not hand over all of the power to the malicious, sadist, nor does it portray a preference for female suffering that gives it a very misogynistic feel. The victims in this movie do suffer, but something else comes out of them as well: a desperation, a defiance, compassion and a mean streak that balances out the movie to a very effective degree in my opinion.<br/><br/>The bad guy sometimes CAN be a woman. The good guy sometimes DOES try to help out others. The good guy can be forever changed by his encounter enough to take bloody revenge on those who so cruelly and coldly murdered people for money.<br/><br/>Eli Roth took the movie in a direction that I certainly didn't see coming- it was through moving in that direction that he places Hostel above movies like ""High Tension"" and ""Wolf Creek."" For the first time, we have a quality movie to compare to ""Last House on the Left,"" and I for one enjoyed the journey, even if at times it is hard to watch and listen to!"
"Fedaykin_Sadako","1","4","8","6 January 2006"," Not all that good... (there are some spoilers)
","A note, first: This movie is NOT directed by Quentin Tarantino. If it were, you can bet your sweet bippie that I would be all about it. This film was written and directed by Eli Roth whose previous film was the somewhat interesting Cabin Fever.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is about two Americans (and an Icelandic chap they met in their travels) who are backpacking through Europe for one last fling with sex and drugs before they move on into adult life. During one disastrous night in Amsterdam, they're told about a utopian hostel far away where the girls will do anything, especially for Americans.<br/><br/>Of course, they go.<br/><br/>Their first night at this miracle hostel is exactly what was promised, but the next day, their Icelandic friend has left without word...and apparently left with a Japanese girl he'd shown no interest in previously. The American boys are worried, but the Pakistani-American (I don't remember their names...that's how invested I was in these characters) told his friend that that's just how they do things in Europe and they should just continue to party and screw. So they did. The Pakistani-American passes out in a liquor closet, but his friend manages to make it back to their room...<br/><br/>...and wake up handcuffed to a chair, naked save for his boxer-briefs, with some guy choosing which tool to use first. Torture ensues.<br/><br/>The Pakistani-American wakes up in the liquor closet and goes about trying to find his friends. He meets up with the girls from the other night and now, they're not so mesmerizing as that first magical night. They're not wearing make up or club clothes and they look a tad strung out, but otherwise like every other girl in the world (a nice touch, IMO). Eventually, one of the girls takes him into the heart of darkness and he has to battle his way out.<br/><br/>It's like a 95 minutes (plus 10 minutes of trailers) cautionary tale about being a horny American in Europe...but there's no investment in the characters.<br/><br/>Hostel would have fit well in the 80s TnA horror flicks we all know, but it has a timeless vicious intensity that almost elevates it to the level of a good horror flick. Almost. However, just as with Roth's previous flick Cabin Fever, it's unfocused with some pretty bad dialogue and bad acting.<br/><br/>It felt as though the two or two and a half reels of lusty girls and pot were really to pad out the script to feature length, not to make the torture scenes that much more brutal. Eli Roth really needs to work on his writing...really, really.<br/><br/>The worst part about the movie HAS to be the score. Note to Eli Roth and his composer: You're not making Lord of the Rings here...you're making an attempt at a new millennium grind house horror flick. Your score is LAUGHABLE and not in a good way.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie other than the great effects from Nicotero and Berger: Miike Takashi's cameo. I'd read about it in Fango, but forgot until I saw him. That was a WONDERFUL surprise.<br/><br/>Roth's obviously a horror fan...and a fan of Tarantino's (as evidenced by the usage of a clip from Pulp Fiction featuring Samuel L. Jackson - Ezekial 25:17). He references Sam Raimi and Suicide Club, as well. I'd have to watch it again for more, but I didn't like the film well enough to bother.<br/><br/>This sounds like a negative review...and it is. However, I must say that the last reel and a half or two reels were more along the lines of what I was expecting based on the trailers. There were two scenes where I was like ""Dayum!"" (Kana and the Kids at the end,) but as far as being disturbing or whatever I felt the impact lessened by a poorly written script and didn't really have anything to elevate it from that quagmire.<br/><br/>As for gore, well...I was brought up on Fulci, Argento, and Bava. I can understand where the average American will see this film and throw up...they haven't seen The Gates of Hell. For a horror fan who is well-educated in the genre and doesn't necessarily feel that the terms ""well written"" and ""horror film"" are mutually exclusive, it's a disappointment.<br/><br/>Oh, and as for the ""based on true events"" thing, Harry Knowles from AintItCoolNews showed Eli Roth a website where you could purchase a ""murder vacation"" for $10,000 and THAT'S the basis for the story. Roth doesn't even know if the website was real.<br/><br/>Overall, I wouldn't waste my ten bucks to see it in the theatres (I'm a projectionist so yippee for free), but I would waste my four bucks for a DVD rental and watch it with friends."
"jacksliver","8","4","8","21 September 2005"," Hostel- Mild Spoiler
","I saw this at Midnight Madness as the closing film of the Toronto International Film Festival. This is one of the most brutal and violent films I've seen in a long time. Kind of a revenge horror flick/cautionary tale, almost an attempt to create an urban legend about American College Students backpacking around Europe. I think the best way to describe it is to say which directors/films it seems to be inspired by. The most prominent influences seem to be the works of Takashi Miike films such as Audition or Ichi the Killer. Other influences seem to be Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Pulp Fiction (Zed's dead), Eurotrip (or at the very least the cliché American college student backpacking around Europe experience, Sex and Drugs). It presents an extremely disturbing and bleak outlook on human nature, which one would hope is an exaggeration, but sadly the 'operation' depicted in this film to me at least is plausible in some aspects of it's depiction, it seems very much inspired by the brutal and senseless torture inflicted in Nazi Concentration Camps. I loved the irreverent humour of Cabin Fever, there are still some traces of this in Hostel. I was riveted watching the whole film, at times titillated other times revolted. I totally marked out and was cheering at the end of the film when retribution was delivered. Definitely not for the faint of heart. Rick Hoffman is great as the smug American businessman, the character is a little bit 'stock' but he does a very good job at quickly creating a character that you just want to punch in the mouth. If you liked last years Festival closer, 'Saw' or any Takashi Miike films you will enjoy this. See this film with a crowd, preferably late at night."

However, I can safely say, gore aside, Eli Roth has created a captivating thriller that can keep the attention of even the most attention-deceived viewer.<br/><br/>The beginning really sets you up for a different sort of movie, which is perfectly executed. Honestly thirty minutes into it I was very shocked by the sheer level of nudity.<br/><br/>By the climax of the movie, you are enthralled and, if you have a weak stomach, about to throw up! I honestly laughed at the ""goriest"" parts because I've seen it all done before. Nothing new, nothing really shocks me anymore.<br/><br/>Thats not it though.

","This is the second movie I have watched despite of the bad reviews on it, and first of all, if you have watched Game of Thrones at all, and I mean like one episode, you can handle this gore. It's not like watching someone's head literally explode on camera to the worst visual torture it shows is cut off fingers. I also have concluded after watching that the plot was not underdone, but it focused on the silent, in between the lines story, and if most people don't have curious, creative minds, they can't follow these kinds of movies. But it was obviously about a man who wanted to be a surgeon and decided to open a torture house somewhere extremely abandoned and small enough to pay off. It makes since that sense that a man who was rejected from saving lives, could trigger the psychotic break that set him in the path of these decisions. But it closes every door it opens, as to the ppl that helped, were involved, and bought off without going into too much mind numbing detail. I thought it was a very good movie, and the only thing that cracked me up is that the movie was set in Slovakia, but the driver's side was on the left side still ðŸ˜‚ like not just the American tourists, but the German bad guys too. Definitely gave me a giggle, but it was 2005, and other than that it was a good movie!!"
"Rickting","4","2","3","13 August 2017"," Does one of the nastiest horror films of the 21st century live up to the hype? Short answer, no
","Long answer: Eli Roth jettisons the satirical potential of his screenplay in favour of... not a lot to be honest. The thing is, the torture scenes, while repugnant and disgusting, mercifully don't take up too much of the film. As a result, this is mainly a film consisting of 3 repulsive guys going around objectifying women and having sex, before as always in a horror film their search for action leads to a very bad place indeed. I have heard this film described as a satire or sociopolitical commentary of some sort, and there is something there for sure. The trouble is, there just isn't an awful lot to Hostel. It's nasty and mean-spirited but mostly it's just tedious. There are intense moments but there's not enough atmosphere; basically, the film just wonders what to do with itself for an hour before exhausting the viewer with endless torture porn towards the end. It is undeniably disturbing and the acting is good for a horror film. There's definitely an element of fear, but Eli Roth, although his direction is perfectly fine, didn't quite manage to back up his ideas with a decent script. Watch Saw instead (The first one, not those awful sequels).<br/><br/>4/10"

","It used to be one of my favorite movies when I was a teenager; things may have changed after watching it more carefully. You know, I will not deny this is pure entertainment, with an engaging storyline, mainly if you are a boy. Cast is most of the time professional, and the mysterious plot makes it very interesting to see. Torture scenes are well done and you feel like you're the one being tortured, given that actors and director do their jobs very professionally. However, we've got to admit there are some plot holes that makes it unconvincing at times. For instance, why would Svetlana bring Paxton to the slaughterhouse to see his dead friend? Wouldn't she imagine he could run and kill the bad guys, just like he did? And more, how come nobody found out about the American carnage after so many dead people? Wouldn't the families seek for help? Wouldn't FBI interpose in that shambles? However, considering ""Hostel"" did its job in delivering a tense and entertaining torture movie, this is still a good movie."

","Three horny male backpackers travel to Slovakia and check into a Hostel that is awash with sexy European ladies. What starts out as a dream comes true will quickly turn into a nightmare.<br/><br/>Brought to us by two of cinemas greatest self promoters in Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino, Hostel is wince inducing, if ultimately a shallow gore wet dream for the early male teenager. There is no doubting the impact of the ""horror"" on show, with Roth, in spite of his hyperbole as the master of shock, actually knowing how to push all the right genre buttons. But after suffering what basically is a horny youth travelogue for what seems like forever, the blood fest comes as a relief instead of a reward for nervous expectation. Within the story there's some meat as to how sick the world can be, for example one of the titular torturers here has already shown himself to be the father of ""cutie"" young daughter. And some moral posers and decisions concerning our main protagonist offer some intelligence in the script. But it still feels empty, too self aware of wanting to shock with schlock.<br/><br/>Hostel was successful enough to spawn an even bloodier sequel, much like that film, Hostel is remembered for its gore than for any thing else of substance. 5/10"
"acidburn-10","6","2","3","20 March 2009"," Overrated
","The plot = three friends backpacking through Europe and when they hear that Bratislava is full of horny chicks, they immediately pack their bags and jump aboard the train. Well, what they've heard is all true, but what no one told them was that a company in Bratislava makes a living by kidnapping tourists and letting their clients kill them for a price. The three friends soon find themselves in some very difficult situations to say the least.<br/><br/>After reading all the stuff about this movie, and seeing trailers and pictures on the Internet and magazines and ended up #1 at the box office and became a smash hit, so I was expecting something brilliant, violent brutal and gory in the same vein as Saw, probably made because Saw became a surprise box office hit and the film makers wanted to quickly cash in on the ongoing craze.<br/><br/>But in My opinion Hostel is overrated, yes it's violent and gory but to my feelings are mixed, it's an okay movie but it's not something I would watch time and time again. And what gets on my nerves is that a lot of horror movies that come out these days say they're based on true events, which I think is complete ballocks.<br/><br/>The three friends play they're parts well but none stand out for me to be honest. Hostal is a good movie but not great, and it's great that they've made gory horror movies mainstream, because for gore I revert to old Italian horror movies in which none of my friends ever heard off, saw I'm glad this and other movies like this have paved a way into a new wave of horror. Plus there are some pretty gruesome gory bits in which I won't go into much detail about, but it's definitely not for the faint hearted.<br/><br/>All in all Hostel is a good movie, It just isn't as gory as it is hyped up to be."
"huntinghawk316","6","2","3","1 March 2009"," No masterpiece, but certainly not that bad either.
","Alright, let me get right down to it: Hostel is not as bad as most people here want to make you believe it is. I think - no, I am certain that people who give this a one star rating simply went to see it expecting too much. Two points that I saw mentioned a lot:<br/><br/>This is not the goriest movie ever. Period. If it's been marketed as such, that might be morally dubious, but hey - if you're old enough to legally watch this movie in any country and still take marketing talk as a fact, you might want to consider switching your medications. The gore is there, it looks professional, it's neither over-the-top nor squeamishly hidden. <br/><br/>Yes, the characters are not out of something Shakespeare, Hemingway or King might have written. They lack depth. I give you that. But the plot is clearly about three guys travelling Europe to get the most sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll out of it as possible. That's all they want, that's all they're ever shown to do, that's the story, for Christ's sake. That's what you do when you're young. If I had been there, I'd probably acted even dumber. They get stoned, they get high on ecstasy - do you expect them to explain the Big Bang in between? They did what kids do when they set out to party - they party. Yeah, people having fun aren't as likable as people suffering a childhood trauma and telling the audience every detail about it. I didn't sit on the edge of my seat blinking away tears either. But in the context of the story, they're believable enough.<br/><br/>Talking about trauma: Yeah, that little tidbit about our main character's past failings was cheaply incorporated. No excuses for this. <br/><br/>Otherwise, though, I think people tend to use the word ""unrealistic"" way too often. It's not like our main character suddenly finds a buried space ship in the end, keys conveniently dangling from the dashboard and a manual nearby...<br/><br/>My final verdict on this movie is as simple and humble as it gets: A decent, well-directed, nicely-written horror flick. Way better than most of the flicks cluttering the horror genre, not a masterpiece either (sorry, Eli..). The acting neither stands out as bad, nor as terrificly good - with the exception of Rick Hoffmann as the American Customer, that was one creepy performance. A lot of ""been there, done that"" moments, but no major plot holes either. If you think this is a bad horror flick, watch Friday Thirteenth - Jason goes to Hell and think again. Oh, and if you really think that this is inferior to Cabin Fever, I dunno, just stay away from me. Please. (Don't get me wrong, it's not like I didn't like that one. But it has, like, a hundred more flaws than Hostel, obviously. Still entertaining, though.)<br/><br/>An entertaining 6/10."

","I have very little to say about this piece of trash.<br/><br/>The Eurotrash stereotypes were straight out of Eurotrip though the jokes were a lot funnier.<br/><br/>The nudity was gratuitous and not at all sexy.<br/><br/>The torture was laughable. <br/><br/>Saw was far better. Roth could really do with taking lessons on suspense from James Wan.<br/><br/>I understand why no one showed up to see Hostel 2.<br/><br/>Roth will end up crawling back to Troma begging Lloyd Kaufman to let him direct Toxic Avenger X."

In this age of overpaid corporate assholes, I can believe that they soon are bored with spending money on $400 cigars and expensive liquor and seek out perversions such as this.<br/><br/>The actual torture wasn't as bad as I expected it to be, but the horror was absolutely brilliant. Eli Roth has established himself as a director of horror. The last 30 minutes was so carefully crafted that it stand well above anything I have ever seen.<br/><br/>And, wow, a cameo by Takashi Miike, the director of Ichi the Killer and Graveyard of Honor.<br/><br/>The only person I recognized was Rick Hoffman.

","I think I was expecting something really cheesy and bad. That's why I took this long seeing it. But it was actually really good. It reminded me of a few movies like American Werewolf in Paris (which isn't as bad as it's supposed to be either) and Suspiria and Oldboy in spots. It wasn't nearly as gory as I expected and except one scene toward the very end I wasn't really freaked out. But mind you during that scene I had my hands out in front of me going ""stop, STOP!"".<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, I thought it was great. The only thing I would have changed was something that Kana did. I didn't want her to do that but in reality it totally makes sense that she did. Jay Hernandez was great. There's something really likable about him, besides being cute, that I think you need in someone who's in peril. I also liked the main villain. The more normal they look the creepier they are. And speaking of looks I thought the movie was actually very beautiful to look at. Which is something you used to get with horror movies all the time. Now, not so much.<br/><br/>I can't imagine why it has such a low rating (5.8 as I'm writing). Unless lots of people who just don't go for that sort of thing voted on it. But I don't understand what they would be doing watching it anyway. I don't really consider myself a horror fan but I do appreciate the good ones. I definitely think this fits into that category."
"sangles-1","8","2","3","26 June 2007"," Very Tarantino
","This is a Tarantino flick as much as Eli Roth's. There is plenty of shock, gore, and even a little comedy.<br/><br/>This is the film in a nutshell - In modern-day Slovakia there exists a Hostel which lures young, low-profile tourists into staying long enough so that they can be captured and used by a ""hunting club"". The main characters are lured by the prospect of beautiful women and plenty of sex. When they first arrive, the girls are everything they expected and more. Later, we see that the characters start to disappear one by one as they are abducted.<br/><br/>They are taken to an old warehouse run by an organization which charges members (worldwide) fees for the right to torture and kill a victim of their very own, in the privacy of their own cells, using dozens of torture instruments.<br/><br/>I rented the unrated DVD version of the film. It definitely goes beyond a standard ""R"" rating. One disturbing aspect of the film is that the ""club"" charges the most $$ for the chance to kill Americans (they are considered the fillet mignon). Another is the fact that none of what happens is all that unbelievable. Jerky guys who travel a long distance to get laid let their guards down and fall victim to beautiful girls, drugs, alcohol, their own egos, and even a band of poor kids who roam the streets as gangs demanding candy! I think Eli Roth is trying to make some sort of social commentary here. You think? What the film does very well is keep you guessing. Every actor is an unknown, so you'll never know who lives and who dies."

"mtess-1","7","2","3","9 December 2006"," Well-made and worth the time
","I had read a good deal about this movie before I watched it - that it was a poorly scripted bit of soft-porn trash and such. However, I found Hostel to be a well acted movie with a good atmosphere of foreboding and dread. Given, the first forty-five minutes or so were required to set the stage for what was to follow, but I still believe this portion of the movie could have been shortened a bit. If you watch closely, however, much of what happens in the beginning is very relevant to the latter part of the movie. The violence was nothing close to what I expected based on other reviews, and what scenes were shown seemed necessary to telling the story.<br/><br/>My main complaint is what the hell did he have to cut off the girl's eyeball for when he rescued her? She was screaming as if to imply that her dangling eyeball was paining her. Uh, yes, I'll bet it was, but how about wrapping her face in a cloth or something? This seemed a bit much and simply an excuse to show some pus squirting out of someone's face.<br/><br/>Overall I found Hostel to be an entertaining movie. Yes, it is a gruesome flick, but that should come as no surprise to anyone who knows anything about the genre. I also feel there was a worthwhile message here: all is never as it seems so watch out! Definitely worth the dollars and the time. After watching the glut of teen crap that Hollywood is spewing out these days I appreciated something that at least pretended to take itself seriously."
"ebossert","4","2","3","24 November 2006"," Typical Hollywood Horror, Which Means It Sucks
","It's been a while since I saw a Hollywood-like horror flick, because my previous experiences have been disappointing. I have since moved on to East Asian cinema almost exclusively. I decided to rent this one because I've heard a lot of positive comments about it. Unfortunately, it's typical Hollywood horror, which means it sucks.<br/><br/>The first part of this film goes a little something like this: Some college guys start smoking pot and talking about banging girls while swearing up a storm because, you know, that's so cool. Then there's this nightclub with scantily clad women everywhere. Then, there's some guy banging a girl in the bathroom. All of this occurs during the first 5 minutes. Then, one of the guys gets into a fight, cause that's so cool. Then they go and pay for sex, cause that's like, totally fresh. Then they go to an apartment with more pot-smoking, sex, and rap music, cause that's like, so phat. Then they go to this heavenly hostel, and almost get mugged by a gang of 5-year-olds (no kidding!). So basically, the first half hour is a completely pathetic attempt at character development and storytelling.<br/><br/>The next half hour is where the real meat of the film lies. Most of the torture occurs during this part of the film. The gore is explicit, yet brief. It doesn't drag on for very long, which is a good thing. It seemed as though the filmmakers wished to use the violence to propel the rest of the film, similar to High Tension (without the ridiculous plot twists). Unfortunately, the suspense is not nearly as pronounced or effective as High Tension. Not even close.<br/><br/>The final half hour is moderately suspenseful, but there are way too many Hollywood-like moments that completely kill the mood of the film! Here are a few of them: <br/><br/>(1) The lead character's torturer was a complete moron, allowing him to escape.<br/><br/>(2) There's a really stupid eyeball scene. You'll know when it happens.<br/><br/>(3) The lead character fortuitously sees the 3 antagonists who led him to the hostel. Better yet, they just so happen to walk directly in front of his car as he is attempting to escape the town. So he then proceeds to run them over with the car, even though 1 of these antagonists was introduced in an entirely different country at the beginning of the film. Quite an unrealistic coincidence.<br/><br/>(4) The lead character hires a gang of 5-year-olds to kill some of the bad guys who are attempting to catch him. How, exactly, does he pay this gang of toddlers? With bubblegum! This was completely stupid. (And yes, it actually happened in the film that way.) <br/><br/>(5) The lead character fortuitously sees the antagonist (who killed his friend) on a train, allowing him to get his revenge.<br/><br/>All of these events kill the basis for the entire film, which is, ""This could happen to you."" Sorry filmmakers, but Hostel's sense of realism goes out the window when you invoke idiotic murderers, fake eyeballs, ludicrous coincidences of vengeance, and deadly toddlers who kill for bubblegum! (Also note the blatant product placement for Pulp Fiction in the hostel. I know the cover of the DVD says ""Quentin Tarantino presents"", but for goodness sake, do you really have to insert a clip from one of his products into the actual movie?) <br/><br/>In any case, this film presents everything that's wrong with Hollywood horror. I wanted to keep up on some of the more popular Hollywood fare, just in case the filmmakers actually got their act together. They haven't."

No script, no visual aesthetic, no acting, no budget for proper CGI effects, no camera work and very weak scenario. Everything is just a pretext for the last part of the movie. Nothing to build the appropriate suspense ambiance.<br/><br/>The acting is not very good except for some evil characters and one of the heroes (Derek Richardson). The sound track is acceptable but you could have expected more (sound effects are effective though).<br/><br/>As for the plot, the twist is interesting but takes too much time to develop. Even for a 90 minutes movie! Separated in 3 parts, the scenario takes too much time on the first one. During the second part you wonder where this is going as it is going too fast for a conventional horror movie. The 3rd part reveals that is more a gory movie than a horror movie. Acceptable but it is not what I paid for. I expected a bit different albeit they suggested in the making-of that it is inspired from real events.<br/><br/>Anyway, I did spend a relatively good time but, thanks to the producers, it was short.<br/><br/>I don't think I would see this movie again.

Even if you don't like a film doesn't mean it is necessarily bad and deserves a 1. A 1 should be reserved for when a film meets none of the criteria that we might attribute to a half decent film. Moreover, the criteria that makes a generic film a worthwhile part of the canon it seeks company within.<br/><br/>Hostel managed this complete lack worthiness. It was neither scary, suspenseful, well acted, well shot, well plotted, it did not supply any pathos (who cared about these stupid w*nkers anyway?) nor did it bother to even disgust. The gore was as pitiful as the acting and direction. It did have some great tit action, but as I'm not a teenager i'm not really going to let that sway me. This film gets a 1.

Then hearing a bit about the plot whetted my interest more (sort of a combination of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and ""Salo""). I wasn't a big fan of Roth's earlier work, Cabin Fever, but do like Tarantino's work for the most part. Long story short, I finally got to see the unrated version of Hostel and have to say it angered me more for the amount of money, time, and hype this piece of dreck generated. Some of the other posters on this site have said similar as far as the characters themselves -- where the basic backbone to any horror movie/victim is you have to LIKE (or at least tolerate) the intended victim in order for there to be any sort of suspense/horror/fear. But give us three totally unlikable, self-centered, hedonistic, spoiled, ***holes and who really cares what happens to them? The only thing I could think of was, could we please just kill these jerks now and move on to something else? When the ""nice guy"" character (nice guy insofar as he isn't quite a big a pustule as his two buds) disappears and then is shown tied up and being tortured in the ""club"", I felt no fear, suspense, joy, elation, nothing -- only the feeling that he really did, in some way, deserve this and worse. Same for the other two nimrods. This plot idea truly had some potential but really got wasted in the soft-porn, drugs, gaybashing, racist remarks (jokes???), stereotyping."

To begin with, the theme of a group of people paying big money to hunt humans is so hackneyed and tired that anyone wishing to have this experience would do well to just check out a copy of the Most Dangerous Game from their local library and call it a night.<br/><br/>The writing, if it indeed can be referred to as such, is one big stereotype after another with nothing much to create any sort of empathy for any character. By the time the first killing is alluded to, the viewer is thrilled if only to end the incredible tedium of gay jokes, unnecessary shots of breasts and drug references.<br/><br/>The film limps along for the rest of it's run time spurred along only by very intense visuals of blood and gore.<br/><br/>For my money if you want to see some blood and gore, just rent one of the Faces of Death movies and save yourself having to sit through an interminable, unoriginal and painful plot."

","Let's get one thing straight: Eli Roth is a dirt bag and Quentin Tarantino is an even bigger dirt bag for lending his 'oh-so-venerable' name to this vacuous mess of a film.<br/><br/>The core idea of the film is good. In fact it had the potential to become one of the most gut-wrenching horrors of all time. The idea of a business that captures and provides helpless victims for wealthy sadists who like to vent their frustrations by shoving power-drills into people's eye sockets is bloody terrifying, especially since, in this day and age, we know that somewhere in the world that idea is probably a reality. However, when the director is Eli Roth who can't seem to see anything past his permanently erect penis, the potential for a structured horror movie becomes marred with senseless sex scenes that serve no other purpose than to pacify Roth's miscreant compulsions.<br/><br/>If I want to watch a porno I will go to an adult video store and rent a porno. When I watch a horror film, I do not expect to have to sit through an hour of giggling nymphets with gigantic breasts copping off with each member of the male cast, as well as each other.<br/><br/>The three lechers in question start off their escapades by sampling the offerings of perhaps all of Amsterdam's red light districts before heading off to Bratislava where, according to some random sleaze-ball with a mole on his lip, the girls are more wanton than pigs in heat. They check into this hostel where even the receptionist looks like she warped out of 'Naughty Nurses II' and become roomies with two flirty, 25 inch-waisted, ample-breasted Slovakians. Clearly it's a dream holiday for any man who has never heard of venereal diseases.<br/><br/>However things turn nasty when one of their compadres disappears...cue the cheesy doom-impending trumpets from the 1930's. The film then descends down the usually trail of illogical pitfalls and contrived coincidences pervading most horror movies. Our hapless goons follow complete strangers around the alleyways of Bratislava looking for information in derelict warehouses (obviously the first place you'd visit after checking out of a hostel). And as the gloved hands reach out of the shadows and strap them into rusty, metal chairs in a room cluttered with sharp gardening utensils they realise too late that they've been led into a trap. Who would have suspected such treachery from the brunette with the evil laugh and perfect tits? The torture scenes that follow are tense and a little cringy power-drills, chainsaws, blowtorches, wire clippers- but they are still tame in comparison with Takeshii Mike's Audition, since the camera usually flicks away for most of the sick shots, and since we feel absolutely nothing for the victims it seems little more than violence for the sake of it, another form of porn.<br/><br/>Of course fortune smiles on one boy who manages to escape through a string of unbelievable conveniences: his retarded torturer slips on a pair of fingers lying on the floor and shreds himself in half with his own chainsaw. After our guy breaks free he finds a snazzy business suit to conceal himself in, a glove to cover his severed hand, a pistol to shoot bad guys with and an escape car with the keys still in the ignition.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film the violence becomes so random and sensationalized it's almost comical: As he drives out he happens upon the two girls responsible for his capture and rams into them at full speed. A group of young vandals, paid with bubblegum, cover his ass by smashing in his pursuers' heads with rocks and crowbars. An unfortunate Japanese girl who also escapes the torture chambers spots her mutilated, one-eyed reflection and despairingly throws herself in front of an oncoming train. And just when you think the bloodbath has run dry, he spots the man who killed his best friend, follows him into a restroom and slits his throat. I guess we're supposed to realise that our protagonist has become what he was initially victimized by, but if you're like me you will see it as nothing more than a vulgar excuse for mindless evisceration.<br/><br/>This entire film seemed to be fashioned around violence and sex, like Roth had all these fantasies of different ways in which he could show women with their clothes off and niggling thoughts about the most excruciating way to kill a man and then weaved a script around that. The dialogue is pathetic, full of numb headed frat boy humour and rainbow hued profanity. The acting is quite stilted, except maybe during the torture scenes, but heck, anyone can scream non stop for five minutes. The music is cheesy and out of sync with what is happening on screen, blasting out ominous tones when their is absolutely nothing ominous about the scene.<br/><br/>I have not seen Cabin Fever, but I have heard it was made in the same vein, ergo I will not be watching it. I must seriously discredit Eli Roth's ability as a film director. His films have all the half baked emptiness of a porno."
"ca1386","1","2","3","8 September 2006"," Nt good at all
","This movie has nothing to do with entertainment. It is dull, unnecessarily alongated, and seems as the first part is a completely different film than the other half. It is cruel and sadistic, and only recommended for people attended to sado. Quite boring though, 'cause you see the people's suffering about 20 minutes, and it becomes quite dull hearing the continuous screams. The setting unnecessarily breaks down the image of Bratislava. There wasn't even a nice part of it in the film. The city is completely different from it's actual state. All in all, if you would like to spend an hour and a half wondering when you should stop the movie, I really recommend it, but otherwise definitely not."

","I wasn't sure how to rate this film.<br/><br/>I had no idea what this movie was about, but was board. As a 37 yo guy... there was initially much to keep my attention. As the plot unfolded, I don't know if ever I have seen a movie I was more disturded about. I literally lost sleep that night with the graphic images. It was very Terintino! Did I like the movie... well as much as I would say I liked a bad car crash. Did I like it... no. Would I watch it again.... no. But it's kind of like that nasty tasting soup.... it absolutely disgusts you.... and you now want other people to feel the same level of pain. So I do want you folks to watch it... but it will scrape at the darkest side of human nature and leave an impression."
"novusq","1","2","3","19 August 2006"," The direction - It went south from beginning to end
","I'm not looking to be poetic or flowery in this review. I have seen some REALLY bad film (I went to film school in Canada), and this by far is the worst waste of celluloid I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Not only does it leave one asking for plenty of terror, gore, and suspense, but it leaves one begging for something - anything remotely resembling texture or talent. The only thing it had plenty of was plot holes and breasts. The only thing deadly was the pace, slow from beginning to end. A shift in focus from one main character to the next was unexpected to say the least - and not in a good way. I use this DVD as a coaster now, to remind myself to that anything connected with Eli Roth is pure and utter stink and that my $11.49 could better be spent on films of substance, like Ishtar. I actually felt guilty for spending money on this film."
"danl1024","9","2","3","26 July 2006"," Great Movie, Very Underrated
","I agree with much of what nowonmai42 said, but I choose to celebrate those things about the film, rather than dismiss it. It seems, perhaps unsurprisingly, that this is a very polarizing movie; you either connect with it or you don't. To correct one of the observations though, Paxton does know that the Dutch Businessman hacked up Josh, he sees him ""operating"" on Josh as Paxton is being dragged into the warehouse.<br/><br/>Yes Roth has made an unpleasant film, with unpleasant characters. (If you saw Cabin Fever, you know that that is quickly becoming a trademark of his.) That's the point, and that's why I enjoyed it. Truthfully, like many others, I actually expected to see more violence than there was (although I'm sure I'm not alone in saying the tendon-cutting scene and the eyegasm scene will stay with me for a while.) Roth has made a small triumph here in three ways: <br/><br/>1. I'll never forget the headline in I believe it was Entertainment Weekly: ""We're All Going to Hell: Hostel Beats Narnia At The Box Office."" In a way, it reminded me of 15 years ago, when Nirvana knocked Michael Jackson out of the top spot on the Billboard album chart: It's nice to see the little guys win. Roth has created quite a sensation on a $5 million budget. Nice job. Especially in a year of bad remakes and overblown sequels.<br/><br/>2. Like Romero's NOLD movies, he's made a satire full of social commentary. And, I think that this film just might have similar staying power-- like the original Texas Chainsaw, I wouldn't be surprised to see its cult status elevated through the years.<br/><br/>3. As unpleasant as the film is, it does have a ""happy"" ending-- Paxton is redeemed by saving the girl-- something he couldn't do for the drowning girl when he was younger-- she turns around and saves his life, and he gets to avenge his friend's killers. Which may be why Tarantino signed off on it-- Pulp Fiction was really all about Butch and Jules' redemption, And Kill Bill was about Beatrix getting her revenge and getting her daughter back. Violence aside, these are redemption films.<br/><br/>All in all, the surprise of the year for me, so far."
"brooksm250","7","2","3","1 July 2006"," Better Than I Expected
","Based on some other reviews  plus the ad campaign, I expected an unrelenting gore fest. Actually, this is a very Grimm fairy tale (pun intended) with just enough fantasy and allegory to keep you interested while not losing your lunch. Thematically, this is also a very political film that takes various swipes at the notion of anti-Americanism. (Note how Jay Hernandez' bi-lingual ability, unusual for mono-lingual Americans, is a plus.) Of course there are many incidents in the movie that are way over the top and highly implausible, but, again, this is a cautionary fairy tale, and it sticks to those old-fashioned rules of good, evil and retribution while being very entertaining."
"skinnymill","9","2","3","29 June 2006"," Opinion of the film Hostel
","Genuinely well made as a horror film. The locale of the film added to the overall spookiness. The acting was right on and I will be thinking about this for a long time to come. I have been to that part of the world and am convinced that it must have been filmed on location. One can imagine that the people as depicted in the film were capable of just this sort of sick sadism. In ways it reminded me of that other fine Dutch film, The Vanishing. (which incidentally was poorly made as an American and Hollywood follow-up). Both explore the tragic and sick make up of the leading sadistic characters in these films. Anyone really interested in the behavior of mentally disturbed people should see this one. And be prepared to be shook up."
"brad_mcmillan","8","2","3","18 June 2006"," Cool and realistic movie.
","A group of over-sexed college students go on a party fest through Europe wind up at a hostel that seems too good to be true. Or is it? See, I can write corny tag lines too.<br/><br/>Anyways in all, this was a good movie.<br/><br/>I will break it down into positives and negatives.<br/><br/>Positives. <br/><br/>1)Realism. This could seriously happen. small eastern European countries are shady at best. These backpackers would probably never be found. Trust me, if you have witnessed the lack of power that embassies actually have, particularly the American and Canadian you would fall into psychosis. Travellers are utterly helpless in these situations and by the time the family members report their missing kin, no traces of them will be found. The villains are not superhuman meaning that they don't magically reappear in front of the fleeing victim like say, Mike Meyers or Jason. They are regular people and are killed like regular people. The lead character (what's his face, the one that doesn't die) reacts appropriately to his situation. His survival instincts kick in and for good reason, he isn't an uneducated numb-skull teeny popper. He is on his way to graduate school.<br/><br/>2)Dialogue. I can seriously see me and my friends behaving and conversing like that. Drunken debauchery as such but when the shizen hits the fan we would rationalize the situation.<br/><br/>3)Restraint. They could have went way farther with the violence but they didn't which is good. They showed what needed to be shown in order for you to grasp the utter brutality and indifference their captures and ""customers"" behaved with.<br/><br/>Negatives. <br/><br/>1)This might knock a little bit out of realism but the ""coincidences"" that occurred near the end. The lead manages to run into all the people that did him wrong and murder them.<br/><br/>2)I had a problem with the fact that they were able to recruit that many into an organization that kidnaps people so others can murder them. I mean, how many sociopaths can they interview for a job before somebody goes and tells on them. In reality, I doubt there would be so many people involved.<br/><br/>Conclusion.<br/><br/>The positives out weight the negatives greatly. As you can see from my negatives I am just knit-picking. I strongly suggest you see this movie."
"catanmax-1","8","2","3","12 June 2006"," Remind me never to go to Slovakia...
","I wouldn't condemn this movie to saying its a horror, its more of a horror/thriller/soft porn flick.<br/><br/>Now women, don't be put off by that, my brother watched this movie and lent it to me to watch, and he told my husband the first half hour was excellent - typical man, watch it and you'll see what I mean by that.<br/><br/>If its true that a horror flick has to have, and I quote from scary movie, the 'obligatory tit shot' then this film has them in an abundance.<br/><br/>The movie is about three guys on your typical run of the mill road trip around Europe. They bump into an Icelandic guy Oli who is alone and the three of them team up to do weed and get laid. Although they obviously think that the weed and sex they are getting isn't enough, so they are told to go to a Slovakian town, where there is a hostel to die for...it really is to die for.<br/><br/>The hostel lives up to its reputation, within hours they are out partying with knockout girls and having a good time, until people start going missing. You see one by one the party people start to disappear. Questions are asked but left unanswered.<br/><br/>I can't say much more without giving away the whole shebang This is a movie you have to see, if you are a fan of Cabin Fever you'll love it.<br/><br/>Eli Roth, the director is in the process of creating a second helping. If the first movie is anything to go by, it'll be another ride filled with chills, spills and not forgetting eye-popping goo!"
"zap644","8","2","3","11 June 2006"," That was intense
","I had to check spoilers since I couldn't resist reviewing this without giving some parts away, but I have not given everything away - perhaps just a little more than one might take from the previews. Read at your own risk.<br/><br/>I watched the preview for this movie and put off watching it until I was in the right mood. If Quentin Tarantino hadn't been involved in some way I probably would have given it a miss, but even though I still didn't think I was up for seeing graphic scenes of sadistic torture, I couldn't resist watching it.<br/><br/>The first half hour sets up the main characters, 2 Americans partying in Amsterdam with a guy from Iceland they just met. They're into normal stuff like getting stoned and getting laid. On the advice of a stranger, they head off to Slovakia where the girls are hot for foreigners.<br/><br/>As soon as they arrive, you get the sense that something isn't right (of course, I suppose the previews helped with that). The scenery is what you'd expect from an Eastern European country behind the former Iron Curtain, very industrial, very bleak, but then they find their oasis, a hostel with hot chicks, a spa, a disco....they're in heaven.<br/><br/>Then each morning, they wake up to find that one of them is missing and they can't get in touch with them, first the Icelander, then one of the Americans. We are shown some of what happens to the victims, and while it was hard to watch because of the torture/gore factor, most of it is actually left up to the imagination of the viewer.<br/><br/>I was reminded of the torture scene in Reservoir Dogs as one of the victims sat helplessly in a chair in anticipation of what was surely to come, but as Tarantino points out in the commentary for that film, they never actually show the graphic brutality of the cops ear getting cut off - different torture here, but again, they don't actually show that although the build-up and the aftermath make your imagination fill in all the blanks so you feel as though you had.<br/><br/>Do not be misled by these comparisons to Reservoir Dogs though - the 2 movies are nothing alike beyond what I've already mentioned. Hostel is definitely more graphic. I do have to agree with the poster who said this was more of a thriller than a horror flick. The horror is contained and once the lone survivor escapes, there is suspense as he tries to get away from the Slovakian mob which has obviously enlisted the police in their efforts.<br/><br/>I see the movie in 3 parts, the setup introducing the characters and how they get into the situation the movie is about, the terror, and the escape. The escape is what really saved this movie from being a torture/horror flick - it wasn't like so many horror films where the ""escape"" consists of the final 3-4 minutes."

","BEGIN TRANSMISSION.<br/><br/>i watched this film last night without reading any internet comments. i wanted to have an unbiased opinion on the whole thing. so onward...<br/><br/>now having watched the movie i came online to see what people were saying. the typical comment is something like, 'don't see this movie. it's just sex and torture.' or 'not scary at all. don't waste your time.' or 'this movie was way too violent, i couldn't even finish it.' i will address all three of these in reverse order: <br/><br/>'this movie was way too violent, i couldn't even finish it.' <br/><br/>well, sorry. this movie ain't for you. what did you think you were going to see? unless you were dragged there completely unawares, you had to know going in that this is a horror-gore movie. i mean, you don't go into a movie like Spongebob Squarepants and then leave the theater complaining there was too much underwater animation do you? fact is, horror-gore is a genre. when working within this genre, the idea is to make the bloodiest most disgusting thing ever. people who are fans of this genre watch these movies to see spectacular make-up effects, large amounts of blood and copious violence. if that's not what you want to see, go see a different movie. you can't call this movie horrible just cuz it was following guidelines of its particular genre. i mean, when i get roped in by my gf to go see some cheesy romantic comedy like Failure to Launch, for example, i'm not gonna enjoy it. but i don't hold the fact that it was full of sappy romantic comedy against it. it's just not my cup of tea. <br/><br/>'not scary at all. don't waste your time.' <br/><br/>now this kind of response i can understand. it comes from typical confusion about horror sub-genres. this film falls into the horror sub-genre known as GORE. this is as opposed to horror-suspense. in a horror-suspense film, the object of the genre is to scare you. hence, suspense. horror-suspense movies are critiqued by their genre fans based on how scary they were. these suspense movies can also be violent and bloody but it is not required. it is more important that they be scary. <br/><br/>likewise, in the horror-gore genre, the object is to be... take a guess? hence, gore. horror-gore films are critiqued by their genre fans based on how disgustingly bloody and disgusting they are. the bloodier and more disgusting the better. these films can also be suspenseful and scary, but it is not required.<br/><br/>so, i will assume that the comment i'm currently ranting on stems from the misconception that all horror films must be scary. this is simply not true. however, i understand where the misconception comes from and understand how one might walk into this movie expecting to be scared and then being disappointed when there were no real jolts.<br/><br/>'don't see this movie. it's just sex and torture.'<br/><br/>now here's where i call people stupid. OK, maybe stupid is a bit harsh. but if this is what you thought about the movie, then i am accusing you of not reading between the lines. you looked at the surface and passed judgment. shame on you.<br/><br/>the word 'just' in the comment implies that there is no sub-text at all. that this movie is sex and torture and that's it. No. i will agree that this movie is sex and torture. i don't think anyone can really deny that statement. however, it was sex and torture with a sub-textual purpose. what purpose? read on! <br/><br/>the first half of the movie sets up the characters as rowdy, post-college types. everything we see them do in the first half is in the quest for pussy. they see europe as a place where they can freely indulge in their sexual wants and fantasies. they even go as far as to repeatedly attempt to buy sex as a commodity. the one character, josh, who refuses to indulge in paying for sex gives the audience a moral reference. even as everyone else around seems to have no moral qualms about prostitution, josh doesn't like the idea of buying flesh.<br/><br/>now suddenly the tables are turned. these kids who were first looking to buy sex as a commodity, now become the commodity themselves. the duality here is nicely illustrated in the two hallway shots. the first being in the amsterdam brothel, the second being in the torture house. the shots are basically the same except one hallway has rows of rooms with sex taking place and the other has rooms with torture.<br/><br/>i found a line in a review that i really liked... here it is: <br/><br/>""Roth, by presenting his characters as victims of the same world of flesh-for-fantasy they were grooving on in the first place, digs deep into the nightmare of a society ruled by the profit of illicit desire."" -- Owen Gleiberman, ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY <br/><br/>now, if that's not your cup of tea, that's your personal opinion. does it warrant a recommendation that nobody ever see this movie again? of course not. just because you don't like a movie doesn't make it a bad movie.<br/><br/>personally i don't like Gone With The Wind. i think it's long and boring with nothing in it that i wanna see. does that make it a bad movie? of course not. i recognize it as a masterpiece of cinema, despite my personal opinion that it was long and boring.<br/><br/>i liked this movie. It's not the best horror movie ever, but it was the best newish horror movie i've seen in recent years. was this even the goriest movie i've ever seen? no way. this movie is really disgusting, but it's not the most disgusting thing ever, as many seem to believe. for even more disgusting, see Cannibal Holocaust.<br/><br/>END TRANSMISSION."

","Wow. I was really surprised to find that so many people hated this movie. I kind of loved it. I guess a lot of the criticism is due to the fact that it's not wall to wall blood from the get go. Well, that, and the characters don't seem that likable on the surface. Now, I love blood and guts as much as the next girl, and I'm the type that usually cheers for the bad guys to kill! kill! kill! I found that I actually wanted Paxton to get away at the end and was afraid that Roth would kill him off anyway. Why would I root for such an ass you might ask? Because I know that guy. I think everyone knows that guy. He's the frat boy that you laugh with despite the fact that he's a jerk. He's the guy who always tries to act ""cool"" because of his insecurities an comes off looking like and absolute tool. Yeah, he kinda reminds me of my youngest brother - too much swagger but basically good at heart. So yeah, I rooted for the bastard despite myself. <br/><br/>The other thing I really liked about the movie (and it is a movie, not a film) is the parallel of the beginning's hedonistic candy-land full of hookers and drugs and any taboo fantasy you could possibly want right there at your fingertips to that of the end's gruesome house of horrors where experiencing the ultimate taboo is simply another matter of price. The fact that the brothel's hallway with each door revealing yet another sexual indulgence so eerily resembles that of the factory's hallway with each door revealing yet another insane, horrific act of murder as a not so subtle comment on today's culture was not lost on me. Sex and violence is so intermingled in today's way of thinking that sometimes it's hard to tell the two apart. They seem to go hand in hand. Our characters at the beginning only see their actions as a great story to relate to others after they get back to real life. They don't see any of the women as actual people, just a part of a good yarn. When the tables are turned and they are treated as so much meat (um, pun intended) it's nice to see that someone learned a lesson. I mean, Paxton did go back for the screaming girl when he very easily could have gotten the hell outta Dodge. It was nice to see that under all the bravado and bad behavior there was an actual human being; someone I could get behind. Thus when it came to the revenge sequence I didn't feel bad for clapping. Of course, maybe I'm fooling myself and just wanted to see more blood. Could be.<br/><br/>All in all, I really enjoyed this movie. I liked the slow build, the foreshadowing, the switcheroo from one main character to another with little warning, and the utter creepiness of the whole premise. My husband liked the boobies. Go figure."

I guess i was expecting something a little more intelligent and entertaining after listening to all the hype my roommate put into it, ""man, ya gotta see this! it's SO cool!' (note to self: Don't listen to the roommate's advice after this debacle, lol!)<br/><br/>to me, a good horror movie needs a plot that breaks some new ground, Hostel does break new ground, it's unfortunate that the new ground was more tasteless gore in an era where tasteless gore takes the place of intelligent plots and villains with style in horror movies. this movie has no style at all, it's just sick. (i wish the director would take some cues from 'See No Evil' now that movie has some style and the gore isn't needlessly wasted, it actually serves a purpose in the plot, and the villain is genuinely scary and very capable of giving ya the creeps and that's what a good horror movie needs).<br/><br/>i could go on all day about this stinking pile of horse manure that's supposed to be a horror movie but i already wasted 2-3 hours of my life watching the movie and writing my less-than-enthusiastic opinion of the movies' merits. if i ever catch my kids watching 'Friday the 13th' or 'Nightmare on Elm Street' i would probably condone that, if i catch them sneaking 'Hostel' into my house (or any other house for that matter) they will spend more time being grounded than most convicted felons prison sentences and they would also have write a 10 page essay to me on why it's crap and convince me that they have seen the error of their ways before i allow them a taste of freedom ever again, i would want my kids to make intelligent choices when it comes to horror movies and to me 'intelligent' and 'Hostel' cannot be used in the same sentence."

","Two American college buddies backpack across Europe and wind up at hostel in a Slovakian town, which is advertised as a nirvana for travelers. There, they encounter all sorts of exotic women willing to do their bidding, but there's a darker aspect of this place that they only learn about too late.<br/><br/>Hostel is your typical sadistic horror film offering enough gore and scares for the audience. The premise is pretty creepy and the execution is very effective. Eli Roth is really good at directing horror movies. He doesn't mind going over the top and he's pretty good at building suspense. His story telling skills are a little weak though. The first forty five minutes or so was a good opportunity to build on the premise. However, Roth just inserted dull dialog and idiotic scenes that didn't really have a point. If anything, it just made the audience hate the main characters. After the really slow start, the movie picks up and becomes more exciting. The death scenes are ridiculously over the top yet still very scary to watch.<br/><br/>While these torture scenes are occurring, there is still no sign of a story. It was really just a bunch of torture scenes strung together without a story but with a lot of style. I still liked the movie but it was kind of pointless. The characters are pretty weak as well. They were your typical college students, annoying, loud and rude. Still, it was hard not to feel sorry for them when they were being murdered. Very few people deserve to be murder that way so it was easier to root for their survival. Some people may have difficulty in doing that though.<br/><br/>The acting is okay, nothing special. Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson play the two Americans and they both give decent performances. The rest of the actors were a bunch of unknowns and no one really stood out. Despite the movie's vacant story, the film still showed some scary real life situations. The whole torture chamber thing is probably a stretch but the fact that people are willing to pay to kill other people is a pretty sick thought. It shows that some people may appear harmless yet have a very twisted side to them. Also, near the end of the film, Paxton (Hernandez) is portrayed as a hero for saving a girl and for getting revenge on a bunch of people. After escaping, he could have just left and forgotten about the people who put him there but he went after them. It shows that someone without a disturbing side can still murder after being near death themselves. Or maybe I'm just looking into the movie too much. In the end, Hostel is worth checking out for horror fans just don't expect a lot of substance. Rating 6/10"

","Hostel received some really bad reviews, some of them claiming it to be one of the dumbest films of 2005. I do not know where you spent your last year, folks, but suppose it was not at the pictures, because when I last checked, there was a real sh*tstorm of much much dumber movies going on in cinemas. But then again, here in Germany the usual Hollywood crap is accompanied by even worse German productions full of fabulous new young actors that all make you want to scratch out your eyes and fill your ears with burning hot lead and finally, say, crack open your own skull and eat your own brains.<br/><br/>Accidentally, the Slovakian torture house in Eli Roth's Hostel is very much like a German movie theatre. Only the scratching and cracking is done for you. The story is simple: two Americans come to Europe, accompanied by an Icelandic friend they enjoy the two foundations that made Europe what it is today: drugs and girls. In the Netherlands they meet a guy who promises them more drugs and girls somewhere near Bratislava, they go there and end up in a death trap. Until the torture house sequence the viewer has to endure / enjoy a load of party, fun and sex scenes. There is a lot of stupid jokes and bare breasts in this. The somewhat uninteresting second act is about the guys wandering around in town, sensing something strange going on (and one by one disappearing). The third act is straight-forward disgusting Miike torture action (and Mr Miike even does a short cameo here). There is some good suspense in this part and, of course, a mother-load of gore.<br/><br/>I guess Hostel received most of its' bashing for being a movie with the name Tarantino attached to it while not being a Tarantino movie. Do not be fooled! Hostel does one thing very well, and that is to entertain and to keep up your interest for the whole length of the movie, and that is precisely where most American horror flicks fail today. It is a good mixture of old Italian horror, Fulci style, and modern Japanese extreme horror. It strays from the boring ""Scream"" and ""I know what you did blah"" concept of having one villain with some trademark outward appearance, but presents a bunch of nameless, multinational businessmen given the opportunity to let out the darkest parts of the human soul. The need to torture and kill which normally resides inside a sleeping repressed part of your mind is the real antagonist here. That idea, the sheer possibility of human beings paying to torture and kill another human being is what fascinated me most about Hostel, even beyond the extreme scenes of violence. That said, I have to admit that Hostel often looks kinda cheap. Effects are all well done, but camera and lighting are nothing to get excited about, to put it mildly. The score is sub-par, often even annoying and very cheap and cheesy. Acting ranges from okay to good, surprisingly, with brilliant performances by Eythor Gudjonsson and Jan Vlasak. All in all, if you are into horror flicks, go and see this one, it is vastly entertaining, brutal and fun at the same time."

","I'm not a horror movie fan. I'm also one of those who doesn't appreciate a lot of violence and nudity in films. I focus on the film making, acting and story. I don't try to judge acting in scary movies, because how am I to tell how a person would honestly react to such beastly situations? But I thought the acting was fine. Now where the story and photography go it is outstanding. You realize early on who the bad guys are, what isn't clear is their purpose and their plan. (not to mention that many of them are only connected by the organization they belong to.) It isn't until right near the final chase scene that you really know what is going on.<br/><br/>Chase scenes annoy me. This one was perfect. There were just enough obstacles, but always a believable escape. And as Paxton makes his way from the ""factory"" he runs into everyone that he encountered on the way. Poetic justice flows forward like sweet wine. Right down to the last perverted thrill seeker. Even the young Asian girl receives a form of justice. I really felt she should have been put out of her misery instead of saved, I'm not materialistic but, how would she get by being deformed in such a way, and then considering the liability she is in escaping, her death not only saved her from more pain, but helped the main character make his escape and avenge his friend's death.<br/><br/>I thought it was perfect. Great story. The story really could have stood on it's own, and that's what I think makes it so nice."

I saw it as almost a commentary on not only how Americans are viewed by the rest of the world but also as how we kind of act in other countries the end I felt like the tables were turned towards the fact that no matter how hedonistic these kids were that the guys with money turned out to be the real hedonists. Anyway I thought this film was great. It had all the trappings of a movie I enjoy, nudity ( that's right, admit it) violence, gore,revenge, and even Eli Roth's subtle sense of humor. The lighting in the torture chambers really brought you in to the picture.

","i thought that the film on the whole was very good, a few dodgy parts here and there, for example people in Holland speak Dutch not German, but other than that i had no major qualms about the film.<br/><br/>It starts off in Holland, where 2 American backpackers (Josh and Pax) and there drifter friend (Oli)are having the time off their lives getting high on Pot and the beautiful ladies, they get locked out of their hostel, and cause upset to the local people, when they are called up to a flat where a lad called Alexei lives, he tells them about a hostel in Bratislava, Slovakia, where there is women by the shed load, willing to do anything with three strapping lads like themselves, and being American well accept for Oli (the king of swing)who is the viking equivalent of Casanova in this film, the women of Slovakia would fall at their feet, this said they up and legged it to Slovakia, well actually they got a train, but that is besides the point. On the train, they come across a man, who takes a shine to our young Josh, and upset Pax, by eating with his FINGERS (cos that is a crime in some quarters of the world).<br/><br/>They finally get to Slovakia and it is exactly like Alexei had described (of course). But that's where the strange events unfold, Oli is dancing with a girl from Holland, i think, but in the morning has left with one of the Japanese girls, he is later seen with his head stuck to a chair, and the Japanese girl is getting her toes clipped.<br/><br/>Josh and Pax meanwhile are tanked up on booze and Josh becomes so intoxicated he goes for a lie down and wakes up in a torture chamber, Jesus that would be some dream. This is where he discovers our finger eating friend from the train, who along with others is aroused by torture. Pax is the last man standing and he goes to the shop of horrors and almost gets served up with lettuce, when some weirdo comes at him with a chainsaw, but he gets away, finds the other Japanese girl, who was having a date with a blow torch, but when they get to the train station, she sees her reflection in a glass sign post, and jumps in front of a train (like you would, you know!?!), so not even this can stop our gallant hero Pax, he gets on the train, and is just relaxing with a nice Sambucca, when he hears the man, that was on the train, the last time he was, he follows him to a mens room and does the business at hand, giving him a taste of his own medicine. But then the credits roll and i was left wondering what that ending was all about, maybe someone knows, but i didn't."

","Well, the director really stands out on a limb in this one...a limb on the end of a bloody stump, that is! Contemporary horror artist's seem to by trying desperately to recapture the singular sensation engendered by Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which, when compared to Tobe Hooper's other films, seems to be a masterful fluke if you ask me. Something which is stumbled upon, like a diamond sitting in the dirt, and cannot be achieved again.<br/><br/>We've had ""Tension"", ""Wolf Creek"" and now ""Hostel"". And inspecting the whole process here, it's hard to figure out why these films fail by comparison...but they do. Sure, I winced during some of the more grisly scenes, but the primal horror I felt during TCM was nowhere in sight. The sadism in TCM was far more brutal and alien. The victims were reduced to absolute and sheer panic without a shred of composure left to them...which is what blind, insatiable sadism wants....blind and insatiable fear. The victims in the most recent horror films still maintained an element of heroism (the final twist in Tension was kind of a cop-out if you ask me...like the writer was retracing his steps to cover up a stalling plot line). All this says to me is that the writer and director seem unwilling to cross the line into true horror and opted to save a shred of hope for their audience...which may be satisfying on one level...and yet, we all still compare them to the shrieking nightmare of TCM, shake our heads and wonder what happened to the good olÃ© days."
"fred-83","1","2","3","21 April 2006"," Lacking of atmosphere and tension
","Just seen this turkey...nothing new. Completely lacking of atmosphere and tension, despite the graphic violence, which, by the way, is too much old-school make-up artistry to have impact. If it had been combined with computer graphics in a way similar to Irreversible, it could have. At the end the movie totally looses focus and relies on way too many convenient solutions. It is interesting that despite exteriors being shot on location, it all seems sanitized and artificial. Maybe because the cinematography is too...looking for the proper word...rigid, safe? Everything is over-lit, except for the ""dungeon"", which is too horror-stylized. A more documentary approach would probably have been more effective, as if it was being shot by one of the backpackers themselves. And this makes millions at the box-office, I guess there is something to be learned from that. Make a lackluster movie with some nudity and gore, make money. I have longed for horror movies to be scary and bloody again, like in the 70s and 80s, but I can live without this. Eli, I think you can do better than this, I hope your next movie has more substance and imagination, Hostel plays it too safe by trying too hard to be controversial."

Cabin Fever was the first of Mr. Roth 's writer/director credits I saw and if I weren't a 2nd chance kind of guy I would have stopped there. After viewing Roth's Hostel I can't understand why someone still allows this man to write, 3rd grade students write with more intellect. Please keep in mind this is just my opinion, but for the love of God will someone stop Eli Roth from writing anything else.<br/><br/>As for the film, boobs, alcohol, blood, and gore without any elements needed to tell a story, like a plot, are all you get. Do not try to make sense of it because you wont and you'll just end up frustrated. I guess we, the moviegoer, are only entertained by bare chests and some of the worst special effects I have ever seen.

"pauldenj52","8","2","3","19 April 2006"," Hostel is Hostyle
","Quentin Tarentino is a fan of Eli Roth, the director, of Hostel. I can see why. This movie is similar to Tarentino's from Dusk to Dawn; if you have seen that movie then I need say no more. I am not a fan of horror in general, but Tarentino's name was on the DVD case, so I had to give it a try. I IMDb'd it after enjoying it, and wanted to know more about Roth. I was not disappointed. Hostel has a European flavor, but American panache. The mix of American and European actors from Iceland to Czechoslovakia adds depth to this movie. This movie has it all; suspense, horror, nudity (oh, those European babes are fine) and you get caught up in the action. The element of reality is what brings it home. Roth is able to bring Transylvania back to life in a daring way. If you have traveled or are going to travel Europe and stay at youth Hostels, then this movie will add an element you have never considered. Having backpacked and bicycled parts of Europe via Hostel's, I am glad I saw this movie after the fact. I am a lot older now, but this movie is so well done that it stirred a lot of memories of my youth. The special effects and makeup are excellent, and their is a great group of k...; well see for yourself. Executive Producer Tarentino knows how to pick them, he knows talent when he sees it. Roth started making shorts at the age of 8 according to the IMDb database, and he is an intelligent and up and coming director/writer. ""Kill the Car!"" is a multi-angle interactive feature that you should take the time to watch before the movie. This is the first multi-angle (3 separate cameras) interactive I have seen, and I enjoyed switching from one to the other, it really lets you appreciate how a director can add intensity to a scene with the right angle. I also recommend you watch the featurette documentary of the film as it was being made, ""Hostel Dissected"" which is directed by Gabriel Roth, Eli's brother. Gory, yes, but the writer/director Roth, is able to add a reality to the plot, that is not often present in your average horror movie. This movie, is not an average horror movie. If cute busty nudes,and gore aren't your thing, then don't bother with this movie's portrayal of art of the horror genre."

"DICK STEEL","8","2","3","3 April 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Hostel
","Nudity, sex, drugs, gore and violence. If you're looking for a movie that has all those elements, then look no further than Hostel, which has got them all. Written and directed by Eli Roth, and given the stamp of approval from Quentin Tarantino, this film doesn't shy away from being seen as promoting a decadent lifestyle, and making fun of stereotypical Euros and Yankees, the horny and the stoned, getting their just desserts.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of three backpackers going around Europe, living from hostel to hostel, indulging in sex and drugs. We meet them in Amsterdam, and accompany them to coffee shops for that high from weed, as well as visiting its famed fish tanks. Didn't know what the interior looked like, until today, from the movie (yeah, what did you think?). And yes, those fish tanks which you see from the movie, are what you get (though you can try whipping out your camera and see what will happen to you :P) Anyway, our trio are getting bored with the *ahem* taste of Europe, and are seeking something different. They meet up with a pimp who recommends them a Slovakian city to indulge in, where the chicks will do anything, for the right amount of money. Tempted, the trio really made their way there (surely you've learnt enough not to trust strangers, but I guessed they thought with their other head instead), and checked into the Hostel, where it simply is gratuitous nudity galore, with beautiful easy chicks.<br/><br/>So while the first half of the movie focused on them getting their rocks off, the gore and violence didn't arrive until the second half, where one by one, our friends disappear under mysterious circumstances. They get locked up in some strange cell, and get tortured. You begin to wonder exactly what is happening behind closed doors, but I won't spoil it for you. Suffice to say that while it might initially seem like Saw, with its enigmatic psychopath calling the shots, this film offered a more stripped down version to the madness. No elaborate games, just brutal simplicity, picking from available weapons of choice like the scissors, knives, hammers, pliers, scalpel, chainsaw, pistol, you get the drift.<br/><br/>Most of the violence happen off screen - your imagination is left to work what exactly is happening, given cues from the helpless screams, and the mechanics of the tools of death. The gore department isn't stinged upon, and there are enough blood spewing, dripping, flowing to keep the blood lust factor up. But there is one detectable cut in the movie, which I thought didn't really mar the sadistic enjoyment (if I can say this) of the movie.<br/><br/>However, there is a reasonable logical explanation to all these happenings though, and you'll share with the pain of the victims, and wonder in reality, if such an underground thingy perhaps could exist? I mean, why not? And there's a satisfying ending to this movie too. There are no losers or winners, but the last 15 minutes are filled with so much gore, the squeamish will find it hard to tolerate. And without spoiling it for you, I particularly liked two scenes then which involves vehicles. The first one is one that is seldom seen in a movie, while the second one is perhaps as close to the real thing as possible, without me being a witness to the event.<br/><br/>I sound sick, I know. But then, that's what this movie is, Satisfyingly, sick."

","Couldn't wait to see this after hearing so much about it... had read a few bad reviews and some pretty good ones so decided to give it a go today. I had been told that the beginning had plenty of topless women and that the three main guys were good times guys out for free sex with anything and everything. Why did the one guy seem to have a thing about his ex yet soon got down to it at the ""Hostel"" Seems a bit of an odd thing to add to the storyline when it made no difference to the way he acted. About forty minutes into the film I was feeling a bit let down. as usual an American film with fresh looking good looking slim people who aren't too bright. BUT it does get better. The one torturer seemed a bit odd and kept hyperventilating and eventually gets killed. The Achilles heel part was pretty gory and i couldn't help saying ""Yuck"". And it gorier.The oriental girl and the eye part was pretty gory, and i laughed at the scene with the people waiting for the train and how they get splattered with blood when she jumps in front of the train...great bit. And the guy in the car when his head was being smashed by the stones. one of the bits looked really realistic. I love a good horror film or a scary film and would probably watch this again but do feel it was over hyped in the adverts about it. Tarantino should stick to the kind of films he is famous for, this won't be one of them. The ending in my view could mean maybe a second one.

","I absolutely hated this movie. The trailers for it were probably the only good thing about it. They definitely made me want to see it, however it was incredibly disappointing when I did.<br/><br/>It was extremely slow to start with and the acting was mediocre. I felt for the first 30 minutes that I was watching a soft-core porn movie and this was not what I went to the cinema to watch. When it finally got down to the bit that people were waiting for, that was when the whole experience turned sour for me. There is nothing new ""gore"" wise but some of the things portrayed in it are absolutely sickening. I personally was disgusted and wondered why i had even bothered coming to see this, even though I knew about and was expecting scenes of torture. For me it was a step to far and I found myself wondering if there are actually people out there who want to do this to people and that is what sickens me most.<br/><br/>So basically, if you want to see a cross between Eurotrip and Saw and you want to be sickened, then sure this movie is for you.<br/><br/>I wanted to get up and leave many times during this movie and I don't doubt that I was alone in thinking this.<br/><br/>It is awful.

","Why 'don't have any expectations'? Well when I first heard about this film I was led to believe like so many others that this film was all about torture and gore. Its not. I later learned that this film has lots of female nudity. It does.<br/><br/>So is this film simply about nudity and a touch of horror only? No. Confused? You wont be. Huh !? OK I will explain.<br/><br/>I watched this film on the second day of release in the UK. My expectations of the film were one thing and on coming out of the movie my realisation was different.<br/><br/>The film starts in a seemingly cheesy way that any teen horror might start and you begin to think to yourself ""I thought this film was supposed to be different to all that rubbish"" bear with it, the tide will turn soon enough.<br/><br/>In the mean time, enjoy the jokes, the humour and the female nudity. For the ladies, don't worry, its not gratuitous. This comedy show lasts for a good proportion of the film and you start to wonder where the gore comes in.<br/><br/>It will. And when it does don't expect too much of it. It only happens in bits and pieces but its certainly gory. Although having said that its not as gory as I expected it to be...thats probably thanks to the hype.<br/><br/>When the action starts though, it really shines through and you become more and more involved with the lead character. The director certainly has us by the short and curlies as the film progresses.<br/><br/>For me. The escape and chase scenes really grabs you.<br/><br/>The acting is good and strong I really have no complaints. The film left for me a strange feeling. I left the cinema asking myself ""was that one of the best horror films I have ever seen?"" well I would have to answer yes. If you take horror in its real form...think 'Texas chain saw massacre', 'Hannibal', 'Silence of the Lambs', 'Saw' etc...It is one of the best...Personally I think films like 'Sixth sense', '13 Ghosts', and the upcoming 'The Dark'are more terrifying due to the Spine tingling that occurs. But Hostel really is a great Horror flick. Yet its not just about the gore...its so much more than that.

"Vefizoo","1","2","3","10 March 2006"," One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!
","Wow, such a disaster and waste of money. Hostel is nothing it promises to be. It's doesn't contain enough blood, enough horror, enough sex or enough tension. It's just a copy of American horror cinema that has become to be so afraid to accomplish a thing completely.<br/><br/>The movie can be analyzed in three parts. The first part is a teen movie, where we're supposed to learn the morals behind the 3 guys going to Slovakia. It's so weird in this part that, an American who's living in a dream world himself, tries to judge the Europeans for being selfish and self-obsessed.<br/><br/>The second part, tries to put some horror into the movie. As this part of the movie begins, it's so obvious that ""Hostel"" is going nowhere. Roth, is helpless and it's no surprise that he doesn't find a way out (just a small and idiotic surprise to turn things over).<br/><br/>The third part is supposed to be the strongest, where some tension and thrill should be inserted, but this part is so quickly finished, that as you watch you feel like, the film was out of budget so some parts were just not shot!<br/><br/>********* possible spoiler ************* <br/><br/>well, there is however one thing to learn from Hostel. If, one your friends, happens to have an eye flopping out of her brains, you can just cut the vessels or neurons whatever connecting the eye to her brain, and the bleeding will stop. Don't worry...<br/><br/>********* end of spoilers **********<br/><br/>To those who think about seeing this or buying the DVD, THINK AGAIN!! It's not worth it..."

","I am sorry Eli Roth, but man this was such a shitty movie. First of all what was the soft porn about? The first 45 min or even hour was so useless. I mean, does that improve the movie to let some B-actors look for sex in different countries??? And then the ""horror"" started...what a disappointment...Just watch some Japanese movies and you'll get the same torture scenes, so what? Now all of a sudden ""Hostel"" is ""the scariest movie of the past decade"" ??? Are you kidding' me??? Anyway, two days before I saw this movie, I'd seen ""The Descent"" and I have to say that that movie is so much scarier and better acted that this one! Maybe Eli Roth should have left out the soft porn part and should have made the movie have a way darker feeling to it than it had now. Maybe then it would have been OK...who knows..."
"stangrande","6","2","3","3 March 2006"," Sick torture in its purist form
","Hostel is very much like two movies in one--the college male fantasy Euro-trip followed by a psychotic deluge of raw torture. The story line is rather ""simplistic"" (not in a bad way) void of any intricate plot twists, tension buildups and surprise endings. Not much thinking is needed to follow this movie. It is obvious that the Director, Eli Roth, is very influenced by filmmaker Takashi Miike's work because, Miike has a cameo in Hostel and this movie follows the same time line format as one of Miike's films, Audition. As with Audition, Hostel is rather tame for the first 3/4 of the movie and then the gore-fest mercilessly comes at you full force for the last 30 minutes. It seems others try to compare Hostel with the two Saw movies. I totally disagree. Where Saw and Saw II are more of a psychological mind thriller that keep you guessing, Hostel is just raw torture that makes you...disgusted. The real horror of Hostel is that the main reason for the torture is based on ""actual events"". To think that something like this takes place in the real world is very scary and sick. The one actor I enjoyed seeing in this film, if only for a few minutes, was Rick Hoffman. He seems to perfect the character who we all would love to beat the hell out of. In the movie, Cellular, he personified the prick lawyer type; he brings that same character's traits to this role in a refreshing, twisted way. If anything, Hostel definitely pushes the envelope on how far a film can go to show you mindless torturous gore. I can't put it any ""simpler"" than that."
"mwoo32","1","2","3","3 March 2006"," Real words can't describe this trash-fest
","I just finished watching Hostel and... wow. The trailer was completely misleading, as I imagined this would be a good movie. First off, the beginning of this movie has you believing it will be a terrible Eurotrip rip-off. Fortunately, this illusion is quickly dispelled, and the movie turns to soft-core porn. Wait... what!?! Yes, at least the first half hour is soft-core porn. Eventually this gives way to merit-less shock cinema at its finest, with scene after scene of gore, torture, and mutilation. It's not really scary or disturbing, just gross. Also, someone's eye comes out at one point, and their optic nerve is cut to relieve them of the pain. A thick yellow liquid proceeds to pour from the severed nerve. This is silly. The only liquid this could possibly be is some sort of pus, and this victim had only recently been injured! This makes no sense! Speaking of sense, how could this bizarre pay-to-kill operation even exist? I think I can safely assume that the people abducted from this hostel HAD LIVES and were not all shiftless drifters with nobody that cared about them. All of these people can disappear with no consequences or investigations? Ridiculous. So far we've concluded that the movie has no merit and makes no sense. What could redeem it? Not the acting. We have: sex-hound foreign guy, apprehensive shy guy, party-loving student turned reluctant (and useless) hero, creepy guy 1, creepy guy 2, creepy guy 3... I suppose these people are accomplished actors, if accomplished means being able to pull a weak stereotype or seem shady. Worthless. All in all, I can't believe I just wasted... how long was it? It seemed like forever, and any time at all was too long. Don't waste any money on this. Heck, if you're some sort of movie pirate don't even bother downloading it. It's a total waste of space and time, no matter how you look at it. I only wish you could give negative rankings on IMDb so I could sink the rating to a more representative level.<br/><br/>Final Scoring: Cinematography: 2 Acting: 1 Angry Child Gang: 9 Shock Value: 7 Other Value: -229847723 FINAL SCORE: 0"

"fertilecelluloid","8","2","3","6 February 2006"," Dirty, direct and defiant
","""Hostel"" impressed me. It takes its sleaze and violence as far as you can go with an R-rating. It feels like a Euro film and even has a Euro-porn/Rocco Siffredi-like atmosphere. The women are hot and slutty, the menace is ""Mute Witness"" pushed to its outer boundaries, and the gore is realistic and nasty. Takeshi Miike has, literally, a walk-on, and there are nods to Sato's ""Naked Blood"", Lado's ""Night Train Murders"" and the ""Texas Chainsaw"" remake. At times, the music is unnecessarily dramatic. Next time, Eli, trust your images a bit more, they're strong enough to resonate. The plot is simple. Two Americans and an Icelander travel to Eastern Europe to meet women who will put out. Instead, they become the playthings of businessmen who pay good money to experience murder. ""Hostel"" works because it breaks contemporary movie rules and takes 70's exploitation for its ""moral"" compass. It is dirty, direct and defiant. Roth opts to shoot everything plainly and clearly. His style is not invasive. He builds a strong, murky atmosphere of dread and keeps on punching until the very last frame. There hasn't been an American movie like this for a very long time."
"segratz","8","2","3","23 January 2006"," Great Horror - Better Than You'd Expect
","I saw this movie on Quentin Tarantino's recommendation alone - apparently the previews of it scared my entire friend network and family away. Everyone said 'too gross!' 'too scary!' which I think are perfectly great reasons to see a horror flick. Having read many interviews with Tarantino, one of which in Fangoria, I figured he has similar tastes with me and so I figure if he's presenting, I'm paying to see it on the big screen.<br/><br/>Hostel starts out with three friends (two American, one Icelandic) staying at a hostel in Amsterdam. Sex, drugs, and jokes ensue. Actually, the portrayal of the American post-undergrads is one of the better representations I've seen. Usually the kids are really dumb and all cookie-cutter the same, so it was refreshing to see some 'kids' that I probably would have known in college.<br/><br/>I should warn the set-up to the gore and horror is slow-coming because I think Roth really wants you to like his characters. I didn't find the beginning set up to drag at all but I know many horror fans will because they want to see the violence right off the bat.<br/><br/>When the gore and horror do begin, they don't disappoint. Following a promise for some of the sexiest and easiest women in the world, the trio travel to a Slovakia hostel where they have a pretty good time before one of them disappears. What is this place and why are they killing kids!? I already knew because I'd seen Tarantino and Roth interviewed on late night. If you know the basic premise it will be pretty easy to figure out what's going on.<br/><br/>The gore is EXCELLENT and EXPERTLY done. I'd like to consider myself a connoisseur of horror make-up and this was perfect for me. Not too over-the-top, not to stingy. If you were disappointed in not seeing anything sawed off in 'Saw' then watch this! Also to note there are many Tarantinio directorial touches in the film...it's like he said 'Eli wouldn't it be great if you did this with that shot....etc.' So well directed is what I'm saying - great camera work was done.<br/><br/>The movies' ending took a bit of an unexpected turn for me but that is because I was expecting something really wacky for an ending (Roth did do 'Cabin Fever'...) but there is no wackiness there..actually it's pretty damn serious.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good for a group of unknowns (and thank god they didn't use another B-list TV star, getting SICK of that!).<br/><br/>If you're going to see a horror movie on the big screen, this is the one to see. I'm glad I took Quentin's recommendation."

","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!!!* *YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!* The gore in the movie and the torture scenes were more than most American audiences are used to for sure. But, the story was VERY predictable for the most part. In fact, the premise behind the story was not much different than that used for the movie ""The Game"" or the novel ""The Most Dangerous Game"". Nothing new here really plot-wise.<br/><br/>Secondly, the protagonists walk right into things that any sane person would run like hell from because 99.9% of the people in this world would realize something was amiss. An art exhibit in a rundown freaking factory looking place? Give me a break. Basically, for the story to work, you have to have dumb asses as pseudo-heroes.<br/><br/>I also thought the movie was more about voyeuristic viewing of the audience watching torture and murder. Should say a lot about our society.<br/><br/>In the end, as a horror movie, the plot was thin, the story was a recycled one with a different twist, the main ""good guy"" characters are all idiots, and the ending of one left standing is pretty well predictable. The only thing this movie provides is very graphic violence usually not seen in American theaters."

I just saw ""Casanova,"" and cannot believe that film unfairly was rated R, just like ""Hostile."" I firmly believe that ""Hostile"" should be rated NC-17, for its pornography, language, and disgusting gore. Viewers aren't warned that what they are about to see is filth.

The hostel they're staying at is running a special on torturing horny backpackers. For a reasonable price, the local freaks can have their way with the lousy tourists.<br/><br/>""Hostel"" is a fine horror flick. I was pleased. There is plenty of blood, gore and general sickness here to please any horror fan. The first half of the movie has the guys partying down in Europe with various topless women. Once they get their hot tip on the compliant Slovakian ladies, the movie clearly illustrates the danger of taking travel advice from someone you just met. The hostel in Slovakia turns out to be a slaughterhouse of wayward tourists. The last half of the movie has many fine gore scenes as the sadists go to work.<br/><br/>Besides its large amount of gore effects, ""Hostel"" also has an abundance of female nudity. I was very happy to see so many unnecessary naked breasts in a mainstream horror flick. This movie does not skimp on the exploitation.

We follow three horny tourists in Europe who travel to a small town whose population consists of lonely female locals who all happen to look like Playboy Playmates. Good deal. Right, except for the fact that there is also giant Euro-trash killers who have more torture devices then Abu Ghraib and don't take fondly to Americans. It was shot stylishly and not in that annoying sort of way where the director requests a 360 degree camera move for no reason other then ""It might look cool"".I would recommend this film to anybody who can stomach Ichi the Killer."

","I was looking forward to this movie because I thought it might fill the void of decent horror films that has existed for the past decade. However, while viewing the film I realized that this is one of the most overrated films I have seen. This film would have been better off as a pornographic film considering the first thirty minutes is basically that anyway. What makes my previous comment valid is that the small amount of violence that actually occurred in the film was not actually as intense as the reviews might suggest. I admit I am not easily scared, but this movie made me feel bad for providing revenue for its makers. I know many of you film-goers have faith in Quentin Tarantino, but I think he made a mistake to endorse and produce this film."

","This movie really contains nothing out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>The ""gore factor"" was no higher than other movies of its genre (i.e. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Nightmare on Elm Street). For a movie that seems to be banking on the prospect that it is one of the most bloody films going, it falls short.<br/><br/>The plot becomes evident very early, so there is no real suspense (such as in Saw). The camera work is standard and the horror comes not from psychological suspense, but from the amount of blood on the screen (see above).<br/><br/>The only redeeming qualities I found in this movie were the abundance of nudity (not really something to sell a movie on) and Ollie. Ollie's antics make the movie almost worth watching.<br/><br/>My suggestion, wait until it comes out on video and then talk someone else into paying for the rental."

Poor Lads! Who can blame them for wanting to get down with their decadent selves? These two are the classic Ugly Americans.<br/><br/>With their brash ways and million $$ mega watt smiles, they stand out among the inhabitants of Eastern Europe like. . .Americans.<br/><br/>So, these fellows are assholes.<br/><br/>For the first half of the story, it's all fun and games.<br/><br/>While back packing it through Europe they encounter a wild and crazy guy named Ole from Iceland, (played by Eythor Gudjonsson, who surely must have studied Steve Martin) and they all embark on an adventure in New Amsterdam. While there, some Euro-trash type points them to a town in Slovakia where when women hear American accents, they fall over on their backs and beg for sex. Sound too good to be true? It is, because this is a horror film, where trips gone horribly wrong rule. Huzzah! We're off on the road to. . well, SOMETHING-vania. And like any country ending in ""vania,"" you can bet it's got some nasty pitfalls.<br/><br/>At first, it's great. The Hostel, far from being some dirty, dingy little flea trap, is in a gorgeous, building reeking of old European charm, where you MUST have roommates, but it so happens they're female with large breasts who are constantly changing their clothes and urging you to join them in the coed spa downstairs where men and woman can sit around and sweat au natural. Before you know it, they're all in bed together and it seems the boys have found Nirvana. Sound too good to be true? It is, because this is a horror movie, and if someone is having great sex, can a grisly death be far behind? Pretty soon though, they wake up after making the sign of the Two-backed Beast all night long with their sexy (if slightly off girlfriends) minus Ole, and that's when things start to go seriously wrong. Our boys aren't without a conscience or feelings of affection for Ole, so there follows a fruitless search during which Paxton and Josh are drugged by the girls one night at a club. Paxton wakes up on the floor of the bathroom in the club, but the hapless Josh (the more ""sensitive"" of the two, on the rebound after a broken love affair) wakes up handcuffed to a chair in what seems to be a filthy dungeon, naked except for his briefs. A man dressed as a surgeon enters the room, says he's always wanted to perform surgery, and you can imagine the rest.<br/><br/>In the mean time, Paxton twigs to the fact something is terribly wrong and becomes obsessed with finding his friend. He goes to the police, who of course, do nothing except take note of the missing American and then he reluctantly enlists the aid of the two women, because he simply knows no one else to turn to.<br/><br/>Girlfriend leads him directly into the Belly of the Beast, laughingly telling him as he's being dragged away that she'll get great money for him.<br/><br/>He is dragged through the dungeon, where he gets (along with with us) subliminal glimpses of people in different rooms being horribly mutilated. He is chained to a chair, in a room, and we know he is destined to get the same treatment as his friend.<br/><br/>But no--what follows is an immensely satisfying turning of the tables by Paxton, an exhilarating escape, and The Revalation: It wasn't all just pointless torture. It was an outfit run by an organization called Elite Hunting. For many thousands of dollars you can slowly or quickly kill a person of the nationality of your choice. Americans are the biggest prizes and the most costly of all victims: $25,000.<br/><br/>Paxton's escape is damned exciting. . .I was cheering so hard for him I was having trouble staying in my seat.<br/><br/>All the reviews of this movie I've read say you can't root for Paxton and Josh, but I disagree totally. Yes, they're assholes, but lots of people are assholes at 21 years of age. And I disagree that they're unredeemable assholes. Josh has a sort of sweet, forlorn quality, and Paxton actually ends up doing a heroic turn at the end of the story. When he could have escaped, free and clear, he hears the screams of an Asian girl being tortured. He goes back down into the slaughter house, kills he tormentor, and brings her out. YES!! That's our boy!. . .although not before performing some interesting eye surgery.<br/><br/>I've also read that the movie is misogynistic. I disagree again.This movie takes a dim view of everyone: men, women AND children. Wait until you meet the darling little gang of street kids.<br/><br/>The production values are very nice, the cast is unknown (at least to me) and very good, and there's a nice feeling of paranoia throughout. Almost everyone the Americans meet is in on the plot to process people through the killing machine.<br/><br/>Oh..and I think the hype is over done. I actually went in nervous, thinking I was going to see things I'd not seen before. It didn't happen, even though I was highly entertained.<br/><br/>Also, there is a disturbing political subtext in the flick. You can read into it or not, it may or may not have been intended, but it is most definitely there. You can't help leaving the theater thinking, ""Holy crap--are we THAT disliked by the world now?""

","Let me start off by saying that you really shouldn't take this movie too seriously. The concept is awesome - that is, where people pay to torture innocent victims just for the rush. It could very well be real (although I really hope not). Plus, there is plenty of sex to go around, and there is some of the most gruesome violence I've ever seen in a movie. From a completely shallow point of view, I loved it.<br/><br/>The basic plot, leading up to the torture, etc., is very shallow as well, but because it is more just a prelude to the real meat of the story, it doesn't have much negative effect on the movie as a whole. More than anything, it is just ridiculous, so it is really just something to laugh at and enjoy for the sex and nude scenes.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, when all was finished, I was wondering if there were any major flaws, like there were in Saw (which was similar in many respects).

","This movie should not be totally at fault for my discontent with the horror genre in general, but it is a great example of how poor the art has become. I've read some message boards and reviews of this movie and I was really excited to give it a chance because everyone in Toronto was raving about it. Alas, I feel like I have been suckered into another hype-filled, sensationalist horror flick with the standard recipe of arrogant teens, sexual overtones, poor plot, split-second frames used for screams and gore that is substituted for movie substance. It's been a long time since I've seen a truly original work from the horror genre that didn't suffer from poor acting or clichÃ© and this movie is no exception. I've never even written a comment on IMDb before and this movie prompted me to comment on it, because I have trusted (naively) the reviews posted on this website.<br/><br/>Many message boards are trying to highlight the terrific social commentary and latent meaning behind the movie to create the impression that this movie is either groundbreaking or important, but I would say that if you search deep enough you could find the social importance of any movie if you want to, and that if that is your agenda, this is an important commentary.<br/><br/>Nothing new or creative exists in the movie. As soon as the three men meet the guy with the mole on his face and he directs them to the hostel, I figured out the entire hostel scam, including the main ""surgeon."" Not that figuring out a movie is bad, just that there were no plot twists to make me second guess it and nothing interesting in between to keep me entertained. Does it show the arrogance and promiscuity of visiting Americans? Yes. Does it objectify women? Yes. Does it follow the current them of the grungy, run-down, industrialized killers' rooms that we see in movies like Saw? Yes. I'm beginning to think that there is a template for turning out bad horror movies to generate profits and that someone took a blender from every late 1980's horror movie and poured the remains out into our horror movies today.<br/><br/>If you want social commentary on American arrogance or paying for the consequences of your actions, read a newspaper or listen to NPR if that is your taste. If you want a half-hearted attempt at a horror movie that takes an elementary approach to the discipline of film, then watch this movie. 4 stars because I've seen much worse, but don't let that make you feel like you should see this movie."

But, it's essentially a torture and gross-out movie.<br/><br/>Probably was more disturbed at the number of young kids at the show. Yeah, yeah, I know, kids are kids. But at the least, enforce the Under-17 rule. At the AMC 30 in Warrenville, IL, there were quite a few under 17 kids (and like 10-15 y/o's) that were there. It's pretty easy to get in, there is no one at the movie area itself to check the age. So, if you have a ticket to another movie, you can get in.<br/><br/>All in all though, really not very scary, didn't actually think it was very well made either. See it for yourself and compare it to producer Quentin Tarentino's Kill Bill series...those movies features about as much gore and violence, but far better made.<br/><br/>As Steve Colbert says, ""Eli Roth, you're on warning"".<br/><br/>And I'd add, ""AMC 30, you're on warning too for letting in lots of unescorted young kids"".<br/><br/>Good luck, you may like it.

The next morning Oli is nowhere to be found and after several cell phone calls get a few messages of their bud high-tailing it with no explanation.<br/><br/>Along the way they encountered an odd Danish businessman (Vlasak) whose clumsy pass at Josh infuriated the young man to no end but the two meet again unlikely at the local watering hole and deciding to make international peace Josh buys the Dane a drink and some words of advice. The next thing he knows it, Josh is bound in his underwear to a hard chair in a dank dungeon and his drinking buddy with a tray of sharp surgical equipment glittering sinisterly nearby.<br/><br/>What follows is a nauseating display of carnage and torture but frankly not as gore-iffic as I anticipated with the hyperbole that the film was offered in its ads and the fact that none-other-than Quentin Tarantino as an executive producer glad-handling the media declaring this to be the scariest, sickest violent infused fest in a decade or so. I'm no prude but I think Roth skimped out on the Gran Guignol this could've been and without sounding sadomasochistic I like my gore to be buckets of, not a sponge job.<br/><br/>The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled. I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous ""yeah"" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory. While the sex scenes are plentiful (thanks Eli!) and the subversive comic relief in the grotty hamlet's gang of pre- pubescent street gang as some ersatz ""Village of the Damned"" is highly welcomed (finally also that the 'hot' babes are indeed well-endowed and hot) the film feels compromised of what if promises to deliver: shock. In fact if feels like a glimpse of The Gimp sequence from Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" (several scenes feel cribbed from this and could best describe the film as a whole). Nothing is shocking really when you already know that the results will be nasty ""Saw"" - like environs, Eurotrash baddies and a few well-shot sequences of tension (the one true gross-out ocular venture's money shot is indeed not for the squeamish), however Roth has a lot more to make up for in his shortcomings, namely one character we can totally relate to and support in his hellish nightmare. Otherwise it is a somewhat gallant attempt to do what Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and others have pioneered in the late Seventies and early Eighties: horror with heart."

","I saw this movie two days ago and I still haven't gotten over it. It is not that the gore that is sticking with me...it is the feeling that I wasted two hours of my life. It is literally like the film-makers just decided: ""Hey guys like boobs, guys like violence...jackpot! And let's toss in some murderous ten year olds just for good measure."" Honestly, I went to this movie knowing that I would probably not enjoy the graphic violence, but I heard it had a good plot and I decided to give it a try...never again. If you want to save some cash do yourself a favor, watch the first half of American Pie, then switch over to Reservoir Dogs just in time for the torture scene...it'll have the same effect that Hostel had."

","Hostel is a suck ballz waste of time and Quinton should be ashamed for brandishing his name all over the television previews cause now everyone on earth knows he had something to do with this turd of a movie. I was so disappointed. It could have been so much better. It ended up being more about sex starved spring break type airheads looking for tang then being about anything scary. If got really good maybe the last 15 minutes. I wish the preview would have shown something about the bulk of the movie instead of leading us to believe it may have been worth 7.00 to see it. Go rent Session 9 and see how a good horror movie looks. That was a good movie for it's budget."
"zellerjk","1","2","3","8 January 2006"," worst movie of the year
","I defy anyone to tell me that this movie was at all suspenseful, scary, or very graphic. Suspension of disbelief is relied upon for every single event in the film that moves the plot forward. I thought that Cabin Fever wasn't very good but Eli Roth apparently forgot everything he knew about film-making prior to that movie cause this one is much much worse. The sad thing is that like Cabin Fever the concept of the story is actually really intriguing. The acting was horrible, and the execution was horrible. I hated every character in the movie equally, but apparently I wasn't supposed to hate the Hernandez character because he saw a girl drown. Thanks for 2 lines of crappily written dialog for a back-story. I'm getting too mad to finish this review."
"will_hickman","5","2","3","7 January 2006"," Good movie, but nowhere near the hype!
","Let me start out by saying that Hostel was a pretty decent horror film. The subject matter is brutal and unrelenting and the actors in this movie do a very good job. But...Hostel is going to be a victim of it's own hype. Every person I heard leaving the theater tonight was disappointed in some sense because ultimately, Hostel was not as scary, violent, or depraved as people have made it out to be. To me, Hostel was more of a thriller with horror elements mixed in. It was painfully slow to get going and by the time the climax hit, the movie was almost over. All in all I was very disappointed and let down when the end credits started rolling. Maybe I was just expecting too much but ultimately I think Hostel was a bit of a let-down."

I think there could be so much more to it though. I just feel like this movie was rushed and I think it could've been so much better. Honestly, not once was i horrified at any of this. It seems like this movie was intended more for shock value and not giving you an awesome movie-going experience. It was really like a softcore porno for the first half, and senseless violence in the second half.(someone said that already) Oh well.. people make mistakes, and i made a huge one by paying money to see this."

","Hostel is a splatter movie directed by Eli Roth and stars Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eythor Gudjonsson, Barbara Nedeljakova, Jan Vlasak, Jennifer Lim and Jana Kaderabkova.<br/><br/>The movie was supposed to be a horror movie but is more of a violent movie with some soft porn.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but not predictable. The execution is the main problem of the movie as the movie could've been made much more horror but mainly focuses on the sex expedition of the characters. The scenes are violent, gruesome, gross and unsettling but horror.<br/><br/>The screenplay is good but not even. Direction is ok. Cinematography is ok but violent scenes are filmed nicely. The climax of the movie is ok.<br/><br/>Overall the viewers who came to see horror will be disappointed but for splatter lovers a nice movie to watch."

","Three friends travelling across Europe meet a man who convinces them to visit a hostel. When they reach the hostel, they encounter terrifying situations.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was okay, the acting was fine, the plot and premise was very interesting and it was quite humorous at parts which I really wasn't expecting.<br/><br/>I thought the first two acts of the film were really good but the third act really let me down, there was a resolution but it was really small to the point where it feels like the whole film you just watched was a bit pointless. What makes that even more of a problem is that the movies runtime is only 1 hour and 35 minutes, meaning that problem could have been easily solved with some better writing. I know there is a part two and three to this film, but I shouldn't feel like I have to watch another two films just to feel like something that actually happened was resolved. The first Hostel was obviously set up for a franchise just to make some money.<br/><br/>With that said though, there is a lot of unsettling and disturbing scenes making it a somewhat successful splatter film. The script writing is quite cliche but not something that would bother a casual viewer.<br/><br/>I don't really recommend his movie, it's okay if you want a fun gory movie then you might like this but I recommend the first Saw film instead.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

","I love horror movies, but Hostel is different.

They are then locked up in some abandoned building, where they get tortured and killed.<br/><br/>I feel like this is too much, for me. I can't even watch some of it. However, on a positive note, the climax is suspenseful and the acting is realistic and well-done. The ending is ""satisfying"" to watch, at least he survived and got revenge."
"evening1","5","1","1","20 November 2019"," California -- ""You are so far from home""
","I'm glad I saw this, though I had an exceedingly hard time getting through it. I succeeded because it was being shown in a horror-film class and I needed to persevere. Otherwise, I'm not sure I would have made it.<br/><br/>I am a horror-film fan, and a ninny who often hides my eyes. For the first time in my experience, I also tried to stop my ears. The sights and sounds in this movie combine to create a sense of being trapped that forces the viewer to experience vicarious psychological torture.<br/><br/>Not exactly a fun time, but there is meaning here. As in a graphic horror movie like ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" ""Hostel"" should not be dismissed because of its shocking excesses.<br/><br/>There IS a compelling story here. Two recent college grads from America, and their older Icelandic pal, are partying in Amsterdam, when, due to their obnoxious reaction to missing curfew at their hostel, they fall into the acquaintance of an Eastern European who describes a place where the sex is free and it's like child play to score. In no time, the trio hops a train to Slovakia.<br/><br/>Uneasiness starts to build inexorably. These guys are rapacious exploiters, heading to Bratislava with a plan to bed local women. (Horror-movie buffs may recall the bravado of similarly cocky protagonists in ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the aforementioned ""Holocaust."")<br/><br/>We're somewhat discomfited by the vulnerability of Josh (Derek Richardson). He'd declined to pay for sex in Amsterdam, and, later on the train, reacts violently to a knee tap from a weird Dutch businessman (Jan Vlasak), who eats his salad with his fingers, explaining he enjoys making ""a connection with something that has died"" for him. Er, OK. His creepy antics raise a red flag -- again, recall the warning sign of a guide's debilitating snake bite in ""Holocaust"" -- but the tourists aren't about to turn back. How many people would? Life offers its share of strangeness, but how many of us ponder the potentialities?<br/><br/>Sure enough, when our guys arrive at their Slovakian hostel, and follow some uninhibited local gals to a steam room, the sauna looks like every schoolboy's fantasy: ""Oh, s___ man, we're never leaving here!"" (A little dark humor.)<br/><br/>It's all a big setup. These outwardly crude, street-dumb horndogs are putty in the clutches of their handlers. Like a sinister sleight of hand, a crew of child street thugs surrounds Josh, only to be sent packing by, yep, the Dutch businessman. And soon Josh is apologetically offering this guy a drink. Bad move!<br/><br/>The movie drives the viewer -- at least if she is of a certain age -- to feel a sense of protectiveness over the wayfarers. Yet we are as defenseless as they. The scene in which Josh awakens from being drugged, and finds himself chained, shackled, and desperately trying to understand, induces terror and panic. We become Josh -- how compelling is THAT for direction?<br/><br/>I felt weak and defeated as I tried to get through this film. At a certain point, I reached for some life-giving, life-affirming sustenance, and ate some grapes. I thought of my loved ones and my wish for their safety. I uncomfortably remembered how we humans seem programmed to see so very little of what is actually present.<br/><br/>""I get a lot of money for you,"" Paxton's erstwhile sex partner gloats. ""And that makes YOU my b___."" One shivers here to remember a similar dynamic in the French-Dutch film ""The Vanishing,"" in which a man is lured toward disaster out of a wish to solve a lover's disappearance.<br/><br/>In class we discussed how this film came out after disclosures about US military abuses at the Abu Gharaib prison in Iraq. It was also in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union, when former client states struggled to find a new economic track and corruption could flourish."

","Hostel (2005): Dir: Eli Roth / Cast: Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eythor Guojonsson, Jennifer Lim, Barbara Nedeljakova: Intense yet unsettling horror film about the illusions given to three males backpacking to Amsterdam. Their quest for sex becomes a nightmare when they are sold for torture. What should be an X rated film becomes another example of a failed system out for the sell. This is not for everyone as it features pornographic scenes as well as images of torture ranging from drilling to blow-torching eyeballs. Director Eli Roth is skillful and presents the flashy culture and discos where these males are seduced, but he also presents the underground sex trade and torture, which unfortunately may have some roots in reality. Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson and Eythor Guojonsson play the backpackers caught up in something truly evil. Guojonsson disappears first, then after their drinks are drugged by hookers, Richardson awakens strapped to a chair. Hernandez endures torture but fights back, survives, and takes revenge. Jennifer Lim is also searching for a friend and is caught up in the torture. She escapes but the physical scars bring emotional fatality and breakdown. Barbara Nedeljakova plays one of the vixens who lures the fellows to their doom. Uneasy yet well made smut that screams what we were taught about talking to strangers in strange unfamiliar lands.

"fire-lizard","7","1","1","5 February 2009"," Actually not as bad as it sounds
","This isn't a work of art but it is not intended to be. It is a decent horror flick on the creepy side and horror fans would enjoy it if they tried. But i do have to admit it isn't perfect. I'll come to that later.<br/><br/>Lets start with the good. The acting was very decent for a horror slasher. The three actors that played the backpackers all convinced me that they were young and in need of a good time. They also showed fear as they were getting tortured which made me feel how they were feeling. Eli Roth directed the film very well and he does have some talent which shows his passion for horror films and I do have faith that he may become the next George Romero. The storyline did keep me hooked as Paxton was trying to get away from the villains.<br/><br/>Now for the bad, most of the gore scenes were quite unnecessary. They didn't all need to be there and it seemed that it as there just to keep the film in budget. It was a pretty sick film and is not for the kids to watch. The goriest part was the eye gouging part. If you don't mind that part than you will be fine. The film as also split in two half's. The first half was a softcore porno and the second half was a gorefest. The sex scenes were very erotic and the girls were all very sexy but like the gore, not all of them were necessary.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great ""bad movie"" with some entertaining scenes of gore and erotic sex that twisted minds will love. But beware its not for everyone."

","It is amazing what you can do with movies. Movies can evoke all types of emotions. The can make you laugh they can make you cry, they can make you love the bad guy and hate the good guy. And in the case with the movie ""Hostel"", they can make you never want to visit a place that otherwise would normally be appealing to most anyone. <br/><br/>This movie does nothing to alleviate the fears of people who are already afraid to travel abroad. Hostel implicates a small city in Europe as a place where the wealthy act out their horrendous dreams of torture. Just to think that such people exist or that such a complicit place exists makes my skin crawl. Hostel is most effective because of its setting more than the blood and gore that was shown. Just the very idea of such things possibly happening make this movie a horror classic."
"stewiefan201","8","1","1","3 April 2008"," Hostel is a cut above (no pun) the level of most modern horror flicks.
","Hostel is about three young men named Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson), and the sex-crazed Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson)who take a trip to Amsterdam. While there all their fantasies of sex and drugs are met. But while on a train heading back to their hostel, they meet a strange dutch businessman. He tells them that if they head to Slovakia there is a spot where they can find anything they want, promiscuous girls and drugs beyond their wildest expectations. So the three of them head there and soon realize that the businessman did not lie. Slovakia is like a dream come true for the three of them. However soon one of them goes missing after a night of partying. Neither one of the two understands where he went and are starting to worry. Until finally the tables turn on them, and they are transported to a secret torture chamber. This torture facility is an enormous place where, as it turns out, rich people can pay to act out there sickest murderous desires. Once the people pay they can do whatever kind of torture they want to these kidnapped people. Once the two realize what is happening to them, they struggle to survive and elude recapture within the facility.<br/><br/>Horror movies have become the epitome of crap lately in my opinion. I'm writing this review in 2008, over 2 years after this film was released. But the horror genre has stayed the same since this film's 2006 release. Recently we have been getting boring PG-13 horror flicks that are not scary in the least. As for the R rated horror, some of it is good, but there's a little too much ""Saw sequel"" for my liking. But Hostel rises above it all because this is one of the most suspenseful horror films in years. The director Eli Roth obviously knows horror like the back of his hand, and it was also very evident with his first movie Cabin Fever, which had a handful of homages to classic horror flicks that inspired him. Hostel overflows with gripping suspense, and a mostly constant impending tension that something bad is lurking right around the corner. One scene I'd like to mention is where one of the three men is trying to elude capture in the torture facility, but ends up being confronted by a psychotic, demented businessman. The businessman asks the guy what it was like to torture a person, and if he got a real good rush from murdering a person. The guy literally doesn't know how to respond to such a wacko, and is frightened by how gung-ho and pumped up this businessman is getting, knowing that in a few minutes he'll be torturing and killing an innocent person. This scene is absorbingly brilliant, and is so well acted and quietly insane that I knew it would be a classic horror movie scene for years to come. There are also a few scenes where the movie becomes half-horror and half-thriller, with finely shot suspense-charged chase sequences.<br/><br/>The movie is basically split into three sections. The first section is basic pornography with gratuitous sex scenes. The second section is purely twisted torture and terror. And the third section is mostly suspense with just a twinge more torture. The one section that works the least, and actually detracts from Hostel, is all the sex scenes. They were laid on (no pun intended) a little too thick, and were mostly just downright unnecessary. Another issue with Hostel is the underdevelopment of the three lead characters. This defect detracted from the experience as well. In my opinion they could have just cut out most of the sex scenes, and put in scenes to develop the characters instead which was much more necessary.<br/><br/>Other than these weaknesses Hostel is a very strong movie with a potent message. The torture scenes are very well done and interestingly shot. They are also much more psychological than gory, which only makes Hostel that much more disturbingly riveting. Whereas Eli Roth's Cabin Fever was just an all-out, no holds barred gore fest. Hostel is more mature and leaves far more to the imagination. But that's not to say Hostel isn't gory, because believe me it is. There are many scenes in the movie that are audaciously violent, and also very cynical and vile. An example is that we see a man's Achilles tendon snipped with a scissor, and I actually just shivered writing that down. There is also another graphic scene where a certain part of someone's face is hanging off after being burned with a Bunsen burner. So if you ask if Hostel is violent or not, now you know the answer is an indefinite yes. However the fact that Hostel isn't an all out gore fest definitely adds to the film's effectiveness.<br/><br/>As a thriller Hostel is good, and as a horror movie Hostel is a cut above the rest of the junk that gets released. The underlying message of Hostel is that many people do have a dark side to them, and actually may desire murder and blood. The parallel showing one man's fight for survival relays the message ""kill or be killed"" very well. But of course the story had a few flaws, just like any normal horror flick. I give Hostel a 3 out of 4. It is original and rises above the common torture porn standards to deliver a good horror film, with a few classic scenes."
"korvics","9","1","1","17 March 2008"," You either love it or hate it.
","I think it is already pretty clear from the tremendous numbers of reviews that this is a pretty gory horror film. I think it is also pretty clear from the ratings that people either give it a 1 or something around 8. I understand both people who hated it, as well as people who enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>For starters if you the kind of person that likes to turn off the brain before watching a movie and just like to ""enjoy the ride"" then this movie is probably not for you. If you have a weak stomach this movie is Definitely not for you.<br/><br/>However if you want to see a real shocker, and if you are a big horror fan the you simply must see this movie. I liked this movie for a couple of reasons. First being the fact this movie is so shocking you will remember it for a LONG time regardless if you loved it or hated it. I personally think that the director did a good job since this movie has such a tremendous impact on the viewer. The second thing that I liked about the movie is the idea behind it. This movie is not meant to please the viewer with its cheesy story or a predictable happy ending. This movie is meant to shock you. This movie makes you think about how twisted a human mind can be.<br/><br/>In a nutshell this movie is a ""love it"" or a ""hate it"" experience. If you seek some serious shocking horror then I recommend this to you. If you seek something that hasn't been done before and you are a Tarantino fan - I will recommend this to you as well. Whether you will love this movie - or will hate this movie I can guarantee you one thing. You will remember this movie for a very long time.<br/><br/>9 out of 10"

","I enjoyed the movie a lot. It has got all the elements needed to be a good R-Rated movie. Well this movie could have achieved an NC-17 rating easily. The story of th movie is so nice and realistic that at one point we start to imagine if people like these really exist in the world.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a group of American friends on a tour to Europe to enjoy life and to have some 'real' fun. They get introduced to a guy who sends them to the Slovakian city assuring them that they get all the fun they ever want. They go to that city and rest should be seen on screen. Well, I guess this movie would have faced a ban in Europe for showing such content in its cities.<br/><br/>Some people may not like this kind of movies and might say ""is this entertainment??""... well. my answer for them...These movies are just and only for entertainment and do not try these with your spouses. Movies are meant for showing something which is unusual to us.<br/><br/>Direction is very good. All the characters are very well carried off by the actors.I,especially, liked the scene with Rick Hoffman in it where he tells Jay Hernandez why he came to that place.The two girls,Barbara Nedeljakova and one more, in the movie are beautiful.<br/><br/>So guys, if u need pure entertainment with gore and violence, this movie sates your need."
"horrorforpresident","8","1","1","1 March 2008"," A great modern horror flick that will be used as an example for torture cinema forever, but does it lack something?
","When I first heard or this film I was very excited to see it, I like Eli Roth, and enjoyed watching Cabin Fever. I naturally couldn't wait to see this, and thought that it would be a big hit, even though I knew that it wouldn't be scary, I knew it would be good, and gory, and it was. The hit factor, however, was basically mixed with ""I hate it"" or ""I love it!"" And, this is basically peoples thoughts on Eli Roth, a risky director in the torture genre, with some good ideas, and a good studio behind him, but he's a director who needs to expand into the horror genre, maybe he should get into some ghost films or something, I don't no, whatever he likes. But he needs to steer away from the torture genre, before this is the only movie he can do. I'm not saying he can't go back, but he should just.........try other types of horror, before this type or film is all anyone will remember him for.<br/><br/>Hostel is basically a film about some young adults, who go one a backpacking trip to Europe, in search for girls, beer, and drugs. But they don't get what they bargained for, once the team head to a mysterious Solvockian town things take a turn for the worse, and they are soon brought into a world of blood, carnage, and greed. The men become en-raveled in an underground torture shop, where rich men can go to torture victims in any way possible. The events that follow, are those of death, hate, loss, and murder, to try to get out of the hellish kill house alive.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the film, and thought that it was an interesting way to pursue the horror genre, with a worthy director of doing it. However it was lacking some key details that are needed to direct a torture film.<br/><br/>1. The acting was not very good, witch hurt the movie to a small extent.<br/><br/>2. The script was okay, and in a torture film, you need a good script to get buy in the theaters.<br/><br/>Overall, Hostel was an interesting way to go forward in the torture genre, with gore, (but actually not that much) humor, so-so acting, and tons of blood. It's a ""rent it"" if generally just like horror films, but it's a definite buy for the die hard torture cinema fan. Check it out, it's good."
"nik963","8","1","1","23 January 2008"," Very Impressive
","This is an excellent example of the new 'torture porn' horror. Whereas Captivity and Saw are poor movies with little plot or subtexts, this film explores the American view of Europe being a strange place with strange people. It also displays three guys and their three hobbies, sex, drugs and being abusive.<br/><br/>Eli Roth portrays Amsterdam and Slovakia as drug infused, violent places but they are perfect for this movie. The tension is intense, I was hooked from the beginning. It's a bit different, for the first half an hour it's like a Eurotrip with sex, drugs and idiotic behaviour from the three main characters. <br/><br/>The remainder is very clever. We have a wide variety of nationalities and the interesting treatment of the American's. the insidiousness of the set-up and intelligent use of ordinary looking men being so evil is brilliant. The real villain was not who I expected.<br/><br/>Jay Hernandez (Paxton) was impressive and you really were behind him beating these sick people!<br/><br/>What I really liked was the constant uneasiness throughout the movie. Every scene has a sense of shadow, darkness and that the character is going to find himself in trouble. <br/><br/>Roth's Cabin Fever was good but this is better. I was mistaken before I saw this in thinking it is 'torture porn' and consistent violence but it manages to combine a real story-line and gives depth to the characters, rare in horror movies. And when the violence did come it was not gratuitous but real and grim. I particularly liked the setting. The factory like building had a real sense of unease. and the close attention to detail with the tools and grotty walls accentuated the premise. <br/><br/>If you like horror you will love this but even if you don't you will enjoy it. Hostel manages to crossover, a rarity in horror."

I thought that this was to be a total T&A movie so I moved on..I came back during the part when Jay Hernandez's character was actually at the torture factory and saw his friends and then was tied up by the German guy and watch until the end..so I know I missed a lot..what I saw was a pretty good horror movie, I just wished that I hadn't missed so much of the rising action part of the film. I will totally watch it from start to finish the first time I can catch it on at a decent time. I am curious..is the second one as good or is it like so many second movies not as good?"

","""Hostel"" was a hotly debated movie when it came out. Examples of the past are: ""The Passion of the Christ"" (without any point, boring) or ""Borat"" (funny, but nothing really special). I had the privilege to see these films months after their original release and it allowed me to have lesser preconceptions. The same it was with ""Hostel"" by Eli Roth. It is not a bad horror film. If you know the rules of the horror genre, there won't be too many surprises in this film, but it still is thrilling and shocking at times and this makes it worth seeing. If it comes to the violence, everything you heard is true. It's definitely one of the most brutal movies I have ever seen, but still not worth the stir that it caused. My point of criticism is that sometimes I was not sure if the depicted clichés and stupidities are just there for themselves or if the director actually wants to say more with that. That's not a problem for me, but it makes the film a bit trashy, less serious, and this again hurts the suspense."

"outbreakt","9","1","1","16 July 2007"," A good movie but just not enough to live up to horror movies these days
","WARNING: The Information Contains Spoilers To This Movie, do not read if you haven't watched the film. To everyone who has/hasn't seen the film and want to know if its worth watching or not please do not read this form, watch the movie first then read this bulletin. Thank you! This movie was decent, it has its ups and downs. The storyline for example wasn't very strong and there was to much gore and little fright. Fright is the main quality to horror movies, gore is just added to make it better in different ways. By grossing out the viewers and making it realistic so that each time you see the gory part it'll be easier to watch and that you can understand the movie better. Horror movies these days are very bad to be honest. The story lines and screenplays are very hard to perform and perfect it out so that viewers can enjoy it, and the acting is very important too otherwise you can't take the character seriously if they can't act. The good things about this movie was that the acting was good, it has its moments in both gore and fright (but more of gore) and its worth watching compared to other horror movies these days. The ways in which the main character survives/escapes in this movie is very difficult to understand and a lot of viewers that watched this movie think its bull or he just got lucky. But if you look on the bright side how else is the main character going to live? If the main character died whats the point of watching this film? It would be hard to make a sequel to live up to the original without knowing what really happened. That is why when you saw how Paxton escaped at first then heard the scream of the Asian girl (i think she's Asian) he went back to her and rescued her when he could have escaped without having the risk to get caught but he succeeded when 9 times out of 10 he would have died if it was real and not a movie. The reason that the directors and script writers do that is to show the heroic side of the character and that he/she can show their true self in the movie to show that he/she is worth watching and worth living. That is why in horror movies when viewers are watching the film they will say ""get out of the house/don't open the door"" it basically creates a mood and gets you excited to see what happens. Because everyone is like that, but when the survivor escapes they have to have a moment of heroic time (people say) so that its more interesting and that the main character escapes and leaves just like that! That is not interesting it just shows that the writer/directer rushed the film and that its not worth viewing. I am basically saying that Paxton did this and he was the hero of the film he avenged his friends at the end and escaped (thanks to the Asian girl because of her distraction to hope on the train). Please read this and think things over with this movie even if you hated it just look on the bright side and accept it for the way it is. Thank you all for reading this and hope that you all agree with me.<br/><br/>P.S. I give 9/10 because horror movies are not perfect these days for a 10."
"Jakethemuss","7","1","1","30 June 2007"," Don't be expecting an all out gore fest!
","Despite this being a well directed and effective film. I feel this, like many other horror films, has been overrated in terms of gore. Slogans like ""The sickest film you'll ever see"" grace the front cover..okay, maybe if you only watch like 5 films a year.<br/><br/>I found the gore only came later on in the film, the first part of the film dealing more with the 3 carefree young travellers as they go exploring in Amsterdam. The unpleasant aspect of the film is not the actual on screen violence, more the way in which the 3 travellers are lead astray, promised beautiful women at this ""too good to be true"" place of pleasure, all they have to do is catch a train and go there. Viewing becomes increasingly uncomfortable when you see just how wrong they were to go there, it seems they are 3 decent people alone in a sea of scheming strangers and evil twists. They are in unfamiliar territory, everyone appears to be hostile, you can feel the earlier energy in the film disappear as what was supposed to be a trip of a lifetime turns deadly serious.<br/><br/>However, when the violence does come, it is pulled of with precision and skill, no tired clichés, no overblown heroics, just upfront depictions of one human being relentlessly sadistic to another. It is the idea which is revolting...business man paying big bucks just to be able to torture somebody for kicks. The actual scenes of physical torture are brief, but intensely graphic for their short period.<br/><br/>If you want all out gore and violence, Hostel is not what your after, watch the remake of ""The Hills have Eyes"" for that. Hostel, under the talented direction of Eli Roth, is an insight into the darker side of human will, and deals with how far some people will go to 'try something new'."
"jzappa","8","1","1","18 June 2007"," Humans are Capable of the Truly Unspeakable
","Hostel is the second film by Eli Roth, writer and director of Cabin Fever, which I did not like, personally. I found that Hostel, however, was an improvement, although I think Roth is still warming up. Hostel shows that Roth can make a movie with smart intentions towards its structure, but unfortunately it falls short of what it could so easily be, a nearly unbearably intense horror film. Instead of being scary like the slowly paced, mysteriously gleeful exposition seems to prepare us for, it becomes a gorefest and a chase film. That is all enjoyable, but Roth has yet to truly scare me.<br/><br/>What I especially love about Hostel is that Roth demonstrates his complete lack of fear or hesitation in giving an audience complete satisfaction of their anger and frustration, and yet at the same time, he is very patient with his story. Roth lets his characters be human and whole in the most interesting avenues to employ realistic approaches to them, one of them being to masquerade them as token fratboy slasher film stick figures, and at the same time, they are impatiently, furiously, monstrously vindictive.<br/><br/>The film's scenes of gore are range in effect, and they are all good. There are very brief yet extremely disturbing images, and there are extensive scenes that are actually quite fun because of the suspense weaved by the clever situation that faces graphic violence at point blank range.<br/><br/>Hostel simply doesn't have the impact it needs to be what it's supposed to be. It doesn't pack a punch. It packs more of a John Cleese eye poke."
"zlockman","7","1","1","4 June 2007"," A good time.
","As many people would like to believe, That Hostel was just a skin and torture exploitation film, I have these things to say. Hostel is the perfect horror movie, not because of some sick twisted, perverse and demented fantasy that is buried somewhere deep in my brain, but because it actually sacred me to the point of wanting to cry. Many regard all horror films the same way they would regard most soft core porn, as all the same. A slight plot an inevitable ending and a sense that as the story closes that you knew everything that was going to happen before it did. The ending is logical and everyone knew that someone was getting laid. With most horror films there is a protagonist that has in some way a purpose, i.e. a satanic ritual that needs to have ten blond virgins blood, a crazy man has been infected by the soul of a long dead serial killer. Someone is going to kill, torment, or bring violence to someone in the movie based upon a set of criteria. Someone wants to kill someone else for some reason. That is not true of Hostel, and the reason it frightened me so much.<br/><br/>In the movie three friends travel to the Slovakian border and look for a good time filled with weed, women, and as much booze as they can drink. They find such a place in an upscale hostel, and enjoy themselves. This is the part many like to mention as the skin flick part, where are unsuspecting trio offers themselves to a gaggle of exciting new women who they enjoy very much. But all this dose is set up the remainder of the story. When we sat down in the theater when we put in our DVD, we all knew that each of the main characters or at least some were going to be tortured to death in some horrible and unimaginable way that would be shown to us in full color on our own t.v.'s or brought in front by the miracle of cellulose photography. It was intentional to set us up, to remind us that each of these young people was going to meet some horrible end, and to set us up for the remainder of the movie. It takes a long time to get to the torture and I felt almost expectant, every corner every turn having some unspeakable evil waiting around it, hiding in the shadows, waiting to strike. The atmosphere ready we are invited to take pleasure in their deaths by their captors or to sympathize with their plight. The thing I think that destroyed this movie for so many people was that there was no reason for killing them, just because some sick old men wanted to. People who kill others in the world don't necessarily do it with purpose in mind and the most brutal people on the planet are remembered as the ones who took the most pleasure out of others deaths simply because they were there. If people would own up to the idea that this is not so far fetched as Saw, or as real as Wolf Creek I think more people would enjoy this movie for its suspense its tension, and its horrific premise that there are those willing to do anything for a good time."
"glenn-320","9","1","1","11 May 2007"," Simply Great
","I watched Cabin Fever (Eli Roth's first directorial effort) and thought it was fantastic. When Hostel came out though, it was one of those movies that people talk about incessantly (among these are ""Saw"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs""). When I finally got around to seeing it only recently, I certainly was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Whilst I believe that Cabin Fever is slightly superior (though I thought the bowling alley massacre flashback was a bit unnecessary) Hostel shows that Eli has made improvements as both a writer and a director. He writes some great characters like the wannabe surgeon and the crazy American torturer (though none compare to the young police officer ""Winston"" in Cabin Fever), and the violence...well, that's where a lot of the genius comes.<br/><br/>Just like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" before it, people were saying that this is bloodiest, most violent thing they've ever seen, but in fact a lot of the violence takes place off screen. When you do see it though, it's never irrelevant and its always brief. A lot of it is really evoked through sound. As a result, people leave the cinema thinking that they have witnessed a person getting things done to them.<br/><br/>Eli also adds in a little political commentary for good measure. The fact that Americans are more expensive than other nationalities, presumably because everyone wants to get their revenge on them.<br/><br/>I also really liked how Jay's character manages to get his revenge on just about everyone at the end of the film, and how he decides to do it instead of getting into a situation where he has to do it. My favourite scene is of course the bathroom scene at the end.<br/><br/>People who don't like this film either just plain don't like it, or just don't look past the gore and violence to see all of these details. Overall, this is a very good film which could have been much worse had it not been Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino behind it. Can't wait for Hostel Part 2. However I'm a little less optimistic about Cabin Fever 2, but we'll just have to see."
"Monkeyman_Jon","8","1","1","27 March 2007"," Nothing new, but still fresh
","After have seen Eli Roth's impressing 'Cabin Fever', my expectations on 'Hostel' was some what through the roof, and yeah, luckily I can't say that I was disappointed once I saw it. I remember that, when I bought it on DVD, the girl at the register, looking at the cover, said something like ""Oooh, this looks disgusting"". And I said ""Yeah, that's kind of the point"".<br/><br/>But I must confess that the movie was not quite what I expected. In a good way! As a fact, I thought it was going to be much more stupid. That Roth would have let himself go after the success of 'Cabin Fever'. But despite its simplicity 'Hostel' is really a pretty complex story. Ofcaurse, the idea of teenagers getting sliced and diced is not new, it's what's happening between the torn off limbs and splattered guts that's interesting, fresh and disturbing.<br/><br/>The story, anyway, is about two Americans backpacking through Europe that wind up in a quiet Slovakian town, after hearing of all the ""easy"" girls residing at the local hostel. When their Icelandic friend then suddenly disappears, they start wondering what is really going on behind the polished facade. And after that, things get really ugly.<br/><br/>Now, what I thought was great about 'Hostel' was not only how raw and uncompromising it was (some scenes brought out thoughts like ""How can a studio release this?""). It is absolutely gut twisting in its presentations of all different ways of hurting, and killing people, but then again, not all are of a physical nature, and that is what I'm getting at. It is the very concept of the story that is more terrifying than the actual display of blood, gore and violence (hey, it's just a movie, after all). The idea of an enterprise making money on putting unaware tourists at the disposal of bored business-men, detached with their animal selves - that the movie's villains are not the usual psycho killers, but very ordinary people - is far more chilling than fake blood.<br/><br/>Yet 'Hostel' is not entirely a story of evil. To me it's more a portrait of the backside of modern society, where people are too busy making money, love, lies, work, plans and so on. As the movie's antagonist, the Dutch business-man, puts it while eating his lunch with his hands: ""I think that we have lost our relationship to food"". We are no longer in touch with the primal being living inside us, and that can sometimes be a stressing thing.<br/><br/>And I think that maybe, that is also part of the reason why we love horror movies."
"MaxBorg89","7","1","1","13 March 2007"," Hardly a horror classic, but recommended for its twisted concept
","This film's advertising insisted on the fact that it was ""the sickest, bloodiest movie you'll ever see"", as opposed to all the tame, PG-13-rated horror films (most of them being remakes of Japanese shockers) that were being released at the time. According to writer/director Eli Roth, it was time the horror genre got its guts back (both metaphorically and literally). As for that second statement, there's no reason to argue: Hostel is not a film teenagers or the weak of stomach should see. When it comes to the ""sickest, bloodiest"" part, however, it's a whole different story.<br/><br/>At first, casual viewers might think they're watching the wrong movie: the film opens with three backpackers coming to Amsterdam. Why they have chosen Amsterdam is quite obvious: what better place if you're looking for sex and drugs? As one of the three, the Icelandic, self-proclaimed ""King of the Swing"" Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), would say, ""It's f*cking awesome!"". Apparently, though, there's this village outside of Bratislava, in Slovakia, where the girls are even hotter, and particularly willing to sleep with Americans, something that makes Oli's mates, Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), very eager to try this new place. What seemed to be another version of Eurotrip, however, will soon become a nightmare, as our three unsuspecting protagonists run into something so terrifying few people would be able to imagine it. And this is where the massacre begins. Well, not quite actually.<br/><br/>In fact, despite what he promised, Roth doesn't exactly show us everything: we rarely see the acts themselves (which include severed limbs and eyeball torture), as the director thinks the effects of those acts will be scary enough. And as a matter of fact, they are, although it has got more to do with the context Roth has come up with for all that violence. On an entirely conceptual level, Hostel is absolutely brilliant, with a third-act twist so nasty it will make the audience re-evaluate the whole film (a small clue for genre fans: it kind of reminds of The Wicker Man, which is referenced in a sex scene). Shame the director doesn't develop this great idea in a particularly original way, using it merely as an excuse to show us flesh (first half of the movie) and blood (second half), and neither of them in the excessive amount the trailers and posters seemed to promise. Roth certainly knows where to place the camera when filming the most gruesome sequences, but he lacks the genius of filmmakers like Tarantino (who is one of Hostel's executive producers) or Takashi Miike (who appears briefly).<br/><br/>Ultimately, Hostel deserves to be seen because of its original concept, although the rest is fairly conventional, and not as extreme and disgusting as they want to make you think."

Terentino is a great director and his ideas are more like fascinations but they do glue you to your seat until the end. the movie is not for weak-hearted as it contains lots of blood and violent+gruesome scenes. it reminded me of Texas chain-saw massacre, wrong-turn and many other movies based on the same theme.

I think the movie is a nice piece of craftsmanship and the actors are doing a good job, but there's something missing. if you've seen movies containing torture-scenes like in ""ichi- the killer"", ""old boy"" or ""saw"" for example, I tell you this movie is not close. but if you're out for an entertaining and different horror-movie, this is still way way better then all the collage-horror-films and other standard horror-films. so, as conclusion, I would say that you definitely should see this movie, but keep your high expectations at bay..peace"

","First of all I have to say that I come from Slovakia. So lets deal with the movie first. Its really hard for me write something original now, because I read a few reports above, and while at the beginning everyone was caring about the main characters and everything, I have to say I was laughing my ass off on the first half of the movie. Lets ask some important questions first. Why do they talk Czech on the train station when our heroes come to Slovakia? Why do they talk Czech in the TV at the Hostel? Why are every signs on the walls in the streets in Czech? I mean come on, there ain't an actual word spoken in Slovak in the whole movie. Well maybe in the disco the music is Slovak, but thats already 20 years or more old songs. My parents used to listen to that music. At the beginning the Dutch guy tells them that this place is near Bratislava and it is true that Slovakia is on the border with the Czech republic, but shouldn't they have explained in the movie,like: ""look there's a hostel near Bratislava the capital of Slovakia, but the hostel is in the Czech republic?"" Another thing, obviously the movie was shot in the Czech republic, believe me I know my country and that just wasn't Slovakia at all. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to dis anybody and I am not saving my countries reputation, its just good to have some things made clear.

The first 45 minutes of the movie is boobs, swearing, drugs and sex which is poorly done. The second half is blood and body parts galore which is very well done. The only problem there is, there is barely any of it and if there is any, it's mainly offscreen. So for you gorehounds out there, this isn't gonna please.<br/><br/>The special effects were really well done and the dull, dirty look of the underground torture place is really creepy.

Along with lots of T/A, this film is a horror fan's treat. Taking place in exotic Amsterdam, the film takes time to get going (about 30 minutes to get to the gore), but once there, it's one helluva ride! Though the dialogue doesn't really hold merit and the script is also somewhat predictable, Jay Hernandez (of ""World Trade Center"" fame) does a great job in the lead role as Paxton (one of two friends from America in Amsterdam on vacation).

","After seeing Cabin Fever and falling into a healing coma after-wards, I was quite skeptical of this much hyped Eli Roth movie. Hostel, while not perfect, is still better than Cabin Fever.<br/><br/>Two American 20-something males are on a backpacking tour of Europe. On the way, they pick up an Icelandic male. These are not sympathetic characters. You could be quite happy ""taking care"" of them yourself (think of the typical AMS Heineken tour group). The triumvirate is fully stocked with clichéd characters : the crazy and wild foreigner; the uptight guy (a.k.a - Mike); the R-rated guy you're not so sure about (Trent). The movie starts out with all three of them arriving in Amsterdam with their quest being the search for weed/drugs and sex. After doing the standard Amsterdam thing (smoke lots of weed, go to clubs, smoke more weed, go to red light district, smoke more weed), they resolve to get to the final quest. On the same night they are kicked out of a club, they are locked out of their hostel. It is there that they are introduced to another traveler, a young Russian. He shows and tells about a hostel outside of Bratislava, Slovakia that boasts the hottest women willing to do anything, especially foreigners. This hostel ,mind you, is not located on any map and can be found only with a broken compass. I'm sorry, wrong movie.<br/><br/>They predictably detour their next destination from Barcelona to Bratislava. On the train they meet a creepy Edward Salad-Hands. Arriving at the hostel, they discover truth in advertising. The next morning, the Icelander disappears. While out and about, creepy salad hands shows up again. This is when things take a turn (I would time this about 40 minutes into the movie). <br/><br/>The remainder of the movie is a veritable butcher's shop filled with graphic mutilations, but little reason to the carnage. Eli uses a few techniques to keep us off balanced and uncomfortable. Initially he distracts us by showing us lots of breasts and skin, and a general light fare. He then turns to techniques such as : creepy whistling (think Daryll Hannah from Kill Bill), the first person eye-hole view, scenes of utter darkness, the foreigners with their respective languages (non-subtitles), yellow puss, and lots and lots of blood. He seems to be feeding off our fears. The fear of not being on your home turf, of not knowing the language and customs of foreigners, and the fear of being hunted. Some of the scenes are reminiscent of Pet Cemetery (a.k.a - the death of Herman Munster), the end of Wonderland, House of 1000 Corpses, the Hills Have Eyes (2006) and Ichi the Killer. For a little genre flavor Takashi Miike makes a cameo appearance and even has a few words to say.<br/><br/>Ultimately, once the plot is revealed, I felt somewhat disappointed. It wasn't enough to ruin the movie, but I couldn't get the image of Rutger Hauer hunting Ice-T out of my head. I think I was enjoying the devastation of really annoying and obnoxious characters (i.e. - like seeing a politician being tortured). The plot seems to be a modern, gruesome adaptation of the Most Dangerous Game, minus any ""noble reasoning"". I would definitely recommend this movie for fans of the horror genre. Please skip Cabin Fever. Hopefully part two explains a bit more of the background, without delving into the realm of Saw 2 or reverting to Cabin Fever quality (btw, I am not holding out hope. It will probably suck). It really is too bad that the Slovakian tourism had to take a hit for this movie to be made, but I guess it's worth it."

Basically Rick Hoffman was the only decent actor in the entire movie, but he only appeared for two minutes.<br/><br/>About the plot? ..... plot?<br/><br/>What luck that the two girls who had screwed Paxton just happen to pop up in front of the car so he could run over them. Not to mention the German speaking Dutch Businessman who just happen to be on the same train as Paxton.<br/><br/>There were no plot twists to speak of. I rate this a 3/10."

","Hostel, 2006 5/10, 4th best of 2006 (out of 4 total movies) 241st of 2000's, 708th all time I'm gonna be honest with you, I really don't know why so many people say this movie is so great. Granted, the movie is based on an interesting concept. Some Americans in Europe end up at a place where people pay others to torture and murder people. Fairly clever right? But the movie just isn't that interesting to watch. While I love horror movies, the reason I love watching them is that I can choose witch characters I'm rooting for. Deciding who I would want to live or die. While watching this movie I really never for a moment cared which characters (good and bad) lived or died. The movie did nothing to draw me in. I never felt like I was watching real people, just a very violent occasionally silly movie. Granted if I was 12 or 13 years old I might have enjoyed the movie simply for the fact that their were boobs in it, but by now those days are behind me. It's not that this movie is bad, its just that I can't see a single thing that makes it stand out from other horror movies. I guess I just don't get what all the fuss was about."

Some emotions was missed. Script was good to this movie. After watched it, you will think about it all week. I wanted to go to this movie premiere with my aunt, but we change mind and we were right, because my aunt will be pass.

"FatboyJohnnyD","Null","1","1","7 June 2006"," Why expect so much?
","I love horror movies and in the time I have been alive have seen hundreds if not thousands of them. My question is, why do people always expect them to have Oscar winning acting, and writing? It's horror just enjoy it for what it is and stop complaining about what it is not. Horror is mostly made up of movies that are dumb but fun, the point is to get scared or grossed out. Doesn't this movie accomplish that? Some of the scene's even freaked me out, and I am not one to bite my knuckle, or cringe in horror. Honestly this movie is disturbing, but in a funny very ridiculous way. It wasn't the best movie ever, but if that is what you are looking for then horror isn't for you."
"badseed7","4","1","1","5 June 2006"," A bit overrated
","Let me say that when I heard about this film I thought it would be pretty good, but unfortunately for me it was just too tame. The main problem here is that it claims to be so gory you will be hiding under your chair or covering your eyes with fear, but the fact is it just does not deliver, just when it gets to the crucial point the camera pans away and you wonder what is the point. The story is not that great or believable either even though it is based on true events .I think maybe this one needed more time and money spent or maybe just better editing. If you are a true horror lover it will not cut it for you and you are better off watching House of 1000 Corpses or pulling out a Dario Argento classic. Sorry Guys."
"StuntsForFilm","5","1","1","29 May 2006"," Gore but no scare
","Gore but no scare.<br/><br/>The movie started off as nothing more than Animal House in Europe bordering on soft porn at timesnot saying that's a bad thing but I was waiting for the horror part of this horror film to start. It is predictable most of the time and the plot was weak. If you want a gory movie with tons of blood and parts being cut off people, this is the movie for you. I love slasher films so I was entertained but to call this movie a 'horror' film is false advertising. It doesn't really keep you on the edge of you seat but the SFX work is pretty good. Overall I would give it a 5 on a 1-10 scale."
"stahlman","4","1","1","21 May 2006"," Is this entertainment?
","This is disturbing. I did not feel entertained afterward, just sick and melancholy.<br/><br/>*Spoilers below*<br/><br/>The build up is fun and somewhat realistic for those having traveled on trains in Europe. but then torture, gore, death and murder in a WAREHOUSE seems like NOTHING NEW for this genre except for the level of violence.<br/><br/>Then, around the time when we could enjoy someone escaping the madness, we get a girl committing suicide due to her shame of disfigurement -- and sadder still, it was predictable.<br/><br/>Then the guy escapes but not before the revenge murders in the same torturous fashion. You expect him to kill the guy, knowing this will possibly end the torture club etc. But by showing the violence, you feel he is just like the sick killers. Maybe that's this movie's depressing purpose, to show our « eye for an eye » sense of justice.<br/><br/>I don't want moralizing and certainly don't expect a Disney ending, but this movie focuses on the worst of human nature and I don't recommend it."
"hpnut4ever","3","1","1","20 May 2006"," A complete waste of my time
","My sister and I rented this movie hoping to see a film scarier and more gory than Saw and Saw II. Sorely disappointed. I was expecting myself to get scared and queasy while watching it, but instead I laughed during most of the torture scenes and rolled my eyes at the majority of the cliché scenarios, like the dance club.<br/><br/>Luckily for me, I didn't have to sit through the beginning of the movie. My sister had watched it before I had and told me that at least twenty minutes of the start of the film was, basically, porn and drug use. I didn't get the movie to watch that kind of stuff, and the fact that I had to fast-forward through it just annoyed me.<br/><br/>One of the girls I go to school with is an exchange student from Slovakia. We started talking about Hostel during one of our classes and it was easy to see that the movie offended her. She said she'd talked to some of her friends back home and that they weren't pleased with it either. And who can blame them? I know I've never really wanted to go Slovakia, and Hostel didn't exactly help.<br/><br/>This was a basic waste of a movie. To me, the best part was watching Josh try to run out of his torture chamber with a severed Achilles tendon or whatever it's called. Not worth the time."

The film, however, did display how Europe appears. For example, the Dutch are allowed to smoke, and in Slovakia, there are some real dangerous street kids. It was what anyone person would discover traveling with a few random people.<br/><br/>And after that, this was what truly scared me ever! It is a known fact that you could get attacked or you could be secretly being monitored / watched by someone. And before you know it, you are his / her victim. Ooh! Very disturbing!An uneasy feeling echoed through my body as I watched every death scene that I didn't want to do an all-over Overseas trip!I feared that and I still do today!<br/><br/>Over all, this film was a good warning as it warns you not to go blundering about. Take the advice which displays in this film when watching it. Watch out!"

","I never had such a problem to decide if I rather recommend a movie or not... never before there has been a main-stream-movie which went this far, depicting this kind of gore. never before I've seen a gore-movie that was this little fun and entertaining. It's true that this movie really made me feel terrible and sick. Not in a way like Peter Jackson's Braindead did to me when I entered a whole new level of horror-movies watching it long time ago. Rather in a way documentaries can make you feel. I couldn't say this is a bad movie or that it's not made pretty well... still I wouldn't recommend it. I'd even recommend avoiding those who simply can enjoy a movie like this. For me there needs to be a a clear line between fiction and reality. Hostel doesn't have this gap so I couldn't enjoy the gore. I still give a 7 because I believe that it's a milestone for the genre... I just cannot tell if it's a good or a bad step ..."

","I expected a non-stop gore-fest, but (thankfully) the gore was reasonably limited and confined to a small portion of the movie.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Roth seems to have given in to his producers...or paid too much attention to the results of the advance screenings, it's hard to tell which. The film is much too tidy and works too hard to dull the effects of the gore by tempering it with a sense of poetic justice.<br/><br/>The skanky addicts who lure the victims towards their horrible and lingering deaths? Don't worry...we'll run them (all three) over on the way home through town.<br/><br/>The sadistic Dutch businessman? No problem...we'll have a chance to slit his throat during a chance encounter in a public restroom.<br/><br/>Offended and sickened by the twisted American businessman?

","Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its potential. Unsatisfactory, predictable. I'm not a major fan of gore, although I need not have worried about there being too much gore in this film: it's mostly implied. There are buckets of stage blood, but not necessarily more than was used in ""Seed Of Chucky"". I saw where someone suggested that ""Hostel"" might be better classified as an action-thriller, and I would say that's probably true. It just doesn't measure up as a ""horror"" flick. Not that the potential wasn't there... Still though, it's better than Plan 9, or Manos. I guess I'd have to say it's worth watching if the only other options are ""Degrassi"" on Nick, or ""Oprah After The Show"". Yawn."

They are looking to have sex with European girls and some guy recommends a Hostel just outside Bratislava. The whole twist of the movie was that all these people they meet in their trip were part of an association that sells the opportunity to torture people for a high quantity of money, twist that I had figured out in the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>Then the obvious happens: people start disappearing, one is luckily safe, he is led to the torture place, he's able to flee.<br/><br/>This is what I didn't like about the movie: So much stuff about the torture, when in truth is the smallest part of the movie. His actions and reactions are nothing like what I think a person would do in that situation. He gets so quickly out of that place that we have 20 minutes top of the movie there. His escape with the Chinese girl is the stupidest think I've seen in a movie for a long time. Not even commenting on the last scene...<br/><br/>Congratz for turning what could be a good movie in a complete waste of time!

"heyjude68","2","1","1","28 April 2006"," Were the critics on crack?
","I was disappointed by Hostel. The commercials made it seem like it really was the scariest movie of all time, stating that paramedics had to be called on scene to take the movie's screeners to the hospital. It really didn't scare me at all like House of 1000 Corpses did. It was very cheesy and the element of imagination in horror movies didn't really exist because I didn't care about the characters. They were college kids who wanted to get laid and instead got mutilated. That's not too original. I'm not saying House of 1000 Corpses is original, I'm just saying that it scared me more, especially because of Dr. Satan and its spiritual aspects. I couldn't wait for the blood and guts in Hostel, but then when it happened all I could do was laugh my ass off at how fake it looked. When the girl's eye popped out I was laughing SO HARD. If you must see this horrible film, rent it... do not buy it. The ending was especially craptacular."

However, without giving you vast detail why this film sucks let me just say the main character changes in the middle of the movie after they kill the main character off (from Josh, the writer to Paxton, the character people know little about)and that should never happen, if you disagree you are wrong.<br/><br/>And supposedly I need 10 lines of text, for this comment to be valid and posted up which is god d a m n f u c k i n' b u l l s h i t!!!<br/><br/>I hate everything and I hate you too."
"atlanticcanuck","8","1","1","27 April 2006"," Great Thriller
","Yes! I said Thriller.<br/><br/>The word of mouth about this flick from the man who made our stomachs turn in Cabin Fever, was that it was all about the gore.<br/><br/>Sure this movie has its gory moments, but really, this movie is a classic thriller. Starting off as your typical buddy buddy road movie, the film takes a horrific turn when members of the group start disappearing. The audience knows what is happening to them of-course as that part has been well advertised. The interesting twist is when Paxton escapes and makes his way out of the torture fun park. This is where the movie takes off and keeps running. The uncomfortableness of the previous torture scenes make the getting away sequences all the more never racking and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Who is not on their seat screaming at Paxton to just get the heck out of there? When he goes back in to save Kana, you can hardly watch.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me in many ways of Mute Witness. Also shot in a bleak Eastern Europe, it starts off as a horror slasher film and before you know it, gets you caught up in a suspense filled thriller.<br/><br/>I have never been a big fan of the just straight out gore movies. Carpenter did not need excessive blood to make Halloween frightening; Craven did not turn the screen red to create masterpieces such as the Hills Have Eyes or Nightmare on Elm Street. Still, somewhere along the way, directors made the equation that blood and gore equaled suspense. Unfortunately, it seldom does.<br/><br/>Hostel is a great movie because it scares the crap out of you and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Eli successfully uses the gore to make you feel uncomfortable; once off balance, he takes you on a roller coaster ride."
"aaron-jannetta","1","1","1","22 April 2006"," Worst Movie Ever
","I give this movie a one out ten only because i am not able to choose a zero. There was no character progression, i felt no connection to the main characters, in fact i was hoping that they all could have died much much sooner so the movie would just end. The only thing that sticks out in my mind is when the main characters got kicked out of a night club and one yelled back at the bouncer who threw them out ""I am an American, I have rights."" That is all well and good, but they were in Amsterdam, and do you think anyone cares? Possibly the worst line and delivery in any movie ever. The idea was half decent but executed very, very poorly. Bad script, bad characters, bad acting. The special effects were also pretty lame, and though it was a gory movie, i did not find it that disturbing, mostly just boring. Don't waste your time."
"tenacious_dude","9","1","1","22 April 2006"," Absolutely amazing. Best horror film for ages
","I just finished watching it a few minutes ago and I am feeling something that I have not felt from a movie in a long time. I am very uneasy and nervous(Texas Chainsaw' nervous). This film makes you want to hold your love ones close and never let them go. Because, trust me, some of the images that this film plants in your brain, are going to stay there forever.<br/><br/>My advice for all that love this genre is to watch this movie alone, in the dark in your bed (because what happens in this film will make you very grateful that you are where you are, and not where they are. Seriously, I am never leaving the country again.<br/><br/>The film gets off to a bit of a slow but necessary start (annoying and teeny  too many 'F' words, and I can't believe I'm saying this, too many boobs (seriously, I love boobs but there's only only so many you can take). But that creates more of a shock when the real premise of the film begins. It was excellently directed, shot, written and surprisingly, acted. Those guys were awesome The one thing that I love the most about this, is just as the 'Saw' series, this stuff could happen, and probably does somewhere in the world. And the director depicts this by making your imagination run as wild as the special effects team. It is more psychological than you would expect. It's great.<br/><br/>It's hard to talk about it without mentioning any spoilers, so I will stop talking now. Just trust me, and watch this film. In my opinion, it is one of the best horror/gore/suspense/teen/thriller movies for decades. Enjoy!<br/><br/>My dreams are going to be nasty tonight. Hold me!"
"tshake54","9","1","1","22 April 2006"," Roth And Tarantino Deliver with this excellent horror movie
","Hostel is one of those movies that will stay with you for a long time, but in a good way. The torture in the movie is really disturbing, with much gore and dismemberment. The violence is really kicked up a notch in this movie, too, unlike other popular horror movies, this movie pulls no punches. If you are under 18, I strongly recommend you not see this movie, due to the violence and disturbing brutal behavior. If you overlook some minor flaws with the film, such as limited plot development and very few characters that enrich the plot, you will find a very good horror movie with something original to offer the viewer. Just be prepared to be shocked and maybe disturbed after the movie. I give it a 9/10"
"Dringostarr","8","1","1","22 April 2006"," For the sadist in you...
","If you are after a nerve jangling horror movie laced with suspense and well placed jumps, then this isn't the movie for you. Eli Roth does not make that kind of horror film. Think of softcore pornography and Saw, and you'll get the idea. His films are for the sadist, expect intense gore, horrific deaths and sex lots of sex.<br/><br/>That is not necessarily a bad thing. Because if you like that kinda thing, and I know many do, then you can't go far wrong than Hostel. A film about two Americans (Paxton and Josh) who go on a European Sex Holiday with their Icelandic friend, Oli, and are led to Slovakia, where the ""real women are found"". The Hostel that awaits them is fantastic and it gets even better when they discover they are sharing their room with three gorgeous women. Yet these femme fatales have more than sex in store for them, seducing them before delivering them to the surgeons, vicious tortuous killers, who earn money depending on the nationality of their victim.<br/><br/>Roth knows how to cut the right limbs. The small, dirty eastern European town (used to great success in the latest Resident Evil video game) is a perfect location for the twisted world our protagonists find themselves in. With the police beating the residents, the children ruling the streets and drugs freely passed amongst the characters, we are presented with a suitably anarchic feel for such a lawless movie.<br/><br/>There are flaws of course. The sex obsessed opening lasts way too long, it takes nearly 45 minutes before the shagging stops and the brutal torture scenes kick in. You won't feel overly sympathetic for any of the stars either, a few times you'll even be begging for their gory end. And the vengeful coincidences that occur for Paxton at the end are nearly laughable.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, you may not feel sorry for our stars but you'll still cringe at every knife slice, drill hole, and toe removal. And you'll still lust for some brutal vengeance against the many that have led them to their fate. And the revenge does come and you'll cheer, regardless of how ridiculously ""convenient"" it all is.<br/><br/>Jay Hernandez (Paxton), Derek Richardson (Josh) and, Eythor Gudjonsson (Oli), put in solid performances. Their lad behaviour is easy to scorn but even easier to laugh at and they play their roles to throat slitting perfection. And that's not to mention the beautiful seductive performances of Jana Kaderabkova and Vanessa Jungova.<br/><br/>Eli Roth has come a long way since Cabin Fever. You won't find any true scares here; this is a true vomit inducing shock movie. Quentin Tarantino recommends and so do I."

They failed but, still you don't normally see this good of an attempt in mainstream horror. The locations/sets helped tremendously as this film is actually pretty submersing (which isn't always a good thing for the weak-hearted).<br/><br/>And yes you heard right: nudity nudity, and even more nudity - tacky but I was *ahem!* able to handle it.<br/><br/>I picked up this and, ""Wolf Creek"".

","I went into Hostel expecting a realistic, graphic, gore-fest. I didn't quite get what I was looking for.<br/><br/>The first 2/3 of the film can be written off as ""softcore porn"". Plenty of nudity in the film, if that is what you want in your horror by all means see this movie.<br/><br/>The big draw of the film was the supposed horrifying, graphic, and realistic sequences of torture. This the film does not deliver. All in all you get maybe 3 whole scenes of torture. None of them are done realistically(not noticeable unless you know a thing or two about this sorta thing) or in a very gory fashion. You got a guy get ""drilled"" and his Achilles tendon cut, a guy get mentally tortured(who then kills his torturer), and you have a girl get her face burned. That is about it for the torture scenes.<br/><br/>The story for Hostel is pretty meh, supposedly it is based on true events, but I doubt it.<br/><br/>All in all it is a decent way to kill time.

"lathesius","6","1","1","17 April 2006"," good idea, shame about the movie
","I had high expectations for this movie. The idea sounded good: three backpackers get kidnapped and are tortured and killed for the pleasure of bored rich people. That alone, is scary to me.<br/><br/>But instead, the film is a let down. Yes, it is gory, very gory in places, but by no means as horrible as the hype led me to believe. Eli Roth makes one terrible, crucial mistake - he doesn't develop his characters. We spend the first half of the film following these three guys as they take drugs, have sex with whores, and just generally behave bad. By the time the torture came about, i couldn't have cared less if they lived or died. If Roth had spent that time building the characters up and making us care, then this would have been a far superior film.<br/><br/>The torture scenes are a disappointment too. This sounds perverse, but we spend half the film getting to this point, and the torture is very limited. Yes, bad things happen to them, but I was expecting far more graphic scenes of violence. I would have liked this film to really explore the dark side of humanity. I mean, what does drive someone to torture someone for fun? Unfortunately this is denied us.<br/><br/>Plus, it is totally unrealistic. In particular, one of the characters gets part of his hand chopped off by a chainsaw. This guy should have bled to death within minutes, but he doesn't. I can suspend my disbelief in films, but this was too silly even for me.<br/><br/>In short, Hostel fails to be the nerve racking horror film we were led to expect. Yes, there are some disturbing scenes (the eyeball scene, for example) and if you're a fan of gore, yes it doesn't totally disappoint. But i feel this had so much potential and it was wasted. It could have ranked up there with Silence Of The Lambs, or even Seven, but instead it went to a writer/director who has no idea of how to create characters. This film deserved to be good, it deserved to go to a better person.<br/><br/>Watchable, but no where near as good as it should have been."

","Cabin Fever was OK - good fun in places but no more. Now we have Hostel, handily championed by Tarantino (smart use of your new friend there!), is nothing special either. I've nothing whatsoever against Eli Roth (except jealousy maybe coz he seems to be getting away it), but is it me or is his output a bit average and uninspiring? All the magazines I see are proclaiming Roth as the new chosen one when it comes to horror but I see nothing special here. There's stereotypes a-plenty and I found myself wondering if this was all tongue-in-cheek, but if it is the humour doesn't come through and it just feels like cliché-city. Roth has an undoubted talent for making your toes curl and that's great, but it cant sustain a full film especially when the gore is limited to 10 minutes or so. The gore itself is good, but nothing amazing or revolutionary (bringing up comparisons with Pet Sematary of all films). If someone can tell me what all the fuss is about I would be very grateful!!"
"newfiesailor","7","1","1","17 April 2006"," Not bad!
","The thing about Hostel that separates it from movies such as Saw and other gross out films is it is built on a premise that could be very real, knowing the fall of the USSR. It is an original idea. I recently saw a Law and Order episode where whole blocks of a city in Russia catered to child prostitution so this is not much of a stretch. The gloomy look of the worn out city captures much of the fallen society it is portraying and it's medieval atmosphere. Those two aspects work great.<br/><br/>However what it does wrong is it doesn't take time to make us like the characters headed into the lion's den. I didn't feel anything for any of the suffering characters except for likable Oli, but we don't really experience his pain. Pot smoking, partying teenagers is too much of a cliché and we kind of know where they are headed from square one. Because of that, it loses much of it's impact. The ending escape scene just seemed rushed, contrived and resorts to gross out tactics. This is where Wolf Creek becomes a better film. Wolf Creek went for an unprotected jugular and never let go. Although it resorted to unabashed torture and cringing acts of dominance, torture is never something that should ever be portrayed lightly. This is where Hostel should have went with it's real and horrible subject matter to make it a real classic shocker.<br/><br/>Still I recommend this to anyone except those with no aptitude for watching graphic violence depicted on the screen. It's premise could very well be real and the look of the old city of Bratislava is the stuff horror movies are made of."

","This is the new breed of horror film, which has become increasingly popular in the past few years. Following in the popularity of ""Saw"", ""Hostel"" is another chapter in the psychological chop-'em-up. Pretty simple story, about 3 young tourists who are lured to a youth hostel in an obscure eastern Europe town. Typical teen dangers arise ( sex, drugs, and strangers) that always result in trouble.<br/><br/>The movie does have moments of inspired tension, with it's ghostly town residents,a concrete killing field,and it's redemptive finale. It even tried to make the characters 3 dimensional ( could the virginal friend be gay? What fuels our hero? and we have a promiscuous...father? ), but it seemed there wasn't enough time to care about those shadings, and instead of a paint brush.. here comes the axe... or chainsaw, or blow torch, or machete, or hammer.. at one point it's like shopping in aisle 5 at your local home depot.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are disgusting, but i've seen more inspired horror scenes. I think some of the most horrific things that happen in the film, actually don't involve the aforementioned utensils, but how people care so little about a fellow human being. Is it groundbreaking... no, but is it entertaining ... yeah. It's a horror film that serves it's purpose. It didn't make me scream...but it made a good attempt."

I felt that they could have made more of the torture scenes and fully flaunt it to a higher level if they were going to go all out. I have to admit, I did like the tension it builds up in certain scenes and even though it may not be as gory as I hyped myself up for, it has a fair amount of blood to justify its genre as a horror.

","This is a really entertaining horror movie. Specially for nowadays horror films. It uses the same repetitive elements of most horror movies (teens doing teenage stuff, sex, gore,,car chases, etc.) but it uses in the right way. For example all gore and torture are there because they have to be, the script needs them, they are not for just make an impression to spectators.<br/><br/>It has no comparison to other horror movies u may be thinking like Scream, I know what u did.., The ring, and so on. This movie is original despite using a known formula. Visually its excellent, the actors perform fine,and the chicks are really beautiful (not the constant playboy alike blonde cheerleaders from typical horror movies)<br/><br/>So i honestly recommend this movie and i think it'll be consider another classical horror film."
"stunospam-ta","7","1","1","28 March 2006"," A violent attack on the senses
","Having been pleasantly surprised by Eli Roth's Cabin Fever, and falling for the sucker puncher that was Tarantino's involvement, albeit minimal, I eagerly awaited this film.<br/><br/>The film borrows ideas from across the board but is certainly original in it's shock value! Whilst I have seen many, many horror films from the comparatively tame but classic Hammer films to the more extreme films like Takashi Miike's Audition (Miike actually has a brief cameo in Hostel) and the total gross-out films such as Cannibal Holocaust and Zombie Flesh Eaters; Hostel left me feeling extremely uneasy unlike a lot of it's predecessors.<br/><br/>It would be hard not to be lured into the jaws of doom by the absolutely beautiful Natalya & Svetlana, and indeed that's when things begin to go horribly wrong for our 3 young hedonistic travellers.<br/><br/>Jan Vlasak should be applauded for his portrayal of the particularly unnerving, failed surgeon. The reason he didn't make the grade as a surgeon is revealed, much to the terror of young Josh.<br/><br/>The group of infant thieves is a nice touch and added a somewhat morbid comedy factor to Hostel, but not as to the detriment of the overall theme.<br/><br/>Extreme, brutal, stylish and aesthetically grand (well, not for poor Yuki!) but I still can't decide whether I really liked it or I was repulsed by it. Perhaps it was both. Some censorship is avoided I presume, by not mixing the sex with the violence or vice versa. I think that means mission accomplished by Eli Roth & his mate Quentin.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see whether Hostel 2 can maintain the tension and evolve at all or just sink into awful sequel oblivion."

","There is only one type of person that could possibly love this film and that is the typical male. Myself... if you must know, yes, i am that typical male. This film has just about everything that a man could want, even if they are not that keen on what this film has to offer. It has foul language, naked women (and there are a lot), sex, foreign girls, drugs, clubs, drunk people, and of course, the mass amount of pure gore! The gory scenes are extremely graphic and if you have yet to see this film then i must warn you now, this film is not for the faint hearted. Quintin Tarentino has definitely captured the moment and has pointed out exactly what to do and what not to do if you decide to invade Europe. Fantastic!"
"Souless27","7","1","1","28 March 2006"," Extremely disturbing film with a brilliant plot!
","Okay, yes it does have some sexual content & nudity but what horror film these days doesn't include something of that nature just to gain entertainment value points? I mean, look at your target audience (teens and young adults) and tell me you don't need those scenes to get people in the cinema seats especially when you have no A list (and really not even any B list actors). Also, if you pay attention to who wrote & directed the film you'd notice it's the same guy as 'Cabin Fever' (this film far surpasses it's predecessor) which has the same sort of 'American Pie' meets 'Saw' type feel to it so some sex is necessary for the story line.<br/><br/>The plot is just brilliant. It's terrifying because it's very realistic. I'm not sure if any of you have ever visited any of these Eastern European countries but something of this nature could actually happen and no one would be the wiser to it. I don't want to give away too much but suffice to say that the plot definitely thickens and runs deeper than you expect.<br/><br/>The gore factor is absolutely full blown. I have seen Saw and Saw II and I would say that along the visual basis they are equal but the key difference is that you really feel the torment and pain the characters are experiencing, it's not just some colored corn syrup and latex intestines...it's horrific screaming and desperate pleas that you really believe. The acting I have to say was superb by these new comers.<br/><br/>All in all, a great horror flick. It's original, well filmed and acted very realistically but I do warn you that some of the gruesome scenes from this film will stay with you for a few days. Watch at your own risk."
"David_Frames","5","1","1","27 March 2006"," Feel my Roth
","There's a sickness pervading Roth's promo for the Youth Hosteling Association. Having said that it's hard to dislike a movie which features attractive Eastern European women in permissive sexual mode - prone to large bouts of unnecessary but welcomed nudity and not too concerned about changing in view of male roommates. Such cynical devices are employed to get round the critical sensibilities of horror hating people like me who think this stuff is terminally devoid of merit, invention or wit and Roths pulled a blinder. For 45 minutes I was putty in his sick, gelatin covered hands and then, having got to the crux of it with those ignorant, hormonally retarded backpackers getting horrifically tortured for the pleasure of maladjusted 13 year olds and man-child fan-boy mastabators throughout the world, I strangely found myself drawn into Roths dirty little web - the Vincent Price like fly to his predatory house spider. Not in any way what you should be doing with your free time but nevertheless far better than you might dare to hope - Hostel may be a good advert for hotels as well as 90 minutes of well tooled disturbance. Hard to hate - especially when watched backwards."
"garywoodburn","5","1","1","27 March 2006"," bloody hell
","Anyone who goes to see Hostel without first reading a review or at least knowing the content is in for a bloody ride. I am still ambivalent as to it's worth. As a bloodfest video nasty it works - as an metaphor for the torture and cruelty that goes on in the world it falls well short of the mark.<br/><br/>the film builds no sense of suspense -it is just relentless. It is slow paced and choppy. It has no sense of structure beyond the set up and closure. We feel little for the characters beyond a mild sense of empathy and a desire not to be them. The only twist it has is a happy ending - something i was hoping for but not really expecting. The last man standing does indeed stand - and no bogeyman comes out of the wood work to foul up our sense of closure.<br/><br/>What works? Well its a horror film - but unlike say the Evil Dead that was bloody gruesome and nasty when first viewed this is just laughably horrible- but it does draw you in and make you crave revenge almost palpably for the victims even though we neither know for or really care for them. So for all its faults i liked it - I'm a sucker for horror - but why Tarantino put his name to it i don't know. There are a few homages to him peppered throughout - like the ear cutting scene in Reservoir Dogs but it does nothing to enhance his reputation."
"jamesb99_1999","9","1","1","27 March 2006"," A fantastic film that surprised me
","Let me start by saying that I thought Eli Roth's last major effort (Cabin Fever) was badly scripted and directed (although it had some merit on some levels). This film therefore managed to surprise me as it's very well done, the Finish character was a non-starter though which could have been done to make you glad when he was the first to die. The ending doesn't really work either, although it's the alternate ending really as the original ending has Jay Fernandez's character kidnapping the Edward Salad Hands characters daughter and ending with the ambiguous does he save her or kill her ending.<br/><br/>Realistically at the end, there is no way he would have gone back for the Chinese girl, he would have got out to report it and try to stop it happening to thousands of others rather than a very unlikely go back for one person who is probably already dead (I know the story about the kid in the lake is meant to explain this but it doesn't wash with me). Then the bit where the Chinese woman jumps in front of the train (because of the way she looks, and possibly to distract the men), I am sorry but it was all so obviously for shock effect.<br/><br/>I would have much preferred some closure on the hostel for this, it is obvious that the character would have gone to the authorities, I would have liked to have seen this.<br/><br/>Apart from those minor points it is very realistically/ claustrophobically done and they successfully make you believe the dorky guy from dumb and dumberer is going to be the hero who survives it's quite a surprise when they kill him."
"Zombified_660","9","1","1","26 March 2006"," Dark genius that's unfortunately destined to be ruined by idiots.
","I can't help feeling that Hostel is going to become the Clockwork Orange of my generation. What I mean by that is a movie that provides a genuinely original narrative told in a daring fashion that's seen as a cheap 'sex and violence' flick by everyone who either didn't have the balls to see it or had the balls to get in the cinema but didn't have the stomach for it once they were in.<br/><br/>Firstly some cold hard facts: There is less nudity in Hostel than there is in Shredder, Detour or Bloody Murder, or any 80s or 70s horror you care to mention. There is also far less violence than there is in High Tension, Creep or Dog Soldiers. Also, the nudity and the violence are part and parcel of the continuation of the plot line, not gratuitous and pointless as some have continuously harped on about. The nudity in the first half-hour is A: Used as a device to display the differences between the three main characters, and to set up Paxon as a character who steadily becomes more aware of where his bachelor habits have got him, B: Initiated by unscrupulous characters in order to manipulate the three weak-willed males into a false sense of security.<br/><br/>In a similar fashion the violence (of which there is at a stretch about five minutes of on-screen, not exactly a lot when you consider that Friday the 13th Part 6 has a total of 21 on screen deaths in it's 80 or so minutes) is used sparingly to flesh out the initially unseen horror you can feel creeping up on the cast, and to provide those all-important scares that a horror requires. To be honest, the most frightening thing is that Eli Roth manages to make the killers both worryingly real and believable as people. These are not knife-wielding zombies with vendettas, they're accountants, doctors...lawyers lol. Scary stuff.<br/><br/>That said, Hostel is intense, uncomfortable viewing. I would never make the ridiculous claim that this is an easy film to watch. Hostel generates an atmosphere of dread and tension that you could cut with a knife, taking the morbid and inescapable feel of Roth's earlier Cabin Fever all the way up to 11. It's a hard, tough watch that'll leave you gasping for air afterwards, and I have to honestly say I've never been this on edge during a movie since Seven.<br/><br/>Really, this is a movie that needs to be watched with an open mind and preferably an understanding of the horror genre. It's a morbid, downbeat and disturbing terror-ride, and it won't be for everyone, but I implore people not to make their mind up before you see it. It IS shocking, it is violent, but it's also intelligent and cultured, a film made by a film-maker, not a film made by committee, and it needs recognition as such.<br/><br/>On a final note, everyone who says this movie is sexist can shove that where the sun does not shed light. You need to look at the first act again and get it through your dumb skull that the two Russian girls are in the pay of the 'Extreme Hunters' to entice backpackers to their death. You also must have missed the fact that Paxton goes back to save his Japanese friend instead of leaving her. Also, true fact, I went to see this with my friend who isn't particularly big on gore films or indie horror, preferring things like Team America, Matrix and the like, and she really dug it. Oh, and the theatre was 50/50 girls and boys, so shove it. Really, get off your damn high horse."

But no...<br/><br/>The story revolves around three stoner dudes who go travelling a lot getting stoned and getting laid. They end up in Slovakia where they are set up as guinea pigs for demented people who pay to satisfy their cravings for mutilation and murder.<br/><br/>You can barely understand anything anyone is saying because apart from two of the characters, everyone else has a weird accent. The acting is mediocre. Nudity is rife, although if you're looking for a turn on in this film, you'll be bitterly disappointed - this ain't no porno. <br/><br/>Suspense, Na! Nowhere near as suspenseful as classics like Halloween! But there is quite a bit of gore (not as much as I expected though). All in all I wouldn't recommend this film unless you are just looking for a mindless night in with a mindless horror film.<br/><br/>I give it 5 points because it was an alright effort, and did have a few cringe worthy moments. However it just annoys me that it could have had so much potential...but alas, another big screen let down.<br/><br/>***SPOILER***<br/><br/>One reason to watch this movie is to see this hilarious part.

To be honest it did not seem the right sort of movie for Tarantino as the film on a whole was not up there with the rest of his collection, but fair play to him for giving another director a push and helping him achieve mainstream success.<br/><br/>I liked the fact the lead character has a conscience (wondered why he bought up that story about a little girl drowning half way through) and he risked it all to try save her (which was pointless to a degree, however her killing herself in front of the train allowed him to get on the other train) I also liked the fact the movie never went the way you imagined it i.e you expected him to be re-caught when he re-entered the chamber for the girl.<br/><br/>All in all a decent movie, not a must see, but worthwhile.<br/><br/>7/10."
"Chris_Docker","6","1","1","24 March 2006"," Not exactly a trip through Disneyland . . .
","With a firm eye on the box-office, Hostel is a mixed bag of gore goodies with plenty of inspiration but a shortage of creative originality.<br/><br/>Like a no-brainer version of Saw, Hostel starts off in a dark torture room. There then follows 45 minutes of non-violent action with three male backpackers as they wend there way through a tedious sequence of bouncing bosoms and hashish bongs. Starting in Amsterdam (portrayed none too realistically, with a marked absence of Dutch), they follow a trail given them by dodgy fellow travellers to find a hostel in Bratislavia promising to be brim-full with sex-starved women and a post-war shortage of men. When they get there, they are lured one by one to a neglected building that shows 'art exhibits', such exhibits being people gratuitously tortured and killed by perverts paying a high fee.<br/><br/>Although much blood is used to drench the set, writer-director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) makes the mistake of descending into black humour and then winding up with a suitably crowd-pleasing good-guy-wins ending. One rather wishes he had learnt from his brief brush with anti-Hollywood studio Troma (where he had small acting parts in the low-budget but very effective Toxic Avenger IV and Terror Firmer) and chosen either seriously nasty horror or gruesome Troma-style camp. Although there is no shortage of nauseating images, from chainsaws to surgical instruments, Hostel rather looks as if it used the British Board of Film Censors guidelines as its handbook. The camera jumps away at the crucial moment (except when violence is perpetrated by the hero), and Roth fails to stylise the brutality with either slow motion, detailed close-ups or snappy editing. The pedestrian acting is competent for the limited demands placed on it, but the script is trite and full of the sort of macho posturing American cinema would sadly have us associate with U.S. undergraduates.<br/><br/>Such amateurishness of technique fails on two counts. Firstly, horror is defined in terms of emotional impact. Such lightweight treatment means the shock value of the ideas and images themselves have to take the full burden. Since Hostel is no better or worse than any reasonable gore flick, yet was well marketed, it at least might succeed simply by attracting audiences that are either undemanding of the genre or are shocked because of lack of exposure to good horror films.<br/><br/>Secondly, given the story line, there are ample opportunities for creative effectiveness missed largely because, as the film has low artistic merit, it must conform to the lowest criteria of the censors. For instance, modern CGI is capable of very realistic simulation of violence (as evidenced in the scene in Irreversible where a man's head is caved in with a fire extinguisher but without the camera flinching away); good editing can also extend the emotional effect of violence to a very uncomfortable level (in Audition, the build up is so subtle, and the first movement of a person tied up in a bag so sudden, that the audience skips a collective heartbeat  and later, in the same film, sadism is extended in time until it is difficult to watch the screen). Both Irreversible and Audition are such cinematic masterpieces that the censor treats the violence more leniently  Hostel is trapped by its own mediocrity into the level of shocks it can deliver.<br/><br/>Ironically, Roth had plenty of talent to hand, including the director of Audition, and Quentin Tarantino (both of whom have cameo parts). Yet the most artistic moments are those derived from better films: as a sadist surgeon approaches his victim and gasps for air beneath his mask it recalls the similar scene in Blue Velvet when Hopper struggles for breath in his asthma mask as he is about to attack. Another highpoint, when a torturer loses control, is effectively emphasised by the identical discordant bursts of background music that were used by Bernard Herrmann in the famous Psycho shower scene (where the short, stabbing bursts were even more appropriate). Many other scenes (such as the partly dissected Asian girl) are glimpsed only briefly and not used to their full dramatic potential.<br/><br/>In its favour, there is some genuine tension in the car chase sequences, and the marauding gangs of children seem not only authentic but realistically threatening. A girl's suicide borrows effectively from Japanese horror as she is frozen momentarily in the camera before death. For all its superficiality, the main story is almost like a modern day vampire movie with buxom Eastern European wenches luring westerners to their doom before the main hero nails the bad guy. Its token believability (there are no mutants, ghouls, supernatural forces)  heavily supported in the official website by oblique references to horrific happenings  gives it a slightly darker twist than the modern monster movie (Hills Have Eyes) or the overworked (and so less believable) slasher series.<br/><br/>Shot in a few months for just over four million, Hostel covered its cost more than fourfold in its first weekend. That it will shock quite a few large audiences and entertain others makes it unfair to categorise the film as worthless, but also makes it likely to be overrated.<br/><br/>The three thrill-seeking, homophobic, racist backpackers (two American, one notably Icelandic) are so unlovable that one really doesn't care whether they are tortured and killed or not  it might make for better movies if such characters were permanently exterminated rather than going on to repopulate the more standard fare teen-slasher movie or umpteenth American Pie. In an interview, Roth claims he apologised (jokingly) to the Icelandic President for the irreparable damage he was doing to Iceland. Maybe he should just have apologised for making a bad film."

"industrija666","7","1","1","19 March 2006"," Well, this movie certainly divided the public...
","First of all, Eli Roth absolutely loves Takashi Miike and the Japanese horror ""hype"" , so to say. The prime idea for this movie was inspired by Miike's ""Odishon"". These two movies are absolutely not comparable with each other, because ""Odishon"" is very deep, dark, and traumatic piece of cinema. But, can we really say that Roth has done a bad job when doing this movie? I say no. This movie does exactly to the viewer what it should do. Relaxes him completely to the state of being just an ordinary movie, and then... bam! Shock. The last 20-30 minutes of the film is great. Great F/X , great disgusting ideas and environment, gloomy atmosphere, etc. I thought Americans would love this movie best, but it seems i was very, very wrong. To finish this review, i'd like to say that Roth has some really great ideas, and hopefully will convert them to the big screen maybe slightly better.

","Just saw this for the first time and was massively surprised. The characters, albeit paper thin, were well-performed and the suspense/gore was effective. What actually got me, though, was....<br/><br/>*SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!* ...that the protagonist wasn't some idiotic cut-out that ""almost"" makes it out and gets killers/re-captured at the end. To add to that equation, the kid actually exacts MUCH NEEDED revenge on his torturers, including the trio that initially conned him and his buddies into the torture chambers (running her over twice caused massive cheers).<br/><br/>It's this element that's sorely missing from some horror/slasher flicks as of late: The concept of karmic response. Even in CABIN FEVER we were given a severely down ending...and in crap like HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES, the evil characters are not only annoying for 2 hours straight, they never get a taste of their own medicine. A theme I tend to agree with.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong...if your main baddie is someone like Freddy Krueger, I don't mind if the guy lives on and continues the smart-ass quips and creative killing. But if your antagonists are a bunch of retarded rednecks (CORPSES) or vapid torturers (HOSTEL), they deserve some comeuppance at the end.<br/><br/>Even after Paxton slices Edward Salad-Hands' throat, I feared Roth would go the traditional route and have a twist-ending that would sour the guy's (deserved) vengeance (a ""twist"" ending concept, btw, that ruined a slasher flick that could have been amazing: HIGH TENSION)...such as Paxton coming back the next year to become a torturer because he enjoyed killing his attackers so much. Instead, Roth did th smart thing...he faded out once the scales had been balanced, leaving us all to wonder what WE'D do in such a situation...<br/><br/>*END SPOILER* Thanks, Mr. Roth....for showing us that not all horror has to shove a pessimistic taste down our throats as the lights come back on."

","Now this was a horror movie. You all probably know what its about so I won't elaborate about it here. Director Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) has made one hell of a horror movie. Finally an original horror movie. I'm so sick of the redundant slashers, remakes (sans a few) and crap that they throw out nowadays. This was quite a refreshing movie.<br/><br/>What made this movie great? First off a solid cast. Jay Hernandez does an excellent job in his role, he stands out among the rest in my opinion but that's not to say that the others were bad, they were good as well, Jan Vlasak, who played a business man on a trip to the same place, took the role of the main villain (even though he might not quite be the real bad guy) and he was great as well, really creepy. I know the one question, for those who haven't seen it, as you're reading this: ""Is it really that gory/disturbing/bloody?"" The answer is: No. It's not as bad as you think it will be. Sure there's blood, sure there's torture but not to the extent that its played out to be. A lot of it is suggested. Of course, that's not to say that its a slouch in the gore department. There are plenty of dismemberments and moments that'll make you cringe. The movie gets off to a fairly slow start. There's lots of nudity (Roth even gets away with a full frontal) for the first half and throughout that first half there isn't really any horror aspects. I think Roth put so much nudity in to take the MPAA's attention from the torture. It worked too, I can't believe this movie didn't get slapped with an NC-17. It's a dark toned movie with blood and torture and nudity. Once we get to the second half, the parts that everyone really came to see, we get a hell of a show though. One problem though is that at some points the movie is so dark (contrast-wise) that you can't see what's going on most notably during the ""eye"" scene, there was a clip posted on the internet, dunno if anyone caught it. Anyways, it actually looked much better and much more convincing on the screen than it did during that clip on the internet, it also doesn't fade to black when he's cutting the eye out either like it did in the clip, the camera stays right on the face and damn is it great. I don't think that was done on purpose to make you think you're seeing something and make it more intense, it's just too dark, they should really think about lighting it up for the DVD release. Now I'm going to compare these two movies now; it was more intense than last October's release of Saw II. Much more. I guess the one major flaw is that it takes so long to really get going that it seems over a little quickly. Call me sick but I came for some gore and torture and I think that they could've shown more torture and really gotten to the audience. Don't get me wrong though, what they did show was freaking awesome! Now, I'm not saying that movie need a ton of gore, that's not what makes a movie, not at all. A horror flick needs suspense and this movie has suspense and lots of it. Don't let the slow start sway you though, it's not boring (the first half) it does set you up for the rest of the movie and makes you feel like the friends are really connected. So no, this movie is not perfect but it's a great one, certainly one I'll pick up on DVD when it hits around May-June (in the inevitable Unrated release). The score was pretty good, nothing over the top but that may have been a good thing. Oh and another problem that just came to me was that Roth uses the F-Bomb way too much. I understand in some parts, hell if that was me getting tortured or in those situations I'd be yelling it out too but he used it at such awkward times, it's like he just said ""Hey, let's use that here!"". After this movie, I vowed to never EVER hit a Slovokian city. Check that one off the list (not that it was ever on...).<br/><br/>So yeah, this was a good horror movie. I didn't really touch on everything (I don't think) so I may go back and edit this later if I think of something else to say. So if you're a horror fan then do yourself a favor and see Eli Roth's Hostel."
"elman22","7","1","1","9 March 2006"," Pretty funny
","I live in Slovakia, I live in Bratislava and I consider this movie being one of the funniest horror comedies ever. I couldn't stop laughing when those guys arrived 'just outside Bratislava'. Police beating up citizens for no apparent reason? Gypsy teen gang terrorizing the city? 80's hits playing at the local disco? Tatra 613 as the best car around here? This 'alternate reality' ruined any promise of terror and fear I could feel from this movie and it ended up with only one scary set.<br/><br/>People say this is twisted, depraved and sick movie. Our local posters have tagline 'Try not to vomit watching this'. But to be honest, it's not that gory as one would think. Almost everything takes place just outside frame or someone blocks the view or the movie is cut away just before 'it' happens. After 'Cabin Fever' I would expect more, but let's wait for unrated director's cut and see what happens.<br/><br/>There's been a lot of fuss about this movie around here, saying it reflects bad image on Slovakia, but people do not get it's just a movie. In my opinion Eli Roth simply wanted to show different locations and props. If he would have shown Slovakia as it really is, he wouldn't get this image of scary European backwoods where everything is possible and I believe the movie would be a lot less scary for non central European folks. We do have the newest cars, we do have skyscrapers, we don't have gypsies' gangs terrorizing towns but hell, we have the most beautiful girls in the world."

","Hostel.<br/><br/>Having seen the trash that was Cabin Fever, I was quite worried that Hostel would be a disappointment, I'm glad to say that on the contrary it wasn't.<br/><br/>The film starts off innocent enough, 3 backpackers touring Europe looking for some hedonistic fun (and lots of sex!) and who wouldn't? Being an ex-backpacker myself I can relate to their early experience entirely! One night they meet a dark and mysterious character in Amsterdam who tells them that if they are looking for beautiful girls and lots of them they should head out to a Hostel near Bratislava, which is in Slovakia if you don't know.<br/><br/>So they do and after a strange incident with a man on the train they go to the Hostel and start having lots of the kind of fun you might expect.<br/><br/>Soon though, things begin to take on a more sinister and very gory turn.<br/><br/>Just to warn you, i have seen some very gory films and I actually felt physically sick watching this one.<br/><br/>I am impressed with the quality of Roth's film-making here, as in Cabin Fever he uses a slightly skewed take on the horror genre, going for real suspense. Instead of the usual bad guy hunting down the teenagers, there is a real mystery about this film right up until the last few acts.<br/><br/>But don't worry, I hear Slovakia really is a lovely place..."
"zv300","8","1","1","5 March 2006"," Near the top of the genre, very good despite some weird reviews.
","People here seem split on this movie but let me tell you, it's pretty damn good. People who did not like it? Weak-stomached girls and a few people from Slovakia claiming it's not like that in their country. We KNOW that, it's a MOVIE!! Most reviews are right about the fact the movie starts off like Euro Vacation, it's very sexy and filled with hot, nubile European women. That's why when the actually horror starts it's pretty jolting, and done ON PURPOSE. The eastern European country and it's people were created with extreme professionalism, very convincing sets and language down to the disco's and run-down buildings. People also had a problem with the acting, I for one thought it was VERY well-acted, especially the European parts like the 2 girls that dragged the Americans into their situation. I don't know what some here expect from a HORROR movie, Oscar-caliber acting? As for the ""horror"" parts of the movie, it lives up to it's name as the torture is pretty hard to watch (and hear) and makes you feel sorry for these guys. The ""villain"" in the movie just so happens to be some peoples perverse affliction for seeing others in pain, and causing it. There are REAL people like this on our planet, so this is no made up Freddy Kreuger villain. This movie is actually 3 types of movies, a sex movie in the beginning, a horror in the middle and a pure VENGEANCE flick towards and end, and boy does the victim get his. Never has vengeance been so satisfying, this guy pretty much gets ANYBODY who harmed him, and in some creative ways. This movie also features some of the BADDEST, most most VILE children you have ever seen. These street-wise euro-kids actually KILL 2 people (by stoning them, then smashing their heads to mush) for a bag of CHEWING GUM! Some of the kids are pretty cute and the site of one asking the other for a piece of gum while their co-Hort's kill 2 grown men is hilarious. Anyway, don't listen to anybody else, check this movie out as it is surprisingly good."

","If you look at it from a horror-movie-maker's point of view, or even from a horror-movie-lover's point of view, it is one of the best movies in the genre to hit the big screen. Yet the actual horror story is set in an eastern European country and I can't help thinking how the movie can very easily tarnish the image of that country and how it can deter tourists wanting to visit the country; especially when the story isn't based on actual events. Apart from that it is a horror movie and you will be horrified. The only positive message I took away from the movie is the message that we need to be extra careful when visiting a foreign country as tourists, and recognize that things are done differently in different countries. What looks and sounds friendly where we live might not be so in a different country."

","This is the worst movie I have ever seen. And why? From the very beginning to the end it's about nothing and less than that. There are many violent movies, but this one is on the top of them and maybe beyond the frontier of disguise. Furthermore, things are completely wrong presented in this movie and Slovakia is shown as the country where live only prostitutes. There are many 'mistakes' that could be intended (i have no idea why?!?!) but it disgusted me so much. Example: Prague's main station is shown as some German train station (it is done in many movies but this is so obvious that the station is in Prague) and Bratislava (capital of Slovakia) is shown as some town with 10,000 inhabitants. So please don't expect it to be good, because it is not good! Save your evening and have a bottle of wine instead of watching this movie."

","Nothing in my review that no one else hasn't said already. This movie was awful. I was so disappointed to see what was a fantastic idea turned into total rubbish. Some good gore slipped in there, pretty lazy though and nowhere near enough. Because lets face it, you're not going to this film to see high art you're here for the gore. But not enough and nothing was actually shown. In short, this movie was crap. Too much time spent on titties, the characters were lousy, the violence/gore was lazy (but the effects were decent). Script? Crap. Characters? Crap. Directing/editing obvious. And here I want to point out a scene where a woman's toe is cut off but is tightly cut to some trimming their nails. Come on, that shot is sooooo old! There is no saving this movie, it is truly truly awful."
"arc81","7","1","1","2 March 2006"," Hostel: Strangeland meets Saw.
","At the start of the movie, my first impression was another corny teen movie. I was right, to an extent. Some parts are corny, however, some are extremely suspenseful. It starts out with a group of three pot smoking friends on a vacation in Amsterdam hoping to get stoned out of their minds and sleep with lots of European girls. Typical and overused, yes, but it worked. Unfortunately, this scenario plays out for almost half the movie. My friend told me about this movie and summarized it as ""lots of boobs, and lots of gore"", and he was dead on. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy seeing a boob here and there, but come on, let's do it in moderation, OK? The nudity was excessive, and it felt like it was only there for the ratings. They could left out 95% of the nudity and still kept the viewers perfectly happy. As for the gore -- Hostel wouldn't be Hostel without it. There's no problem there. This is a movie that WILL make you cringe.. and it's a movie that WILL make you fold up into the fetus position. But it won't scare you. Hostel was much more of a thriller than a horror.<br/><br/>As for the acting.. everyone did a good job, with the exception of a few scenes. Everyone was convincing for the most part, even the ""only hired because they were hot"" European girls. Since I compared this movie to Saw in my summary, let me just say the acting was a thousand times better than in Saw. Don't worry about that.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed this movie. But it definitely isn't something I'd buy. It kept my attention, it was very suspenseful at times, and the story was straight forward and believable. It just didn't have the spark. Metaphorically speaking, this is just another notch in the belt in terms of recent horror/thrillers.<br/><br/>I give it a generous 7 out of 10 stars.<br/><br/>Don't take your kids to this movie."
"freaky_dave","7","1","1","28 February 2006"," Hostel is a good horror movie that makes a strong point
","I think I enjoyed Hostel not because of the gore, which this movie has loads of, or even the sex scenes which are pretty shallow and take up the first part of the movie. What I liked about this movie was the story and the point that director Eli Roth was trying to get across. That point is that most people outside of America do not like Americans very much. In their opinion, Americans are rude, inconsiderate, selfish and think they are better than everyone. Not only are they all these things, they are also naive, and it is this last point that leads our young protagonists into doing something they are never quite ready for. But how could they be?<br/><br/>Eli Roth pulls no punches with this movie. It is in fact gorier and probably more disturbing then Saw. He sets the movie up as a soft porn flick which soon changes into a terrific horror movie involving torture and other nasty things.<br/><br/>What really makes this film work is that deep down we as viewers know that things like this are possible. We assume that we are so safe in our own country and believe that we will be just as safe going into other countries. All we have to do is think about what's happening over in Iraq to see that security is not always possible when you are so far away from your own country and exploring cultures that you really know nothing about.<br/><br/>Hostel is not a great film, the acting was pretty weak, and I found it hard to even care for the characters. But then I believe this is part of what Eli Roth was trying to say. After all, how can you care for such obnoxious people who care only about themselves and show nothing for others. However at the end of the film, I do believe that one of the main characters finally understands this and looks as if he's going to change his ways. I think maybe a lot of us should."

"mystemo","8","1","1","24 February 2006"," A very pleasant surprise
","I must admit, Roth has redeemed himself with Hostel after an abysmal outing with Cabin Fever. In that film I could not care less if these characters lived or died because they were so unlikeable. It is SO important in horror or thriller movies to make the characters so relateable that you could imagine that it is actually you in their situation. I am pleased to say that Hostel works very well in this area. Three guys backpacking through Europe together get a tip-off that there is a bevy of beautiful women in a town in Bratislava who are ready and willing for anything. It happens that the guys aren't having too much luck in the people-saturated Amsterdam, so they decide to trek over to this town. And so the mystery and terror begins... One of the things I was shocked by was the polish of this film - not often do people describe horror movies as beautiful - from the cinematography to the score. A good example is the intro with the credits: snapshots of a dank place somewhere with someone whistling, cleaning up a room of some sort from many different angles, often blurred or out of focus - but never actually knowing what the heck is going on. Now, for a supposedly gory and ultra-violent movie, I found these sensoral moments very rewarding. For me, buckets of bloods splattering the screen is not scary - more often what you don't see will terrify the viewer much more effectively, so the actual goriness of the movie only accounts for roughly 20% but, because of the other 80% involved, the 20% becomes crucial to the telling of the story (YES, an intriguing story in a horror movie). After an intro of getting to know the characters, once events happen to take them away from the main action you feel for them and their fate. Even beyond this movie, it leaves you with a sense of what happens next? and not just a sequel for sequels' sake. Jay Hernandez is excellent in his role, showing a great vulnerability for a male lead when it was possible for him to become all 'Die Hard' on us - that said, he knows when to bring out the big guns when required. The other two includes Hernandez's friend who began the journey with him and tries to summon the courage to approach the very forward women in Amsterdam, and an Icelandic backpacker who is the complete opposite joined them along the way who bringing a lot of humour to the tale. The terror in the movie is excellent and the psychology of the characters, intriguing to say the least, albeit disturbing. As with most horror movies, the overall message is the same regarding our human ability to trust others and when it is misplaced. I am hoping with the sequel they can build on and enhance the atmosphere created in this movie and continue to chill the pants right off us :)"

"Aiwaz69","8","1","1","9 February 2006"," A Disturbing Horror Classic
","Hostel has been unfairly criticize for being too gory and sadistic, as people ignore what the movie is trying to say on human nature. Hostel's basic tone and plot is this: the exploration of humanity's nature for finding the pleasures of life and always seeking more ways to fulfill it's cardinal sins. The three victims in the movie are all seeking pleasure through sex and drugs, but those who go to the ""business"" in Slovakia no longer can get fulfillment from casual sex and drug use, so they seek their pleasures in sadistic torture and blood. These people will pay large amounts of money and conduct the most horrendous acts just to fulfill their desires. In some sad way, this is so true as everyone has that deep deep desire to hurt or watch someone die, whether one tries to see if there's dead bodies after an accident or killing virtual soldiers or people in video games. To me Hostel explores this secret desire upfront in graphic details. Yes, the film is dark, yes the movie is gory and sadistic, (I was surprised it got an R rating) but so can human nature... all you need to do is watch the evening news and know it's true. It is a horror classic in the making in the likeness of Last House on the Left & The Hills Have Eyes."
"Jonny_Numb","3","1","1","30 January 2006"," this ""Hostel"" is little more than a glorified roach motel...
","Some critics with delusions of philosophical grandeur have gone the old ""cautionary tale"" route in justifying the excesses of Eli Roth's tediously grueling sophomore effort, ""Hostel."" And while I would be inclined to agree that it IS a cautionary tale, it is certainly not in the same context. By my count, we learn 3 important lessons over the course of 90 minutes: 1) Quentin Tarantino will attach his name to any ""hot"" piece of crap that purports to push the boundaries of genre cinema; 2) Harry Knowles and his ilk are clearly commissioned by companies like Miramax and Lions Gate to provide laudatory blurbs in order to help boost box office; and 3) the hype surrounding Eli Roth and his ""craft"" is still seriously unfounded.<br/><br/>In spite of the praises of a drunken Peter Jackson and recommendations from several friends, I found Roth's debut feature, ""Cabin Fever,"" to be a maddeningly obnoxious romp lacking in script, redeemable characters, and any sense of style. You might argue that I'm being overly analytical, that I can't ""enjoy"" a movie for what it is, but you would be wrong--the worst offense of ""Cabin Fever"" is a total lack of joy in its execution of horrific events and gushing gore.<br/><br/>So, is ""Hostel"" (a homonym that becomes less clever the more you hear it) an improvement over Roth's previous effort? Not really. While more technically proficient and a bit more developed in story (which isn't saying much), it ultimately remains an experience that is more exhausting and tedious than horrifying and suspenseful, despite the grisly subject matter.<br/><br/>The story, such as it is, follows 2 American fratboy types and their Icelandic buddy on a backpacking trip across Europe. That none of these guys are ever clearly defined as characters leaves us to view them as a trio of sexist, homophobic jocks who would be getting pounded in the pit at Ozzfest. While on a train to Slovakia, our heroes encounter a foreign businessman who eats salad with his fingers (har har), insisting that ""Man has lost his relationship with food"" (an apparent double meaning is at work here, but I'll be damned if I know how it ties into this movie). Once in Slovakia, our zeroes check into a posh hostel where they are accosted by a duo of Euro-bimbettes; T&A ensues, thus signing away whatever life insurance policy these idiots have. As our fellows gradually and vaguely disappear, it becomes apparent that an underground syndicate of traveling businessmen are paying hefty fees to torture and murder youths in an ugly abandoned warehouse. Or something.<br/><br/>While the setup promises great things for an overachieving gorehound, the reality of ""Hostel"" is very disappointing. That we care nothing for the characters is the first problem; the clunky, uneven pace that provokes frustration when events should be jetting along is another; and the incredibly awkward attempts at humor (including a gang of renegade Slovak children) are distracting and throw the movie even further from the base of ""realism"" it so desperately wants to capture.<br/><br/>If Roth has improved his craft on a technical level, it is ironic that this is another factor that works against ""Hostel."" In a movie going for gritty horror, the settings certainly smack of a 'bowels-of-hell' squalor, but the orchestral score, combined with acting that is too deliberate and studied to convey a mood of real consequence, sinks the intended effect. Whereas the recent ""Wolf Creek""--with its unrefined acting, soul-deadening night sequences, and no effort made to explain its madness, heightened the experience to terrifying effect, ""Hostel"" is constantly reminding us: ""It's only a movie...only a movie...only a movie..."" ""Hostel"" does have its gory moments, though they're set against such stark lighting (or encapsulated in momentary edits) that they're sometimes hard to make out; while the violence is plentiful and done in Grand Guignol fashion, it left me feeling cold and indifferent. Compared to, say, ""Saw II,"" which has a justification--no matter how contrived--for its madness, ""Hostel"" is simply a shock show that condenses its confused 'point' in a speech given by a nattering businessman before he applies a blowtorch to his victim's eye. One can almost imagine Roth emphatically saying, ""This is the kind of awful stuff that goes on in the world! See? It's all justified!"" Which, of course, is like saying ""The Devil's Rejects"" was justified...<br/><br/>Perhaps the most savage and nihilistic moment comes at the very end, where our lone surviving hero (minus 'dos dedos') murders the foreign businessman from earlier in the film, thus giving a hollow rush of vengeance that doesn't blur the line between tormentor and tormented, but instead shows the film's hypocritical standpoint on human rights. As if, by killing ONE of the sadists, the black-market torture trade will magically come to a screeching halt. The resulting conclusion I drew from this is that we're pretty much all scum, and have ""lost our relationship"" with what makes a quality horror film anymore...""Hostel"" is a testament to that.<br/><br/>2.5 out of 10"

The last scene was the best and most horror filled, I actually think it looked like a different style of directing if you ask me, just because you throw fake blood and fake body parts around does not make it a horror film. This movie did not scare me, it was not the best of horror, it was barley better than the Devil's Rejects which really sucked. I gave this movie a chance and no it did not suck but it was not even worth the discount ticket price I paid, not very cinematic at all, I could have watched it on a six inch screen with the same effect.

","don't you think the location of the movie to Slovakia is rather ridiculous since there is nothing what should remind this country except for a few background songs? The native language used in the movie sounds rather Czech (only for those who could recognize it). All scenes are situated in Czech republic. This fact degrades the authenticity. The authors selected Slovakia - they should have made it there. No worth to travel around the world to get something not authentic. Don't you agree with me there is enough such creepy places all around the world to get the same result? The opinion on this movie in Slovakia varies, but tends to be mostly negative.

"amixer24","7","1","1","15 January 2006"," Violence Level
","In regards to the violence of the film, I must say I was somewhat surprised. Based on the reviews and the online buzz surrounding the movie, I assumed I was in for a blood bath, with the camera lingering on each painful and graphic torture. I planned on watching people leave the theater in disgust but, in my theater anyways, no such thing happened. After all, Quentin Tarantino did help Roth evolve his idea for the movie as well as with the script and he must have been given a chance to lend assistance/his ideas to the torture scenes. After viewing the movie however, I thought that, while the violence was grisly and gruesome, it was not as bad as it was made out to be because the camera did not linger on all of the violence and torture actually occurring. Instead, we are left with the aftermath. I am not someone obsessed with violence whatsoever but I could easily name 5 movies that contain more graphic and brutal violence than Hostel. I was also disappointed that the scene with the toe in the bolt cutters cutaway before we are allowed to see what happens (although it is obvious), yet a severed chillies tendon is given a close up. I was disappointed with the chainsaw scene and had planned for it to be used more and for it to have ""cut more up"" so to speak, than it did. Again, I'm not a psychopath obsessed with violence but I thought that Hostel could have been much more bloody and graphic than what it was.

","I was quite disappointed by the time I got to the end of this movie. I agree with the user who commented before me, (Todd Koerner from Hermosa Beach) with his analogy ""It certainly felt like it hit all the necessary marks, from nudity and dismemberment to bloody revenge, but at the conclusion, it just felt like eating cotton candy - no real nutritional value, just a sense that I had satisfied some of my prurient appetite without any logical payoff."".<br/><br/>I agree to a point. I almost think that after all the hype there would have been more to it. A quirk or a twist would have been good, but it turned from a somewhat creepy horror movie into an actually laughable ending. The movie wasn't even scary. I don't get quote scared unquote at movies, but I appreciate the horror of it. But this one was off the deep end. No explanation, no reason. Think of it along the same lines as Jeepers Creepers, only with a bit more nudity and gore. I wouldn't say DON'T watch this movie, but I wouldn't advise going to the theater and spending too much on it.<br/><br/>This movie is a rental for sure. Of course with the mostly brain dead young adults in this day and age, I'm sure it will be classified as ""incredibly horrific"" and the such, but frankly I'm disappointed that Quentin Tarantino would put his name on it just to make money. To be frank, I only paid money to go see it because I was and am a big fan of Tarantino and of his mentor, Robert Rodriguez. Hope to hear some more comments and reviews of this movie."

This movie COULD have been a commentary on human nature, the desire for blood, how money can buy anything, the inherent evil nature of humanity, SOMETHING. This movie could have been so many things, but it ended up just being a typical big screen horror film. Same stupid, formulaic plot we've been seeing since we started watching horror. It's a shame nobody can seem to make horror with a solid plot line.<br/><br/>I'll give it some credit - it had something going for it until the end. Then it tried to wrap itself up too fast, and lost any and all plot credibility.<br/><br/>Long story short...I didn't see anything I hadn't already seen done better in Saw over a year ago."
"victoriaggarcia","1","4","9","17 November 2018"," It sucks!
","«Hostel» does not even qualify as a horror movie. It's just a bunch of disgusting clichés regarding Slovakia and Central Europe. A grose Americancentrism makes the whole plot. It builds a pseudo realistic and pseudo ironical register which excludes any supernatural feature; consequently, the film suggests that poverty, marginalization and corruption in Slovakia are the causes of serial murder and horror. Obviously, Americans are shown as victims, but also as heroes."
"johnnyth","1","4","9","7 January 2006"," Cannot ""Un-see"" this Terribly Shallow Film.
","Tarrantino has gone insane. This film was a blood-fest that offered no clever plot or witty dialogue that we have come to expect from the producer. Hostel is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Aside from severed limbs impressively depicted with cutting-edge effects, Hostel is devoid of anything more than gore. The predictable plot is exacerbated by highly improbable chance encounters that serve simply to allow Tarrantino to kill someone else in, he hopes, a more shocking fashion than the last. Hostel oscillates between sex and torture, two aesthetically intriguing subjects when integrated into an interesting plot. However, these subjects as implemented in Hostel contribute to the shallow and disappointing nature of the production. I left the movie feeling nauseated and envious of those exiting from The Chronicles of Narnia. Even the Family Stone-goers appeared more enlightened following their movie than myself, having retained no capacity for intelligent thought after having the life sucked out of me by Hostel."

","This movie was not at all what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting a saw-like psychological thriller type movie. Instead I was handed this piece of crap. The trailers made it look all cool, but as you sit down in the theatre you get a hard slap on the face. It is basically a Eurotrip ripoff (as some other people have said) then for like the last half-hour or so you get to see a little bit of gore/violence, mostly off screen. It is ridiculous to me that someone would need the paramedics called in for them during this movie. I have seen worse things on the TV show CSI. So it is my advice that you avoid this movie for its sure stupidity, but if you happen to get sucked in to going to see this garbage of a film do yourself a favor, bring a pillow and take a little nap. Honestly the worst movie I have ever seen. Well maybe not the worst at least ties with Peter Jackson's King Kong though."

There is tons of gore in violence in this movie on the other hand so don't think the previews are misleading. This movie has a great story line, that shows real life in an artistic sense.

","The only reason i did not give this movie a perfect score is because the teasers led us to believe this movie will be torture all the way through and i got my guy friends to come and just sort of hangout but it turned out to be well plotted. Rather than torture the movie has a heroic plot and is definitely recommended for couples to cuddle and just enjoy the well balanced sadistic yet genius movie. Incredible acting, super plot. This movie also proves it doesn't take multi-million contracts on a single actor to make the acting good. Also i found this movie to be more of a thriller rather than a horror. If you want to enjoy the hot girls, the sex, yet see a good semi-unexpected plot with some(Notice not a lot) of torture. This is for you.<br/><br/>9/10"

","The movie has a lot of obscene things including many vulgar scenes through out the movie as its more of a teen life based movie and it is also really a shocking experience as it has a lot of brutal and horrifying scenarios. I like this movie as it really graphic and its also a thrilling experience to watch it...It's not a family movie; some scenes might be too gross to watch as its ultra violent and some scenes might be too disturbing... so be ready for it. The movie is going to be a sure hit as its a movie that everyone who loves horror movies would like to watch.

","I just saw the premiere at Toronto this afternoon. Eli Roth was presenting Hostel as a 'work in progress'. Let me say this, you could hardly tell. The look of the film was excellent.<br/><br/>Now on to film. Hostel is story about some guys back packing through Europe looking for drugs and girls. They hear about a Hostel that is supposed to have the best girls around, so they decided to go check it out in Slovakia. Surprise, surprise it's not quite what they expected.<br/><br/>This movie made me want to throw up at times, and that is a compliment. Some scenes were just so unsettling and disturbing. Fans of the genre will not be disappointed. If you want to see a great horror film that doesn't hold back the punches or try to sell you any watered down PG13 crap, then this is the movie for you. Eli Roth knows how to make the audience squirm in their seats and doesn't hold back on the gore. There should be more films like this out there."
"hakobyanhakob81","10","3","6","26 September 2010"," The most important and most inherent horror movie of the 21st century!
","This movie was a wave of emotions which I can't fully describe. I can only say that although I'm not a gay, if I hopefully meet Eli Roth someday I'm going to give him a French kiss for making this movie because it's probably the toughest and the most original horror movie that will never be forgotten because it graphically exposes something that's not at all far from being/becoming true. I mean we have already heard the stories about some rich people arranging manhunts just for fun, right? So it's quite possible this movie prevented some much worse things from happening. Since the plot is very plausible, and therefore captivating, it makes the gruesome scenes even more realistic. A very intellectual horror movie that has a great depth of meaning. Truly a masterpiece that praises the genre."

It would be about the same as sitting back watching a porn and flipping through playboys. what substance. the movie (after the abundant amount of tits and sex) was actually done OK, but I lost any liking for it cause the beginning and some parts throughout were so polluted with garbage and way too much sex, nudity, drugs etc. How much can a movie seriously push the envelope before its considered a porn? Unless a women was a lesbian, or an exhibitionist who enjoyed women being humiliated for no other than the reason to see them naked, I don't see why a woman would actually sit through this movie unless of course she wanted to torture herself with sexism. the producer must be a real pervert and have absolutely zero respect for women. A movie can be good without all that crap. Its called imagination and suspense. There was A LOT that was NOT left to the imagination. If you want to see a Hustler magazine gone movie, this is it. To have to use the female body at such a sexual extreme shows to me that the director is pretty insecure with his ability to make a good movie so needs a lot of eye candy/distraction. Complete asinine crazy ass sex and nudity borderline soft porn flick for the boys this one.

This movie is both scary and fascinating it's based on true events except the events really happened in Japan, Eli Roth was going to do a documentary on the subject but knew he wouldn't be able to find out much since the whole ""killing business"" is hush hush/under wraps/on the down low ... the extras and special features are really funny watching them film the movie so funny check that out for sure. Eli Roth also makes an appearance in the movie see if you can spot his part! it's really small only 1 line but hes there [ CLUE: Red Sox ]<br/><br/>THE BOTTOM LINE: WATCH THIS FREIKEN MOVIE! IT'LL ROCK YOUR SOCKS!"
"johnmichael-2","10","3","6","31 October 2006"," The Complaints Are Baseless or Misguided
","As you can see by my title, I ran across quite a lot of complaints about this movie before I watched it. ""It had a bad plot,"" people said. ""It was porn for the first 40 minutes, and its transition into gore was really sudden."" ""The acting was bad,"" ""the directing was terrible"", ""the story sucked"", etc., etc.<br/><br/>When I watched it I was very pleasantly surprised to find that all these complaints were wrong. Sure, some of them were based on truths, but I think people distorted them simply because they didn't like the premise. Yes, the first 20-30 (NOT 40) minutes of the film had quite a lot of nudity in it, but it was by no means porn! And though I'm not a great fan of mindless sex, at least it wasn't pointless. The sex is what lured the main characters into the hostel in the first place. And the transition into the gore was not sudden, but quite easily handled--in fact, I'm surprised at the wonderful job that Eli Roth did at transforming the mood from light and flippant into dark and unfathomably disturbing.<br/><br/>The acting was by no means bad. Jay Hernandez, I believe, did a spectacular job as Paxton. It is fascinating to watch Paxton's character change from a carefree college student obsessed with sex and girls to a troubled man that delights in vengeance against his torturers. The other actors did their job well (though Derek Richardson as Josh, while mostly skillful, needed to work on his whimpering).<br/><br/>Now for the story. As you all should know, it's about three college-age men that backpack across Europe looking for sex, and they're recommended to a hostel, which turns out to be a place that people get tortured (seriously, the plot is better than I made it sound). Eli Roth didn't add many fancy or unexpected twists into his screenplay; you won't see the kind of surprise endings that the Saw franchise is famous for. But everything Eli Roth does have in here he made sense of. He uses very little unnecessary material, and he does a great job at subtle foreshadowing so that, in the end, everything makes sense. Please pay attention to the scene where Paxton tells Josh about a childhood memory of watching a girl die, because it foreshadows what would have otherwise been a really dumb (er, I mean Gryffindorish) moment in the script.<br/><br/>I also loved the fact that Eli Roth and the sound editors didn't splurge on the screams. In fact, when the screams get particularly loud, the editors actually turned them down and instead increased the other noises (such as the chainsaws or, most memorably, the snapping of sharp scissors). You can't know just how pleased I was that they didn't blast me from my seat with 100,000 decibels of pure sound.<br/><br/>I also loved the score, which moved away from the overly-creepy style of horror films and more towards the dramatic form. It suited the film better, because this film was really not scary. However, it was truly disturbing and horrific (hence the term ""horror film""). It is dumbfounding to witness this appalling display of human brutality and its marked effect on the characters (namely Paxton--he has an absolutely haunting terror in his eyes during the last half-hour of the movie). This brutality is made all the more effective by Roth's refusal to use the safer, less inciting ""cut-to-black"" techniques found in cheap horror films. No, he shows us everything. In great, bloody detail. And it is gross.<br/><br/>The trailer said the movie was based off true events. I'm guessing it probably meant the premise as opposed to the actual characters, but either way it's entirely believable. Humans are cruel creatures, and they go to insane lengths to continue in their destructive depravity. It was Roth's effectiveness in conveying this theme that made me give this movie a 9 instead of an 8.<br/><br/>This movie is a must-see for horror fans, or for MATURE viewers. If you cannot see past the gore, you should probably not watch this movie. If you can, however, you need to watch this at least once (more, if you can stomach it), despite the side effects of a churned stomach and a severe jolting of the emotions and senses."
"tokyoboy019","1","3","6","16 October 2006"," Pointless Massacre
","One of the worst movies i've ever seen. It really has no point, a complete waste of time. A group travels to Slovakia from Holland and passes through a hotel named Hostel and can't even get into it, so searches for another place to stay, and the name of Hostel comes from there, great. And then they go after a bunch of horny girls, to Slovakia, just to get laid. They have fun and everything is perfect etc etc and then girls sells them to a butcher {simplifying}, and they die one by one, pffft only thing is that they die horribly. So basically the movie is about ""minor sex scenes and horrible deaths"", it could be a successful movie if the director would make it a porn movie or a teenage scary movie i bet. So anyway, they die and one friend manages to escape, without two fingers. Losing fingers seems like no big deal in the movie, but in fact, it's pretty much traumatic, he would pass out or die from blood loss, but instead of that, he just walks away with two fingers in his pocket. Then he decides to rescue a Japanese stranger from the hotel that he was staying in, and she manages to escape with his help, but this time without an eye, also he cuts her eye himself, she loses a lot of blood and that mustard-like liquid and all, then she joins him in the great escape. They run away like two wounded heroes from that place, and in the end she commits suicide which she could've done sooner, and he decides to kill a psycho he met in the train at the first time {also he kills him the same way as that doctor tortured him and the way this guy killed his friend by slitting his neck, which he has no idea about}. So my point is, this is a regular American guy and decides to play hero after a massacre, out of nowhere, that makes not much sense. The whole movie makes no sense, it's just great to kill time and turn you into psychos. Also i couldn't stop thinking that, is Slovakia like this? beggar/murderer children, hot girls around who are ready to sell your body, people doing everything for money; i can't imagine how come they let the movie soil the whole country, or a part of it.. thats not the point though, the point is this movie sucks and thats it."

Now for that statement Eli must take the cake as one of the biggest Jerks Hollywood has ever produced.<br/><br/>So let me get this straight - Hostel is actually a practical joke that this Boston native is playing on Americans? I'm not sure anyone got the joke, including Europeans. So Eli is going to make a movie in which he makes loads of money from Americans that is actually a practical joke on Americans? Not sure I get it.<br/><br/>I can think of better ways to make the sort of statement that Eli made - I don't think that this is the real statement he made - it's clear that this is a jack*** back stepping after making a film that has no clear artistic point.<br/><br/>I think there are plenty of educated Americans who know where and what Slovakia is - but I also think there are Americans who do not know a thing about Slovakia - but one thing is for sure - the only thing Roth proved with this movie is that he is the latter.<br/><br/>I love great horror movies and I think violence and gore are justified in a great piece of art - The Exorcist is a great example of that.

The horror part didn't even start until well into the movie, and the plot development left much to be desired. Unfortunately, I watched the movie to the end, hoping Quentin Tarantino would redeem himself with some wit, some twist, or for heaven's sake, some plot!<br/><br/>Aside from a lot of blood/gore, nudity, and swearing, this movie had no substance.

","Does anyone seriously believe Eli Roth's claim that this exercise in gloating sadism is a commentary on the war in Iraq? He has said in interviews that Hostel was inspired by viewing websites where one could arrange to kill human victims in third-world countries. Apparently he originally intended to make a documentary about this. For whatever reason (legal perhaps?) this proved impossible. Never mind - the movie clearly appeals to the same crowd as would roll up to see an actual ""snuff"" movie.<br/><br/>The only connection with Iraq that I can see is that unashamed celebrations of cruelty such as this have no doubt contributed to the culture that spawned the sniggering torturers of Abu Ghraib."

Yet these scenes failed to shock me as I was used to this kind of stuff after spending a year watching crummy horrors like Jason X and Alien Vs Predator. Yet once I heard about Hostel I decided to see it. I couldn't as it received an R rating (or NC-17 for the Americans reading). I was furious when the ushers refused to grant me entry, thinking that the high level violence that I could've been witnessing at that very moment couldn't possibly be as bad as the ratings say. I was proved wrong when I witnessed the violence on DVD. For the first time in 4-5 years I have been truly shocked and scared of a modern horror. Eli Roth deserves to be recognized for this bundle of porn, blood and power drills. His previous movie 'Cabin Fever' was, in my words, fantastic but this movie tops it by far. Nothing beats watching some clot chained to a chair with a chainsaw inches away from his face. The minor cutbacks, however, are the stereotypical Americans in Amsterdam but that doesn't matter when they look like Calvin Klein models one minute and diced ham the next. I cannot wait to see Roth's next movie and I won't care for the rating, even if I'm underage."

"Dead_Rock","1","3","6","1 May 2006"," Cruel movie without depth
","Sorry for any spelling issues - English is a foreign language.<br/><br/>At first I must say that I'm totally disappointed of Quentin Tarantino. I liked his movies and how brutality was used. But Hostel totally shook this opinion. I can't understand how Tarantino could engage his self in a movie like this.<br/><br/>The story bores from the minute the film starts. The 3 main characters have no depth and somehow their stupidity makes the viewer lack any feelings for them. The first 45 min. you see them smoke weed, f*** anything that comes across them and that's totally it - sounds already boring? Their play is also more sort of a B-Movie - except there is no point to laugh. Then slowly the ""story"" unfolds - which is easy to get behind - there is no suspense. To compensate this lack of suspense splatter of the worst kind is used. I mean in general I'm a fan of splatter - chainsawing Zombie, exploding heads, we've already seen anything like this - but always in the right place and packed into a story. Don't expect this to happen in Hostel. Drilling holes into legs and cutting of Achilles Heels is not cool, it's cruel and this film shows things like that in Close Up. Don't get me wrong I'm not a sissy, I've seen worse in the hospital where I worked. But in Hostel you don't even care if the 3 boys get killed, you don't have a relationship to them. This film celebrates the cruel killing as its only content. This is not cool, this is boring. Splatter films with zombies are cool, splatter films from Japan are cool, B-Movies are cool. But Hostel is plain cruel and boring - because it doesn't involve you. You're just disgusted by the things shown.<br/><br/>Another major issue are the stupid stereotypes. Pot smoking Netherlands, poor, ugly and criminal former Soviet people. Simple characters is the most friendliest term that comes to my mind.<br/><br/>Don't get fooled of the trailers and the Tarantino thing, this movie sucks and is not worth your time.

I was expecting to constantly be thinking what I would do if I were in that position; however for the most part all I could think of was how unrealistic certain parts of the film were, ie when Paxton, with half his hand missing, was moving around like a super-hero.<br/><br/>Before I saw this film I was trying to compare it to the Saw movies.

The first 45 minutes of the movie are a waste of time, take way to long to get to any kind of action. This movie is nothing compared to Duck til Dawn, even that was better than this. Luckily I had a coupon to rent this from Blockbuster, otherwise I would have returned it and asked for my money back."

Moreover, Slovakian girls hardly could have names Natalia and Svetlana - there are Russian names. As for the perverts (who torture people) it is not clear why there are so many people who are fond of this? If I was Slovakian I would not like this portrayal of my country. And as far as I understood the only survivor (Hernandez) and the director of the movie are of the same or of the similar nationality though in my opinion that boy who's name Josh (the shy one) should survive.

","I saw hostel a couple of days ago with my boyfriend. if he hadn't been there, I would have left the moment i heard the drilling sound.<br/><br/>What irritates me in this film most is the view of Slovakia. I am aware that Roth's aim wasn't to give the people a geographical course on this country, but from my point of view, he misused it. He took a not well known country and presented it in a way he thought that would be attractive for an average (American) viewer. I don't think it is unnatural, if i watch a film where my country is described as a land of no younger than 40 year-old men and 20 year-old money-hunting prostitutes. <br/><br/>Choose an exciting plot, place the story into a country no one knows and modify it according to ur imagination, tell everyone u worked on it with Tarantino, claim that true events inspired u, put as many naked women and sex scenes as it gets and find a guy who can do a pretty cool whistling...this is what i call Roth's recipe for a horror...and it worked...Eli Roth is currently the most unpopular American in SK (ok sorry, the second most unpopular - after Bush) but on the other hand, what he achieved was brilliant - he made a fortune by making a movie which people love or hate. and that's what it is all about - it is discussed - people go and see it, even those who'd like to see Roth being cut with a chainsaw.<br/><br/>If Eli Roth's goal was to make me keep my eyes closed for the half of the movie and make my stomach twist in my body, he succeeded. Anyway, a really good horror movie is not about rivers of blood and hanging eyeballs. For me, a horror scares u quietly, gets into your brain, makes your imagination work. This film wasn't scary. It was just gross."

","Please don't waist your hard earned money by going to see this very poor film. The best thing about this production is the hype that has been created around it and as public enemy said don't believe it. <br/><br/>To a certain extent it is a massive disappointment as the idea on an organisation who offer bored and frustrated business types the chance to torture and kill various nationalities for a fee could have been both fascinating and terrifying. However the execution (no pun intended) of the film is really bad, it starts in Amesterdam with the three main characters behaving incredibly obnoxiously in a bad teen comedy style which in itself is cringe worthy, to the extent of you really hoping they come to a grizzly end. For this reason alone the film has already failed, it is hard to feel scared or terrified for characters who you feel no empathy for and you're actually hoping they get bumped off quickly so you can leave. <br/><br/>As for the claims that its the goriest or sickest film ever I find this must be the work of the hype machine, there's nothing here that hasn't been seen before many times before once again spoiling perhaps the only thing this film had going for it. <br/><br/>Another disappointing aspect of the film was the 'American' finale to the film, with the lone hero escaping but not before conveniently avenging his friends deaths with no fear of retribution from the law, go 'Team America'. <br/><br/>In short don't see this and don't believe anyone who says this is the first scary film they've seen since aliens because it isn't.

","I have seen every horror movie there is and nothing has ever really scared me (at least not in a bad way). Frailty, Wrong Turn, Cabin Fever, and Saw did come close though. But nothing could have prepared me for Hostel!!! I rated it a 10 because it did its job. However, it was not enjoyable to me at all. I am not a squeamish person in the least, but the gore and violence in this movie were almost too much to bear (way worse than Kill Bill). With people vomiting all over themselves in fear and crying rather than just screaming, it seemed more real that any other horror movie I've seen. The only thing that could be more horrifying, in my opinion, would be watching live footage of people being tortured and killed in concentration camps. The eyeless Asian girl throwing herself in front of the train will haunt me for I don't know how long. I felt sick to my stomach after it was over and even cried.

Well soon the entire movie has clips that will remind people of another movie, ""Euro-Trip."" The movie falls apart as soon as the third of our main characters gets captured. The storyline goes out the window, as it just becomes insulting to the viewer. Events happen for no reason & just adds to the confusion of the movie. Throughout the movie, you'll be asking, ""What is that tattoo about? Who is that guy? Who are these people?"" Well, all these questions & more never get answered. The final insult comes at the end, when after our last main character ""saves"" a Japanese tourist while she is being tortured, she jumps in front of a train after seeing the ""torture"" done to her face.

The prelude is way too long and there is no story at all. The characters fall in every cliché possible and are just plain dumb. It wasn't even entertaining.

","After waiting for some time with much anticipation for the Tarantino/Roth horror film, ""Hostel"" finally made it's way to my local cinema. After an assembly of ridiculously bad horror previews, the film finally came up and I eased back in my chair. The film's first half or so was albeit, not horror in any way shape or form, and more so was a closer relative to a National Lampoon sex romp. The three main actors were thankfully enough, good at who and what they were trying to emulate: horny, college grads who want sex and drugs...but they were funny and occasionally kind of down to earth. <br/><br/>Eli Roth did a fair job of setting up the story, though i felt it took a little long for a horror film. As great a storyteller Miike is, and as much as Roth adores him, I would've figured the film to have an overall creepy quality, but alas no. The music was well done, especially when the horror comes crashing in, and the direction was pretty good, showing us a good amount of gore, and then a good amount for us to leave to our sick imaginations. <br/><br/>My only complaint about the film was the tiresome nudity and sex, teens will love it, as will college students, but it gets old fast. I never knew Roth relied on such frivolities to make a film move along, then again ""Cabin Fever"" did the exact same thing. <br/><br/>The latter half of the film was very good, and occasionally bordered on the awesome. I wish there was more gore, though there was some, and I was hoping to get more glimpses into the other rooms that lined the slaughterhouse. The best scenes were easily inside this ""factory"" and if the whole movie was set up faster for more time inside the ""farm,"" this movie would've been great, and not just good."

Thankfully we chose a matinée because this flick was definitely not worth full price admission. The tag-line ""The scariest American movie in a decade"" is way out in left field too. I can think of at least a dozen scarier and anyone who goes to see ""Hostel"" should be able to do the same. The gore is okay at best and the story is pitiful, as is the acting.

The last forty-five minutes are gore that goes past the extreme of Saw causing many patrons of theaters viewing this film to lose their lunch, similar to the nausea caused by Blair Witch Project. Quentin Tarantino truly did not make the film and his name is solely listed on the poster and advertisements to make people actually attend this picture. There are snuff films that do not take it to this level, and probably have better dialogue. The main influence from this film came from internet spam and idea of torture flicks; so they stuck to main influence without making much of a storyline or point. At least the violence of ""Munich,"" is backed-up with actual historical facts, rather than a fictional waste of garbage. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it for anyone, any age."

It would have been way less cliché if he heard her scream and just kept on driving. I know that I would never go back into that hell hole. There was a lot of comic relief in a movie that was supposed to be scary. Like the gang of kids? Who took that seriously? Who saw them bash in that guys head without laughing? Who didn't laugh when that guy was so psyched while asking ""should I do it quick? or slow?"" A lot of the gore was really stupid. The Asian chick's eye looked so fake.

This movie was grotesque for the sake of being grotesque. I cannot recall the last time where I was more disappointed in a movie that I paid money to see. $6 was not worth the torment that was watching this movie. I know that the horrible nature of the film is a point in itself, but I believe that the film makers forgot crucial elements of the film such as character development and a good , solid plot when they were thinking of horrendous ways to disgust the audience. Also, in one scene, the lens filter inexplicably changes between angles. This is a poorly done film by almost all accounts."

And I've learned a lesson, Eli Roth sucks at making horror movies. This movie was basically a less funny rehash of Euro trip for the first half or more, complete with nudity, sex, drug use and weird locals. Then it got really gory which is the only reason I'm giving it a 5 out of 10. I love gore, and this movie definitely didn't lack in that department. But where after seeing the previews I expected a gory, suspenseful, frightening horror movie, I got a crappy comedy with a whole lot of gore. This really could have been a good horror movie if it was scary in the least, but it wasn't. And don't get me started on the ending, once again Eli dropped the ball. It felt like Eli just took every character in the movie that had done Paxton wrong throughout and just dropped them straight in his path as easy an quickly as possible. And how convenient he finds his friends killer, cuts off exactly the same fingers he lost off the guy and kills him the same way the guy killed his friend. Stupid stupid stupid.

Traveling Europe, hooking up with some hot foreigner babes with ease for some romper stomper free reign frolic. I don't mind some fun but COME ON, have some debt or story or .... just SOMETHING here. No worry... no suspense... no creepiness, nothing.<br/><br/>Then finally when the ball get's rollin, (and only for a few minutes at that) even the supposed 'gross' or stomach churning points were like a warm flat opened can of coke. No fizzle, nothing! The effects of the, well lets just say the eye ball sequence were blatantly fake taking any fizzle of creepiness from it. Not to mention our 'injured' parties were running around like nothing had been done to them. Hardly a squint of pain to help you remember they'd been, well 'worked on'.<br/><br/>If at all anything good, the lead actor has a certain something and I believe he could show up in something more worthy of a chance. The camera work and even the basics of the direction were satisfactory however the script was just crap! They went out for a lil T & A to entice the youths while jumping the (I wanna be like cool like 'Saw'), bandwagon. ""Hey, lets put out a scary movie that sucks and hopefully make some money the first weekend with a bunch of hype before everyone actually realizes...this sucks!"".<br/><br/>Not to mention Quentin Tarantino's power meter dropping a couple of notches for putting his name on such a let down piece of shite.<br/><br/>So if your a 17 year old guy who's middle name is 'hormone' and you don't care about a film being smart enough to take you away to a good experience, then this might be your jar of Vaseline.

","I have to say that it's been quite a while since I've fallen for the hype surrounding a movie like this one. Unfortunately, I got caught up in the promises made by Hostle and was let down in the most disappointing way.<br/><br/>A perfect way to illustrate just how this film manages to fall so short of the mark is to compare it to the lame publicity stunt I had to bear witness to on opening night.<br/><br/>During the first remotely ""scary"" scene in the film an audience member simply leaned forward and fell to the floor, leaving his girlfriend to scream out for help. Was he so scared by the graphic violence on the screen that he passed out in horror? Were we witnessing what we had all heard was true... would paramedics actually have to be called to the theater? No, not at all.<br/><br/>The act was so transparent that it simply annoyed anyone who cared to notice. And the same thing can be said of the film itself. It's just another safe horror movie done by the numbers, dull and unoriginal, that simply pretends to be more than it is.<br/><br/>Hostle is no more shocking, scary or disturbing than anything you've seen before. And much like it's failed publicity stunt, this film deserves to be ignored."
"madhatter241124","3","3","6","7 January 2006"," That's it?
","I saw all these trailers that were promising gore and blood and horrible unspeakable acts that were going to happen in this movie. I was excited thinking if they put a decent story behind what they are promising than who knows this could turn into a great movie. I eagerly awaited Hostel's release and I went to see it opening day. After all was said and done I wondered is that it? Its over? Was there blood? Yes. And there were several scenes of torture also as promised. However Hostel fell short in my mind for several reasons First off, my biggest problem was the entire hook that this movie was wrapped around. Its gore. Yes it was present but the commercials made this movie out to be so graphic that if you're a tad bit squeamish don't go see it. I know that the type of people that the premise of this movie appeals to...I am the type of people and the commercials did a good job to really build up that type of person's interest. But when push came to shove frankly I wasn't impressed it was just too little from a filmed that promised too much. There are things in movies that make me cringe its not like it is a hard task or anything. But Hostel didn't make me want to cringe or feel queasy or any of that. My second problem was Eli Roth's laughable directing style. Roth really needs to decide whether he wants to direct horrors or comedies as he falls into the same problem that he got into with Cabin Fever in that he tries to mix the genres. The problem is that at some parts of the movie you're not sure if you should scream or laugh. Since you can't decide you don't do either and you aren't terrified or amused and the scene is wasted. Roth has great directing ability but he needs to focus on a genre. The movie does have its good points. The women are very very beautiful in this movie. Also the storyline while thin could be worse I suppose. It was frighting because in theory it could happen and thats about the only terror Hostel had as it was hardly suspenseful. Eli Roth does throw in some good laughs as well as a couple brutally graphic scenes, albeit far from what the film was told to deliver. In the end, Hostel just doesn't satisfy. I left the theater wishing I would have either had a richer plot or more gore. Either would have sufficed. To describe it best Hostel is much like an amateur sniper. The beginning take a long time aiming up for a perfect shot, such a long time that one gets impatient, and when that shot finally comes it seems rushed and as a result misses its mark entirely. If you want to see gore then save your money and rent or buy Saw 2 when it's released on DVD. Saw 2 is far superior in every way. (I.e. gore, plot, ending, acting, directing) Where as Hostel falls just short on every single promise it made and every thing a horror movie should include. If you're expecting to see buckets of blood you'll see it but you won't see how it got there and to me thats the main point. Don't see Hostel if you want to see a gory movie, or a good horror movie, or high hopes. If you don't go into it with any of these desires you may leave happy, otherwise you'll just leave unfulfilled."

Sure, the gore was good and it had an interesting concept, but the first hour totally ruins that.<br/><br/>I do not go to see a horror movie to see sex. That kind of ruins it. I do realize that the only reason they were in this town was for sex, but it wasn't necessary to show it.<br/><br/>Like I said, the gore was good. That's what bumped my vote up to a 2. I was a little upset that they cut away half the time. They will probably show this on an unrated DVD, but there's no telling how much sex will be in that version. That fact also hurt my vote.<br/><br/>I was just soo let down. I mean... Tarantino was attached. What went wrong? I didn't expect it to be perfect because I've seen Cabin Fever and didn't expect much from Eli Roth, but Tarantino was there too! My guess is that the first half of the film was Roth and the second half was Tarantino.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to wait until the unrated version is out on DVD."

","This really isn't your typical horror movie where some crazy maniac chases you with a axe or chainsaw, it isn't a movie where some stupid little doll,munchkin,mythical creature or space alien chases,shoots,eats or threatens to destroy you.Over the years those movies have become general and run of the mill. What this movie is, is a disturbing, unnerving, psychological thriller that as you watch it, It feeds off the real fears and horrors of the real world.A horror that can actually happen to you.When you watch a slasher movie,you already know that its fake and a story made up for Hollywood.But as this movie shows, an ordinary average college aged person, much like you and I, can indeed fall victim to this type of scenario, and in fact is possible in todays greedy money hungry world where if you have enough cash you can pretty much do anything you please."

I didn't know enough about them to form an opinion on whether or not I liked them.<br/><br/>The blonde-haired kid wants to be a WRITER and has ASTHMA.

The other guy is TALLER and OLDER and FROM ICELAND and has a KID.<br/><br/>All this is is a suspense thriller which turns into a revenge movie and is packaged as a horror movie.<br/><br/>The plot is largely stolen from that ""Mutilated Bride"" urban legend: http://www.snopes.com/weddings/horrors/shanghai.asp <br/><br/>There were a couple stupid movie clichés used, like: 1. Shock doesn't exist. If you have two fingers amputated, the blood loss will just make you act like you have a beer hangover.<br/><br/>2. A guy who's just had his fingers amputated can defeat several larger men who probably have had prior military training because HE GETS THE DROP ON THEM.<br/><br/>But all faults aside, this movie could have been a lot worse... with the slow start and the scene where the girl's toe is cut off (off-camera) I was expecting most of the film to have that lame movie cop-out violence, and it didn't.<br/><br/>So yeah, I think it was worth the ticket price."

"zamfir_the_great","4","3","6","6 January 2006"," I'm a hardened violent-film goer...
","...and this one was hard for me to put into words exactly what disturbed me the most about this. In terms of positives, this is a survival movie, if you want to call it that, and the payback scenes had me and the rest of the audience cheering for the evil bastards' comeuppance. Having said that, though, the shock value of this movie is, especially for an R movie, off the charts. This really should have been NC-17, but I think Tarantino's involvement with this got it changed to an R. And this is a HARD R, probably the hardest R I've ever seen, and I see all the violent movies. I'm pretty jaded when it comes to this stuff, but this was gruesome in a way that has not been shown in American movie theaters yet. If this had come out in 1993, before anyone other than cult followers' of Taratino knowledge of Reservoir Dogs, this movie would probably have been NC-17 or straight to video. If this movie had come out 20 years ago, it probably would not have been made in this country, or it would be considered borderline snuff.<br/><br/>I'm sure most other reviews will either be shocked and revolted by it or will be the hardcore blood marks who loved it. I'm leaning more toward the shocked, and possibly revolted. I thought something like Pulp Fiction or RD, though having its moments of ultra-violence, had an artistic redemptive quality about it. I admit that this movie, once you can recover your stomach from the butchery (NOT an easy task)does a good job of getting you to root for the primary protagonist.<br/><br/>The use of female lures for these deathtraps was especially notable, as Natalya's mocking laugh as Paxon gets captured is replayed at the very end of the credits - it presses a lot of buttons there. It certainly makes you think twice about visiting any former Warsaw Pact countries, for fear you might wake up (if you're lucky) in a bathtub filled with ice, leaving you reading a sign that said your kidneys have been removed because the hottie you were flirting with is paid by the Russian mob to slip you a mickey. This movie is an urban legend on crack, steroids, and every other drug used in a Tarantino film.<br/><br/>I am still struggling to adequately describe this movie. I shall probably edit this at some point, but for now, I will close by saying the following: this movie does not push the envelope; it obliterates it."
"poolandrews","7","4","10","22 November 2007"," Top quality gore film, I liked it & bugger all the politically correct out there...
","Hostel starts in Amsterdam where three friends, two Americans named Paxton (Jay Hernandez) & Josh (Derek Richardson) plus an Icelandic guy named Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), are backpacking looking to travel across Europe getting laid by pretty girls, to party & to smoke some drugs. At the hostel where they are staying they meet Alex (Lubomir Bukovy) who tells them of a youth hostel in Bratislava in Slovakia where there are plenty of young beautiful girls who love Americans, the next day & the three friends travel there by train. They meet two girls, Natayla (Barbara Nedelijakova) & Svetlana (Jana Kaderabkova), who show them all a good time at a disco. The next morning & Oli has disappeared without leaving a message, then soon after Josh disappears leaving just Paxton to figure things out. He eventually discovers the gruesome truth...<br/><br/>Written, co-produced & directed by Eli Roth I wasn't sure what to expect going into Hostel, I mean I hated his previous film the horror comedy Cabin Fever (2002) & it seems to get a lot of criticism from people saying it's a pointless film filled with nudity & gore. But never let it be said I don't give a film a chance & I went into Hostel with an open mind, in the end I'm glad I spent the time watching Hostel because I have to say I really rather liked it. The script by Roth takes it's time to get going, in fact the first hour is almost total exposition with Roth setting the situation up & fleshing out the character's which makes the final 30 blood soaked minutes of carnage even more satisfying & actually have some meaning. The final third of Hostel is really intense & gory film-making with bags of tension that the films critics seem to overlook, in fact I think the PC brigade dislike & attack Hostel so much because it is so effective & is a downright decent, if admittedly brutal & gory, horror film. Some of the twists & turns are a little hard to swallow but that only serves to reinforce the fact that Hostel is pure fantasy which is also something the idiotic PC brigade conveniently seem to forget. I liked it & I'm not ashamed to admit it, I liked all the nudity & sex, I liked the drug taking, I liked the brutality, I loved the gore & all those frigid members of the PC brigade can stick that in their pipe & smoke it! Interestingly no-one is actually shown being killed on screen in the slaughterhouse torture scenes yet whenever Paxton is shown to kill someone it is seen.<br/><br/>Director Roth was apparently heavily influenced by executive producer Quentin Tarantino & that's no bad thing, there are some truly horrific scenes in Hostel. I loved the atmosphere as well, the scene when Josh wakes up in the room almost naked tied to a chair & he can only make out a light & two tables full of scissors, scalpels, medical equipment & knifes is very chilling & unsettling. Imagine being in Josh's position? There is some heavy duty gore but surprisingly not that much actual on screen violence, someone tries to walk with the backs of their ankles cut open, someone gets a drill poked into their body, fingers are graphically severed, legs are sliced off with chainsaws, someone commits suicide by jumping in front of a train (a really juicy sound effect as well), there are shots of someone with their chest cut open, there's loads of blood with over 150 gallons of the stuff being used to make the film, severed heads & limbs strewn about the place, someone is shot through the head, there's a couple of slashed throats & my favourite scene when a girl is seen with her eyeball hanging out of it's socket by some veins & Paxton cuts it off with a pair of scissors. The special make-up effects by KNB are top notch, very gory & very impressive.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $4,500,000 & making over 20 million on it's opening weekend Hostel is well made with great special effects & great production values. Although not set there Hostel was filmed mostly in the Czech Republic. Apparently Hostel was written, made & released theatrically all within 12 months which is very quick. The acting is alright from an unknown cast, extreme Japanese director Takashi Miike has a small cameo as a Japanese businessman who Paxton ask's what it's like inside.<br/><br/>Hostel is a great film in my opinion, I liked it a lot, I liked it excessiveness & gore & gratuitous nudity. Despite a slow first half when it gets going this is a great horror flick that is pretty intense at times. It's also nice to see a horror film cause some debate, controversy & extreme opinion again. Followed by Hostel: Part II (2007)."

","OK, maybe I shouldn't have given it a 1 rating. But considering the fact that we walked out of the theater after an hour into the film should say something.

This movie got so much hype about being scary, gruesome, ""the paramedics were called for test audiences"" Blah, blah, blah. Hype, all made up hype. A bunch of B.S. to promote a movie. Within the hour that we watched there was only one small ""torture"" sequence which involved them showing a drill being picked up, then hearing a man screaming, then showing a bloody drill. Ohhhh scary. The audience actually laughed. It was pathetic. My friends who actually stayed for the movie called me after to tell me that I was smart for leaving. Don't waste your time or money.

","Saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival and got what i expected. Eli Roth has the ability to agitate a viewer and evoke a turn-away response with some of the anticipated visuals. The premise behind the movie was also very disturbing, and it is too bad Mr. Roth could not elaborate on this more in the film. All in all, I thought this film was well done for what it is, a B-movie. My only criticism was the ending of the film, which Mr. Roth did so well with 'Cabin Fever'. This film is not for everyone, nor should it be. It is for people who like to have their senses twinged a bit from the other disturbing films such as 'Herbie: The Love Bug' as remarked by the beautiful co-star of the film during the Q&A. Roth-On."
"hwentworth23","8","4","10","26 September 2005"," Roth is getting better
","I didn't like Cabin Fever much, too jokey, too many half wit characters and a really uneven tone. Hostel is a real improvement. Roth has learned how to pace things better (seems a little too slowly for some of the posters here) and he pitches a tone of dread that slowly works into menace that then gets into hysterical terror. Also, a better story (not super original but not too derivative) and a solid cast. The first act sets up the characters nicely, without over- explaining or weighing them down with irrelevant back story. When it comes, the gore is intense but you could say not gratuitous. If someone paid $25k to kill me, I'd imagine they'd want to savour it and make it as painful as possible. Roth actually deserves props for holding back - he teased us with the toe severing of the 1st Asian woman but restrained himself. Then when it's appropriate, the splatter brakes are removed and anything goes. Tarantino-esquire? Paxton going back to rescue the Japanese woman is straight out of Zed's pawnshop. But that crazy gungho American torturer was in a league of his own. One false note: you can justify the 2 evil women being perfectly placed for vengeance but throwing in Alexei was a bit much."

First- Slovakia is Middle-Europe (here is also located geographical middle of Europe...)I live in Slovakia- Bratislava. It's city with about 500 000 inhabitants, skyscrapers, airport, huge shopping centers, cinemas, churches, theaters, schools, offices, corporations producing high-end products, traffic jams and many others- like any other ordinary city and it absolutely doesn't look like barely-electrified medieval settlement full of blood, dirt, sluts and robbing-hungry-thiefchildrens... BTW when you look closer on the scene when guys are getting of the train and looking around dirty train station you should notice the name of the station- Praha Poricany- I think it testifies about something..... BTW2 (It was really hard to find such exemplar of an ancient TV from Hostel lobby- it can be rarely located in few museums) The problem is that if someone who has never been here see such movie it will persuade him that this is the way people live there and he will pray not ever end up in here or he came here with hundred dollars in pocket in belief that he will find here 'the movie' and when he leaves plane he will be many more than surprised....

I won't go into spoilers but this film pretty much fails on every single level and it is not even remotely scary. I can't believe that this film has been compared to SAW for goriness - it doesn't even compared and the storyline in this makes Saw look like Citizen Kane.<br/><br/>Rarely do I ever regret watching a film, no matter how bad, but I certainly regret wasting 94 odd minutes of my life on this crud.<br/><br/>I can hardly believe that a sequel is being made for this!"

","All the reviewers missed the whole point of this movie. They say it is misogynistic and degrading to woman. However, after I read an interview of the director it became clear that the movie is the complete opposite of that! Our tourists in this movie are drawn to the hostel because they want to exploit the poor women who are desperate. Now a lot of people say could not sympathize with the characters. Well thats the whole point! They are not sympathetic characters! As Barbara says, now you are my Bitch now! It's like all the woman in the world who have been exploited are getting their just revenge on our characters. In a way that's why a lot of guys don't like it! It's a little too close for comfort. I see some people complain that they used a real European country as the setting. Of course IMO that just makes it more creepy since although Slovakia is a remote country that many Americans have never visited, it does exist! It's just like a haunted house that you remember when you were a kid. If it was some imaginary country, you could dismiss as not really existing. Now the same people are complaining about the unreal plot here when they believe perfectly in the Chucky Doll or Freddy appearing in your dreams.<br/><br/>I would say this is more like a European movie since the characters are not acting over the top like Robert Denero or Joe Peschi.

"okami_ito","1","3","7","14 March 2006"," From the people that brought you Guantanamo Bay!
","Frequent viewers of U.S. American movie-productions are aware of the fact that most American citizens live in constant fear of the fact, that there are foreign countries on their globe. Those of them who are bold enough to travel those dangerous territories have the wildest stories to tell. ""Hostel"" is one of them. It's the kind of yarn, that's presented from little boys with a lifetime experience of TV an video-watching for those who are eager to be told the same boring crap over and over again if only their regularly dish is spiced with some extra gory details. The idea of ""Hostel"" is as simple as its protagonists: Somewhere outside of the United States of America there is a very strange area. It's called Europe. Most of the time it's like a mixture of Las Vegas and Disney World but if you stretch it too hard there are dangers waiting there for you beyond your lamest imagination.<br/><br/>The two heroes of ""Hostel"" are backpackers who want to get laid. They want to have sex with European women. So they travel to Slowenia, because someone in Amsterdam told them that they will find those women there. So they travel there. (You wonder why it's taking me so long to tell this? Hey i'm talking about 60 % of the story!) On their way to Slowenia they discover that some natives eat with their hands. Creepy isn't it? After that (and after the audience is watching a real bad ""Porkys""-Rip Off for about an eternity) they finally reach the destination of their dreams. A ""hostel"" that is managed like a swinger club. They are seduced by beautiful Slovenian women, dressed like prostitutes. These women are not only vile, they are evil! They lure our innocent heroes to a place where rich people can live out their sadistic fantasies by torturing people for a fee. ( I bet if such a place would really exist, the people who'd go there would have A LOT more fantasies than Elli Roth, the ""director/writer"" of that ""movie""). I think i'm not ""spoiling"" anyones viewing pleasure by telling that our heroes will find themselves captured in this torture theme-park, ready to be, well, tortured. <br/><br/>When you watch this movie in a cinema, like i did, you sense a change in the audience at this point. Finally after one hour of lame sex jokes and stupid dialog the movie seems to be going somewhere. Behind me i could hear some heavy breathing. So i was getting a little curious myself because i really like violent, disturbing movies. Well, it takes at least a little fantasy and visual imagination to make a torture scene in a cheap movie work. Roth likes to brag about ""pleasing"" even ""hardcore horror-fans"" or ""breaking boundaries"" with his fairy tale and he's not ashamed to name masters like Chan-wook Park as a reference but believe me: ""Hostel"" does not deliver! It's not even worth a laugh. After some really boring torture scenes, there are some badly staged escape-scenes and some totally illogical revenge-scenes thrown in for good measure. <br/><br/>So a movie that, in the hands of a more talented young director (f.e. Alexandre Aja) , could have been at least cheap fun turns out to be just...cheap. And stupid. And just for your information, college boys: the official language in Slowenia, the Czech Republik and the Netherlands isn't German. If it would be, the Germans would have won world war II. And that is (in opposite of ""Hostel"") a real terrifying idea.<br/><br/>Watch the much more terrifying ""Wolf Creek"" or the brilliant ""The Descent"" instead of wasting precious time with juvenile babble."
"Coventry","6","3","7","11 March 2006"," Bring out the East-European Gimps...
","""Hostel"" only just got released and it's already a bit overrated. Well...over-hyped might be a better term to use, as Eli Roth's follow-up to the crappy ""Cabin Fever"" is an overall intense horror flick and it definitely reaches its basic goal; which is to disgust and even shock younger audiences. Eli Roth and producer Quinten Tarantino aren't exactly known for their subtlety and thus ""Hostel"" is quite a sick and unhinged movie that leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination. Not even during the bloodless first half hour, when numerous beautiful girls go topless and the film looks an awful lot like vulgar teen-comedies such as ""American Pie"" or ""Road Trip""! Two Americans and an Icelander, all driven by their hormones, travel through Europe with only sex and soft drugs on their minds. After a disappointing party in Amsterdam, a fellow stoner advises them to travel further east where the girls are stunningly beautifully and  oh yes  very willing. The hostel in Slovakia starts out as a dream location but, soon after, the horny boys one by one get kidnapped and gruesomely tortured in a ramshackle old factory. The idea and structure behind the torture-network isn't particularly original or innovating, but since it's the only form of depth and plotting in the film's entire script, I won't be the one ruining it for you already (although other reviewers obviously have no problem with that...). Admittedly you have to be a little sick in the head, but I really enjoyed the extended and genuinely sadistic torture sequences and the devices looked creepy. Eli Roth will probably never be a great filmmaker, but his directing skills have seemly improved since ""Cabin Fever"", as there are some stylish camera angles and a nifty use of locations. The almighty Tarantino's influence is clearly detectable in smaller aspects, like twisted gags and clever references towards other movies (like his own masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction""). The ending is really good and the film once more proves that ordinary CHILDREN are the most petrifying creatures on the planet! Worth seeing."

","Me and my friends agreed that when someone ask us what was the last movie that we saw we would say it was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Simply, because Hostel can't be considered a movie, it lacks the originality, it lacks the script and it lacks the desire to be a good horror movie. The sound is just fatal you can't compare it to Hitchcock's development of the plot in any manner. I am a male and of course I enjoyed the female mammary parts exposure which averaged 5 pairs a minute. Of course the movie is grotesque but that is not nearly close to be a horror movie. The grotesque element is one the director may use in the movie but not rely to actually be the movie. As one of the early post says if you want grotesque go to an emergency room. Saw I & II are pieces of art compared to Hostel. So if you are looking forward to Hostel to go over your expectations it is not going to. Please save your money if you haven't already waste it. And if you already did it like me say the last movie you actually saw wasn't hostel. Please say you saw another movie not this one, you'll make a fool out of yourself.

While there is gore, some of the most graphic I've seen in a US film to date (J-Horror still tops it), the most graphic scenes are the ones left up to your imagination... the film cuts away at the perfect moment several times in the film, especially early on, letting the audience's suspense grow.<br/><br/>Then what's even more suspenseful is how long it takes for some of the torture scenes to be completed... you keep waiting for it to be over and it doesn't stop... culminating in what will forever be known as ""the eyeball scene"" which puts tremendous strain on your nerves and when over, is libel to make anyone with buttered popcorn bolt for the bathrooms to vomit.<br/><br/>But all the editing choices, cinematography and horror homages aside, Hostel is most importantly a movie with a message. Yes, the movie does have a message and this is why the film is and should be loved by critics. The film explains, in the best way possible, through example and a ""walk a mile in their shoes"" mentality to show the ironic reciprocity of how Americans can objectify stereotypical Europeans, especially women, and how those same stereotypes can fall on Americans and come back to bite them in the ass.<br/><br/>As odd as it sounds, this film will have an effect on audiences that is very similar to the one that Crash did. This film will make you question not only your sense of sanity or your preconceptions of what is ""too much"" but it shines a light on the dark underbelly not only of Eastern Europe, but shows that the ""Ugly American"" label is appropriate now more than ever.<br/><br/>If you are planning on seeing this movie and read this review, do me a favor and when you leave this film, stop and, with what you just watched fresh in your memory, think about this: If you think the bad guys and girls in the film are bad, what does that say about someone who paid to watch a movie about torture for 95 minutes? Hm? Great Movie. Great Film. Great Message.<br/><br/>Kudos to you Eli Roth... kudos."

The fact that some of things happening in the film are plausible is the only that is scary about it. There is gore but nothing that would make viewers of 'The Passion of the Christ' or either 'Saw' or 'Saw II' cringe. The attraction that this film has is horror, but that is not the focus of the movie until a good hour into it. Three males go to Europe to have fun, and that is exactly what they do. Mr. Roth, the director, has been generous with shots of half-naked women and rectums. Not to mentioned people smoking weed, a content of sex, the sexual references, and horrible language. This film is definitely not for young children. The focus of the first half of the film is sex. I for one did not go to the theater to see a porno. Parents beware."

The fates of some of these characters is pretty brutal and made worse by the fact that you care (unlike other films in this genre). Despite my commitment to watch the whole film, there is still a five second scene where my eyes shut all on their own (but I could imagine thanks to the audience what had been on the screen). I am glad I attended this during the day, as I was drained, disturbed and shaken by this film. As another reviewer said, the scary thing about this movie is that it is not about ravenous aliens from space, but a scenario that could believably happen (if not now, in the near future). My hat is off to the director!! Once this movie hits theaters(possibly in November according to Eli) run don't walk to see this film. And remember, take two friends!!!!"

","Hostel was one of those movies that came out in the early to mid 2000's and ushered in the ""torture porn"" genre. You know the type of movie. The one that is heavy on gore and seeing people be tortured on screen but is light on story, suspense or anything good? It used to be this is what lazy filmmakers would put forth when they didn't have a decent story. They'd just throw a lot of blood at the project and people would go see it. But now it's a genre all to itself.<br/><br/>There is nothing worth seeing in this movie. At all. It uses the most cliche of characters, namely a bunch of douche-bros go to a small village in Eastern Europe where the women are hot and eager to do them. And they do. But to quote an old meme, it's a trap and they're all captured and taken to a place where rich people pay lots of money to torture and kill innocents. I think it's supposed to be a commentary on the fragility of life and how in today's world anything can be bought and sold for a price. Or I would think that somebody at some point has tried to make that comment in defense of this movie. It was crap then and it's crap now. This movie exists only to show blood and guts on the screen.<br/><br/>And that's really it. There's no story, the characters are unlikable and Eli Roth decided if he couldn't make a good movie at least make one with lots of blood so people would confuse it with horror and want to see it.<br/><br/>But it made money and spawned two sequels. Each of which was worse than the one before it."

repellant on the inside.<br/><br/>The concept of big business being behind the spate of missing people is also a really interesting idea although it lacks common sense that they'd pick middle class travellers as too many people might start asking questions.

","Everyone else has already mentioned the drawn out intro, the lack of character development, the bland characters, and the senseless plot. I will not continue to harp on those points. What really took me out of this movie within it's meatier bits are the stupid antics of the survivor. Movies are no stranger to the idea of someone surviving massive blood loss, but most make some attempt to couch this in reality (unless it's the villain), and normally I wouldn't much care. This movie shoves it in your face.<br/><br/>He has his hand sliced open with a chainsaw (not to mention the other wounds), and at no point does he bandage or cauterize or even disinfect the wound in some way. The entire time I was waiting for him to at least get dizzy from it, but he runs around the rest of the film completely fine. He winces when he puts on gloves, but that's about it. And he can't even curl his ""missing"" fingers into the palm in later scenes.<br/><br/>He miraculously makes it to a car undetected, but then runs back to save Kana, only to cut off her detached eye. A) Going back in was a ridiculous decision, and it makes no sense that they got out again just as easily. B) A doctor could have saved the eye as long as the optic nerve wasn't severed, you idiot! But it's fine because they somehow miraculously run over the scouters, only to ditch the car instead of having a car chase. Like hmm, maybe a hospital or a police precinct in another town would be a good idea? At least when you hit Germany, I mean, sepsis, anyone? But no, revenge!<br/><br/>Even though her injuries aren't that bad, Kana kills herself, and yet the train keeps running. Even if the city was completely lawless, police would've stopped the train at least long enough to identify the body. I mean someone's got to clean it up. Can't be driving a bloody train over country lines.<br/><br/>This film asks you to suspend your disbelief over and over throughout, and while I normally have a large tolerance for that, but this is ridiculous. Not in an over-the-top fun thrill ride sort of way, but in a nagging, 'You are watching a terrible fake movie,' sort of way. The more I think about it, the lower the rating gets!"

","The initial setting of this film left me outraged. Slovakia as a place of beautiful and sexually available girls because of deficit men? Seriously? What war? They have cellphones so The World War 2 was ages ago! And while the Slovak (/Czech/Polish/Ukraine/...) women seem better looking (than, let's say, British ones), it's only because they are ""normal"" (that's the golden rule - the closer you are to being average and balanced, the ""better"" you look). And normal women tend to have normal lives (high school, boyfriends, university/polytechnic, marriage, two children, career, grandchildren, retirement). I'm not from Slovakia myself but I have a lot of friends and colleagues from there and I always liked that country (as a matter of fact, we were one nation not so long ago). Don't tell me that it's ""just a fiction"". How would Americans like it if we made such a stupid, untrue, and slandering film about their own country?<br/><br/>However, as the plot progressed, I've realized that the film isn't about Slovakia and Slovaks. The whole scam is ran by an international gang ran by Russians, which is entirely plausible. So is the police which is easily bribed and more likely to believe a word of a local over that of an American sex-tourist. From that point on, the Slovakia and it's inhabitants became more of a background. As a matter of fact, they never had any kind of a prominent role in the story. The film made quite well around the world but trust me, it's considered highly controversial in our countries (CZ and SK)."

","By the end I was ashamed that I actually contributed money to this terrible 'B' movie trying to pose as a horror film. 'Cabin Fever,' Eli Roth's first movie was a pretty good indie movie, but a bit over the top gore, for my taste, but was a decent starting point for a director. Considering he took that credit, got a bigger budget and used it to make a trite, plot less, gore porno is just offensive to the intelligence of movie goers. This isn't even a movie. All it is is a porno for sociopaths. It's pretty much the movie from the '80s 'Faces of Death,' that was essentially a documentary of what people look like when they're dead and kids would rent it as, like, a dare because it was really gross. Had no plot, was just gore and grossness. There isn't much to say about it since there is no story. It's just, yawn, we've heard it a million times, two college guys go to Europe, do drugs in Amsterdam and find out about this ""awesome"" place they should go in some screwed up, poor part of Europe that no one would ever go. They show up, and, of course, the girls are always naked and have sex with them. Surprise, everyone is being paid off to bring in young kids so psycho rich guys can torture them...the end. Seriously. That's the plot and the entirety of the story. Of course, once they get all of that story out of the way, they just cut up kids in gross and unthinkable ways. Anyway, I have zero respect for anyone who could possibly enjoy this film. And Eli Roth is a sensationalism hack who plays on people's curiosity to sell tickets. I'm sure his mother is very proud. He probably sells babies on the black market, too."

","By the dawn of the 21st century, there had been a number of very low budgeted films (""Saw"", ""Cube"", to name but two) who were, despite all shortcomings, able to breathe some fresh wind into the stagnant genre of splatter-horror. ""Hostel"" was one of those films but, considering that both ""Saw"" and ""Cube"" had their moments of brilliance, I could not for the life of me say what the ""Hostel""-hype was all about. <br/><br/>The story of American students travelling Europe – oblivious that Europe isn't a country and that there are differences between Bratislava, Amsterdam and Paris – in search for the ultimate joyride, is well-worn. In ""Hostel"", our protagonists fall in with a ring of gangsters running what can best be described as a ""snuff-club"", where rich patrons pay heft amounts to live out their murderous fantasies. <br/><br/>""Hostel"" sure has its moments, mainly those concerning themselves with realistically simulated tortures and killings, but that's all ""Hostel"" got running for it. I'm not going to talk about uncharismatic lead actors, lack of artistic talents or the pretentious style of directing; I want to talk about bloopers. <br/><br/>See, I'm not a very bright viewer and am virtually blind to things like errors, bloopers and inconsistencies. No, I never noticed that Charlton Heston was wearing his wrist watch in 'Ben Hur'. I'm completely oblivious and I don't even care – until it comes to the issue of ""Hostel"":<br/><br/>The film is riddled with errors to such an extent that after about 40 minutes I asked myself say, ""dude, is this a joke""? Yes, partly it was. I remember director Roth explain that the constantly changing make-up of the Japanese girl in virtually every shot was intended because he wanted to do something to the audience – not sure what the purpose was because eventually my brain turned off to the rambling, having too often heard shoddy workmanship disguised as artistic innovation. <br/><br/>So how did this c-grade production ever become ""cult"" or hyped in the first place? Well, it would probably never have seen the cinematic light of day if it hadn't come with the over-sized headline screaming: ""presented by Quentin Tarantino"" and to Tarantino fans it seems to be all gold that shines (or rather has the moniker ""presented by Quentin Tarantino"").<br/><br/>I'd give it 2 points from 10 for a couple of the gore effects but that's where the sympathy stops."

The story is weak, the writing is weak, the characters are weak, and the idea itself isn't THAT interesting to stand on its own feet.<br/><br/>First off, I do understand that Eli Roth tried to do something a little layered, by setting the whole first half of the film in what seems to be the COMPLETE opposite of a horror film, and trying to establish parallels between the two halves. Problem is, the first part is so shallow, so forced and so dumbly crafted that the only thing it produces is boredom and annoyance. The characters remain perfectly flat and bi-dimensional all the way through, so pretty much ALL of the desired effect is gone out of the window.<br/><br/>Second, the proper ""horror"" half of the film is nothing new. Really, folks, this one came AFTER Saw; there's no ground being broken here, with the torture and the graphic violence. At least it doesn't even pretend to say anything deep or thoughtful, so no worries in THAT department. But the whole thing just comes across as ridiculous and satisfying. If the intention was to keep away from ""torture porn"", the film actually handles it quite well for a while, but then we get a completely idiotic, LONG shot of the main character cutting out a girl's gouged out eyeball. It's like the film gave up all hopes of being gripping and disturbing, and went straight into ""X-Treme Looney Tunes"" territory once and for all. And what comes next is even worse. At least it gets sort of exciting towards the very end, but the aftertaste is horrible: the empty feeling of having wasted so much time in such fickle, fake pleasure.<br/><br/>At least you can draw parallels between the film's both halves and US, the audience; in one hand, it seems like the Hungarian red light district seems like a much more satisfying and life-enriching experience than this film; and on the other hand, we OURSELVES are the victims of cinematographic torture, except we are the ones paying for it.<br/><br/>At least I didn't pay for it."

"Falconeer","8","2","4","15 December 2009"," Ridiculously under-appreciated film
","I waited 5 years to see this, but I'm glad I finally did. I can honestly say that most critiques of this film are inaccurate and unfair. ""Hostel"" is an intense and extremely well-made modern horror film. Comments that ""the action"" doesn't begin until after an hour, were obviously written by viewers with infantile attention spans, and video game addicts. The calm before the storm is known as tension building, or ""suspense."" ""Hostel"" begins to get creepy almost immediately, before the guys even leave Amsterdam, when the Slovakian guy makes the comment about being able to do anything to the girls from this remote village. By the time Paxton and his traveling companions arrive in Slovakia, it is already obvious that what will follow will be something very bizarre and terrifying. Director Eli Roth has obviously learned a lot from, not only classic horror films, but also foreign film, as he takes the familiar direction of the slower, more suspenseful style of his Euro counterparts. Beautiful and strange little touches like the murderous children, and the ambiguous suggestions of one main characters sexuality also lend this one a definite Euro feel. Those that commented on the amount of nudity and sex in the film must have led very sheltered lives, never seeing a foreign film. The nudity is very brief, and only occurs at the beginning. The abandoned building where the torture/killings take place is truly brilliant in all it's dirty and bloody splendor, and the violence is realistic, shocking and disturbing. Anyone offended or sickened by said images should have done a bit of research before looking at the film, and known enough to steer clear of it. But no, they wanted to see it, just so they could rip it apart and call it ""sick."" These same people paid to see it; what does that make them? Hypocrites. ""Hostel"" cleverly lulls the viewer into a false sense of security with an intentional light mood. The beginning portion of the film utilizes bright colors and upbeat music. The second portion sees the colors washing away, along with the light feeling. Halfway through ""Hostel"" observant viewers will notice that the color is gone completely, leaving only shades of black, brown and gray, with the only real color being the red of the gallons of blood being spilled. The harshest critics should watch this one again only this time they might want to switch their brains on, and maybe they will see all the little nuances and symbolism that make ""Hostel"" an intelligent, classic horror film. The thing that places ""Hostel"" in a different league from similar films like ""Saw,"" is the suggestion of evil on such a grand scale. While ""Saw"" dealt with the anger and vengeance of one man, ""Hostel"" suggests a world where an entire village might be in on the conspiracy of murdering innocents, and not even for some moral or spiritual reason; but rather these people are in it for nothing more than financial gain. ""Hostel"" suggests an evil and an inherent corruption, an immorality on such a large scale, that the film can hardly fail at being one of the most evil and disturbing films of our time. As a horror film, therefore, ""Hostel"" succeeds and surpasses all other imitators."

","Hostel is basically an attempt to garner attention from college-grade students, and to be a party movie that turns into a horror movie. The problem is that it fails in pretty much every facet of this.

This movie leans towards off-base clichés and the nudity really just is there because, well... it's nudity. It's supposed to create an atmosphere of the ""perfect road trip"" for American teenagers, but due to its lack of integrity, dialogue, and acting, it's just a thoroughly unconvincing pile of garbage that has boobs in it.<br/><br/>As for the horror aspect, it too is pretty lame.

"croutonsofdeath","3","2","4","11 November 2009"," Torture with no edge, suspense, or horror.
","A certain phrase has been slung around in popular culture ever since the appearance of the Saw series, and that phrase is ""Torture Porn."" The idea behind 'Torture Porn' being a movie or story that deals with the torture of human beings with no rhyme or reason other than to illicit a sick form of pleasure to a certain audience. I've never liked the term ""Torture porn"" because I certainly got no pleasure in what I saw in the Saw movie, even if the first one is one of my favourite suspense/horror movies, but that's something entirely different. So what about Hostel, the other big name ""Torture porn"" flick? Well, although there are certain sights on display that did illicit pleasure mainly in the form of various beautiful women but that didn't really have anything to do with the torture, so I'm already straying away from calling this ""Torture porn."" But unlike Saw, there is no rhyme or reason here, so if there is a movie out of the two that deserves that title, it is Hostel.<br/><br/>Hostel is not a good movie. The torture isn't scary as there's no tension to it. A lot of guts are spilled here and there are some painful looking scenes, but somehow Eli Roth was able to take the pain or horror out of these scenes and the only groans they got from me weren't in disgust, they were of boredom. To make something like this work as horror, it has to be tense, suspenseful, and most of all, have an edge that makes it scary instead of repulsive. Hostel can't do any of this, the only repulsion the film brings is the fact that it's yawn inducing because of how boring it is. The plot is muddled and confused and it seems to be telling two different stories - one story from an American Pie movie and the other from a wanna-be Guinea Pig horror film. Neither work, I suppose the ""American Pie"" section works a little bit only because there is some nice nudity, but it still comes off as idiocy.<br/><br/>In the end, there's nothing here for anyone really. Its too tame and lacking in edge to please those few, sick depraved individuals that DO get off on movies like this, and it lacks the suspense and edginess required to make it scary for folks like me who want a few thrills and chills from their 'horror.' And even the part that tries to be a sex comedy doesn't really work either. Hostel is just a stupid movie with practically no appeal, no talent. I only give this a 3 because a 3 is a rather curvy number and the curves are really the only positive to this film."

","I was so close to not watching this film because of the comments here, but I'm so glad I did, this is the first comment I've made on IMDb, because I had to tell everyone who hasn't seen this film that this is NOTHING like a conventional 5/10 horror film. <br/><br/>I'm a huge cynic with horror films, I hate nearly all post 2000 American ones, but I haven't just sat down and enjoyed one like this since Alfred Hitchcock's psycho (1960). I heartily recommend this film.<br/><br/>To prove you can trust me:<br/><br/>Reasons I think people undeservingly hate it are: <br/><br/>-they are in denial a person would pay to kill a random human being and say this is ""unbelievable"". <br/><br/>-they think nudity is unnecessary for some reason, (it's not used in anyway to try and expand the target market of the film or any cheap shot like that, they just shows some tits and a bit of sex, which is not a big deal) <br/><br/>-they think the gore was unnecessary because there is not any in the first half (the gore is great and adds to the impact) <br/><br/>-the characters didn't bitch enough (definitely a good thing when I'm watching a horror film)<br/><br/>So please dismiss negative comments about this film.

","I watched this movie with a bit of chagrin. The start was plausible and the holiday etc rolled on. When the lads go on holiday and become trapped in the 'Hostel' the disgusting torture porn starts. Everything that happens in this film is just NOT BELIEVABLE. It is pure imaginary rubbish coming from the mind of people who seem to get off on watching others suffer. The film could easily have been 30 minutes shorter. At a lot of points it seems a little dragged out. The end, and revenge angle was justice done etc was enjoyable but entirely predictable. Didn't enjoy this and those who did need help. I was genuinely surprised they made a second one..."
"MacBalthus","3","2","4","7 July 2008"," Nothing special
","I don't see all the noise around this little flick. Ultra-brutal? Hell no. Funny in a trash sort of way maybe. And since it was basically only advertised by its failing gore, the rest, as I expected, isn't worth any attention. The story is just nonsense. Maybe someone should have told Eli Roth that to feel and fear with and for the main character, the main character should have a character. Here we have somebody who's about as interesting as an AXE TV model, minus the abs. Two eastern European babes, one sex addict from Iceland and of course the villains...it's just not enough for a full length feature. The settings are pretty decent and probably the only believable thing. The cinematography has a fresh look since movies aren't shot that frequent in this area but that's about it. <br/><br/>Hostel is boring, lame, not even especially gruesome and it does never justice to its hype. But for kiddies who haven't seen somebody's finger getting cut off: Enjoy it while your parents are out for anniversary dinner, you little punks."
"el_anarchy","8","2","4","15 May 2008"," Not torture porn, but a real horror movie.
","I really loved Hostel... it is a very, very good movie, regardless of what many people think. People can't seem to see beyond the violence or the gore.<br/><br/>The photography, the editing, the acting, the score, the script... everything was top notch. It is really well made. There are a bunch of 'torture-porn' (but really, TORTURE-PORN) flicks like 'Violent Sh#t' or 'Porno Holocaust' out there with zero production values, just made for the hell of it (which i suppose they're fun in a way, but basically they are pieces of garbage)... People don't seem to realize how well made a movie like Hostel is.<br/><br/>I believe Torture Porn is not fitting at all for Hostel. Hostel is a very tense, very disturbing, nightmarish look at human nature. It's a Horror movie in every sense of the word, and stylistically it's very much like an Italian Giallo.<br/><br/>Right now, in times when you get a lot 'just for the sake of being gory movies', Hostel can't be taken away from that context, but I assure you... Hostel will be a Horror classic, cause it's really well done and it actually has something to say."
"momo-112","10","2","4","28 April 2008"," Convincing, suspenseful and scary
","The suspense is brought rapidly to a peak. At each seemingly innocent or curious encounter we suspect that the intrepid travelers have started on the path to their doom. Yet they continue unharmed and would make us wonder if perhaps nothing is wrong. That is, we would wonder if we didn't know we were watching a horror film. The suspense doesn't slow when the gruesomeness starts. We are sill left wondering who will survive, if they will survive or how they will survive. The director gives away nothing as moment by moment the plot unfolds. The tension doesn't slow as the plot tilts from terror to revenge since every step of the way it threatens to slip back into terror. Even as the film reaches it's conclusion the twisted plot leaves the viewer wondering if that really is the end or if there is one more twist waiting for us after the credits roll. The film is fast paced, scary, convincingly acted, true to it's location and achieves moments of brilliance. Particularly in one scene where a single and seemingly innocent sentence (""We are going to the sauna. Would you like to come?"") reveals every secret to Paxton in an awful epiphany.<br/><br/>This is a gore film but in no way a formula slasher film. The bad guys aren't superhuman. The victims aren't stupid people doing even stupider things. They behave like normal people that a rational viewer can identify and sympathize with. A lot of the real gore does move off camera that I would have liked to see but I wonder if the film was risking an X rating if they showed it all."

","That's one hell of an idea they got on this movie. I think I mostly liked it because I thought I had the whole plot figured out and in the end I didn't, and I really liked the idea. The movie also develops itself very quick so is not boring, I hardly noticed time passing and I had a few laughs alone, which is always a good sign (you don't usually laugh when you're alone). I think it's a controversial movie and not everyone will like it. You'll like it less if you're expecting a Tarantino movie, which isn't. And maybe is not the classic horror movie you watch with your girlfriend, but the one you watch with your friends. It gets you thinking because you have to wonder how unreal the movie is. Most horror movies are not supposed to be real, what actually gives the creeps about Hostel is that what happens there might be true for all you know."

None of the characters seem remotely real. 3: The gore is just revolting, not entertaining in any way.<br/><br/>I turned it off about ten minutes from the end, I wouldn't waste more time on it.

"lady_telfalathiel","2","2","4","7 September 2007"," I don't get the hype
","When this first came out, I never thought that I'd sit through it in a million years. I'm nowhere near a gore hound, and would prefer psychological thrillers to any sort of outright ""torture porn"". Although I had this in mind, I eventually grew more interested in seeing it, hearing that it was absolutely terrifying and utterly disturbing. I was curious, so when I saw that it was on Showtime one night, I decided to sit through it.<br/><br/>Boy, was I stupid.<br/><br/>In general, it's a poor film. At first thought, the most blatant mistake that Roth makes is his characterization. If you're going to make a film specifically about torture and you're trying to make your audience sympathize with the victims, the worst thing to do is make them seem like completely stupid and shallow frat boys from the first moment. If the audience is sympathizing with the predators instead of the prey because they prey are such frustrating and silly characters, your film's not gonna be effective. <br/><br/>Secondly, I won't deny that the plot's idea is frightening. The execution, however, is not so much. The torture is more silly than frightening (I'm sorry, but I had to laugh when the Asian girl's eye was hanging out. With a budget that large, there is no reason for visual effects to be THAT excessively cheesy), and it is much too amateurish to be disturbing. The acting was just made up of a ton of simple screaming, making even something as nasty sounding as a slit Achilles tendon seem dumb. <br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong. There were one or two genuinely creepy moments, the only one coming to mind as when Jay Hernandez's character is in the locker room talking to a man, who is freakishly excited, getting ready to go in and torture someone. That, I thought, was a good, effective way to actually make the plot seem frightening and present. Everything else, however, doesn't do near the same job.<br/><br/>People, fans of the genre, have told me that if I could handle ""Hostel"", I could handle anything. After seeing it, I am now genuinely scared of the state of modern horror. If this is the epitome of terror in modern cinema, then I don't want to know what the future holds for the genre..."
"fred3f","1","2","4","2 September 2007"," Let's be honest here
","Despite all of the debate over the political and social issues, and despite all the reference to this being too shocking, degrading or pornographic, when it comes down to it there are only two reasons for watching this film - Sex and Pain. I was going to write Shock instead of Pain, but the shock is only of the pain variety. If you object or do not enjoy seeing these things on the screen then you probably shouldn't watch this film. <br/><br/>Also, if you are looking for good acting or plot development, if you are looking for complex subjects, or depth and insight into life, then you should go elsewhere. The acting is strictly high school, the script and dialog are infantile, and any ""meaning"" attached to the film is fairly superficial giving the viewer the idea that it was ""thrown in"" to give film some justification for existence other than just being a way to separate the audience from its money. <br/><br/>For those of you remaining, I will review the two aspects of this film which may appeal to you. <br/><br/>Sex: There is nothing pornographic in the sense of hard core x rated pornography. You will see some naked women some of whom are pretty and others less so. You will also see some ""situations"" of apparent sex. There are some scenes of adolescent joy at ""sexual abandon,"" which look very set up and trite. I wouldn't recommend the film for its sexual titillation. If that is what you want you can get much more of it elsewhere. <br/><br/>Now we get to the real value of the film - the pain. Yes, it is here in abundance - quality pain. One reviewer here gushed at the fact that, ""My stomach was still knotted up after we left the screening.The last time I felt like that was when I saw ALIENS for the first time about 19 years ago. Since then, no other horror film has ever made me feel like that."" If this is the kind of thing that you enjoy then you can splurge on it here. However, the pain is mainly in the second half, so I would recommend you skip the first half and go straight to the blood and pain that dominate the second half. This could save your a good deal of time. <br/><br/>On the other hand, there is something to be said for watching the first half and being so disgusted at the idiocy of the main characters and being bored by their poor acting that you feel some satisfaction at seeing them tortured in the second half. However, that would is not to everyone's taste and you would have to decide on an individual basis if this would be worthwhile. <br/><br/>All in all, the film will appeal to many who enjoy viewing activity in the areas of sex and pain (particulary the latter) as a means of entertainment. I do understand there are a large number of people who fill this group, and so did the marketing people who put this film together. To you, although I am not of your tastes, I simply say - to each his or her own, and I hope you find this film satisfying. All others will find their time better spent in different pursuits."

","Hostel was a great follow-up to Eli Roth's great Cabin Fever. It was well-written, scripted, and acted. Hostel also had Roth's interesting blend of sex, blood, horror, and comedy, and it works much better here than in Cabin Fever. Hostel is definitely not a film for everyone, but genre fans are sure to love Roth's newest film. I especially loved Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson is great performances, and their characters made this film so enjoyable. For once, this horror film allows you to get attached to the characters so that when they die, it is all the more effective. I would really recommend this to anyone, but I think that horror fans will get the biggest kick out of it. While it wasn't as good as the sequel, Hostel was still one of my favorite horror films and a shockingly great time."

The story is strangely believable because the bad guys are ordinary people just like you and me, but people who are looking at getting kicks from killing others. The bloody horror that unfolds is one that has your choking back the vomit. On watching this film for a third time, I watched other peoples reactions around me and their faces as more grizzly gore appears on the screen. Its unnerving and you feel every scream as the victims are tortured beyond belief in the most grotesque way. It is a definite hit and one which should not watched by the faint hearted or people who are that little bit squeamish.

","There are scary movies and there are horror movies. Hostel is the later. What do I mean by horror? A movie that makes you flinch, that's uncomfortable to watch and stays with you long after you see it. The movie starts like the garden-variety scary movie in the vein of ""Scream"" and 80s slasher flicks, but by the last half it becomes pure unadulterated horror. The director did a pretty good job taking us from the cheesiness to the terrible cruelty you experience later to its unrealistic, but satisfying Hollywood ending. Many people will say the Hollywood clichés will ruin what could have been a classic, but I think when the subject is so disturbing you need a little movie magic to lighten up things. When the movie ended, the most horrible thing I think I experienced was not watching helpless, trapped people being tortured like if they were in the deepest stage of hell, it was thinking these things are happening somewhere in the world right now. Not in Slovakia, where this movie does what Borat did for Kazakhstan, but in places like China, Iran and Cuba (where Americans are likely doing it too). There are some parallels between sex and violence in the movie, but it's easy to forget if you only want to watch it as face value. There are too many clever things done for those who want to read between the lines. One last praise, I think it was pretty clever not to subtitle any foreign language. It adds to the experience, which in the end is to make you uncomfortable in all levels possible."

It's rare to experience the real-life horror of Europe's ""murder-for-profit"" business, and to know that things like this really happen.<br/><br/>Within this film, three backpackers travel to Europe for girls, drugs, alcohol, etc. and find themselves receiving far more, and far worse than they could have ever imagined.<br/><br/>If you think that THIS is a cheesy, over-done, ""predictable"" or ""pointless"" film, then why don't you go watch something like eight of the nine sequels to ""Friday the 13th"" or several of the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequels."

"jluis1984","6","2","4","8 January 2007"," A nice effort by Roth
","2002 was a big year for director Eli Roth, as the huge success of his modest debut film, the low-budget horror ""Cabin Fever"", quickly gave him the attention of a young audience eager of horror films aimed to their generation. While not exactly an original or exceptional film, Roth's ""Cabin Fever"" became a huge hit among the audience because it offered an edgier, raw approach that proved to be very attractive to die hard horror fans, but at the same time was friendly enough to gather the mainstream audiences not entirely familiar with the genre. It was this success that attracted producer Quentin Tarantino to help Roth to make the follow-up to his initial success. The 2005 release of ""Hostel"" was the result of that joint venture and the movie that showed that Roth is finally growing up as a horror director.<br/><br/>""Hostel"" is the story of Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson), two backpackers traveling across Europe during their last summer before going to college, in a wild trip of drugs and sex. In their quest, their are joined by Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson), an Icelander traveler who is also looking for good experiences. During one night on Amsterdam, the three travelers meet Alex (Lubomir Bukovy), a young man who tells them about a hostel located in Slovakia where they will find not only the best looking women of all Europe, but also the ones that are easier to get into bed. Excited about this information, Paxton, Josh and Oli travel to Slovakia to discover the paradise Alex was talking about. But they will also discover a dark side of the business that Alex conveniently forgot to tell them.<br/><br/>Written by Roth himself, ""Hostel"" is at its core, a very basic tale of punishment as the young protagonists go from lustful consumers to products of consumption by their own choice; however, it's commendable the effort Roth has put to the development of the characters to give some flesh and make the simple story a bit more engaging. The lack of sympathetic or well-built characters was one of the most criticized aspects of ""Cabin Fever"", but in ""Hostel"", Roth creates a trio of characters that while at first are like Xerox copies from his ""Cabin Fever"" boys, later they evolve into real persons with realistic motivations and surprisingly heart, proving that the director/writer has learned something from his past mistakes.<br/><br/>It's important to point out that its hype as an extremely violent movie is deceiving, as it really doesn't offer anything new or groundbreaking to old and experienced horror fans familiar with lesser known gems of the exploitation genre. That said, ""Hostel"" is a visually impressive movie (thanks to its bigger budget) that showcases a stylish yet very realistic way of violence rarely seen in the current mainstream horror. As a director, Eli Roth follows a straight forward approach to his story that in many ways is the obvious evolution of his work in ""Cabin Fever"", as even when this new film is definitely more brutal and remorseless than his previous work; it also offers a slightly friendly face that makes it attractive to bigger audiences outside the traditional horror fan base.<br/><br/>The cast of the film does a commendable job, but never goes beyond the expected. Jay Hernandez is probably the best of the main cast, giving a believable turn as the naive American who gets in the middle of something bigger than himself. While he is good in his role, his character loses all credibility by the last third of the movie due to the sadly unrealistic way Roth ends the film. Derek Richardson is pretty good too, as the less enthusiastic and introverted Josh. Eythor Gudjonsson as Oli exudes his natural charm in a role that is probably an exaggeration of his real life persona. Jan Vlasák gives a terrific performance in what's probably the best acting of the film. The rest of the cast is pretty much OK, without any real surprises.<br/><br/>As written above, it is Roth who is the main responsible for the fatal flaw of the film: it's conclusion. ""Hostel"" is divided basically in three acts, and sadly it's in the final part where Roth decides to conclude his story in a way so fantastic that betrays the realist approach he had used in the film so far. Without spoiling the finale, I'll just say that the unfortunate decision makes the film look like a complete different movie and totally unbalances what otherwise could had been a new classic. ""Hostel"" has been criticized by the naive and ignorant view it has on Slovakia and other European countries in their portrayal as poor countries where life is cheap. While Roth has defended himself by saying his film is done that way on purpose, personally I think that the ambiguity the film has on this aspect (it's very realistic at times, while over-the-top fantastical at others) doesn't really help Roth to make his point clear.<br/><br/>Wheter it is a socially aware film or not, the fact is that with ""Hostel"" director Eli Roth gained another financial success and proved that he was more than a lucky one hit wonder. While not a movie without flaws (and it has some serious problems), ""Hostel"" is a big improvement over ""Cabin Fever"", and hopefully Roth will make a masterpiece if someone else writes instead of him. 7/10"
"universal_monster","Null","2","4","31 December 2006"," The cheapening of horror cinema continues...
","Thank you Eli Roth for taking an intriguing premise and transforming it into something of no value whatsoever. ""Hostel"" tells the story of a couple of annoying yank college students and one seriously burnt out foreign ""dude"" traveling through Eastern Europe. Since they spend the majority of this film sucking up whatever drugs they can get their hands on, banging prostitutes and acting like complete morons, they become perfect targets for an business looking to recruit (i.e. kidnap) 'distracted' and brainless young tourists... just like them! Before you can say ""good riddance"" we discover that said business is actually a grimy, decaying underground labyrinth where customers from all over the globe pay big bucks for a chance to torture a mutilate a real, live human being. Sounds like a blast, doesn't it? <br/><br/>While Hostel might seem like a disturbing horror film in theory, it's so badly directed and written it aggressively refuses to deliver anything remotely resembling suspense, terror or shock value. The only memorable sequence happens near the end of the picture and involves a dislocated eyeball that needs snipped. In the meantime... The characters are so poorly developed, obnoxious and dumb, the dialogue is risible and the film so slow moving you might find it a trust test of patience to hang in there. I'd say Eli Roth probably had his target audience in mind when he vomited up this mess; people who are content with nothing more than T&A and blood being flung around. Sadly, those sharing his same mentality tend to be too young to actually see R-rated movies.<br/><br/>Most surprisingly, this mess managed to make a dent at the box office. A small dent, but a dent nonetheless. Just one more sign of the times when something this bad turns out to be one of the highest grossing horror movies of 2006. And that has nothing to do with it being a quality horror film and everything to do with hype. Hype being some major name calling dredging up Quentin Tarantino's money investment and a misleading ad campaign claiming this is the most shocking film of the past ten years. Unfortunately, it doesn't even come close and is just another waste of time and money."

"blabbity","1","2","4","19 August 2006"," Interesting concept...sickeningly portrayed
","I'm not certain at the beginning of this review if I am going to pop out a spoiler or two, so the spoiler warning is ""just in case"".<br/><br/>First off, let me begin by saying the only reason I gave this movie ONE star is because I was unable to give it NO stars.<br/><br/>The idea behind the movie, as mentioned in several of the reviews here, is quite terrifying and would made for a thrilling novel. The IDEA that someone would pay for the sick pleasure of torturing a random (or sometimes randomly picked from a series of preferences listed by the torture-er to be) person is truly horrific and a serious offense to the humane, not to mention dealing a massive blow to the psyche. You are chosen, drugged, chained to a chair, and are forced to endure hideous and abominable tortures, agonizing pain, and a prolonged, longed-for death. I'd be longing for death too after an ordeal like that. It's a psychiatrist's worst nightmare.<br/><br/>Because of the premise and the idea, I had actually WANTED to see this movie and I fought for days to rent it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, WHEN I saw this movie I was completely disappointed and more than a little disgusted. The entire first half of the movie is basically a poorly-done porn flick pretending to be horror, while the second half is nothing but an unintelligent splatterfest of gore. It makes a body sick, rather than terrifying the mind. In fact, at one point, I was truly forced to leave the living room and vomit. Thank god I didn't see this on the big screen. I'd have spewed my dinner on all unsuspecting moviegoers on my marathon run to the restroom. And I'm a horror buff. I love horror. This movie, this isn't horror. It's just sick on all counts of human decency.<br/><br/>The characters themselves are shallow, two-dimensional, unbelievable, and nothing but a bunch of horny sex-mongers who apparently don't care if they get an STD from any of the MANY prostitutes they bang in the process of their ""Eurotrip"". I found myself hoping they'd die from a disease or a virus before the gross bit of the movie was even HINTED at. Had it not been for the title at the beginning of the film (if it can be called such) I found myself wondering if I had gone into the wrong theater.<br/><br/>The only Likable character is the poor Japanese girl who gets her eye pulled out and dies by jumping in front of a train. I actually felt SORRY for her, but not for anyone else in this disgusting excuse for a ""movie""..."
"conwayk","1","2","4","18 August 2006"," A lack of sympathy is odd, but inevitable in this case.
","I literally just saw this film and I'm puzzled as to how I feel about it.<br/><br/>Usually the whole point of watching people being tortured is that the horror stems from not only the visceral horror, but the sympathy for the victim. Without this necessary factor, the thrill of the scene is all but lost.<br/><br/>However, in the beginning of the film, when Paxton, a rude American with his rude American friend and a stereotypically horny European male, shouts, ""Man I hope bestiality is legal in this country, cause that girl is a f@$%kin pig!"" (at a prostitute who is nowhere near fat), I found myself muttering, ""God, just kill him now."" We have already lost sympathy for the characters. All we have left is the violence.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is overextended sex scenes that cut into valuable film time that could be used to explain why we should care about these men. Perhaps that's Roth and Tarantino's intention--to view the victims as the murderers would: as arrogant, rude, oversexed and boorish Americans that are only good for tourism and death, if anything.<br/><br/>Blah blah blah, death death death, shame shame shame. I expected better from Tarantino, master of Kill Bill and helping hand in the amazing Sin City.<br/><br/>Even the prize cow needs to deliver sour milk once in a while."

I must say i am glad I went all alone or the effect would be much worse if I had opted to take one of my friends from the opposite sex (14 dollars down the drain!! Are you kidding me??). The movie did start out randomly with a trio making a pleasure cruise in Slovakia and it seemed like a porno flick more than anything else and then after the first 20 Min's the gore and killing starts. Everything is explicit and you can throw the story out of the window by now. It seemed to me that the director Pachl in conjunction with Tarrentino wanted to make this movie a real scare but somehow lost their nerves after drinking a couple of Vodka shots and decided to make it a ""splat in your face"" kind of movie.

The 'moral' of the story is not lost on Americans who widely and falsely believe Europe is far more dangerous than the U.S.; <br/><br/>(2)by going to another country and writing a script for foreigners to perform - for money - he is basically saying 'clearly they - whoever they might be - are better off letting us present them the way we want them to be seen.'

Roth also explained he decided to shoot the movie on a small budget in Eastern Europe after a conversation with cult director Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>He added: ""When I told him about 'Hostel', he went, 'Oh man, that is the sickest idea for a horror film I've ever heard!

The only difference between this Hostel and Rockville was that Rockville had terrible sound editing and mastering. Save yourself the time and the money. Don't see this movie no matter what your friends or anyone else says. I am really disappointed that Quentin Terintino or however you spell his name as a respected director would put his name along side this piece of trash."

Does he think that because he's Quentin Tarantino he can just put together any stupid series of events and call it Art of Film?? His name will sell it? How insulting. Pulp Fiction was fantastic, Reservoir Dogs was excellent, Jackie Brown was almost good (sorta kinda OK), From Dusk Till Dawn was pretty dumb as a whole but had a few redeeming qualities; decent cast, visually interesting enough.... <br/><br/>But THIS?

","umm... boobs and gore. My friends and I rented this, hoping for a really good psychological horror kind of thing... something that would mess with your mind and creep you out for days. Well, what we got was something that probably could be considered mild porn. In fact, the entire first half of the movie seems devoted to naked, busty women. I found myself wondering when the actual plot was going to be set in motion. Then the plot was set in motion, and I kept waiting for some kind of grand finale, some wrapping up of events... something to signal that the movie was over and the last two hours of my life had not been wasted. Alas, my waiting was in vain. There was no tying up of loose ends... maybe I should be glad for that, because as bad as the rest of it was, even a great ending wouldn't have made up for it. <br/><br/>On an up note, the effects were good. The gore, while almost amusingly over-the-top was realistic enough to make me want to vomit. There really isn't any horror involved though, more of it's more of a shock value kind of thing... almost as if the director was saying ""hey, lets see how many times I can catch the audience without their faces covered! Just when they think the nasties are over... BAM!"""
"mofftarkin-2","1","2","4","4 May 2006"," Worst Movie Ever
","This movie was simple awful. I can't believe that people like this, for a horror film it wasn't at all scary.<br/><br/>My experience with this film ended half way through, when someone had a seizure in our cinema (which I might add I was very grateful for, grateful for the fact I could leave, not grateful for the fact the guy had a seizure). All the violence and sex in this film really does detract from it. It could have been done in a way which added some much more to the film. As some else said it is an interesting concept for a movie but the implementation of that idea got lost, don't waste your money like I did it's simply no worth 2 hours of your life."
"Kingkitsch","1","2","4","4 May 2006"," Another piece of junk from Eli Roth
","Will someone please stop Eli Roth (the ""director"" of this stupid and dull excuse for a movie) from ever making any other films? His ""Cabin Fever"" was bad enough, but ""Hostel"" is way, way worse. This wretched excuse for a movie takes half its running time to get down to business, squandering any intelligence or plot in favor of low-grade porn and the misadventures of three characters that no one could remotely even care about. Throw in a lot of barely concealed homophobia (Eli Roth apparently has issues he's trying to work out) and watch this impotent brew put the audience to sleep. By the time the supposedly ""scary"" stuff starts happening, this movie is so far off the tracks that it crashes and burns into one ridiculous scene after another. Film buffs might get a laugh or two picking out parts of other, better horror films that Eli Roth ripped off and used in ""Hostel"", in exactly the same way he did for ""Cabin Fever"". This movie actually put me to sleep during it's first half, and then gave me a whopper of a headache during the second half, primarily due to aggravation based on the fact that I couldn't punch Eli Roth's face off. The only really frightening thing on the DVD is in the featurettes listening to Mr. Roth talk about how European toilets flush. I told you he had issues. Pass this movie by and save a couple of aspirins. Total garbage!"
"robniccolai","1","2","4","3 May 2006"," worst...movie...EVER!
","This movie doesn't even count as horror. it's a porn film for murder fetishists. The ideas in the movie come out in maybe one scene, and it gets buried under mounds and mounds of gore. Someone managed to take a dying genre and try to revitalize it by removing any semblance of real plot and reaching right for the saw blades. The result makes you yearn for repeat viewings of Jason X. I refuse to even call this a film, and it has as much artistic quality as Girls Gone Wild volume 3. I imagine Eli Roth took a trip to the Holocaust museum and his first thought was ""hey! this would make a great movie! if I slip in enough tits and gore, no one will notice that my characters are nothing but puppets that exist to be chopped up by maniacs! Brilliant!"
"bnrherron02","1","2","4","3 May 2006"," Slow and Boring...
","Very boring.. really a waste of movie rental money. The movie takes forever to even get started and by then.. I had enough. Not going to spoil it for others..... however.... I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. The plot could have been something but getting to that point was slow torture for the viewers! I actually walked out of the room... came back a few minutes later and the same scene was dragging along. There's some gore but overall it's not a movie that's going to make you ""scared"" or ""jump"" or create ""fear"". It didn't stir any emotion but boredom and disappointment. I suppose it's a matter of personal taste... as for me.. waste of time!"
"DonFishies","3","2","4","1 May 2006"," So what's so horrific about it?
","A day after watching Hostel I still cannot help but ask myself, where was the horror? Because besides a small five minute scene, which was not all too terrifying, I cannot for the life of me, understand why anyone would define this as a horror movie. It's not, it's just silly throw-away trash.<br/><br/>The plot, as most of us who have read anything about it know, is that three guys, two Americans and an Icelandic guy they meet up with, are in Europe looking to sleep with lots of women. Does not seem to matter, as long as they have a pair of breasts and a nice ass, they are there. So upon finding out that there are all sorts of women doing anything in Bratislava, the three of them go, only to find the women of their dreams, and the stuff from their nightmares.<br/><br/>To define the movie into certain parts, it goes from thirty minutes of sex, breasts, alcohol and drugs, to ten minutes of a thriller, to the rest of the movie trying to be horrific (along with film noir and comedy elements thrown in for good measure), but failing mindlessly. People are brought in, and leave way too soon, either by dying or just by not coming back. None of the relationships or motivations are explained at all. The actors look like walking, swearing zombies. No character, even the sympathetic Jay Hernedez, is the least bit likable. Everyone is a jerk. And to top it all off, there is virtually no good dialogue in the film at all. And for some ungodly reason, there are way too many homosexual overtones at every turn this movie attempts to take, that you begin to feel that the characters should be wearing cowboy hats and making Brokeback Mountain with torture and murderous mayhem instead.<br/><br/>When the whole idea of what is going on, and why all of these people are being tortured and killed actually begins to make some sort of sense, you are just left stunned trying to understand how ludicrous the idea is. And after you realize who the lead bad guy is, you still do not get a real sense as to why any of this is actually happening. It only becomes even more ridiculous than it was before hand. It all just seems like heinous and horribly random acts of violence put forth in order to try and achieve some sort of scareful momentum. But the movie fails to deliver it.<br/><br/>But Eli Roth's problem is like every other modern horror director. He shows lots of blood, but does not push the envelope. There is nothing new here, and any methods that may seem ""new"" are either not brought to their full potential, or just do not seem to make sense at all. There is quite a bit of blood spilled throughout the film, but its nowhere near as sick or vomit-inducing as this movie was hyped up to be. Instead, it comes off as a hyper-violent disappointment that some campy fans may be into, but traditional horror fans will see right through. He may claim to be trying, but this is really far from. Even Saw, which the movie is border line ripping off, seemed a lot more frightening than this film. And it had three times less blood, and just as bad acting.<br/><br/>I have yet to see all of Cabin Fever, but even with the small parts of that movie and the entirety of this movie, I really get a feel that Roth thinks he is being clever, and does not realize that the audience is not as gullible as he thinks. If he's going to make a horror movie, he should make it. If he wants to make a comedy, he should make it. If he wants to make a porno, than he should make it. A film noir? A revenge tale? Merging all of these into one incohesive narrative is definitely not the way to go. It may work for Tarantino, but is does not work for Roth.<br/><br/>Take a lesson Eli.<br/><br/>Write good dialogue, make characters likable, and add some horror.<br/><br/>And for god sake, let the movie make sense.<br/><br/>You do not horrify the audience with your images, you horrify them with your horrendous way of putting the movie together and claiming it to be a horror film.<br/><br/>3/10."

","I was one of those who didn't like ""Cabin Fever"" but I must say I was pleasantly surprised about ""Hostel"". I all ready knew the plot: (Spoiler Alert!!!!): which is: Travel, sex, porn, torture, escape, revenge. It is a bad plot but one does not view such movies for the plot but for the effect and the suspense. This movie is one of the most suspenseful I have ever seen. It's true that the acting is lacking at places, and also that there is no realism in the plot (Spoiler alert again!): These people have no motive to torture. No one would pay to do this. It's true people torture each other for all sorts of reasons but not for the reasons in this movie. It is very persuasive but still not realistic. Moreover (more spoiler alerts!) the notion that the last surviving guy just whacks off all his victimizers in a single sweep sort of meeting all of them on his way home is not realistic at all. The way he escapes from the tortures is also pretty dumb. Why not just walk out? He had a gun. Surely it would not be easier to hide among the corpses and hope for the best while he was being transported somewhere. Anyway, this is surely a great movie about how rough Europe maybe especially Eastern Europe can be!"

I thought to myself how the heck is this a horror movie? Even when the movie shifted I think it got worse. Yes there a a few gross parts and some looked really fake but that is about it. The storyline was terrible, the acting was terrible. I actually skipped through some parts cause I just couldn't take it anymore.

I shouldn't be laughing because the actors are ridiculous. I mean seriously I am sure this movie had enough of a budget to hire a few decent actors. Well I guess if I could act i wouldn't go near this script either. I am certain a bunch of foul mouthed 5 year old kids penned it under the name ""Eli Roth"". Seriously every character is off the shelf stock. Young, pot-headed, hedonistic, horny and above all stupid kids go on massive road trip throughout Europe and end up in an area which lures tourists in and has people pay to slaughter them. Whoa that is a good one... Let me tell you now. I find it funny that soft core porn is distributed throughout Hostel in effort to convince you that there was something in the film that was worthwhile. It is a paradox that anyone who watches this film will be violated far worse than any of the stupid characters in the film."

I sincerely hope this movie is total fiction and not based on some dark truth somewhere. There is some very good foreshadowing as well: conversation about drowing victim, the initial meeting with one of the Elite Hunting ""customers"". One of the more chilling moments is when the main character is going into the exhibit and the guy leaving says ""best money you'll ever spend"". Nice job Quentin."

The main characters wanted life experience to take back to college with them, and by God they got it.

There was not enough of a story line for this to be considered a great all round movie. Stupid people making stupid, lousy choices and ending up being tortured is no basis for a movie. There was no build up around most of the characters, aside from the main character, so no sympathy or feelings are felt for any of them. The doctor from the beginning ending up on the train in the end and the girls that originally seduced the main character being in the street were just two really stupid coincidences. Basically, overall it was a waste of time and not even worth my thoughts. If i wanted to see boobs and sex i would have rented a porno and if i wanted gore i would've watched a real horror film.

There were so many naked women, it actually took away from the movie. I expected to see a scary movie with some plot development, but I was very wrong. Apparently they lost the original footage for the first half of the movie and decided to use an old ""Girls Gone Wild"" video and hoped nobody noticed. With an absolutely horrible transition, the movie switches to complete gore. The gore wasn't shockingly horrible, either (contrary to advertisements). There was just lots of it. I honestly believe that Eli Roth decided to try to fit as many naked women and gory scenes in one film and this was the product.

The fact that it seems a popular Hollywood manner to place evil in eastern European countries is the height of ignorance and total disrespect for these nations who were established and flourishing a long time before the pathetic USA was a wet dream in Washingtons trousers.

","This was truly one of the worst films I think I have ever seen, although I do take my hate off to Mr Roth and Mr Tarantino for pulling one of the greatest con jobs of all time. This film sold itself on it's sickening, god awful violence and for my money it just wasn't there. I am extremely squeamish - I actually passed out at 'Hannibal', but I didn't even have to look away at any point in this film. The violent bits were actually few and far between and there was only one short scene that was pretty bad. Half of it doesn't look real and the rest is just crap.<br/><br/>The reason I went to see it is because I thought the way it was done might make it an atmospheric, solid genre piece. It is not. Mr Roth has been insulting films like 'The Grudge' saying they are PG-13 horror films with no real bite. Well I disagree completely. Watching people slice each other up does not scare me, it just makes me feel sick. 'The Grudge' and 'The Blair Witch Project' were scary because of the atmosphere they created. 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Wolf Creek' were both gory AND scary as they created a scary atmosphere, made you identify with the characters and THEN chopped them up. Hostel is not scary because it does not make any effort with storyline or character development. I did not care about these characters, so when they had their tendons slashed etc etc I could not care less. And there simply is NO storyline whatsoever. Also, the tag line to the film says there is a place where all your sickest fantasies can be indulged. Well if people really do fantasise about doing this sort of thing to people we are living in a sad world. And to be honest, I don't think anyone does fantasise about this sort of thing. I have friends that have gone to jail for violent offences and they would absolutely never fantasise about this sort of thing. So right away there is a huge plot flaw.<br/><br/>Awful, awful, awful film and not scary in the slightest. Well done to Roth and Tarantino again though. I'm off to write a script about a theme park where everyone gets the worst, most horrific things happening to them as long as they can pay for it. Its gonna be well gory. Expect to see it at the top of the US box office."

","This is an edit of my previous review, I wrote that review when I first came back from seeing the film, I thought it was brilliant, apart from it's slow start. However, I have since returned to see it and I want to take back my one negative comment.<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>The film starts with the three friends Josh, Oli and Paxton touring Europe in an attempt to get Josh laid, before being directed to ""the Hostel"". I suppose in my first viewing I was too prepared for instant gore, violence and torture and therefore didn't truly appreciate the necessity of this.<br/><br/>END OF SPOILER <br/><br/>The need for this slow start is to introduce our characters, we find out who they are, what they like and the fact they are fun-loving young guys who are just out for a good time! And this makes what happens to them in the future so much more scary, we feel as Paxton does when he sees what has happened to his friend... utterly destroyed and we think ""how can this happen to such a nice guy"" without that slow start the scenes of torture would not be as shocking as they were.<br/><br/>For anyone who has seen the film, compare how you felt for Josh and Paxton as they were tortured, and then for the Chinese girl as she was... you felt squeamish but because you had no relationship with her, you felt almost passive at her suffering.<br/><br/>Overall the film is about human nature, but is a bit more complicated than good and bad... Roth isn't saying that we have good and bad people in this world...<br/><br/>SPOILER<br/><br/>... what he is saying is that everyone has the ability to be good and bad, just some people exercise more of the other. The ""hunter"" who tortures Paxton, is hesitant at first, he still attempts to torture Paxton, but for a split second we feel he may change his mind because the good is coming out in him.<br/><br/>Once Paxton has escaped, he gets a chance to kill the Dutch Businessman... and he does... Paxton becomes bad and whether Roth wants us to, we ultimately end up thinking... is it right?<br/><br/>END OF SPOILER <br/><br/>So do I recommend Hostel?... the answer... YES... But watch it and all the time ask yourself, Why has Roth done this like this? and What does he want us to think? Don't dismiss it because of the graphic violence it depicts.<br/><br/>A BRILLIANT FILM!"

The way the story connects the characters it's quite silly and sometimes makes no sense. Plus, the script seems to have some very big ""holes"" in it and some of them are quite remarkable.

","This Comment will contain Spoilers. Please take heed, thank's, and don't feel too cut up about it.<br/><br/>What a load of old rubbish.<br/><br/>After all the media hype, that I never fell for, for a minute, did you? No, I did not go to this showing to see just gore, as Hostel sold itself on, but to see a new and refreshing movie of interest at least.<br/><br/>This completely unoriginal and extremely predictable bore fest has been seen too many times before, i.e. the oozing eye from the Japanese girl, this being the money shot no doubt, such as in The Evil Dead. Come on, could there not be any other way for this movie to develop, to evolve? Yeah, kids on the journey of their lifetime, fair enough, but it approached a brick wall and never turned into anything but a pointless sorry excuse of celluloid.<br/><br/>Who, or what even, is this movie aimed at? What was the story again? (It's a rhetorical question), do me a favour and come back with something with an idea and content that is worthy of my time and money. At least we know there won't, I hope, be a squeal, as all the lose ends were so very conveniently tied up at the end, wow, now that was easy wasn't it? I'm impressed.<br/><br/>Even to the point of seeing a girl with only one eye, the other was on the floor you see, she seemed to take it very well, you know, in the car, getting away from the baddies, see was ever so quiet and calm. The question of how high was her pain threshold was for her to be able to walk around with half her face ripped open and not be screaming her, excuse the pun, face off, and yes, you've guessed it, she helps the good guy in the end by. Amazing. It's not that hard to figure out.<br/><br/>Even in the torture scenes, we are, more than often, only guessing at what is being done to the poor victims. As these were out of shot, please don't say, "" Well less is more and we had to image what was being done to them for better effect"", I just thought that it was because this movie lacked, another pun, guts, guts to carry off what the media hype had us, except me, and yourself? To believe.<br/><br/>This Hostel was full; there was simply no more room at this Inn. Unfortunately, there were no more rooms to let to creativity, imagination, plot and originality.<br/><br/>I'm looking for another building (story) plot.<br/><br/>I'm checking out."
"TKTiger","1","2","4","1 April 2006"," Utter, utter rubbish!
","Eli Roth, what have you done? The trailer made this film look like something that was on-par with (or maybe even better than) the delight that was Saw 2. The full film, however, fails to deliver on every count.<br/><br/>We're given three lads who backpack and want to get laid - cue loads of naked women and sex. As the dudes party on, they're (one by one) drugged and dragged off to a place where they're tortured and then killed by people who have paid to do so. The third guy is taken by other means and ends up escaping, whereupon he enacts a revenge not unlike the torture his tormentors have dished out.<br/><br/>This is very much a film of three parts. The first part is the ""getting to know the characters"" part, where we see the three lads drink, dance, and smoke pot a lot. After around 45 mins of this (half the film) we get to the action *cough* part where the torture kicks in. This is the ""gore"" section of the film. It is meant to be full of suspense, but.... Well, it isn't. The horror isn't very horrific - gore filled, but nothing is on the same level as Saw 2. <br/><br/>The gore is justified well enough, it just doesn't seem to be the right gore, if that makes any sense. And, while this may sound odd, there isn't enough gore. Too much is left to the imagination, and then ruined by letting you see the aftermath which is so tame compared to what you imagined. One scene with a drill makes you wince as you imagine the guy being drilled to have large chunks of flesh removed, when in fact he was about three small holes which leak a little blood.<br/><br/>I think the main reason this film doesn't compare to Saw 2 is that the victims are just that. They are victims. They (apart from the last guy) just lay down and take their punishment. In Saw 2, the victims had a chance if they were quick witted, calm, and (in some cases) brave enough. Most of the torture sequences in Saw 2 had the victims fighting for their lives, which made for compelling viewing. In Hostel, the only survivor makes it out alive by luck more than judgement. The sad thing is what he does next is just pathetic.<br/><br/>The third part of the film is the ""escape & revenge"" part which plays out for the last 20 minutes or so. This involves the survivor rescuing a girl who's having her face burnt off by a welding torch (not as horrific in the film as it sounds here in text) and killing the ""heavies"" who run the place, mostly by shooting them or hacking them up with things (again, it sounds more entertaining than it actually is). He ends up stealing a car and running over some more people involved with the torture farm (for lack of better words) before finally ending the life of a torturer he met earlier on the film (albeit not knowing he was involved then) in the toilet on a railway station. The revenge is played out more like a comedy, with the final death being more amusing than disturbing.<br/><br/>The events in this film hit all the popular clichés too. Let's see... Slaughter of main characters who are male and in early 20's - Check. Characters whom you felt no connection to - Check. Setting mood using dimly lit corridors - Check. Lots of sex, naked woman and drug use - Check. Lone survivor - Check. Main ""evil doers"" killed - Check. Needless car chase sequence - Check. Complete and utter lack of plot - Check. Jump moments - Che... no, wait. I can't remember any. There might have been one, somewhere. Very bad music (strings) to heighten tension/suspense - Check.<br/><br/>All in all, a complete waste of time. If you want a good horror flick, go see Saw 2 - or revisit any classic horror movie from times past. You will have a much better time doing that than watching Hostel - fact!"

","I can't believe some people. How you can actually doubt movies like this, yet praise crap like Jeepers Creepers, Wrong Turn, Star Wars, LOTR. All the killers in them movies are like some creepy monsters, it's not even real. LOTR & Star Wars, it's all animated. It's all a matter of opinion. People should stop hating on this movie because it's CLASS. I think it's definitely one of those HATE IT OR LOVE IT ones.<br/><br/>I personally loved it, as I love these types of movies but I always critisice film makers for not making films, more real life like. I mean having killers than can fly, monsters etc (like The Descent)...I mean how unreal is that? There are rumours flying about that it was based on true events (I don't believe that) but it just goes to show it CAN happen in real life.<br/><br/>Don't believe the bad reviews about this and trust me, the IMDb rating does NOT reflect the true genius of this film. If you like 'edge of your seat' thrillers, this is the one for you. It's got everything...plot, storyline, action.<br/><br/>Watch it!

"Redford73","8","2","4","24 March 2006"," Realistic and gritty horror!
","An excellent film which delivers on horror by it's sense of realism. I disliked 'Cabin Fever' which was far too silly but this was a far cry from that. A little slow to begin with but this was clearly to build on character so that what occurs later in the film has more impact. A film of this kind has been a long time coming and takes the mythology of the Snuff movie to it's apex. Certainly not for the squeamish and although there are films out there with more gore it is rare that it is portrayed on such a believable basis and one leaves the cinema with the feeling that there really are people out there willing and capable of committing the atrocities shown in the film. Roth clearly nods to the Asian horror genre along with elements of films like '9mm' and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' but the film itself is original enough to stand out on it's own. The acting was very good with strong, believable performances from all characters. The intriguing nature of the atrocities, which makes the viewer a voyeur, also adds to the horrific and sickening nature of the film. My two criticisms are first that there weren't more 'clients'of the human hunting service shown in the film as there could clearly have been a wealth of examples of depraved individuals which would have added to the film's horrific revelations. Secondly that we never discover who started and organizes the service as this could have added to the plot. A must see for horror fans although normal cinema goers may find this too shocking and disturbing but then that is what horror is supposed to be."

There is no money or any other reward that will redeem sitting through the 90 minutes of stupidity, from the silly A'dam opening sequence through all the unimaginable gore right down to the dull ending nowhere near closure.<br/><br/>Eli Roth deserves to endure all the pain the victims in this flick experience, and there would still be room for stuffing his left nut in his gouged eye socket."
"zanity","Null","2","4","20 March 2006"," If you approve of real-life torture, you will love 'Hostel'
","I have just watched ""Hostel"", and as a result, my mind is filled with a vast amount of anger and disgust at the content of this film. I am not the world's biggest horror fan, but will certainly watch 'mainstream' movies in this genre. ""The Devil's Rejects"" wasn't to my taste (athough I loved its prequel), but the film had many praise worth qualities, and proved Rob Zombie to be a director worthy of much bigger and better projects. ""Saw"" was great, ""Saw 2"" hohum.<br/><br/>""Hostel"" however, doesn't even pretend to be a horror film. It is, instead, nothing more than a plea for the re-acceptance of the use of torture in the real world.<br/><br/>The film is cheaply made, with useless acting, and a cheap nasty use of untouched abandoned industrial locations. However, it is in this that the film is TOTALLY honest, for the film is concerned ONLY with scenes of torture and sadism, devoid of any context or dramatic purpose. The film ONLY comes to life when a torture scene is showing. The rest of the time, ""Hostel"" is like a very very inferior copy of a plot-free version of ""An American Werewolf in Paris"".<br/><br/>In the opening scene of ""The Evil That Men Do"", a low rent Charles Bronson thriller, we witness a bunch of would-be torturers receive a practical classroom lesson in the art of inflicting pain and humiliation on a real-life male and female victim. ""Hostel"" was made as a pure piece of desensitisation for such an audience.<br/><br/>I'm sure the renamed ""School of the Americas"", the main facility in the US for training the leaders of death squads that operate in various Latin America nations, has already placed a giant order for DVD copies of ""Hostel"" to use as a teaching aid.<br/><br/>There is NO black humour in ""Hostel"". No dark subversive comment. No plot to speak of. No irony and no invention. No decent editing, and no decent cinematography. The East European landscape is cheaply and artlessly shot. The sexual nudity is tedious in the extreme. All these negatives allow the film-makers to purify the central purpose of their film, an act of pure worship at the temple dedicated to the worst of Human crimes, murder by torture.<br/><br/>""Hostel"" has but one message, that torture is now to be accepted as a normal part of the Human experience. When the use of torture by the West became commonplace in US facilities in Afghanistan, Iraq, Cuba, and many ex-Soviet-controlled nations (eg., US military bases in Poland and Romania), we had a choice. To howl our outrage, and return Western Civilisation back to the values previously in place for at least the last two hundred years. Or to quietly submit, and embrace the new age of depravity. The makers of ""Hostel"" believe that we have voted for depravity, and wish to cheer that result as loudly as possible.<br/><br/>As a side observation, why was the film giving Slovakia such a kicking? Is this rivalry between the successful Czech Republic, and the other part of the former nation of Czechoslovakia. Torture and racism, what a lovely combination.<br/><br/>I can't score this movie for obvious reasons. However, if I could score for evil intent, ""Hostel"", like John Wayne Gacy, would score a perfect 10.<br/><br/>For those of you that would seek to misunderstand my position, I would explain that I am too squeamish to watch the whole of even the 'cut' version of Hellraiser 2, but I would NEVER dream of describing that film as evil. The often stupid and tasteless Italian exploitation horror movies of the 70's and 80's likewise always have some merit, and would never be described by myself as evil. For me, ""Hostel"" is a first."
"Sanguineusbasi","1","2","4","17 March 2006"," No style!!....... Tarantino??.....
","My god!! What happened to Tarantino to be involved in such crap? Kill Bill was already not as good as the critics claimed it to be. Be honest, nothing new after Pulp Fiction.... just some chicks swinging blades with so-called ""style"". Well, i guess we won't get any more excellence and style after movies like PF and Reservoir Dogs from mr Tarantino, especially if he teams up with Eli Roth. On the other hand Sin City really kicked ass, but that is only due to Rodriguez and Miller.<br/><br/>About Hostel >> what the f**k is going on? People speaking German in the Netherlands, Czech in Slowakia? Three main characters with the summed IQ of 3... a dozen of chicks adding maybe a few more. Every scene makes it more unbelievable and the ""shocking"" part of the movie is replaced with numbness and disgust. While i really think it could be much better with good actors, good storyline, and at least some style. But then you would have a completely different movie.... I think the psychos were quite stupid, paying so much money, getting dressed like butchers, whistling a song, and then kill your victim quickly. Sorry, it's just style-less. And then i won't talk about the silly scene with the motor saw. Please! Better watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre again. This movie does not deserve to be hyped like it has been already so far. It's just pathetic. For me it ranks in the worst movies bottom 10 together with a movie called ""Pleasure Island"" i watched in South Africa once. And i think the people in Eastern Europe will not like it either, because it is projected as some sort of third world were only retards and maffia live. It simply is totally not like that, even a retard can see... ;-) The real retards gave this movie over 2 points. What can i say? Never seen any movie before?"

But what held me was the atmosphere. An Eastern European setting was perfect for this movie. Yes it contained elements that you'll find in any horror...crazy teenagers, etc. but it was this same setting and atmosphere that had me glued. If it was shot in the US I'd probably not like it so much. I recommend you give this a watch and then tell me if you would like to visit a strange Slovakian town in your next vacation trip. However, the story could've had a bit more meat in it and probably no teenagers."

"brokebob2000","9","2","4","4 February 2006"," Eli Roth Avoids The Sophomore Slump...Makes Shock Cinema Accessible to American Mainstream Audiences
","RUN! Run as fast as your spindly American legs will take you to the nearest movie theater playing ""Hostel."" I understand this is going to be hard since the film was released in early January and most theaters don't hold a film of this nature for more than a couple of weeks, but find it!<br/><br/>Like so many jaded horror fans of yesteryear, I approach the modern slasher flick with very low expectations. Even when they're the follow-ups to films that I like. In this case, I was a pretty big fan of writer/director Eli Roth's debut feature Cabin Fever. Not so much for its outstanding achievements in horror, since it was, after all, just a cleverly crafted retread of many other horror movies. No, more because it reflected Roth's obvious enthusiasm for a then-dead genre and gave us plenty to laugh and marvel at. <br/><br/>When I learned of Hostel, I wondered if Eli could deliver a superior horror movie in a market flooded with bad Japanese remakes (""The Grudge,"" ""Dark Water,"" etc.) and bad American horror sequels (""Saw 2,"" ""The Ring 2""). But his name was on it and I am nothing if not loyal. So I went to see it with my lovely and loyal assistant, figuring it would be a good way of getting her to cling to me for two hours in a darkened room. <br/><br/>As fate would have it, I ended up being the one squeezing her arm until it turned blue and ""Hostel"" proved to be one of the most queasy, enervating emotional experiences in cinema. <br/><br/>The music was overly-dramatic at moments that were unnecessary and served only to dumb down the First (and most tiresome) Act. The first 25-35 minutes of the film seem to crawl by as the two sight-seeing friends and their drifter companion go to every arbitrary disco, orgy and hash bar from here to Bratislava. Not that I'm judging. After all, these are a group of horny guys let loose in the sexually and chemically liberated streets of Amsterdam. It just gets a little old.<br/><br/>But even at its less thrilling points, the film kept our eyes open with color and Frat boy humor. Examples of this can be found in the casting of the tweaked out European kid with the mole lip who tells our main characters about the hostel in Slovakia. If Corey Feldman and Dov Tiefenbach (see: Jason X) smoked a bunch of crack and had a love child, this guy would be it. The silhouette scene, a moving shot through a bluish-hued corridor of sexual abandon, was not just artfully done, but served as a sharp foreshadowing contrast to what awaits the young men at ""The Art Exhibit."" Another highlight that keeps the film moving when it sputters out is the Bubblegum Gang, a group of impoverished little kids who roam the town, mugging tourists.<br/><br/>There are only a scant few places in this world that share the architectural beauty and weirdness that Slovakia possesses in the film. At first glance (before the bodily fluids are spraying everything within arm's length), it looks like something out of Babes in Toyland or March of the Wooden Soldiers. <br/><br/>When the film gets going and the torture begins, that's when you remember why you paid full price to see it on the big screen. The torrent of bloody extremities and high-pitched screams are just a fraction of what Roth and Co. have concocted here. In each of the major torture sequencesparticularly in the case of a character choking out globs of vomit and tears through his ball gagthe anguish and fear are so unrelenting and real that you almost feel like you are watching the introduction to a snuff filmaccompanied by a motion picture score. <br/><br/>The film is a massive achievement for filmmaker Roth, even if he never makes another film like this again. Some would say, especially if he doesn't (alas, we'll never know since Eli has already signed up for the sequel). The visceral terror, the sheer realism of each of these scenes, is mind-boggling and when you think about it, it must be a lot harder as a filmmaker to provoke these sorts of emotions in your actors than it is to tell Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger to act gay. It's a far cry from the exaggerated ""I made it! I (expletive deleted) made it! BANG! BANG!BANG!"" of Cabin Fever. No sophomore slump here. In fact, Hostel is proof positive that real talent can only grow as it goes along.<br/><br/>From the creepy whistling of the Dutch Dissector to the heavy, excited breathing of the German Surgeon, there is nary a moment for one to catch their own breath once the horror begins. The desperation, how tight you'll cling to your life, is what really grinds the nerves into pixie dust. When we see a potential victim pleading with his would-be killer in the killer's native tongue, a language the victim doesn't he speak fluently, we realize that we will stop at nothing to keep our hearts beating.<br/><br/>And if you were afraid the film wouldn't have any time for memorable lines amid all the bloodshed, just wait until you meet the American businessman who is so fired up about killing somebody that he nearly bludgeons himself to death with his own gun. This role is played with expert wanna-be macho energy by Rick Hoffman. <br/><br/>Hostel is easily the most deliciously disturbing and formidably real horror film of the 21st Century. And what it lacks in subtle build-up to harrowing events, it makes up for in the very events in question."
"scabpicker","10","2","4","24 January 2006"," Eli Roth is a comedic GENIUS
","Cabin Fever was the first film to get me laughing out loud in a movie theater. I absolutely worshiped the sick humor; however, I did not find it scary. Hostel, on the other hand, was even funnier and much more intense. The first half of the film is all set up, and the scariest images for these 45 minutes are all nasty fake boobies. But when the ball gets rolling it plows everything in it's path, faster and harder than all the whores in Amsterdam combined! I must say, by the time I saw it I was kind of desensitized to a lot of the graphic imagery because of all the preemptive hype. Yes, it gets nasty, the ""eye-ball scene"" is gross, but I really didn't think that much of the film was any more graphic than an episode of nip/tuck. I debated for a long time as to whether-or-not i wanted to see this because I'm really squeamish, but I'm soooo glad I did. It was an absolute blast, one of the most satisfying movies I've sat through all year."

","I thought this movie was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Too much sex and not enough real gore. And there was no real point to what gore you did see. The story concept was good but executed very poorly. Made what little respect I had for Quinton that much less. I think that most of what happened could have been accomplished and portrayed without all the sexual visuals. That is my main beef with this film. When half the movie is based on sex (which really didn't have much to do with the gore part) before you even get to the gory part then there is a problem when the movie is supposed to be a horror flick about the gore. The sex scenes weren't in the previews which makes the previews misleading. If it wasn't in the preview even a little then it really didn't seem that important. They wanted to concentrate on the gore and scare tactics instead (which wasn't all that scary or gory but it does take a lot for me to get grossed out). Keep in mind this is my personal opinion and you can make up you own minds but I wouldn't see or recommend this to anyone."

The plot is extremely weak and you definitely don't have any sympathy for the main characters in the movie.

I am the first to admit I loved Natural Born Killers and Pulp Fiction and even Four Rooms. The violence within those films was an appropriate fit. But they weren't made soley for the 'gore-factor'. So do yourself a favor, save your time and money and see a movie where you might actually learn something. At this point I recommend just about anything else, as I am sure it would receive eight more stars than this pile of garbage."

","I have to say that i am an aspiring film maker and i think Eli Roth is awesome. As much as i adore Dario Argento, Quentin Tarintino, Lucio Fulci, and others, as of right now you are my favorite. I thought Hostel was brilliant. Everyone, including myself was expecting extreme gore and the sickest stuff imaginable. But, i thought it was better the way you made it because it left so much to the imagination. and i thought it was full of suspicion, and loneliness, and the thought of ever enduring that kind of pain and torture, to me it is so realistic because the stuff does happen. At first I was like, this is okay, but the more i thought about it the more i liked it and to me that is the kind of reaction i would want for my films. something to think about after the film is over. And let me say, i also adore Takashi Miike. And to have in your film even for 15 seconds was beautiful. I was the only one in the theater who knew who he was. meeting the Japanese master of horror for you, would be like me meeting you. keep up the good work, and i'll keep being inspired. thank you for listening, Kelly from West Virginia."

","When I initially saw the trailer for Hostel (as a trailer for Saw2, which sucked worse), I had very high hopes for this movie. Imagining a place where total depravity could be bought in eastern Europe was extremely enticing and given that Roth put out a movie like Cabin Fever, with classic gross out scenes like the girl being finger banged and discovering that the bloke was fingering a hole in her leg, made me think that this movie could hold some promise. Sadly, I was seriously mistaken. Though this movie did sort of put out in terms of gore, as well as t and a, the plot, story, and acting sucked so hard I could hear it. Give me a box cutter, a blowtorch, some rope, a baseball bat, and a DV CAM and I could put together a 15 minute short that would really freak you out. Lions Gate needs to stop putting out ""horror"" movies (aside from the original Saw and the Devil's Rejects) and stick to making movies like Crash (which seems more their speed). Do not waste your time with this film, if I could have I would have given it a .5 instead of a 1. Go out and rent something like Last House on the Left if you want something from the horror genre that doesn't totally suck for starters."
"cohen_justin","1","2","4","17 January 2006"," Do Not See this Movie!!
","This movie, is, by far and away, the worst movie I have ever seen. Without ever significantly developing any of the characters, this movie fails to generate an atmosphere consistent with a movie about torture. The film clearly lacked not just the monetary capital necessary to complete such an adventurous endeavor, it lacked the intellectual capital to pull off a meaningful, or even mildly entertaining film about torture. Moreover, this abomination of a flick, is too scared to actually show torture, despite being marketed in such a way as to sell itself on this horrid human behavior. At least such an experience would have generated some emotion in it's audience. The film, however, fails to provoke any thought, capture any interest, or generate any emotion in its audience. Overall, and in all of the specifics, this movie is simply awful!!!!"
"Rathko","9","2","4","17 January 2006"," Eye Gouging as Political Statement
","After the shockingly inept 'Cabin Fever' nobody could have been as stunned as I was to find that 'Hostel' is actually a very good movie.<br/><br/>Firstly, Roth manages to bring a surprising sense of authenticity to the story. Anybody who has spent anytime backpacking around Europe will recognize the seemingly insane risk-taking, the unlikely friendships, the co-ed dorm rooms, the intensity of short-lived friendships, and the very real sense of poverty, resentment and depression lying just under the surface of quaint, picture postcard villages in post-Communist Eastern Europe. By hiring local actors, and choosing to film on location, rather than on the generic Euro-backlot at Universal studios, Roth is able to give the whole film an unusual degree of realism that lifts the film above its generic genre foundations.<br/><br/>Secondly, Roth purposefully avoids the usual, vaguely racist, cliché of portraying every American as attractive, funny, and likable, and every European as either mildly inbred or wildly pompous. In 'Hostel', the American backpackers are depicted as the arrogant and patronizing teenagers that so many of them are. When Paxton complains that Slovakian television should carry English subtitles so visiting Americans can understand it, we are invited not to laugh along with him, but to shake our heads at his stupidity. It's rare, and refreshing, for a mainstream teen-orientated horror flick to be so derogatory against its own audience.<br/><br/>Thirdly, Roth's screenplay isn't afraid to take its time. In an age when horror films are expected to start piling up the corpses well before the end of the first reel, it seems almost revolutionary to see a script harking back to the genre's 1970's heyday. Characters are actually introduced and developed, and the plot slowly and believably evolves at a refreshingly leisurely pace. Even the climax has an old-school simplicity about it; logical and satisfying, without feeling the need for some tired twist ending.<br/><br/>Performances are universally sound, but Jan Vlasak is brilliant as the deeply disturbed businessman traveling half a continent to secretly give expression to his sociopathic fantasies. He gives us a fascinating character, generating a subtlety and depth that deserved more screen time.<br/><br/>'Hostel' is an excellent horror movie; one of the best of recent years. In grounding his story in a believable post-Communist landscape, in which the 'villains' are simply pursuing the Capitalist dream of making money at any cost, Roth manages to make a political statement whilst cutting off toes with boltcutters. And that's no small feat."
"greenshields","10","2","4","15 January 2006"," A brilliant film, among the best horror films I have seen.
","Hostel is one of the most genuinely horrifying films I have seen. It begins by introducing us to a couple of likable, open, and friendly young men, backpacking through Europe with all the confidence and unawareness of well to do students from the center of the earth, exploring the quaint folks who aren't like them. But they are basically decent, occasionally reflective guys out for an experience they can't get or wouldn't indulge in at home. They want to have a good time before committing to the proverbial gray flannel suits of careers, grad school, etc., and so they begin in Amsterdam's center of sex. drugs and rock'n'roll. Sex is really the major object of their quest, and the first part of the film documents it all with a sort of boy's eye view that keeps it interesting, even alluring, without quite going to porn. Then we have a nicely paced transformation, using the odd creepy or awkward incident and the excitement of beauty and mild debauchery. Gradually beauty turns to ugliness and piquant exotic pleasures become dangerous, until we enter a relentless hell that is pretty scary. There are several neat developments that aren't cheating, but are nonetheless entirely unexpected. The whole thing is subtly done with real acting, character development, and dialogue, so that when bad things happen to people, you care about it. The backpackers are relatively little known and very talented players, as are the women they meet, who behave like student tourists and mysterious libertines rather than horror movie bimbos. It's interesting that there have been some protests about the gore, because it is actually fairly limited, very well contextualized, and has none of the campy excess that we have come to expect from horror films. In fact it is really quite unpleasant and not at all titillating or amusing. Moreover, there is no reliance on supernatural effects, or monstrous people rising for one last slashing after we thought they were dead. The enemy in this one is definitely us, or at least some of us, and that's what makes it terrifying."
"klw910","3","2","4","15 January 2006"," Very Disturbing Should have walked out.
","Way too graphic for my taste and yes it was disturbing, distressing and upsetting. I arrived and sat next to a couple of kids and their mom. First thing on the screen were the 3 young men out looking for a good time in Amsterdam smoking pot followed by scenes with strong sexual content. Wondering what these kids are doing here? My guess the boys were less then 10-years old way too young for this movie.<br/><br/>I will say I don't normal go to horror flicks, I see why now. Don't get me wrong I think some are done very well. ""The Shining"" is a great example and more recent ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" another good example. I do go to movies every week so I figure I paid for this better sit through it. In some ways the plot and acting were well done the scenes were very real, in some ways to real. The torture scenes were especially brutal and violent and not the things I would want any kids to see. To tell the truth I didn't want to see them being that graphic. It's hard for me to believe that so many people are this desensitized that there is such a demand for this kind of cruelty/torture. It's also a little untimely with U.S. in the news bringing detainees to eastern block countries to be tortured.<br/><br/>After leaving I found it tough to shake the brutal scenes and felt violated in some ways for sitting through it. Not sure why I stayed, it's been a long time since I walked out on a movie, should have trusted my instincts and walked out..."
"cynnicalrj","2","2","4","15 January 2006"," Why the hype?
","Having heard that Hostel was one of the most successfully frightening and atmospheric additions to the new wave of horror/grind-house influenced movies, I was excited to see this. Reading reviews online which noted people vomiting and being unable to sit through the movie comfortably only added to my expectation for a satisfying film.<br/><br/>The movie did not deliver on any this. No cringes (save for a third-act ""artistic"" decision where the protagonist cowboys up with a gun and exacts revenge), no real connection to the story, and honestly two moments where I felt even a frisson of fear.<br/><br/>SPOILER The first moment that worked for me was when Josh comes to in the factory, hooded and the viewer is provided a POV shot. Very atmospheric and well done. The subsequent torture scene gave me hopes that the movie was going to commit to the premise and pay off after a slow build. Roth cuts away from moments and allows the audience to imagine the torture instead of seeing all of it, a smart move if the audience is later rewarded with a scene that is truly horrific. Sadly, we don't get to see this. Only flashes of other nameless characters being tortured and flogged as Paxton is being taken into the factory.<br/><br/>The second bit of business that worked was the severing of the optic nerve. A nice bit of old fashioned gore where the camera doesn't back off. END SPOILER<br/><br/>Overall, Hostel didn't engage me. Granted, part of the fun of these movies is seeing the characters picked off and waiting for it to happen. These characters, with the exclusion of Josh, are so unlikeable you end up waiting for them to die so that the story will progress and the movie will finally be over. Apologists might argue that Roth is taking the staples of the genre and reworking them--if this is indeed the case, it's a tactic that does not pay off.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the are moments where I thought the film might gain some momentum and really deliver. This never happens. During the opening credits I was excited to see that Greg Nicotero was in charge of effects make-up. Having recently watched Land of the Dead I was anticipating the possibilities of what he might deliver. The make-up effects are overall ineffective. And in the third act there is a remarkably unrealistic facial effect. What works in a dimly lit environment in daylight reads as grotesque as a kid playing with ketchup or maybe dyed Kayro syrup.<br/><br/>For me, Hostel is a fascinating failure. You're presented a well-made movie that has potential to be disturbing. Sadly, the movie never delivers on this."

I had a few laughs with it, the horror was absolutely pathetic... the acting was so absurd... some great movies are made low-budget and they turn out great.. and had not Mr. Tarrantino supported it, I think it would have been a total flop... do not count on any of the horrible actors to make it big time any time soon... at least I don't.

"Alpha_and_Omega","2","2","4","14 January 2006"," That's called Entertainment?
","I went and saw Hostel on the night of January 12th. I thought that the movie was.... interesting. Drugs... Sex... Gratuitous Blood and Gore. Not my *personal* cup of tea, but for a horror flick, it wasn't what could be called bad. But was I entertained? No. I went in expecting a few jumps, a little blood, and some flying body parts, which is all standard when you consider Horror Film + Quentin Tarentino. What I got was a gore-fest wrapped around a thin, but plausible, storyline and 25 minuets of sex. I, personally, didn't blow $20 to go see a movie that would make me nearly throw up 6 times and have me question my travel destinations for the next few years. The main thing that bugged me about this movie was the fact that they used such visual depictions of the torture acts instead of using the standard 'pan-offscreen-and-listen-to-the-screams' technique to convey the message of 'holy crap, that guy just got DRILLED!'The whole point of this is to say: It may have just been a Horror film, but was it entertaining? In my opinion, NO! I hope the next time that someone decides to make a film like this, they keep in mind that it's not the amount of blood on the screen, it's how many people you make scream that decides if a Horror flick is good or not.<br/><br/>The two worst parts of this whole film are as follows: First is the ending, where you see a great protagonist degenerate into a killer, even if it is to kill the guy that killed his best friend. The second is Poor, poor Kana. After seeing her torched face in a plexiglass poster cover, then throwing herself infront of a train.... not a good thing to see. This is not a movie for the weak of stomach, or the faint of heart. But if gratuitous Blood, Sex and Gore is your cup of tea, then I say: Go for it!"

Even when the ""torturing"" scenes started it seemed like they kept leading you up to really gruesome scenes only to cut to a different scene as soon as it started to get good.

"scud_muffin","9","2","4","11 January 2006"," If you HATED Cabin Fever, you probably won't like this
","In my opinion Hostel was great, but I also really enjoyed Cabin Fever. I wouldn't vote Hostel as a horror in the traditional sense, but the same elements that made Cabin Fever good are what make Hostel good as well. The things I am referring to are the ""gross out"" factor and the horror in realizing ""this could happen in real life.""<br/><br/>Hostel wasn't scary. It had some pretty gruesome scenes, but I almost expected more. There was heavy drug use, sex and lots of nudity. If I rented a movie LIKE Hostel, I probably wouldn't think it was very good or recommend it to anyone. But the movies isn't LIKE Hostel, it IS Hostel.<br/><br/>A quick summary: Two friends travel to Europe at some point, I think the summer before their senior year in college. They meet a European guy (Ole) and travel as a trio. Their main goal: getting drunk, high and laid. After traveling all over Europe they realize that everywhere is overrun with Americans (like themselves) and they want to get somewhere a little more secluded, with hotter girls and less tourists. After a random encounter with a guy in Amsterdam, they are on their way to a small town in a Slavic nation (on his advice, of course). Once they arrive they meet the hottest girls on their entire trip and have lots of sex and drink lots. Ole vanishes and they try to look for him. They decide to wait a little while, when the ""nice guy"" of the duo also goes missing (both people missing include scenes of torture/death and a not so clear but easy to figure out message that is the main point of the movie). Finally the cocky guy demands to the people they have met to be taken to his friend, and he is taken to a gain warehouse where the torture/death takes place. As it turns out, he is next. I won't explain more, as it would ruin the ending (which I found surprising).<br/><br/>Most people look at Cabin Fever (and I think eventually Hostel will be looked at the same way) as a horrible teen horror movie; sadly these people miss the point. The overarching factors that turn Hostel from a mediocre, gruesome, B horror flick into a cinematic... well not masterpiece, but something really good... is the fact that A) this could really happen, and for all I know does happen and nobody knows about it (the actual horror element) B) Eli Roth KNOWS that's (not good) what the movie seems like, and makes his ""horror"" a bit... lighthearted... which gives it a little something extra C) Roth makes so many homages to old horror movies, you know he appreciates the genre and lastly D) He (Roth) never wanted to make crappy horror flicks, so he's taken a general idea and made it something all his own.<br/><br/>If you absolutely HATED Cabin Fever, you probably won't like Hostel. If you go into the movie expecting to have your pants scared off... you're out of luck. If you expect this to be something it's not (so far what the general public seems to have expected of this flick) then you will be disappointed. If you're ready to see something with a good story that utilizes a great idea, some pretty gruesome and interesting torture/killing scenes and enjoy yourself for 95 minutes OR if you ""got"" Cabin Fever and ""get"" Eli Roth - this movie was made just for you, and you won't be disappointed."

","I recently saw the film Hostel hoping for some terrifying film that lived up to both the hype and appearance of the trailers and the publicity. I am sad to say it does not accomplish either of these things. The gore that is so ""over the top"" is, for the most part, off screen, and only implied. The plot is simply a device to put people is situations of terror, which simply aren't terrifying enough to make this movie worth watching. I'd even like to say that this movie is so bad it's worth the laugh, but it simply is not. The first half runs with the plot depth of an average dirty movie. The second half seems to only be the setting for the torture of the ""stars"" of the film. This film is truly awful. Cabin Fever was enjoyable, and I had hoped that this director's follow up would be worth the watch, but sadly it just seems to fall somewhere below what Saw and Saw II have presented in recent years, which really isn't saying much."
"MovieCriticMarvelfan","7","2","4","11 January 2006"," Not that bad a movie
","I liked ""Hostel"" for the most part, I expected a ""SAW"" ripoff but I was glad that they altered the plot to not make it into another serial killer movie. <br/><br/>With that said, it is pretty violent, however amazingly I still think it wasn't too gory afterwards probably because I've seen my fair share of movies like these (Audition, CAT III)<br/><br/>Yes it's predictable, silly in some parts but in horror movies that goes with the territory. In this day and age after a million horror movies have been released over the past thirty years it's hard to be shocking or original anymore. <br/><br/>The acting was OK, the plot good, the twists OK as well. For me the second half of the film saves it, they even managed to add some humor to it. I have to admit as well when the American tourists who is still alive goes on his revenge spreed, the Audience I saw it with loved it....especially we'll you'll see. <br/><br/>(Spoilers)<br/><br/>We'll the plot gives a lot away a couple of horny American guys go aboard to Europe and find the ""Hostel"" hotel where they think they're fantasies will come true.<br/><br/>Enter Natalya and Svetland the local sluts who in fact are part of the torture ring in which they get paid for their ""services""<br/><br/>Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are too naive to see what's going and when they get drunk they fall for the trap.<br/><br/>Josh is tortured brutally (as with all the other victims in the slaughterhouse).<br/><br/>There were some memorable images, Paxton's ""tour"" of sorts inside this asylum is very creepy. Especially when he sees that this bastards clearly are getting a sick satisfaction of doing this.<br/><br/>He escape by sheer luck , and thus his revenge takes place. Hernandez is good in this although there's not too much character development. His revenge is pretty well played out though.<br/><br/>I'am sure we might see more blood and mayhem on a DVD cut but for now Hostel is a pretty entertaining but perverse little flick.<br/><br/>It was as Quentin and Roth admit filmed on a low budget and it shows but they do manage to use that to an advantage setting up some creepy shots and delivering the ""goods"" when the movie calls for it.<br/><br/>It ain't that bad of a movie, Quentin did produce it so it ain't too bad. Now there's word of a possible ""Hostel 2"". Interesting stuff. I would recommend but be warned of the content."
"SmakethDown638","9","2","4","11 January 2006"," Not scary, but still very fun!
","I saw this movie and it was fun to watch. Now, people complain about the acting. I didn't expect great acting because based on the trailer, I was anticipating a Slasher/Survival type film. So what mindset do you go with? Why Friday the 13th, Elm Street, or Texas Chainsaw Massacre of course. The character development was decent at best. Sure, there is still lots to be desired as to why the ""Elite Hunting"" was formed and the background behind that. There's also the mystery of what happened to the Dutch businessman who wanted to be a surgeon. However, the story is still solid. The torture wasn't as intense in the scenes like I was hoping, but the psychological impact definitely can be felt when watching this. Proof? How bout on some parts, I actually had some chills. That tells you something. The kids attacking the car was sort of cool because it reminds you of the classic film, ""Children of the Corn."" The kids are their own posse and will do anything to satisfy themselves. It's almost like a parallel to the ""Elite Hunting."" The people that work there WANT MONEY TO TORTURE PEOPLE! The kids want SIMPLE BUBBLEGUM OR COINS AND THEY ARE WILLING TO JUMP THE ELITE HUNTERS! Sorry, had that reaction about that scene after reading a comment by someone who felt that scene didn't make sense. The pay off for the whole thing was great too. It all comes full circle in the end. <br/><br/>This film did a solid job at pointing out how society is today. Many people love sex and drugs and aren't responsible enough for their well-being. Then there are some people who are responsible, but get belittled by party-animals because they aren't as hardcore as them. There was some great symbolism of the old saying, ""nice guys finish last."" The proof here was Josh not making it. The greed in society was portrayed here as people were willing to do anything for money. Those people were the ones who didn't care about the lives of the others in the torture chamber so to speak. It shows that bribery in society can work and people can be easily brainwashed.<br/><br/>I think usage of flashbacks for the ""Elite Hunting"" and the Dutch businessman would've helped this movie more. Other than that, no complaints here as this was a fun little roller coaster ride once everyone got to Slovakia."

Considering all the crap people were talking about his debut i was hoping Eli would silence all of the naysayers once and for all... man, was i wrong. This film wasn't anything i was expecting. I was hoping for some sick, sadistic, demented film and what i got was the exact opposite. The first hour was nothing but the word ""Fuq"", and copious amounts of boobs(not that there is anything wrong with either) it just felt as if some kid was in charge of the entire first act of the film and he was showcasing his immaturity. Then people start to disappearing and waking up handcuffed to a chair in some dingy looking dungeon while a stranger starts hacking away at them. Not a bad premise for a film at all, but the film was poorly executed and the gore was held to a bare minimum. The Fulci-esquire ""eye"" scene was the only cool part of this so called horror film. Good luck next time Eli."

","I just got back from watching Hostel. Couple of friends and I went on the premise that it would be along the lines of 'Saw' and 'Saw 2'. I actually enjoy gore movies; a good portion of my movie collection has some level of gore in it. Psycho thrillers are definitely a favorite. So, why on earth did I hate this movie? Because it has no plot and serves to satisfy only two cravings, that for gratuitous nudity and copious amounts of blood, gore and psycho guys doing the blooding and goring. The feeble attempts at creating a plot are strung along with these weak characters that I have no connection with.<br/><br/>Indeed, it does make one want to vomit or at the very least turn your stomach. For that alone I give this 2 stars. I am sadly disappointed that Quentin Tarantino had anything to do with this movie. It is not his caliber of film.

"ItWasWritten","9","2","4","9 January 2006"," HOSTEL is absolutely amazing....some people do not get the point...Go see it!!
","First of all, some people that have given this movie bad reviews on this site are people that like to see visual gore like in Braindead, which is extremely laughable by the way.<br/><br/>Hostel is more psychological than visual. In order to feel the terror, you have to imagine that you are part of it. For example, imagine if you are Paxton strapped in that chair with that German man revving the chainsaw right in front of your face. Now that is complete terror, especially because of the stuff that Paxton sees when he is being dragged to the room.<br/><br/>Many people complain about the nudity and there is a good amount. However, that is what makes this realistic. I know many people that want to go to Europe to look for women and smoke. It is something many adolescents want to do and I thought that these characters were extremely realistic in that aspect. The nudity sets the tone and makes the torture even more horrifying because of the humorous tone during the first half.<br/><br/>I read a review with the writer not knowing why Paxton went back to save the Japanese girl. Well, if you paid attention during the movie, you would have heard Paxton talk to Josh and telling him about a traumatizing experience he had when he was kid, with another kid drowning and him not doing anything about it....and constantly waking up with screaming sounds of the mother of the drowning child.<br/><br/>Another person did not know how Paxton knew that the Dutch businessman was part of it at the end. Well, that man was the first room he saw when he entered the ""art exhibit"" and he saw the Dutch man clearly dissecting another body (Josh I believe).<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie was amazing and had me very excited at the end. The movie theater I was in started clapping when it ended, and the movie deserved it. You really feel for the characters because you can relate to them; Josh reminded me of my friend Eric and Oli was the hilarious horny dude everyone knows.<br/><br/>Overall, the ""art exhibit"" is very creepy and the killers are even creepier. Once again Hostel is movie is more psychological than visual, and I think that makes it even scarier; Braindead was a comedy with a bunch of cheesy gore. If you want to see a very good horror movie with enough gore, go see Hostel...you will not be disappointed <br/><br/>KB"

The promise of a good, nasty throwback to the 70s exploitation flicks of yesteryear, the promise of terror and brutality, up there on the big screen, clawing the audience's eyes out while we keep a nice, safe distance, free to shield ourselves and whimper in fear.<br/><br/>Oh, and Quentin Tarantino was involved, so you KNOW it has to be edgy and unique... apparently. And, landie dearie me, folks, the biggest reaction the film got from the audience was when - in one scene - Pulp Fiction happened to be on television. I don't think anyone would have bothered with this movie if the title hadn't been under Tarantino's name in the previews. <br/><br/>Going in to see Hostel I'd already seen Cabin Fever, Eli Roth's first outing into gore/horror/slapstick/whatever cinema, and I loved it. Absolutely loved it. I loved it in that way that any movie that is so damn weird and entertaining deserves to be loved.<br/><br/>Coming out of Hostel I wish I had stayed home and rented Cabin Fever.<br/><br/>I went with two friends... Meg and Alan. Alan is a huge fan of movies in general and Cabin Fever, specifically. Meg hails from Hiroshima, and after a lifetime of Japanese horror flicks she has developed quite an appetite for scary movies. I just like to have a good time.<br/><br/>We were all pretty disappointed.<br/><br/>The first half of Hostel was absurd. For anyone under the age of 14 who really, really, REALLY likes to masturbate, the first hour of Hostel will be bliss, I assure you. I have never seen so much nudity in one sitting (outside of a porno flick, at least) and I cringe to think that I may ever, ever encounter a naked woman ever again in my entire life, because Hostel has pretty much broken me of ever wanting to see that. So, dare I say it, but way too many boobies, kids.<br/><br/>We are handed a few characters and by virtue of the fact that they're on the screen we're expected to care about them. Unfortunately, that doesn't really work and so all we have to get us through this movie are some people on the screen with whom we can't relate and for whom we feel no real attachment. The absurdity of these people and how little it was that we cared about them pretty much boils down to the fact that Alan was far more interested in the loud guy sitting behind him (as was I) and Meg kept asking me what the Japanese characters in the film were saying... because they were speaking gibberish... with incredibly phony and - Meg informed us - incredibly offensive accents: ""Tlain... we go to tlain station."" Indeed, the Japanese people on the screen didn't sound anything like the Japanese person sitting next to me. I find myself wondering, now, how many European cultures Roth was able to alienate through similar ignorance... there are a LOT of accents in Hostel.<br/><br/>So, after all the sex and boobies and drinking are out of the way, some of the characters get killed, we see some good special effects and some terrible special effects but we really don't care in the least, we sit through a few scenes that are supposed to be tense or humorous or both (but they're just dull) and then the movie ends.<br/><br/>Herein lie the spoilers:<br/><br/>Things I Have Learned From Watching Hostel<br/><br/>1) Women are there for one reason and one reason only: sex. This includes your mothers and sisters... if you can't bang 'em, they're useless to you. Don't forget that. <br/><br/>2) Homosexuality is evil and easily equivocated with brutal torture, much like Haute Tension, in that respect. <br/><br/>3) If you give children gum they will mercilessly kill for you, even though you can't explain to them what you want because you don't speak their language. <br/><br/>4) People really, really, really like to text message during movies... a LOT. <br/><br/>5) It is necessary to operate in absolute secret to seduce and kidnap people to sell them to an underground snuff club, even though every single person for miles around (including the police) are perfectly aware of said underground snuff club, and it really isn't all that secret in the least. <br/><br/>6) If you lose an eye, escape certain death and are on your way to freedom you will commit suicide because at the last moment you discover that you've lost an eye and are - we can only assume - ugly and unfit to live, so you might as well dive in front of the nearest locomotive. This only applies to women, who are only good for sex. Disfigured men can go about their lives as usual. <br/><br/>7) You can sucker audiences into watching anything so long as you hype it enough.<br/><br/>And, with regards to number 7, this seems to be the perfect, PERFECT example of a movie being over-hyped. I have never seen such a packed theater and at the same time I have never seen so many bored viewers. Nothing captivating happens during Hostel, it's impossible to care about the characters and after the first hour of nudity and debauchery, there's no room left to tell a real story. The concept is spectacular, but it wasn't given any room to move.<br/><br/>I was hoping to feel upset or disturbed by Hostel or to at least have something to think about after seeing the movie (the only lingering thought, that quickly faded, was: yeah, Europeans hate Americans... and water is wet, what else you got?). All that I felt, even the next day, was that I better write to the distributor and demand my money back so that I can give it to the guy who was sitting behind Alan... now THAT guy was the real entertainment!"
"MichaelCaz","2","2","4","9 January 2006"," Lackluster
","Let me preface this post by saying that I was really, REALLY excited to see this movie. A gore-filled horror movie stamped with Quentin Tarantino's approval (as a ""presenter"") sounded pretty good. Opening weekend, 9:30 Show... sold out, 10:30... football-field-long-line. We waited anyway. I'll cut to the chase. I thought the film was poorly written, poorly acted (for the most part), and just poorly done in general. It left nothing to the imagination, and there was simply nothing interesting about it. As far as gore is concerned (if that's all your looking for), Saw and Saw II blow Hostel out of the water. If it wasn't for the pair of gorgeous Russian girls that rarely have clothes on, this would have been a total bust. The first words out of my roommates mouth upon exiting the theater were, ""Why the hell did you want to see that?"" I spent the rest of the night explaining why I thought it sounded like it would be a great movie, and buying them beers to compensate for the disappointment. Hostel was a huge let down. Sorry folks."

","I can say this much...if i was given the chance to take the script and re-write most of it...this would be an amazing movie, but I'm sorry to say it was so bad. I have so many thoughts about the movie that can make it good...they just did it half-ass. I was expecting to see something more amazing than SAW and SAW II which i thought were brilliantly made movies..the plots of those movies were incredible, acting wasn't really good but that really didn't matter, HOSTEL on the other hand was just not good...any time there's humor in the movie thats supposed to have gore and blood then its not good I love movies and I KNOW movies...and this was not a good movie, and for me to not like a movie then it must be bad."
"thundercleesewalter","1","2","4","8 January 2006"," No spoilers here, just the truth
","This movie is possibly the worst excuse for horror that i have come across in a very long time. Granted, I have avoided nonsense like House of the Dead, but really... Don't waste your time, this movie is awful. The first part is Eurotrip without any humor and the second part is gory, but nothing too rough and pretty dull. Leaving the theater i just hung my head in shame. I am pretty sure all the positive reviews of this movie are part of a conspiracy to trick unsuspecting movie patrons into wasting their time and money on a ridiculous, plot less, pointless joke of a ""horror movie"". Also, **** YOU Tarantino YOU LITTLE ********, i have no respect for you anymore."
"lotophagi","3","2","4","7 January 2006"," Very upsetting
","Let me start by saying that I love Quentin Tarantino. I feel that everything he has made or put his name to has been outstanding. However Eli Roth has never impressed me at all. 'Cabin Fever' had to have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen; with that said, 'Hostel' does not do much of a better job.<br/><br/>This movie was not only boring but it took crude sex scenes to a new level. I can understand your standard ""B"" horror having an obligatory T&A shot along with the local tramp being had in a random place, but this was ridiculous. There was sex and no violence for a very large percentage of the movie. Nothing exciting happened at all until the last 20 minutes and even that was done in a way that was annoying. I have seen it before and am not really interested in seeing again. Come up with something new if your going to promote a movie this well.<br/><br/>My short and sweet recommendation is to wait till this comes out on cable so you can do something else until the excitement happens. I have never left a movie theatre before a movie ended but I was VERY temped this time."
"hllywdryan","3","2","4","7 January 2006"," Not impressed
","I love horror films. I love thrillers. As this film had a little of both, it didn't have much of anything else. Well, other than breasts.<br/><br/>I went into this film not expecting much. Especially after Cabin Fever. But I was even less impressed than I expected. Eli seems to go for nudity, drugs and shock value as his methods of entertaining and story telling. He doesn't seem to have much depth to his stories. The two main actors of the film did a fantastic job with what they were given, but I just wish they were given more.<br/><br/>I found the movie to be very predictable with knowing who would turn out to be who and what some one would do, but there was no real twist or point to the story. And as much as I was wishing it to end, I felt it did not have much of one when it finally came.<br/><br/>I know Eli has a few projects in the works. Including comedy. I just hope that he begins making smarter films, or he may face a direct to video career! His direction is great, but his writing is lacking."
"Dsteviesax","8","2","4","7 January 2006"," Wild ride Into the Den of Inequity and Debauchery
","Don't believe the hype but that aside This was a great scary grotesque sexy film. The direction was awesome and the acting superb. Yes there was about a half hour of nice then the HEll begins. The next step is for someone to do a film almost beginning to end pure scary horror and suspense like a roller coaster ride thru a haunted house There is a lot of sex and loads of bloody violence. Eli Roth is a very sick in a good way dynamic and insightful director. The premise is very haunting yet very realistic. Makes you wonder what became of Europe after the fall of communism. The level of human cruelty is explored to the extreme beginning with the lure of sex and independence. Great film good bloody rip roaring screaming ectasy."
"AdrocTheViking","2","2","4","7 January 2006"," Worst movie I've ever paid to see
","This movie is a terribly painful disappointment. I am not a Tarantino fan at all, but I gave this movie the benefit of the doubt, considering the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed Saw I and II (and Eli Roth is rumored to direct the third one). I think the only reason Tarantino tied himself to this movie is due to the fact that it is ridiculously gory.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was terrible. It's just a bunch of stupid kids doing drugs and screwing chicks in Europe. On top of the lack of story, the acting was so horrible, my friends and I could not stop laughing. Sure...the acting in Saw wasn't great either, but this was just far too ridiculous to take seriously. Then came the gore. I thought the gore was not only sadistic, but pointless and fake. I was waiting for this movie to redeem itself just a little bit, but it never happened. My friends and I were tempted to ask for our money back.<br/><br/>So when it comes down to it, see Hostel if you only care about the 'glorification of excess,' but if you're looking for a gory movie that's not mindless, and involves true suspense and has a point, stick to Saw and avoid this movie like the plague."
"Pete_Venkman","5","2","4","7 January 2006"," I went into Hostel looking for a ride... I left a happy little boy.
","Alright, so I went into Hostel with high expectations. The clips that have surfaced took my ""want and need"" factor up about 10 notches, and I was fully prepared for opening night. The movie started and didn't go directly into anything. The story was there, the fleshed out characters were, and the eventual gore. I won't go into it, spoiling anything, but I loved it. The shots were great, good music, good camera movements, and great acting. You really feel bad for all of them. I recommend it, but not for the weak. Four people left separately during the movie, and a lot of EWWW'n came from the audience. Excellent job, Eli. You did it again. People just don't see your films for what they are."

","writer/director Eli Roth { cabin fever } and producer Quentin Tarantino { reservoir dogs , pulp fiction ] team up to create a sick fetish from underground and deliver more disturbing images then saw and audition combined , although the film had potential i feel as if the director focused more on blood and vicious violence then a complete story . the main characters played there role as they were intended to but the plot fell downwards half way through, i can honestly say that the blood and gore saved the movie if it wasn't for the madness beyond the walls of terror this film would have been nothing more then another 8 dollars down the drain.

",". . . it's because they fell asleep and because they were tired of trying to keep their eyes open.<br/><br/>I have been on pins and needles waiting for this movie to hit the big screen and I just returned from the theater feeling like someone slapped me in the face. It's as if Quentin Tarantino(One of my favorite cinema shock masters in the U.S.) got paid off to put his name on this slop. Any average schmuck in this world could have sat down and written this script in a couple of days. If you're looking for plot twists and turns that will leave your buttocks welded to the seat, then save your money and wait for another opportunity. Tons of things could have been added to this movie to give it some spunk. Music adds to the mood and amplifies scenes; apparently whoever composed the score for the film was preoccupied by watching Survivor or something and missed out on possibly adding something to dramatically pull this out of the mud.<br/><br/>The acting was decent, but it was hard to connect with the characters due to the mind numbing plot. The first half of the film was almost pointless and left you on the edge of your seat yearning for any sort of entertainment. When the gore and the plot twist finally comes, you're already exhausted from the boring foreplay.<br/><br/>The gory aspect of the film didn't even come close to the huge rants and raves it received. If you want to spend $7 to see lots of boobs and a couple of bloody scenes, I say more power to you."

","The make up and sound effects were great, but if you're looking for a real good scare- this isn't going to do it. There is a little suspense, but really the only thing this movie is good for is the blood/gore. The plot is shaky, and it doesn't really give you time to care about the characters before stuff starts happening. I scare really easily since I haven't had a lot of experience with horror movies, but this one didn't phase me. Again, the make up effects and over all ""ew"" factor was good, but without a ""bad guy"" to focus the fear on, it ends up lacking in that department. Its creepy, as far as situational, but not enough for goosebumps."
"badtz75","Null","2","4","6 January 2006"," Good but Doesn't Fulfill the Hype
","Eli Roth's film has been hyped as the ""scariest movie in a decade"". With Tarantino attached (seemingly only for marketing/promotional reasons) and rave expectations since his previous CABIN FEVER, it's not the director's fault that this film has been pumped to the Nth degree. With the success of the SAW films and the J-Horror flicks in the past several years, we eagerly awaited this ""fresh"" concept, based on true events.<br/><br/>Paxtor (Hernandex) and Josh (Richardson) are two young Americans backpacking through Europe, focusing less on the culture and more on the booze, drugs, and women. Predictably, the characters are foils. Paxton as the brash, egotistical Type A and Josh as the more quiet, reflective, just-broke-up-with-the-girlfriend sidekick. They meet Oli (Gudjonsson) an easy-going party-animal from Iceland. Together, they enjoy the sights, scene, and sex of Amsterdam.<br/><br/>One night, they meet Alex (Silhavecky) who tells them of a city in Slovenia that is ""filled"" with women, if that's what they want. Alex shows them digital photos of him and gorgeous, naked beauties.<br/><br/>The bait has been shown and the fish are hooked.<br/><br/>Paxton, Josh, and Oli go to the Hostel recommended by Alex, but the trip is initially depressing and they are somewhat hesitant. Seemingly, their luck changes when they arrive at the hostel, a charming building which houses the three with two buxom flirts (Natalya and Svetlana) who invite them to the spa and out dancing.<br/><br/>The next morning, after a night of bliss, is when things start to go awry.<br/><br/>Roth manages to get us to this point in the film, about twenty minutes in, without much effort. The characters are stale and one dimensional, and the American-as-ignorant-tourist is over-played. Later, Paxton's ability to speak German is misused to give this idealogical conflict some meat. Unfortunately, Roth is too methodical during the gruesome torture scenes and continues to try and use the characters to send a message about Americans/capitalism.<br/><br/>While the concept is strong, the story plays out a bit amateurish. The tension is fleeting, and we only wish the torture scenes could be longer (not for the blood but to push the envelope of what these people are doing). It's unfortunate that we know very little from the torturers' sides; they are just masks. There's no twists as to who's good and who's bad. It's fairly obvious as each character is introduced as who will end up being a friend or foe.<br/><br/>As a second film for Roth, it's a good start. As for the hype, forget about it and just enjoy it for what it is, a pretty good horror flick. Hopefully Roth will forget about the Hitchcock-like directing and just focus on the in-your-face scare next time."

","""Hostel"" is a mystery horror movie in which we watch a group of friends traveling around Europe with their backpacks.

So, they are going there but everything is too good to be true and soon everything will change for them.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot and many scenes with suspense which kept me alert for the most duration of it. I also liked the direction of Eli Roth's and I believe he did a great job on it. I also liked the interpretations of Jay Hernandez who played Paxton and Jan Vlasák who played as a Dutch Businessman. I believe that either you watch this movie alone or with company you are going to have a great time since the suspense is in the most out. <br/><br/>Finally, I have to say that ""Hostel"" surprised me in a good way because it is a horror movie that combines very well horror scenes with mystery. It's an interesting movie with many twists and I believe that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I believe that if you are a fan of horror movies you are going to love it but if you are not then it's good to reconsider watching this movie."

","When three young guys Paxton( Jay Hernandez), Josh( Derek Richardson), and Oli( Eythor Gudjonsson), arrive in Amsterdam it's party time; or so they think it is? The three of them wonder what to do first. Josh, the smart one, wants to visits a disco; and the others want more action. They first hit the pubs, then go to this one disco at night. There they start trouble and eventually get thrown out. When they return, they realize they are late for curfew. They are locked out for the night, so they are pitching a fit, because it's cold. When they get the attention of another resident, Alex((Lubomir Bukovy), he tells them to come up to his room. There he has a couple doing the wild thing, in front of every one. The guys ask him about girls. Alex ask them if they want to find the best girls, they must travel east Slovakia to the Ukraine. Alex tells them that's where they will find the best, especially Slovakia. Little do Paxton, Josh, and Oli know what Alex truly is. The next day Josh, Paxton, and Oli take the train to Slovakia. While on their way they encounter a strange man, who invades their cabin. The man(Jan Vlasak) tells them he is on his way to meet his daughter. They get to talking and he puts his hand on Josh's thigh. Josh freaks out while his friends laugh it up. The man leaves in a hurry, but it's not the last time they see him. When the three arrive in Slovakia, they can't wait. They arrive at this Hostel, check in and meet these to girls. Natalya(Barbara Nedelakova) and Suatlana( Jan Kaderabkova), they both invite the guys to the spa. Well Josh, Paxton and Oli think they are in P***Y Paradise. They can't believe their luck, they all want to think Alex for the good advice. That night all three of them get lucky, but the next day they realize Oli is nowhere to be found. They go down to the desk and tell the clerk. There the desk clerk tells them that he checked out. Paxton and Josh look at each other, and decide to leave Oli a note. They leave several notes,look for him; but still no Oli.Then Kana( Jennifer Lim) another guest shows them a picture of her missing friend with Oli. Paxton tell Kana to send the picture to his phone. He gets it, and he also gets a text with I Go Home. Paxton and Josh do a W.T.F. and say maybe he did who knows? That night Paxton and Josh go out with Natalya and Suatlana. They go to the club where they drug them both, Paxton gets locked in a storeroom for the night. Josh feeling the effects of the drugs, goes back; but is never seen again. Once Paxton gets free in the morning, he calls Josh. There is no answer and Paxton knows something is up. When Paxton finds Natalya he is taken to this rundown factory. When Paxton finds out the truth and discovers what happen to Josh he tries to leave. He becomes a victim but he is able to escape. He finds some clothes and in the pocket he finds a hunting club card. He discovers what is going on. He finds out this is a murder for profit club. They kidnap people mainly backpackers, torture them and kill them for big money. Paxton is lucky he escapes along with Kana. Just when he thinks he's safe one thing still stands in his way, he must end it in order to survive this nightmare.<br/><br/>This movie is full of unnecessary gore, and makes Slovakia look like a tourist nightmare. I don't like to praise movies that make a state or Country look like S**T. It's very low class and it hurts the people who live there. The only thing I got out of this movie was a lesson. Don't Be Gullible And Trust Everyone. These kids thought they owned it all and only found trouble. To me Hostel 2 is so much better than the original, it has more of a plot, less F-Bombs, and less gore. So if you want my advice skip the first, and go directly to the sequel."

","This film starts out with 2 good looking college age guys and a drifter they picked up while backpacking. We see them wondering around in Amsterdam, doing drugs, drinking, ya know typical college kid antics. They then talk to one guy who informs them about a hostel in Slovakia where there are ""unbelievably hot girls"". Now of course they get excited and decide to go to this place. First of all, I would like to compliment Jay Hernandez and his co-star on their acting, they were very convincing in the lead roles of this movie, I enjoyed them here. The sexual content was just a little too much for my taste, I didn't care to see so much nudity, and the nudity was all female too, no male nudity, so sorry ladies and gay guys, but to be serious, the female nudity got to be a little overwhelming. The violence in this film is very graphic and will disturb some viewers, it is important to go ahead and be aware of that when u go in to watch this film. Also the two main characters in the film really are good guys, I mean yes they did a little drugs and drank and had some sex, but that doesn't make then bad guys necessarily. This movie really made me care about the 2 main guys. One of the guys really does have a big heart and is sweet and nice. Now, the violence includes an image of a severed head, it shows a girl about to get her toe chopped off, it doesn't actually show everything, but you know what is about to happen, there is also an offscreen showing of a guy getting drilled, and more stuff similar to those type of things. Just wanted to let you know all this, because if you are faint of heart, then this movie is definitely one to skip over. Now, I enjoyed the script for this movie, the script and dialogue worked very well, and nothing was cheesy and cliché about it. I really loved the atmosphere in this movie, the building in which things go on was very creepy and very atmospherically creepy. This premise of this movie is very interesting, I liked how they executed the plot. Now is the movie's violence too brutal? I think it is a little too graphic for my own personal taste, I was expecting it to be brutal, but they took the torture scenes just a little too far in my opinion. But hey it could've been much worse, movies like saw, and others of that kind have been much worse, so I am thankful that it wasn't any worse than it was. At least some things occurred offscreen and just showed screaming and the victims reaction. There is some justice served here, one of the torturers does in fact get what he deserves, so it's not like evil triumphs in this movie. A couple victims do in fact vomit while in the torture room, from fear and just sheer shock I suppose, that wasn't really pleasant, but I guess it was realistic. The movie shows very graphic images of carnage: severed hands, legs, rooms with cut open bodies and blood on the floor. Yes, some of this aftermath and carnage was an overload and was too grain graphic and unnecessary. And there is one scene in particular that was just NASTY, I mean it was very disturbing, that was the scene where one of the victims is shown hiding and sees a guy just sawing severed limbs with a chainsaw and other instruments, too graphic for my taste. Oh and also the eye scene was wayyyyy too nasty and disturbing, that was just unnecessary. Although I am glad that the characters in this movie weren't like bad people, the main characters were good guys, that was refreshing to see. This movie was not the best in the world, but it certainly was not a bad movie, it was a 7/10, I have to take off points for the overwhelming gross out imagery that didn't improve the movie, but in fact made it worse, and in my opinion, dumbed it down. But it gets points for being well written, that includes script and characters, and being well acted. And I assure you that the bad guys do not go unpunished. Hostel ended on a good and a bad note, a partially happy ending. I won't go any further about how it ends, you'll have to see for yourself, that is if you are in fact brave enough. Enter at your own risk."
"nitzanhavoc","7","0","0","15 December 2012"," Gore and torture, as promised.
","I consider myself a devout Horror fan, and try to watch as many films of the genre as possible and of as many sub-genres as I can. However, I'm not at all a gore fan, and I don't appreciate what people describe as ""torture porn"". It's simply not what I like to watch.<br/><br/>Therefore, it took me a long while to bring myself to watching Hostel, because of all that's been said about it. There's been a lot of buzz around Hostel and Saw here in Israel, and I absolutely adore the Saw series, so I thought it was about time to give Hostel a try. And it actually wasn't all that bad.<br/><br/>I'd divide Hostel into three parts. First - the build-up. Three friends go backpacking in Europe, enjoying the drugs and ladies, very Eurotrip style without the comedy (except for Oli, who's the comic relief). The second - gore and torture. Some pretty disgusting gore shoots and very disturbing physical torture. Nothing more. The third - the conclusion of the story along with the ""I Spit on Your Grave"" style vengeance. It might have been an attempt at a happy ending, though it merely showed that the victim became as bad as the antagonists...<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys gore and torture films, as these are the most powerful aspects of it. Personally, as someone who doesn't like gore and torture (have I said gore and torture yet? Well, gore and torture, plenty of it), I could have easily managed without."

A first they didn't show to much gore, than they showed a bunch of it. I can't help but feel this movie didn't even try to be serious or shocking. I thought it would have but it's done in a in your face and over the top manor. I liked the story, but it was executed poorly and seemed more for teenagers with all the elements of drugs and prolonged nudity. Eli Roth could have done better but it just turned out the same as Cabin fever, maybe even lower.

The concept as far as horrors go though was brilliant IMO!

","Good movie, bout time someone got it right. Eli Roth has totally proved that he is here and will be thrown in the ring with Wes Craven, Sean Cunningham, and John Carpenter. Anyone that disagrees with me check out ""Last House on the Left"" Wes and Sean made it right out of college, perfect example of Hostel the only difference is that with cameras and production being better Eli lost that scary home video feel, but on the other hand he really got it right with everything else. The irony in the movie is the fact that the boys buy the girls like objects but in the end they are bought like objects....the die hard fans will get that."
"luke-pauli1","7","0","0","28 October 2008"," Enjoyable, but Eli Roth could have pushed it further.
","Half silly sex farce and half gore-fest, Hostel is unworthy of the hype and controversy it received upon release. It starts excellently, mysteriously and impressively, before descending into clichéd American's in Amsterdam, looking for sex and drugs. Sure, this does provide us with plenty of boob action, but it does little to develop this characters beyond mere caricature. This first section drags, and it's only when the gruesome moments start coming that Hostel springs to life. Sliced ankles, severed fingers and pus-oozing eyeballs are just some of the lovely images you can feast on. Eli Roth intended to push audiences to their limit with this film, ""torture-porn"", but there's not nearly enough gory or inventive moments to make Hostel overly memorable, nor was I ever truly on the edge of my seat with my hands over my eyes. That being said, it is a great idea for a film and it does have it moments, but I just wish Roth had pushed it even further. Perhaps the sequel will impress me more. Your better off watching the first couple of Saw films, for a more inventive take on the ""torture-porn"" sub-genre."

","First of all, to all the negative critics of Hostel 1, stop the hating. As far as critics go, usually they only give an A rating for complex, thought-provoking, intelligent stories. zzzzzz.... Eli Roth, to me, is over the top but that is his style. I enjoy entertaining horror movies and that is exactly what Hostel is. From watching a preview, you know the kids are going to end up getting tortured. We all know all the happiness was going to end at some point. Regarding the movie being pure entertainment, I liked the script. Josh was awkwardly funny and the Icelandish guy was hilarious. The girls weren't just hot because of their looks and the much-needed nudity (horror movies always used to have nudity!!!!). The accents were great and brought creepiness to the movie. ""Sirious Ameriken"" . My only issue with Hostel and all the other horror movie that comes out nowadays is that it's just not scary at all. I think Eli Roth wanted it gory more than scary but still. I feel like the last scary movie I saw was Candyman. Eli Roth has been great but the fact that he's over the top at times turns people off. I mean Texas Chainsaw Massacre was kind of funny, especially part 2, and I like funny, but let's lean towards scary sometimes, especially for a horror movie. That's just an example of a classic horror movie that can be a bit comical. Hostel was by far Eli's best because he kept it pretty morbid. It is one of the most entertaining horror movies I have seen in a while. Hostel 2 was also pure entertainment, but he went Eli Roth on it and took it one step too far on the jokes (Goalllllllll). <br/><br/>So overall, good script, good acting, good production, good nudity and good torture. 9 out of 10."
"ladycleosombra","5","0","0","24 May 2008"," For those worried about the amount of SEX in the movie
","Okay, so this is NOT really a spoiler, perse; I'm just addressing the sex scenes.<br/><br/>Reading the other user comments, I was a bit worried about the amount of sex that would be in here. It's really NOT as bad as it seems. Here is the basic gist of the beginning: Three guys are exploring the countries and are looking to get laid. So they go to a sex club. Here you see the movements of couples in rooms behind white screens (you see their shadows.) The most revealing part in this is a S/M bondage room, but even then, you only see a woman straddling a man in black leather. Then there's a pair of boobs. That's it.<br/><br/>The guys go to this apartment and talk to a guy who will send them to a hostel where there a VERY friendly girls. Meanwhile his two friends (male and female) are stoned and are having sex. As the main characters and the guy talk, you can see the girl on top of the guy in the background for the entire conversation. But basically it's just the two of them, naked, her sitting on him. There's no moaning or frantic gyrations.<br/><br/>The last sex scene is of a guy and a girl in one bed and a guy and a girl in another. The basic action is her taking her top off and him making moaning expressions.<br/><br/>That's really the end of the sex. However, before this last sex scene, the girls invite them to the spa where everyone (the girls) walk around naked. They chat with the boys in the steam room with their tops off. If anything, that makes it LESS sexual. You stop noticing their breasts because they're not paying attention to it, either. I'm guessing this is what nude beaches are like.<br/><br/>If you're in it for the gore/horror, you might as well fast forehead to about 40 minutes into the movie. Really. Nothing, and I do mean NOTHING happens before that."

","Paxton, Josh and Oli are backpacking across Europe when they are told about a hostel in Slovakia. Once they hear that this hostel is infested with beautiful European woman who only want tourists, they quickly get on a train to the wonderful promise land. As soon as they get there, they start having the time of their lives. Soon after they arrive, they slowly start to realize that this hostel is hiding a terrible and dark secret.<br/><br/>One day, I just decided to see ""Hostel."" I've seen ""Turistas"" first and many people have said it was a complete rip-off out of this film. Well, I can see the similarities but the whole feel for the two films is different, and I actually like ""Turistas"" because it was realistic, more or less and the characters were smart.<br/><br/>Compared with ""Hostel,"" the characters are dumb, at least for the first hour. Honestly, I found the first hour a let down, not because there's not a lot of blood - I don't like that - but because it was basically a bunch of nudity and characters going around doing sex and drugs. I do, however, found Derek Richardson performance really comedic, in a good way.<br/><br/>After that hour is over, it really gets good - no, not because there's a lot of torture scenes - but because the film slowly turns to a black comedy, and I mean it in a good way. After a mediocre first hour, I was quite entertained by the last half hour. I was really cheery for the characters and laughing at the screen! If only the first hour was like that...still, that last half hour boosted my like-ness for this film.<br/><br/>The performances were decent. I, in my opinion, think that it was worth the wait for the last half hour. Sure, the first hour is just plain mediocre and un-entertaining, but what comes next is the fun part. Give this a rent if you're still unsure."

","Unlike most recent horror films, Hostel shows a genuine talent for scaring. But it also shows that to make the most of this the director needs guidance from somebody (probably somebody not Quentin Tarantino). In particular, this film needed a different scriptwriter (i.e. other than the director), a different cameraman, and a focus on what it was about, i.e. what kind of film it was. The idea of it would have made a very scary short story, and the film could have been as scary, whereas at present only a few scenes scare and the bulk of it is waste motion.<br/><br/>The writing and camera-work must be discussed together because both are to blame for the insufficiency of the build-up in the first part. Even granted the director is out to establish the protagonists' lifestyle (during their vacation) as one long hedonistic binge, this needn't have taken more than a few minutes. Where we needed to get to was where they were to end up; Hostel took too long getting them there. And once they were there, it didn't do much about this. We needed to see, with them, their first look at the country, the city, the street, &c. And with them we should have seen things that unsettled us increasingly: at first the kinds of things in other cultures you disapprove of but hesitate to condemn; then things alien, partly incomprehensible; then, in systematic progression, things that were confusing, sinister, dangerous, frightening.... Almost none of this is written into the script, and where it is, the camera-work doesn't deliver it. Some movies are able to instill landscapes with a sense of dread; sometimes you know how they do it, sometimes you don't but find your stomach unaccountably in knots; either way, some such method was required here. Most obviously wanting is the atmosphere of the hostel itself, which I'd expected to be the center of horrific activity (the movie would have been scarier if it had been; but of course this has been done before). The protagonists' experiences there should have added up to more than a few conversations with the girls; they, and we, should have come to wonder about the comings and goings of the guests (especially the goings), the behavior of the staff, movements and conversations glimpsed or overheard in the hall, through the windows, at night when everyone should be in bed.... More significant is the same want of detail of life outside. We see thieving children and a torture museum; these are too obvious, and not nearly enough. We needed to see indications of a callous, brutal environment where ordinary morals are eroded and everything is a commodity, with survival the bottom line; to see enough so when we get where the film is taking us we don't doubt for a second what we see because it's a logical extension of what we've seen before; of the very _air_ in that place.<br/><br/>Hostel's basic structure is the central horror film plot: a character happens onto a place (person, situation, &c.); at first it seems innocent, then suspect, and finally, when the character learns the truth, horrible. The basic problem with it here is the same as in almost every other film using it: it's just enough for a short subject or TV episode, and so must be stretched out to three or four times its natural length. If a film keeps to the confines of the structure, the ending is in effect no ending (that's IT?); if it goes beyond the structure into a third act, which almost has to be an account of escape or revenge, it also goes beyond the horror that is its raison d'etre; and since up to then it has been striving to convince us the horror is inexorable, in effect it's undoing what it's done (for examples of the two methods described, cf. the two versions of The Vanishing). Hostel takes the second path, but the director seems to realize he's gone beyond his original story, since he begins to exaggerate the horror and the action to Hong Kong-like proportions, dispelling the seeming seriousness with which he treated the harrowing scenes that preceded. However, in a story of this kind, any attempt at a third act is a trap, and Hostel falls into it. The script might at the beginning have introduced a larger context--war, the economy, anti-American feeling--and returned to it in the end; but that implies a more serious film than I think this one meant to be.<br/><br/>In other respects also, the script is probably most to blame for Hostel's faults. Padded as the story was bound to be, what would have filled it out somewhat was a more rounded characterization of the protagonists. The dialogue of the villains probably needed to remain elliptical to be disquieting in the way intended; but we should have gotten well acquainted with the protagonists, seen what each did uniquely, and understood why; scenes so informing us are absent. And there are what I consider misjudgments in structure. The scenes behind the credits are disturbing, but telegraph something of where we're heading and what goes on there, both of which would have been scarier without a prior look. For a first-act payoff, the film introduces a horror shot--its first, I think--and I think this was a mistake; the shot preceding, which would have planted the same suggestion but left us unsure and worried about it, would actually have been scarier. There are two second-act payoffs: one too many. They would have been more effective combined into a single one, probably with the second preceding the first. And finally, there is some unintentional misdirection. The credit scenes mislead us, in a way; and the horror climax--the second payoff--misleads us more: it implies a third level to the system shown that would have made it even scarier (though less credible).<br/><br/>In summary: a wayward film from a wayward talent."
"Austin_Powers-1","7","0","0","23 October 2007"," Not as grim as rumoured
","Before 'Hostel' was released, it was announced as the most bloody and violent film ever showed. This, of course, increased the expectations a lot, but I must say that it is nowhere nearly as violent as it is cranked up to bed.<br/><br/>Sure 'Hostel' has it scenes, but it has a general problem: If you want to make the most ""bloody and disturbing film ever made"", then you need to SHOW the graphic horror, and not just make hints to it. A few scenes made me chill  the scene where Paxton is cutting Kana's dangling eye with a scissor almost made me puke), but this was almost it. It is way too easy to let the Dutch businessman grip a power drill, and then remove the focus to other torture instruments while hearing Josh screaming in pain in the background, and then afterwards show him with holes in the body  the pain doesn't get to you. It is way too easy to make a nasty sound of the businessman cutting Josh's Achilles tendons without showing the cut itself, but just make a ""cutting sound"". And in the end, it is all too easy just to cut his throat letting the camera go black with the sound of a cut without seeing it. Besides, watching a decapitated head (referring to Oli's death) without showing the ""surgery"" isn't more disturbing than watching any other horror movie with torn limbs. To be honest, I expected a lot more graphic violence, and I was a bit disappointed with the gore I got, now that 'Hostel' was supposed to be the ""most disturbing and violent film ever"".<br/><br/>The cast works very well, and especially Eythor Gudjonsson as Oli is simply hilarious. He makes a PERFECT performance! Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson are good as well, and especially Derek Richardson's torture scene is one of the emotionally strongest in the entire movie - No wonder he was nominated to an MTV Movie Award for ""Best Frightened Performance"".<br/><br/>But take a note: a film doesn't need to have blood, guts and violence to be good, but when it's announced as one of the most frightening films ever made, it sets certain expectations. 'Hostel' is definitely not a bad movie, oh no. The premise is scary as hell, and the film works really fine as both a funny an unpleasant thriller; I still enjoy watching it. But don't expect any more gore or torture than the average for these kind of films."

","Hostel is a movie that revolves around two American men backpacking through Europe as a life experience. They meet a young man from Iceland along the way and join up with him as they travel from hostel to hostel. The basic idea of the movie is disturbed businessmen pay big money to torture and kill people. What a concept, right? As Hostel does deliver many unpleasant scenes of blood, guts, and beyond; I do feel this movie had one major flaw. When you first start watching this movie, you will slowly start to ask yourself and others in the room if you are really watching the right movie. Why? That's because the first 30+ minutes of the story seems more like a National Lampoon's movie than any horror. I personally feel they took way too much time to get into the heart of the story. With all that said, it did a very good job at depicting a disturbed world of torture. The idea of that even slightly being possible makes me sick. Many of the scenes are very graphic and are probably not recommended for the light of heart. Overall the concept and torture scenes accomplished the mission of great horror cinema. The over stretched story packed with sex and partying was a bit much. I would recommend SAW over HOSTEL any time, if someone asked my opinion. I feel the original SAW was a better movie in every aspect and HOSTEL had many good qualities, but slacked in a smooth story.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","I liked an earlier comment ""Bad things happen to bad people"". <br/><br/>If you would like to understand better why Americans are not very welcome around the world (unless their capture and pending torture jacks up the price, i.e. value of them), this is a great example. Send some creepy bratty American college boys on a Europe tour. Have them cuss and swear and using the F-word in every third sentence (even when they are pleading for their very life). Have them treat anybody with disrespect and loathing, including the girls they want to have sex with. Oh, I forgot the absolutely boring fake teenage sex parties in a public youth hostel. You put all that into a movie, and the result is predictable. GIGO: garbage in = garbage out.<br/><br/>I wonder if anyone could show me what the point of such a movie would be? It can't have been an interest in ""horror"". Nothing in this movie was scary, just plain repulsive, because it was done so badly. The built-up toward the gruesome scenes is plainly annoying. These college boys are immature brats, rude and anything but likable. Who cares what happens to them?<br/><br/>We get a few hints of what lies ahead when they meet a strange ""meat lover"" in their train compartment. Whom they again meet later, in the dungeons of some eastern country, of course, where unspeakable evil things can happen. <br/><br/>It would have been, -maybe-, an interesting horror movie if we had learned what really motivates those rich patrons, failed / wannabe surgeons, and other American cash paying thrill seekers. But those characters are mere shells of types, shallow and totally uninteresting. We don't even get the feeling that they are really getting a ""kick"" out of the horrid stuff they are doing to their victims, it's all so mechanical. And that hunchbacked dungeon clean up maid, who incinerates the remains of victims... what a sorry hoot! No Hannibal Lecter (""Silence of the Lambs"") here anywhere. No fear of looming danger like in ""Aliens"". No identification with any of the characters. Just dull disgust with a wannabe horror movie.

Naturally there had to be plenty of artistic license taken here-the first guy and the one who ended up escaping after somehow finding he had a gun in his pocket-had his leg prodded with a drill and it showed it going through.When he finally escaped the film seemed to have forgotten he was supposed to be chained to the chair but later he was able to function as if he'd just tripped up-his shredded hand he covered with a glove he found in a cupboard. In reality the first jab with the drill would have killed him and no way could he have removed himself from the chair or even moved his hands around to produce a gun.

","Strange movie. It's like a product of America's post 9/11 mentality meets Porky's. In my opinion, it's worth a look, but I'm not sure what it's trying to say. If it's about American paranoia, and the fortress mentality of ""everyone's out to get us"", it works pretty well, except for one thing: the three leads are selfish, dick-driven ****holes who deserve everything they get. This may be Eli Roth's point, but I doubt any American Hollywood Director would have the cojones or the principles to assassinate his career by making a movie that pushes the view that Americans abroad - including the troops in Iraq - are not heroes or liberators, but are, in fact, ignorant, vulgar, boorish interlopers. Once you take that out of the equation, there's not much left - if it's not a critique of American mentality & foreign policy, then what is it? Purely in horror terms, it fails dismally. It's neither disturbing, suspenseful nor scary and, in terms of gore, it pulls its punches badly (even on the ""unrated"" DVD). So, having said that, 6/10 is giving Roth the benefit of the doubt - maybe he really has tried to slide a subversive something into the American unconsciousness.

Then the second part emerges, they are caught and tortured and we are supposed to feel bad for them.

I could actually enjoy the second part of it, because I had already realized that it was not to be taken to seriously, so I just laid back and enjoyed the pointless gore. Even so I did not feel anything special when the credits started. If I have to say what I think they should have done when they made this movie, in order to make it better. It would be to make the first part more meaningful, and give the characters more personality ( positive personality at least for one of them ). And THEN chop them to pieces to make the audience feel something, instead of just making the soft hearted nauseous, and the gore loving ones smile. In short terms, a good idea, but a movie that lags depth and meaning. 5/10"
"gingasherminator","5","0","0","2 September 2006"," Interesting, dark, slightly familiar in so many ways...
","A great dark film, but when watching it it felt a bit bitter and that there was something completely unoriginal about it. I can see the original storyline and ideas, but there are too many rehashed ideas and moments put together to make something new. I mean a lot of belieavability into the situation, i mean its the ultimate S&M, torture. But the locals truly give the feel of a cross between the locals from 'wicker man (1973)' and 'chainsaw massacre' i mean it even uses music from wickerman and a lot of the look and symbolism is there. A lot of the scenes were graphic and cringing but i feel was kept to a good minimum as it should not take place as the dominant feature in visuals, like 'saw' did and some of the techniques were disturbing and cut scenes kept the imagination at a full which is always good with graphic scenes of this nature. a few things bugged me, the full vendetta involved in it and a few unessary scenes, and it turned up completely random towards the end, it became too random for me towards the climax. and the little children were annoying and a pointless bit of child violence and gave a strange feeling of humour that wasn't needed, or intentional. a good watch but a film buff will notice too much of a collage of multiple films."
"heatherofilm","5","0","0","28 August 2006"," Distinctly average
","The heightened violence and gore publicised in this film made me expect something of the horror and general downright scariness of films like Saw. Although there were good elements to it, and an exciting build up of tension until the explanation of everything was revealed, something was missing. I've found it hard to put my finger on what that was, but I think it was the psychological tension you find in all good horror flicks. It just didn't mess with my head enough to be the sort of film that stuck with me for days. To make the comparison again to Saw, what scared me with that film was the way in which the tortures were devised sometimes without an excess of gore but in a way that played on the most scary situation you could imagine being faced with. Hostel just went for gore."
"stephenneale67","7","0","0","28 August 2006"," In need of greater link between sadism and sexual gratification
","In this thought-provoking film, Eli Roth cleverly uses a polarization of human emotional extremes, as though it were something from Dante's inferno: for here we have three back-packers, Americans Paxton and Josh, joined on their rounds by Icelandic clown, Oli, all in pursuit of hedonistic sensual delights, yet concluding their wanderings in an unimaginable living hell. From one end of the spectrum we go, seeing the young males initially enabled to live out their wildest sexual fantasies, to spewing vomit as they plead to their captors for mercy in the face of drills and chainsaws. Its powerful stuff. The film is also highly atmospheric, particularly in the underworld dungeon scenes, when one can almost smell the detergent that is being sprayed against the the ensanguined walls in the aftermath of slaughter. Possibly the main factor which rather lets this movie down is the film's failure to fully exploit the link between sado-masochism and sexual gratification. Imagine the impact of the American sadist engaging in an act of forced penetrative sex with his oriental victim as he removed her eye from its socket, or the German chainsaw sadist perhaps indulging in an act of masturbation as he set about his butchery (though admittedly, this is hinted at by some of his facial expressions). Nonetheless, a movie that is once seen, never forgotten."

The scariest movies are also made by showing less and telling more. Neither of which is the case for Hostel. And I certainly didn't sympathize with the main characters. The villains weren't motivated enough and I wasn't satisfied with the ending. There was no energy in the movie. The whole movie was like a snatch and grab job at a liquor store.

","I got this film a couple of days ago, because I'm only 16 I couldn't see it at the cinema, but due to the amazing trailer I bought it the minute it was released on DVD. And I can honestly tell you I was seriously let down. Because it states that the film is presented by Quentin Tarantino, I was expecting a terrify, horrific, be sick in you pop-corn box film. But it is nothing like that. This film is really just a huge build up to nothing but a a few shots of graphic violence and one or two jumps, but besides that it's nothing special.<br/><br/>Directed by Eli Roth, the film follows a group of backpackers travelling the world in search of excitement and sex. In Amsterdam the group are told of a 'HOSTEL', located in BRATISLAVA with beautiful girls all gagging for it. But when they get there, they find out that the HOSTEL is not what it seems, and more like a twisted holiday camp for wanna-be psychopaths.<br/><br/>Now, as I've already said the film does have some graphic scenes, and it really does deserve it's 18 certificate. But for the first 20 minutes, you would think that this is a sequel to ""EUROTRIP"", for example ""SPOILER""...<br/><br/>...there is a scene on a train in which a strange foreign man enters the boys compartment and starts talking, later on in the scene he attempts to feel up Josh ""Derek Richardson"" (Dumb And Dumberer). But is obviously turned down in a some what amusing style. Now if you have seen ""EUROTRIP"", you will probably remember a scene very similar to this. <br/><br/>Also the film has a character list which is very similar to most teen-slasher flicks. Firstly there's the sex driven character called Oli ""Eythor Gudjonsson"". Who's only objective is to get laid with as many girls as possible. Also there's the character who wants to be a bad ass but can't Paxton ""Jay Hernandez"", and finally the quiet know it all ,(who I've already mentioned) Josh ""Derek Richardson"". And because of this I don't believe that this film can be all that it can be. <br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong the performances were great, but I just don't think that these actors can really pull the performances off. I mean take 'SAW'. This was a terrifying film, and not a teenager in sight. Which is the way it should be.<br/><br/>This Film was a serious let down, and despite it's few scares I wouldn't recommend it. Tarantino should never have put his name on this.<br/><br/>Milligan =D"

It starts with three young men travelling from a drugs filled time in Amsterdam to Bratislava where they plan to get some sex from some of the girls who they have been told are there. If you hadn't seen the opening title sequence you would think this is a remake of Euro Trip. It's even got them travelling by train and a creepy foreigner getting into their spot and touching one of the kids legs. This is exactly the same as what I've seen before. I came to this film looking for something different. The film is mostly build up. It's 70 minutes of sex and confusion followed by 20 minutes of indescribable violence.

This is pretty much in line with the preview which hinted at three horny guys looking for sex in Europe, and then getting drawn into a new level of R rated violence, which is exactly what occurs, without further nuance. The only thing the movie adds to the preview is more violence. It doesn't get deeper, more clever, or more interesting. This could have had the power of Bue Velvet or Last Tango in Paris, but it quickly gets run through the Hollywood formula which removes any trace of believability or interest. Instead it's pretty much a retread of Friday the 13th in which sexually-active teens are mutilated; the moralism that feeds the country.<br/><br/>The characters are super bland. They have the most normative of sex. They 'make love' to some super-models. The movie is little more than hetero boy wish-fulfillment. You get to see some boobs on hot chicks and there's enough homophobia to reassure nervous viewers there's no possibility the movie will veer into any unexpected direction.

"Crap_Connoisseur","Null","0","0","29 June 2006"," A Good Horror Movie - But A Disappointment
","Eli Roth has joined forces with Quentin Tarantino for the follow up to his rather awesome debut, ""Cabin Fever"". If the Tarantino involvement was not warning enough that the film would be crap, the internet buzz surrounding Hostel has been almost deafening, with 12 year olds across America loudly claiming it to be the most gory horror film they have ever seen. To cut to the chase - Hostel is not particularly gory or disturbing. It is, however, a decent mainstream American horror film that showcases Roth's obvious ability and potential.<br/><br/>Roth's debut was one of the most humorous and ironic horror films to be released in the past few years. I'm usually not a fan of comedic horror but ""Cabin Fever"" is funny in such a subversive manner that it almost created its own sub-genre. One of the first things that becomes apparent on viewing Hostel is that Roth has ditched the humour for a more straightforward approach. This seems to be in line with the film's obvious aim of returning to the aesthetics of the genre and exploitation classics of the 1970s, where the violence is sadistic and often interspersed with gratuitous sex and nudity. This lofty goal is noble indeed, however, despite a promising beginning, the film never quite achieves what it sets out to.<br/><br/>The premise of Hostel is inspired. The idea of an organisation which sells rich businessmen the opportunity to kill tourists, who have been rounded up in a local hostel, is just twisted enough to be plausible. The film begins promisingly, like a slightly more explicit version of a National Lampoons movie. Travel plans quickly change when the main characters learn of a Hostel in Bratislava full of beautiful, seemingly amoral women. Josh, Paxton and Oli leave Amsterdam quicker than you can say ""buy some condoms"" and arrive in Slovakia ready to party. Once in Bratislava the blood finally begins to flow. However, much to my disappointment, the results are far less gruesome and far more Hollywood than imagined.<br/><br/>For all the talk of the ""cutting edge"" violence and sadism, most of the action occurs off screen. In fact, most of the gore is pretty lame. The film only comes close to its goal of hardcore gore during the torture scenes, which by American horror standards are reasonably graphic. The eyeball cutting scene is great and there is something about the misuse of power drills that does it for me every time. That said, anyone who has sat through Asian nasties like ""Naked Blood"" or ""Daughter Of Darkness"" will be scratching their heads at all the fuss. And I really hate to think what Hostel haters would make of ""Red Room"" or, heaven forbid, some ""Extreme Measures"" filth.<br/><br/>It is not only the tepid violence that irritated me, but also the incredibly stupid turn of events that sees Paxton turn into some kind of teen Rambo, all the while looking like a Backstreet Boy. Jay Hernandez just doesn't cut it as an heroic figure. He looks like he would be more comfortable on the set of ""That's So Raven"". His transformation makes the entire last third of film incredibly annoying. No wonder the Bubble Gum Gang left Paxton in peace; they probably mistook him for one of their own. The other lead, Derek Richardson, while hampered by his whiny and insipid character, is at least more credible than Hernandez. The real acting is left to Jan Vlasak, who makes a very creepy Dutch businessman and Rick Hoffman, a highlight as a psychotic American customer.<br/><br/>Despite my gripes, which admittedly have more to do with the way the film has been promoted than with the film itself, Hostel is a very good horror film. The premise works and there are shocks and disturbing moments aplenty. The violence, while not as explicit as the hype would have you believe, is still strong in comparison to most of the stupid fluff that passes for horror movies in America. The combination of sex, nudity and violence is also a nice nod to the more adventurous Euro-schlock that Hostel so desperately tries to imitate. Most impressively, Roth's vision and direction is not impinged by Tarantino's sometimes overbearing presence. Eli Roth is clearly a man with huge potential. Hopefully next time around he will stick to guns and forgo the Hollywood ending."

Pretty naked ladies roam the hostel, but as soon as they get there their friend gets missing. And soon they all find themselves from the hands of sadistic rich bastards who entertain themselves by torturing people to death.<br/><br/>As for horror goes this movie is gross and it, without any doubt, is one of the most brutal main stream movies ever made. But where, I ask, is the merit in that? There is no real story. Just some torture and a vengeance. I don't see a real need for this kind of a film, that makes the killings and violence in a pornographic manner (yes, yes... I like Kill Bill's, but in them the violence wasn't serious). You can even say, that 'Hostel' is as much a real movie as are porn films. But the direction is good though, that much I must give for its benefit.

I went in to see what all the fuss was about and can say I now never want to visit a hostel (well actually my friend lives in one so Id wanna go to HER hostel) but not any other one. This is the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. You've got to give credit to Roth for having the balls to make this though but I would not ever want to watch it again. The thing with the eyeball was just too much. I love horror films but this was just too much."

","First, I need to say that 'Hostel' is a film that only men will like. I'm pretty sure I'm right on this. There are more naked women in this film than I thought existed. There is more gore and blood than a lot of other films. In other words, 2 things: any typical guy will like it, and if you're looking for sharp character development and an unpredictable story, don't expect it from Eli Roth in this one. Nevertheless, it is entertaining and short enough to make it watchable and likable.<br/><br/>Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) have met up with an Icelandic man named Oli, and have heard of a hostel in Slovakia that is told to satisfy their wildest, wettest, and most perverted dreams ever. They get there, and the place does not disappoint, but they soon figure out that this hostel is not what it seems, and that they are becoming part of a sinister plot involving an infamous torture museum.<br/><br/>I must say that Eli Roth had the necessary materials, but like Cabin Fever before it, he doesn't utilize it enough. Also like Cabin Fever, the film is predictable and very one sided. There isn't a lot of character development or realism to a story said to be inspired by real events. What Roth's strength is that he realizes that he's made a few goofs here and there, and provides all the blood and cool gore scenes that you'd come to expect from someone Quentin Tarantino has thrown his support behind. Roth makes up for it all with some really shocking torture methods, and two very evil villains, one who doesn't talk much. Roth manages to make the film very entertaining, even though it gets off to a really slow start. The acting isn't that bad, but I don't think Hernandez or Richardson should bank on this movie to make them credible actors. After seeing Hernandez in a couple more films, I must say his future is very bright in this business. Don't miss him in World Trade Center.<br/><br/>7/10 --spy"

","I first watched this at my college movie theater for $3, and my first honest opinion was that this movie was total c*ap. I thought it was a movie that decided to join the whole Saw-hype and try to get some $$$ through the whole low-budget and high expectations deal. Now that I've watched it a second time, I believe I can actually make a ""more balanced"" comment on this movie.<br/><br/>First off, I have to say this IS a scary horror movie. BUT its scariness lies not in suspense or ""jump-out-from-behind"" scenes, but rather in the blood, guts, and gore. Hostel is scary in that its painful to watch, and it does make the viewers cringe and moan in their seats. For that, I do give props to the makers. Also, the acting is very well done. Through acting, the characters actually give you a greater sense of pain and fear that arises from the insanity of the hellish situation they are thrown into. For that, I do give props to the actors.<br/><br/>Now to what makes this movie simply ""bad"". I have to say, the plot is awful. No twists, no turns, no nothing. The plot is fairly straightforward, but it totally lacks the quality that would equal that of Saw and Saw 2. Instead, the movie tries to make up for this by adding lots of strong language, lots of drug reference, lots of sex and nudity, and most of all, lots of very very vivid and gory scenes. Cabin Fever tried to put some ""humor"" into it, but this movie doesn't seem to do that either. Maybe the beginning was intended to be ""humorous"", but it seemed stupid even to a college student like me. You just see three young guys making a fool of themselves going around smoking pot and drooling for girls. Totally unnecessary. Not to mention several confusing elements that were not explained. For example, why did that one guy have Oli's coat? Or was that just a coincidence?<br/><br/>Conclusion: You get vivid and sick gore, drug humor, and sexual content. Combine those with a very bad plot and you get Hostel. In other words, a bad movie. Period. I've heard and read good reviews about this movie, saying that the movie is a ""social critique"", but I beg to differ. The sole theme of this movie is sick violence, and nothing else pretty much. At least I don't see anything out of this movie, and I thought it was a waste of time and money. I wouldn't suggest watching this if you have anything else to watch. But if you do have the time and money to waste... go ahead. Just be ready to see some sickening things that you probably have never seen in a movie."
"dhlough","6","0","0","23 June 2006"," Effective Little Gross-Out
","Eli Roth's Hostel isn't a very good film, nor is it  in its genre  all that imaginative. But it's effective, intermittently engaging and, above all, very satisfying.<br/><br/>Two Americans  the cocky Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and the broken-hearted Josh (Derek Richardson)  are backpacking across Europe with an Icelandic pick-up, the party-hard Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson). Stuck in Amsterdam, and bored with the influx of Americans, they meet the bug-eyed (or is that cross-eyed?) Slav Alex (Lubomir Bukovy, with the freaky presence of a young Marty Feldman). He entices them to head to Slovakia, where the women are all supermodels and will screw you just because of your foxy American accent. So off they go, soon in the clutches of babes who bed them, drug them, and sell them to an organization that allows you  with the right amount of cash  to kill another human being.<br/><br/>A film like Hostel lives and dies by its concept. This movie's queasy set up is a doozy. Roth takes his time getting his entertaining trio to Slovakia, and the camaraderie of men in pursuit of cheap thrills and cheaper women feels right. The scenes in the murder factory aren't as gross as the ads would have you believe  you grow immune to the shock fast, and reminisce about the more ingenious gross-outs of Saw. Yet the last thirty minutes are everything a horror movie should be: tense, funny, and insanely reliant on crazy twists of fate that are never less than satisfying to an audience.<br/><br/>And Hostel is a film that requires an audience: one that shouts, groans, and laughs at the sheer giddy high of more bloodshed and its attendant acts of revenge. The best revenge may come from the spike (pun intended) in travel to the countries of Eastern Europe; regardless of the carnage (and the pus and the gristle), there isn't one ounce of cellulite on its women."

The gore was good, the acting was surprisingly decent, but the plot was so mind-numbingly awful that I really couldn't enjoy it much.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie is well made and well acted, but it has such a boring, straightforward plot that it really wasn't all that great.<br/><br/>5/10 <br/><br/>PS- I did like the TCM reference near the end."

","Horror films need more than just sex and slashers ...so if you're looking for something with higher level cinema, you best look elsewhere. HOSTEL is designed for the young man with an appetite for video-game style plots.<br/><br/>The films premise is, at least, interesting. A Hostel in a Slovakian city is a jumping-off point for nightclubs, sexual encounters, drugs ...and murder. The hostel owners are secretively helping a select group of the rich and demented. These wealthy and twisted individuals pay to kill people, and an ""art house"" on the outskirts of town acts as the facilitator of horrors. For those unweary travelers who happen to fall victim to the wiles of the hostel owners, ending up drugged only to reawaken in Hell on Earth is a gruesome and life-ending discovery.<br/><br/>Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his friends Josh (Derek Richardson) and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are three college students traveling through Europe. They stop at this hostel and are quickly enraptured with a couple of young women who have an appetite for sex. Once fully involved with these women, the boys begin dropping off one by one. First Oli vanishes, the Icelandic disco-lover. Then Josh, the nice boy. And soon even Paxton finds himself strapped to a chair with an axe-wielding and chainsaw-ripping psycho standing over him.<br/><br/>But Paxton escapes and with him he takes another Japanese girl who was also being tortured to death. Once out, Paxton loses the Japanese girl and soon spots the ""main man"" responsible for this death camp. Can Paxton exact revenge on him? Or will he get caught and killed? The main problem with the film were its characters. Josh, the likable guy who seems to be the brains of the trio, is killed off in short order. Paxton, who I thought was a bit of an ass, lives on to exact revenge on the man responsible for doing in his friends. But this revenge sequence felt very flawed as I had no empathy whatsoever for Paxton. Josh, on the other hand, should've been the guy to figure out everything and avenge the death of his buddies. Even Oli would've been a better choice. He was at least fun to watch and had a great personality. Perhaps the script writers weren't sure who should live and who should die ...and I think that really showed in the revenge aspect of the film."

Before I continue I will let you know I am in the targeted demographic for the film being a 20 year old male. However these types of movies aren't usually made with this much thought. The director does a very good job at keeping the viewers wondering just what the hell is going on. The first half of the movie is mostly about sex and trying to get the three guys laid. But the director still finds time to get to know the characters and paint of picture of who they were before killing them off. Aside from some of the very graphic, gutwrenching seens I was still glued to the screen trying to figure out what and why this was happening. we were also learning what was happening as the characters in the film were. Overall I thought this film was very engaging, and surprisingly watchable."

","I read a ton of horrid reviews, which I'm pretty much in agreement with, however I will say that aside from all that was wrong with this movie (there was plenty) the premise was interesting and really freaky, which is probably why there are so many reviews and so many people have at least been curious enough to see it.<br/><br/>In a nutshell; I thought the story idea was good, naive American boys travelling through Europe smoking pot and chasing women, the hotter the better. They slowly realize that what they thought was Garden of Eden turned out to be hell. The idea itself makes great fodor for a horror flick, however having seen many horror movies I'd say this one failed because so much of it was not believable. The main guy took on an Indiana Jones quality after he inexplicably escaped the torture chamber without raising an eyebrow from anyone there. He went back to save the Japanese girl which was not only out of character, but completely ridiculous. If you saw people being killed, tortured, sawed in half do you think anyone in the world would go back inside? Yeah, right. He finds the perfect get a way car which just happens to have keys in the ignition, and a big stack of bubble gum to assuage the little boy gang. He just happens to be on the same train as the bad guy and just happens to have the perfect opportunity to follow him into the bathroom and exact his revenge. Too much."

","***SPOILER***<br/><br/>This movie is not for the squeamish. It takes a little while to get there but, once it does the film is full of ghastly and gruesome blood and gore. The horror derives from helpless victims of a deranged, sadistic maniac being ruthlessly tortured, dismembered, mutilated and slowly killed for the pleasure of paying clients.<br/><br/>I saw this movie on an afternoon break between classes at the local ""dollar theater."" ...didn't know what it was about. The only thing I had heard about it was a caller on the radio saying there were plenty of ""naked chicks."" He was right. There was an abundance of uncovered female curves - especially for $1. And, there was about a bank vault's worth of screaming, cursing and bloody corpses. Critics might say that some of it is gratuitous, although it seems to fit in with the storyline to me. Yes, there is a story - a thin one, but a story nonetheless.<br/><br/>Two American buddies on a trip to Europe (for chicks and drugs I guess) join up, in Amsterdam, with a companion from Iceland. When the three of them travel to central Europe in search of the ""naked chick"" jackpot, things take a turn for the worse. One by one they start to disappear. Whether, drugged, abducted or somehow lured, they all end up in the slaughterhouse where they can be butchered for a price. <br/><br/>The fact that it is a business is not revealed at first. Eli Roth, who wrote and directed this piece, does a good job of parceling out the details bit by bit. At first sight inside the torture house there is nothing to indicate there is more than one victim at a time, or that anyone other than the abductor is involved. Gradually, we learn that there are more chambers in this dungeon and numerous workers, outside security, and paying customers. <br/><br/>The director and film editor also do a good job of showing the actual torture scenes by using a variety of angles, close-ups and medium shots. With the two American pals, we see views from behind them, viewing their captor - but, also from in front of them, showing the point of view of the captor/attacker. The latter view especially lets us see the terror in the eyes of the victim as they plead for their lives to a totally unforgiving fiend.<br/><br/>The special effects and makeup are quite good in this movie. Everything looks real - the violence, the aftermath, and oh yeah - the Eroubabes, too."

The direction didn't make it scary, kind of ridiculous, the idea was great, but this film had the potential to be a great thriller like Saw or something but it just fell apart in its 2nd and 3rd act and the first act felt like a softcore porn film, which makes it sad that the 1st act was actually the most entertaining part of the film.

","Director of the indie hit ""Cabin Fever"", Eli Roth's 2nd feature and latest horror offering is a starker and potentially more disturbing take vision. Though not without a sense of humor, which seems to deliberately compliment some of the more gruesome of the film, ""Hostel"" succeeds most for me during the first 1/2 to 2/3 of the picture. Characters and setup are laid out smoothly and an abundance of bare-breasts doesn't hurt either;) However, once things really start to go from bad to worse, it became increasingly difficult for me to continue to take the situation seriously as scenes go over-the-top and humor starts to leak through. While this was likely a conscience choice on the part of the director, for me it hurt the film and my ability to stay engrossed. I'd have rather the tone and story remained consistent and not made the apparent change-up.<br/><br/>Though still bound to be strong medicine for the average mainstream movie goer, Hostel seems unlikely to leave a lasting mark on genre fans. If you've heard comparison's to Miike's ""Audition"" don't expect to have the same reaction because unlike the latter, this film isn't especially disturbing or horrifying. It's a fun time at the movies and somewhat of a step up forward from ""Cabin Fever"", but just the same not particularly memorable."

In his second work, ""Hostel"", Roth increased the silliness and it takes the whole movie one step up. A story as stupid and unbelievable as this one just couldn't have been done as a full on, ""serious"" horror flick. I do believe the advertising was kind of misleading in that aspect. Sure, ""Hostel"" does get down to the nitty-gritty (two, er, thumbs up for the eye scene!), but it's all so hilarious that you're not going to take any of it serious. I sure hope that all the stereotypes featured in this movie were exaggerated intentionally. God only knows, why Roth has all his European characters speak German (and badly) and why he put a gang of criminal eight year-olds in the movie. At times one felt as if this was the missing cousin of ""Top Secret!"" and ""Eurotrip"". Anyway, even though the movie is hilarious to watch, it's questionable how long Roth can disguise bad writing with silly jokes. Is this man able to come up with a really good horror movie? Well, his next project, Stephen King's ""Cell"" is going to show. ""Hostel"" didn't totally change my mind about Roth's talents, but it convinced me that he's got a great sense of humor."

","HOSTEL may be effectively horrific to your average moviegoer who has never seen any of the notorious Japanese underground horror/gore GUINEA PIG movies. For those who don't know, these movies are virtually plot less, shot-on-video movies depicting women being tortured, dismembered and murdered.<br/><br/>Writer-director Eli Roth adds a story and snappy Tarantino-ish dialog to this obscure subgenre of extreme horror, but little else. Anyone who's seen more than one of these movies will find nothing in HOSTEL particularly shocking.<br/><br/>That's not to say the movie is entirely ineffective. There are some creepy moments, impressive make-up effects and clever story elements. I thought the trio of guys getting laid and smoking pot for the entire first half of the movie, juxtaposed with the scenes of torture, mutilation and murder during the second half was a clever comment on what constitutes subversive behavior for different classes of people. College aged guys go to Amsterdam, hook up with beautiful girls and get high; older, more socially refined men go to the Ukraine and pay for the privilege of torturing an innocent person to death.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Roth doesn't do a whole lot with this intriguing set-up, and the movie's final moments fall in to the usual chase and revenge clichés.<br/><br/>Despite its similarity to the GUINEA PIG series, the movie that HOSTEL most reminds me of is Joel Reed's sleazefest BLOODSUCKING FREAKS. In fact, it is, in a way, simply a more elaborate, less misogynistic remake of Reed's movie. Like FREAKS, it also attempts to excuse its outlandish gore by purporting to be a pseudo-hip black comedy. The GUINEA PIG movies, love them or hate them, are what they are. They do not pretend to be anything else but tasteless exercises in extreme gore and sleaze, and do not apologize for it.<br/><br/>Roth doesn't have the courage to go all the way. He backs off, sprinkling the movie with hip, snappy dialog, stereotypical horror movie clichés and creepy music to remind the audience (and himself) it's all make believe, it's not to be taken seriously, it's safe.<br/><br/>If there's one thing to be said for such sickening exercises in extreme horror as GUINEA PIG, MEN BEHIND THE SUN, CANNIBAL FEROX, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and AUGUST UNDERGROUND, it's that they don't make excuses for themselves. They exist to disgust and shock the viewer, nothing more. Roth obviously wanted to make one of these movies himself with HOSTEL. But he doesn't have the stomach to get down there in the cinematic sewer to do it, preferring to keep his hands clean and distance himself from his own subject matter.<br/><br/>You can't pretend to be shameless.

","I found this film to be deeply disturbing, and profanely sick. Unlike one of the earlier comments that this film like Aliens, created a sense of suspense, I found the suspense overwhelmed by the idea that any human beings could find fascination in the gruesome aspects of the film. I would not recommend this film to be viewed by anyone young, or impressionistic. This film does give one an insight into the minds of Dawber, and his ilk. That these types of people actually exist gives one thought, (Thank God for Prisons). I personally like good old fashion Science Fiction, for it's release, and films such as this one, more sick than slick. However, I do believe the characters were developed well, and we got to know the characters and create a empathy for them, having been given the chance to identify with them, before they were thrown into the Hell that their circumstance became. The film as a whole was well done, and well directed. But the idea that people such as the anti-hero's in the film do actually exist, made the film too intensely sick for my taste."

","The subject matter underlying Hostel should have been enough to make this movie a harrowing one. However, the film did not reach the level that it should have in dealing with the subject matter.<br/><br/>The main problem with the film was the characters in the movie: they act like typical, horny teenagers straight out of typical, teenage sex comedy movies. If these characters had been in, say, American Pie or Porky's, they would not have appeared out of place. Here, they act as distractions. They are not memorable or have any redeeming qualities about them. The only character who I felt had any depth and substance was the main character, played by Jay Hernandez, but only barely.<br/><br/>The story itself unfolds unevenly: the first half plays like a sex comedy and the second half, like exaggerated torture and gore flick. Unfortunately, even the bad characters are portrayed like caricatures and, thereby, ruin the realism of any of the scenes that could have had any massive, visceral impact.<br/><br/>Hostel is not a boring or unwatchable film, however. To be sure, there is much genuine suspense and terror throughout the film, especially in the second half, but not to the degree it was purported to have had at the time of the release.<br/><br/>A passable, gore film that should please most gorehounds."

I didn't worry... still a lot of time to make up for that. The following butchery in that nest didn't make up... not for my preoccupied mind.

","Eli Roth is obviously a huge fan of the genre. This was made clearly evident with his first feature - the fun, ghoulish, but ultimately flawed Cabin Fever. Hostel is likewise a fun, ghoulish, but lacking movie that is better than Cabin Fever, but missing something. If this movie proves anything is that in time Roth has the potential to make a film on the same level as the ones that obviously influenced him - Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, Japanese horror films like Audition - but he's not quite there yet.<br/><br/>The first half of Hostel is Girls Gone Wild as a trio of friends beggar through Europe. The movie begins by finding the trio in Amsterdam. Need I say more? Soon, however, the movie thrusts its viewer into a nihilistic world where wealthy people pay good money to indulge their need for torture. And our three drug-addled, sex-crazed heroes are the main course.<br/><br/>Hostel has a lot going for it. It's fast paced. The characters are likable. The women are beautiful and barely wearing a stitch. And that's just the first half hour. The rest of the film takes place in a kind of hell of earth where limbs are amputated, fingers are chainsawed to the floor and the human body is reduced to the properties of a pin cushion. People are flayed and dissected with glee. Eyes dangle from their sockets. Ankle tendons are severed. Although the DVD boasts that its unrated, the gore level was not as stomach-churningly prodigious as I had anticipated. But still. Pretty much all bodily fluids are on display herein. The movie, despite all its bloodshed, seems to not take itself seriously. And neither did I. I'm not sure if the desired effect was to make the viewer squirm and dry heave or at times to laugh out loud at some of the more over-the-top effects. I did mostly the latter. For any horror fan, this is a must see, considering how stale the genre is it at the moment. More importantly, Hostel shows a horror filmmaker (and above all, a horror fan) improving his craft while delivering the visceral goods to those of us who eat that sticky stuff up.<br/><br/>Of the special features on the DVD, the only ones of note are the three behind the scenes features and the four separate commentaries featuring Roth and others, including one with exec. producers Quentin Tarantino and Scott Spiegel."

","I am not a hardcore horror fan but I can handle a seriously disturbing movie as long as it has some artistic credentials behind it or says something relevant about the world (see Seven, Jacob's Ladder, Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer). Also, I've seen enough gore and making-of docs that that aspect of it doesn't particularly phase me. Having said that, I must say that I was quite disappointed by what could have been a troubling, haunting movie about American paranoia, human violent instincts and what poverty will make one do for money.<br/><br/>Eli Roth just doesn't seem capable of the subtlety necessary to pull that trick off here. He's good and I did like Cabin Fever but he spends too long on the set-up and throws in too many forced plot elements that are needed to validate future events (like seeing the doctor on the train, the oddly placed story of the drowning girl that sets up the guy going back for the Asian girl, etc..). Plus, there's the way-too-over-the-top-to-be-effective special effects gore scenes that take it from horrifying to cheesy.<br/><br/>Like Wolf Creek, another film that focuses on kidnapping and torture over the quick shock of slasher flicks, the most unpleasant and haunting aspect of this film is the screams of people at the whim and mercy of a madman. In that aspect, there were some decent and realistic performances but any emotional punch they packed were quickly neutralized by the overall silliness (I mean, really, that whole eyeball thing was pretty damn silly).<br/><br/>In the end, I've seen scarier. I've seen bloodier. I've seen better. What scares me the most is that there are so many people out there who are so disappointed that it wasn't more hardcore in the violence.

","I liked ""Hostel."" In the same way that I enjoyed Hershell Gordon Lewis' ""Gore-Gore Girls,"" and the 80s pop of Hall and Oates, ""Hostel"" carries in its bloody clutches a ""guilty pleasure"" endowment that's hardly mistakable. <br/><br/>That said, there also appears to be a duel train of thought, here, that was carelessly overlooked during the film's making. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple. Two college students take an uninhibited tour of Europe's dark under belly, relishing the purple haze of legal hash bars ... having ravishing sex with bosomy euro-chicks. Life's pretty good for these irreverent, if naive and unsophisticated hedonists. Then ... within a matter of minutes ... everything appears to go to hell. One of them finds his hands and feet bound by shackles, sitting almost naked in a dank room that is lavished with all manner of knives and power tools. The purpose of all this? Well ... it's sort of like the Playboy mansion for twisted millionaires ... a place where rich men (and maybe women ... I dunno) can exact all sorts of barbarous, sadistic torture on unwilling participants. And the question on everyone's minds? Can these kids escape this dungeon of carnal, bloody pleasures with their lives?<br/><br/>For a movie that spews rivers of blood, pulpy bone marrow, and mashed limbs ... on top of comely nudity and blistering sex, ""Hostel"" is pretty fun to watch. I found this movie to be deranged, vicious, and inappropriate in every conceivable way. Sure, I've seen gore in other films that might make ""Hostel"" seem like a Charlotte Bronte novel. But the vast majority of movie-goers simply don't watch those films ... and for a lot of younger kids who cut their teeth on ""Scream"" or the ""I Know What You Did ..."" movies ... the intensity of what they're watching, here, might appear some-what repulsive. (Actually ... I might clarify one thing ... ""Hostel"" isn't a horror movie ... it tries REALLY hard to be an exploitation shock-fest ... which is probably why Quentin Tarantino's name is in the credits.)<br/><br/>Gore, for the sake of gore alone, I'm totally cool with. Gore, to me, does not enhance the ""scare factor"" of a movie, though. And if Eli Roth, who helmed this picture, wants to be a maestro of thrills and chills, he'd do much better studying the beguiling atmosphere of Roman Polanksi, or even that of Alfred Hitchcock. <br/><br/>The point that Roth was obviously trying to communicate is that violence, under the guise of entertainment is ... um ... well ... BAD. Okay. However, he relays his message through a camera lens engulfed in thick, syrupy sadism. He's not trying to disappoint America's fixation with violence ... Roth is exciting us with all of this bloody madness. I don't think I'm being far-fetched when I write that Roth WANTS us to watch ""Hostel"" ... over and over again. And because of this, his commentary (already simple and overcooked) is therefore moot. <br/><br/>But who cares? If you're watching ""Hostel,"" hoping to view a portrait of man's inhumanity to man, you've wasted your money. As a guilty pleasure, ""Hostel"" hits all the essential bases, man. Actually ... guys like Eli Roth might well be the last bastion of filmmakers who dare to push the proverbial decency envelope. As meaningless as their work might be, you also have to love them for their irreverence for our sensibilities. Guys like Lucio Fulci and Jess Franco were men who swiped the rug from underneath their audience, and made them feel uncomfortable. Roth may eventually clamor among their ranks."

","I found this film to be undeniably compelling and suspenseful, even well-directed. However, I just have a problem with the concept of torture as entertainment. I think that anyone who has ever given thought to the reality of torture in the modern world would find it repellent that the filmmakers would exploit it for a horror film. That goes for Mr. Tarantino as well. My assumption is that there is an ongoing effort to find material to exploit in the horror genre and this is the latest example. The film deals with elements of xenophobia, homophobia, phobia, phobia and more phobia! What makes this film especially disturbing is that, like the video game GRAND THEFT AUTO, the public seems to have little or no reaction on a moral or values level to this kind of material being put forth as entertainment from companies like Sony. Yet, when a film like BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is released, the public freaks out. Strange world we live in!"

So onto when the movie actually gets to what you see it for. The gore was more so laughable than anything. The way they had to cut from shot to shot during some of the things (such as gun shot, then the head exploding...or at the end with woman jumps in front of train and you can see very well that it's a green screen shot..then it cuts shot to women getting splattered by blood and looks horrible, quickly shooting out of it) just...none of the bloody scenes looked real at all. The only thing that i can say that would have really made this movie ""scary"" is if they didn't show anything at all. Knowing what was happening but not really seeing it (like they did at the beginning of the movie with a power drill being shoved into the guy's leg) was more intense than anything else. I can't say anything good about this movie and wouldn't suggest to anyone that they should see it."

","I might get ragged on for not particularly liking this film, but I honestly thought it was way below average. ""Hostel"" starts off with three male friends vacationing in Europe, one of them being from Poland. The three guys are basically looking for girls and drugs, and Amsterdam is the perfect place for that. From there, they meet a guy who directs them to a youth Hostel in Slovakia, where the girls are apparently willing to do anything. So, the hormone crazed guys head that way. After arriving, they find the girls are great, but after time goes by strange things begin to happen, and after both of his friends go missing, the leader of the group, Paxton, is lead to an old abandoned building by one of the girls from the hostel. From there on, the blood begins to spill, and he discovers that the old abandoned building is used for wealthy businessman who pay to torture and brutally kill innocent travelers, just for the ""thrill of it"".<br/><br/>Eli Roth does a good job and completely disgusting his audience, there are some pretty brutal torture scenes here, and I will admit it gets pretty nasty. Yet, ""Hostel"" still felt like your below-average horror film to me, full of cheap nudity and sex, and some intense gore scenes to go along with it. The first 45 minutes of the movie felt like the teenage comedy ""Eurotrip"", and then it takes a dark turn. Still, this movie was a huge letdown, because the concept is actually really scary. Unfortunately, this movie was a mess. It felt comic at times when brutal things where happening, and made the atmosphere all too unrealistic, and completely unbelievable (an example being the town children attacking the bad guys, come on). For Roth's 2003 horror film, ""Cabin Fever"", the comic side of it worked, but with ""Hostel"", the comedy played into it makes it seem way too cheesy, and not serious enough. I was expecting much more, and it turned out to be far below average, despite all of the insane hype that the movie has gotten. I don't understand it.<br/><br/>I guess it just depends what kind of movies you like. ""Hostel"" is a brutal, gory, movie, with a bunch of nudity and sex, and I felt like I'd seen it all before. It all depends on taste though, and it just wasn't the right movie for me. It wasn't scary, I didn't care at all about the characters, it hardly had any plot at all, it was just disgusting. Had this movie had a much more serious tone and more plot development, it could've been a good movie. But it had neither of those things. If a couple of brainless hours of sex and torture make a good movie for you, then enjoy. For me, this movie failed. 3/10."

","To be honest with you, I thought this film was rubbish. I don't usually go out of my way to slate movies, but man Hostel was tripe.<br/><br/>The acting was terrible, and its not like you should be expecting it - the billing that its been getting and having QT's name all over it you would at least come to expect some good acting. The characters are the most unlikeable bunch ever. I was looking forward to them getting killed, not feeling sorry for them like I was in Wolf Creek. The twist and turns could have been seen a mile away. They had to con people into thinking it was a Tarantino flick so they would go see it, cause it wouldn't be able to pull viewers in on its own merit.<br/><br/>The scene on the train where they meet the German guy is just plain stupid. He is on a train and is eating a salad out of a travel pack and we are suppose to think he is a freak for this? Oh yeah, and he isn't vegetarian either, so he must be evil.<br/><br/>The two lead guys, I cant even remember their names, are so clichéd. One clean cut, ""I respect women and don't want to have sex with one unless I can hold her and cry myself to sleep afterwards while listening to Enrique all night"", emotional guy who misses his girlfriend and wants to work on the great American novel, and his friend - the sex hound who is gonna help him get over his ex.<br/><br/>Some of the gore is good. I'll give the movie that. But its one or two scenes of style over substance. There is even one torture scene where we have a throw back to Tom and Jerry. I would type up what it was but, I don't wanna post any spoilers who those unfortunate enough who still have to witness it.<br/><br/>Wolf Creek was 10 times better than this. Anyone who this nothing happened in Wolf Creek for the first 45 minutes is meant to be watching a movie like Valentine or I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Wolf Creek was all about character development, building of tension, bonding the audience with the cast, letting you cringe at the thought of the foreboding danger that lies ahead in the middle of nowhere. They did all that brilliantly. And when the 'action' started, it never stopped and kept you on the edge of your seat peering through your fingers at the scenes you were brave enough to watch. Brilliant film, unlike Hostel - which just tried to rip off Wolf Creek in nearly every way but failed on every account."

A crashing disappointment for Eli Roth after Cabin Fever, the only horrifying thing here is the planned sequel. Yeah, yeah, there are one or two comic touches involving a half-funny twist on the Oliver Dickens youthful vagabond shtick, and there's the inevitable revenge on the bad-guys; but by the time Hostel staggers to its paint-by-number payoffs it's all too late."

I didn't get a chance to see it in theaters, but I rented it the day it came out on DVD to quench my curiosity. I made sure I avoided any reviews of it, so I went into it with expectations for a really, truly sadistic gory ride.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. Using three (almost)unknowns as the leads was a good idea. Jay Hernandez was especially believable and sympathetic. The story is not important...lots of booze, drugs, and foreign-girl sex. The good part starts in a dark basement of a huge warehouse. This is where Elite Hunting is headquartered. In the dingy, dirty rooms, people can pay money to torture and kill tourists. Yep...thats basically it.<br/><br/>Roth took this idea and ran. He ran straight for the gore. If you're a gore hound like me, this film delivers.

After about 15 minutes of these guys being loud, obnoxious, and rude, I thought to myself, "" I got it, OK? Yea, they're young,dumb and full of C**."" Why couldn't they have been represented better as smart guys who are over there with a noble purpose? Why is it if they're American all they want is pot and sex?

","Eli Roth has, yet again, managed to produce a film throughout which one will wince at the unnecessarily graphic violence, and cringe at the risible plot and script-writing. What Tarantino is doing sullying his good name with this audio-visual garbage is anyone's guess, presumably Roth has some kind of hold over him and forced him to do so. I suspect that in years to come he will be ruing the error of his ways. The other notable cameo is that of Takeshi Miike, whose appearance only serves to remind you how much better he is at pulling off this type of gore-fest than Roth, as can be seen in both ""Audition"" and ""Ichi the Killer"".<br/><br/>Having seen ""Cabin Fever"", another ""film"" by Roth with essentially the same ""plot"", I did not enter the cinema with particularly high expectations, and thus I was not surprised when I left the cinema feeling mournful for the sad demise of the last 95 minutes of my life, which would have been more productive - and pleasant - had I spent them watching someone removing their own fingernails with a phillips head screwdriver while singing the first verse of ""Wannabe"" by the Spicegirls over and over again.<br/><br/>The depth of the characters is comparable to that of the plot and there is apparently little attempt to make one sympathise with them, so the prospect of their potential death merely makes wonder in what gruesome manner they might die, rather than if or how they'll get out alive.<br/><br/>So if you want violence verging on snuff, and nudity verging on pornography - both of which I'm sure are readily available on the internet for free, then this is one for you.

","A lot of people have come on here and praised or slated the film for its gore/lack of gore, and how people would have passed out through shock, and how the scene looked real/not real but I have a different outlook on this film.<br/><br/>The most scary thing I could get from this film was if this could really happen. Thousands of people disappear every year when they head off back packing on the other side of the world for a once-in-a-lifetime thrill and they are never heard from again. The Societ block has only just been broken up and there are large countries that have taken their Independence from Russia but how no full knowledge on how to use it. Most people know that the Russain mafia still have strong influences in these countries, so why could (not would) they not set up something like this? A small remote town out in the mountains somewhere with operatives all across Asia, Europe and Africa (just like the guy in Amsterdam). All tourists who are looking for anything different are 'informed & advised' to visit this place and they will find what they are looking for there. Once there, they are never heard from again. Bear in mind that in this film they are not only working against the organisation that has ensnared them, but the police and a few of the locals too.<br/><br/>This film may not have met the levels of SAW & SAW II in many peoples eyes, but I find the possibility of this actually happening far more terrifying than the SAW series. A serial killer as in SAW would just not elude the law long enough to get away with so much bloodshed as the US government has tight monitoring processes in place that would let them track down such a criminal in their own lands pretty swiftly. Out in many of the broke away Soviet block countries, they are no where near as advances.<br/><br/>I think this could truly happen."

Eli Roth tries hard (maybe the whole first half of the movie) to introduce us a story behind the massacre that we know is bound to happen, to give us context, and he fails miserably at that. The characters are so moronic in anything they say or do as to almost look like a caricature of your average Dumb American travelling through an Europe where everyone speaks German; the ""plot"" is so vain and empty that it looks as if it was written by a six year old, with all the never-ending clichés and the recurrent phrases and events from the past which come back to hunt you; the way those ""ghosts"" from the past make their way into the story, which is as subtle as a chainsaw; the camera work which is average at best; the lousy soundtrack that never gets to be even remotely convincing; and many more.<br/><br/>As if that wasn't bad enough, Roth felt the need to stick a comic relief into every other scene during that ""introduction."" I swear there were chuckles - hell, downright, full out laughs - in the theatre when we were told that the word the characters have been using to refer to chicks the whole time actually means ""clit"" in Icelandic. I'm betting the people who laughed were also enjoying great lines like ""I'm the king of the swing"" and ""Of course, my horse.""<br/><br/>And then we get to the slaughterhouse, where, hopefully, every teenager who has ever been bullied can let his anger out, just sit back and watch some old-school madness, right? Wrong. You get to see blood, yes, but not as much as the trailer had you hoping for, and always with some lame dialogue in between; for instance: <br/><br/>Josh: You... Why? The Dutch Businessman: I always wanted to be a surgeon. But the boards would not pass me. Can you guess why? You see? So I went into business. But business is so boring. You buy things you sell them, you make money you spend money. What kind of life is that? A surgeon, he holds the very essence of life in his hands - your life. He touches it. He has a relationship with it. He is part of it. Josh: Please just let me go, please... The Dutch Businessman: You want to go? Is that what you want?<br/><br/>So, you see, the Dutch Businessman has ""problems"". He has a ""past."" Here I was thinking that he was just your everyday Business Joe who loves his daughter and likes to slash ankles and legs open. Go figure.<br/><br/>I can't for the life of me think of a decent excuse for Tarantino to be associating his name with Hostel: everything Tarantino is good at, Hostel almost magically ruins. Dialogue, editing, soundtracks, even mindless pointless violence. Everything. Here's hoping we never see a Five Rooms with Roth directing (or worse, writing!) one of them.<br/><br/>Alas, this movie is so nauseatingly bad that Eli Roth may just turn into a cult hero.

The film stuck rigidly to the Hollywood conventions of exaggeration and lack of subtlety and general brashness that goes with this genre. The three central characters shouted a lot and the early Amsterdam scenes were larger than life American fantasies of degenerate Europe with everybody overacting like mad and behaving in totally stereotypical ways. The Slovak section was visually attractive and slightly more subtle, but the whole film seemed to be shot in bright light with loud and obvious background music announcing every nasty scene well in advance. I am not saying it was a bad film - of it's type it was exceptionally good - but in the hands of a better director it could have been a lot ""darker"" in every sense, and produced more involvement with the characters, none of whom were particularly likable, and even more shock impact from the gore scenes.

The three main characters Paxton (Jay Hernandez), Josh (Derek Richardson) and Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) are introduced living the any reckless male teenager's dream of debauchery, ingesting drugs, alcohol and sleeping with as many women as possible women. Paxton and Josh are in the middle of their Backpacking trip through Europe, playing the typical annoying, ignorant American tourists, having already befriended the loud extrovert Icelander Oli somewhere along the way. After finding themselves locked out of their hostel on a particular night out in Amsterdam, a chance meeting with a stranger tells them of the ultimate backpackers hostel in Bratislava, where the eastern European girls are desperate for any men they meet especially American. After arriving at the hostel in Bratislava, the promise of women not exaggerated and all three immediately hook up with three beautiful women. The morning after, things turn strange as they wake to find Oli missing, with the hotel reception informing them he has apparently checked out and gone home to Iceland. Strange things continue to happen as Josh goes missing next, leaving Paxton to search for his friends amongst the rather unhelpful locals and a rather vicious gang of 6-year-olds to uncover a darker side to the Bratislava.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, the film has a fair bit of bloodshed, gore and some quite gruesome scenes, definitely not for the squeamish, the death scenes make you cringe but also has the ability to mesmerise you with curiosity.<br/><br/>You would like this if you enjoyed the horror films such as Saw, Saw2, Final Destination or even the aimless deaths in Cube. The kinds of murders in all these films were reminiscent with the extravagant death scenes as the story unfolds from plenty of erotica and sex scenes early on, then to gory blood and finally to gruesome unrealistically funny.<br/><br/>For a good mindless blood I fully recommend this film, it will never be classic because simply there wasn't anything new to offer, it did however, leave me with a lasting nausea effect for a few days but don't expect any twists, turns, head spins or any real plot to develop. It trundles to the end and finishes with nothing more than a minor resolution to end."

","Hostel, well...I was told by a friend that this will be the scariest movie you'll ever see and the trailer looked a bit creepy. It was the whistling and no music. The critics, well the ones I read, seemed to agree with the hype. Here's what I thought of it. Although not original in it's concept (My Little Eye)the idea was still a good one. If this was a film about giving thought to what you do before you do it and then bear the consequence then it didn't quite hit the mark although there was redemption in the film. I found the film good because it made me laugh. There was black humour in it but I don't know if it was intentional. The feedback from Roth on cable inferred not, moreover I was not frightened nor was I made to feel squeamish. Roth alluded to it himself when he stated that humans are more scarier than monsters and I could not agree with him more, but this film didn't enforce that belief. To make someone feel uncomfortable during death scenes you have to make it believable. The scene in Donnie Brasco in the cellar when they cut the body up, that was difficult viewing. The Native Americans and their arrows when they kill Timmins in Dances With Wolves, that is uncomfortable viewing. Butchering, maiming, killing... it can't have more impact than the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and films from that era, or even recently Ed Gein with Steven Railsbeck. Hostel was 18 rated entertainment and it did that well. It made me laugh, it made me root for the good guy and more importantly it entertained, but it certainly did not frighten me, nor did it make me feel uncomfortable. My personal view is that there are a number of people in the film world and outside that like Roth as a friend and may be viewing the film through rose tinted glasses. He may be a good guy but you have to be honest to your friends."

","After watching this film its obvious who its aimed at. Teenagers, those seeking to get into their first movie underage, oh how disappointed they will be. I thought the Blair witch was the most overrated film of all time, this runs it close. <br/><br/>The shameful marketing of this film makes me want to demand my £6 entry back directly from Tarantino for conning me into believing that the Tarantino tag was a guarantee for witty script and original screenplay. The horror aspect was far too weak to carry the average script. If there is going to be no tension building then lets see some ""shocking violence"", but when it comes you just cant help but feel as though the joke is on you. The first part of the movie is wasted on nipples and unwitty dialogue, there was plenty of time given to do some decent character building. Its a real shame to see a talented director (Cabin Fever is far far better in every way) and a legendary backer bring absolute discredit to their names, maybe they are going to release the real Hostel in a few months and this was their idea of a sick joke.<br/><br/>You can see what Roth was trying to do but I feel as though the potential had been simply been thrown away. Then he wraps it all up with some perverse Hollywood ending based on incredible coincidence. <br/><br/>To sum up, its witless, the characters are poorly developed (did anyone care if they died in a brutal manner?), the violence is unoriginal not particularly stomach churning and we are left with mass exploitation of film goers.

Not that that's entirely the filmmakers' fault, but I imagine anyone over the age of 14 will come out feeling short-changed (and if they're 14 they shouldn't be watching it anyway) because it's so pointless. The premise is good, and the film does convey a sense of the panic one would feel at being trapped in a strange country with the events taking place. Also, the idea's alleged basis in fact does have a chilling element to it, but ultimately, it's a long wait until anything happens and when it does it's strictly formulaic and even insulting. The violence is not for the squeamish, but it's totally unconvincing if you don't avert your eyes. There is no style in terms of cinematography or direction, neither does it take the Wolf Creek realism angle. It looks like a nasty version of Porky's. If it still appeals to you,give it a try, but only on DVD."

","As gore films go this is a good one. It is not just a series of stomach churning violent scenes that leave you reaching for the sick bag, in fact the story line is well developed and the film, as a whole, has a menacing feel. There are just enough twists and turns to keep you guessing the whole way through and you are always one step away from really knowing whats going on. There is also a moral thread running through the film, which is shown between the parallel of the boys buying women at the beginning and being bought themselves at the end. There is just enough gore and violence to keep you happy but not leave you feeling over faced. It is not a big budget Hollywood gore flick packed full of special effects but I feel that it benefits from this because it has to rely on plot line and suspense to deliver the real chills.

","As a horror fan it's getting really disheartening. Why is it that it's becoming increasingly difficult to find modern films that fit the bill of ""decent effective horror""?? We all know it does exist as there have been the odd recent examples, but we're still having to rely all too frequently on the output from the Asian film industries to find something remotely effective.<br/><br/>Then I heard about Hostel. From everything I'd heard it seemed like this might actually get back to some of the raw darker roots of the horror genre  and for once this wasn't just a remake of a great 70's/80's exploitation flick. I never liked Cabin Fever, which although having potential, never actually delivered anything, but putting that aside, the impression I've got from reading interviews with Eli Roth is that he's actually interested in going back to those exploitation roots and pushing the boundaries again.<br/><br/>So what the hell happened?? There's an interesting premise (that's interesting in the context of a horror film), the dark, grim almost nihilistic feel that suggests something really shocking is going to happen, yet very little actually does. In fact, I was actually quite surprised by how little... The first half of the film was pretty bad and extremely cheesy, and sets out to show as many naked women as possible (which, intentionally or not, I found to be an mildly humorous homage to 80's slasher movies, despite it showing a lack of actual creativity), but also worked effectively in making 2 of the 3 main characters pretty unlikeable. As you know something shocking is going to happen later on, you can half accept these bad scenes. At least that was what I thought The latter half of the film just completely missed the mark on being any sort of decent horror movie. The torture scenes were generally quite restrained and, unless you're new to the genre, pretty much veered away from anything particularly shocking, (the one exception being the scene with the Japanese girl). There were no scares and the one or 2 ""suspenseful"" scenes were lacking any actual suspense. The opportunity to shock should've been the saving grace of the film, as that's how it had been billed, but when this restraint is put alongside the bad first half, I was left wondering why I was wasting my time. The ending of the film turns out to be so contrived it's practically the most painful thing to watch. Despite all this though, the filmmakers did have 1 clever idea  the Takashi Miike cameo.<br/><br/>As this wasn't a tense or scary horror movie, it needed to shock and repulse the audience to get a reaction. That didn't happen. Yet again (this is becoming the ultimate cliché of the genre) the potential was there to make something really effective, but that was squandered and the film ends up as just another average American horror movie with little going for it. Although Eli Roth is clearly a horror movie fan, it seems he doesn't actually make his films for fans of horror movies."

I like them as much as anyone else but if I wanted to see that I would've hired a porn movie. As you kind of already know what the film is about you are sat there waiting for something to happen and you have to wait a while for it to happen and when it does finally happen it isn't long until it's over again which leaves you waiting for something more to happen.<br/><br/>From what there was at the main point of the film it was good apart from the ""I'm American, I have to be a hero and save the girl"" kind of thing which was in there and didn't help it's cause in making me like the movie.

"ErasmusSpikher","3","0","0","23 March 2006"," Not a big deal (the first part, at least)
","The film splits into two parts, the teenage sex comedy part and the horror part, which is not necessarily a fault. Horror is most effective if it starts in commonplace circumstances, and smoking pot and hunting madly for sex, no matter whether at the native college or with backpack overseas, seems to be commonplace for kids of the age group that was portrayed in the film. (And that is dominating the audience.) I do not admire such behavior but I do not think that because of how the poor kids behave one cannot sympathize with them when they get tortured later. Surely he who confronts his companions with his naked bottom repeatedly for no apparent reason, and calls himself ""the king of the swing"", should be punished, but chopping off his head is a bit too much. Perhaps it would suffice if his friend, an admirer of Kafka, would read him loudly the first chapter of the novel Amerika. Anyway, maybe a teenage sex comedy really has some potential to serve as a preamble to a horror, as the makers of the film believe. I went to the theater just to see whether this is the case. (In fact, I walked out after the first torture scene and I knew in advance that I will walk out. I do not have stomach for this kind of horror. I like Vertigo but not The Silence of the Lambs.) My general feeling is that the first part of the film is shot loosely, without focus and verve. As if the director thought ""I am shooting an indie film, a film for fans (of whom there will be plenty), so why care?"". When some suspense appears after all, it seems like it was smuggled into the film by the actors behind the director's back. I am talking about the creepy salad-eater in the train, and the girl with an eloquent smile at the reception desk of the hostel. But not the children gang, please! These well-fed Czech kids, thinking that they will look frightening if they will frown into the camera, were laughable. Perhaps if the film was shot in Slovakia, as the script suggests, and not in Czech republic, it would work better. After all, the opening takes of the horror classic Nosferatu were shot in Orava, a rough but beautiful region of Slovakia near the Slovak-Polish border."

","Dear fellow Slovaks that feel offended with allegedly revolting image of their beloved native country portrayed in the movie could have calmed down. I dare to refer to some of the postings at Hostel discussion boards.<br/><br/>SOME SPOILERS: What a delight to find out that those sophisticated entertainment for wealthy foreigners comes from nowhere else than homeland of ballet, vodka, caviar and Kalashnikov! Just have a brief look at the e-mail address at the 'Elite Hunting' card. (Incidentally, my favorite Sony Wega that vividly and truthfully reproduced the colors of this movie was made in Slovakia.)<br/><br/>Everything has it's price. Perhaps Russians are the easiest prey in that neck of the woods, while Americans are hard to find, if American meat is five times as much expensive as that of the Russian - it's a market economy... Or, maybe, Russians are simply more primitive. And the excitement of torturing and killing a Russian for mere five grands is nothing compared to the sky high pleasure of dismembering a more complex live organism. It would be ridiculous if Russians would feel somehow abused and may protest against the inadequate price-list.<br/><br/>The chick that lured the boys into the trap, Natalya, is Russian. Her blond girlfriend Svetlana is Czech. Besides, no one would judge the entire country by a couple of hookers. The bad guys are Dutch, German and American. Oh, I've just forgotten hideous Takashi Miike (nice cameo!). Contrary to them the majority of the locals look friendly and intelligent. I guess maybe the bunch of zombie-like kids that kill for a chewing gum is something slightly over the top - but anyway they did a good job in one of the final sequences.<br/><br/>The rotten renegade cops that law-abiding individuals must be afraid of are abound elsewhere in the world - otherwise internal investigation officers could have got the hook.<br/><br/>Most of the cars exhibited in Hostel are good old Russian Volgas. I understand that the country is now flooded with major European brands of vehicles, and vintage Russian make in a reformed East European economy may look something extraneous and ancient. But at least this is a part of the Soviet legacy that should hardly be embarrassed of. <br/><br/>The movie is shot on location in neighboring Czech Republic (frankly I found most of the scenery to be quite beautiful and not appalling at all, irrespective of either it stands for the particular country or not).<br/><br/>I believe there's absolutely none of country specific features reproduced in the film that could have shattered respectable image of Slovakia, especially considering that this is just a movie. Moreover the film-goers shouldn't expect that foreign filmmakers could do a feature about their country better than their local producers.<br/><br/>As to the film itself, unfortunately, the concept about a kind of human safari wasn't extremely original as the producers claim. <br/><br/>At least I found Roth's earlier effort, Cabin Fever, to be more chilling, effective and surprising."

","First of all let me start off by saying they promoted this movie in Australia as another Tarantino flick which put me in the mood for something completely different to a non-humor horror flick.<br/><br/>After the credits where read I realized that he was just an executive producer and Eli Roth was the director. I blame myself for not looking into it more being a movie buff and all.<br/><br/>I'm not a great horror movie fan as most horror flicks don't really work, as one person mention I haven't been scared since Alien was made. Gore doesn't really work unless you feel like the characters this doesn't mean that you need to be like them but know someone who is similar which worked in Hostel.<br/><br/>Many would have complained about the soft porn and I agree but it was to put you in the picture of young boys who will be easily seduced by the thought of easy sex in Europe and the people who live in Europe where taking advantage of this by showing them what they wanted to see.<br/><br/>One of the Hero's was clearly a mummies boy and frankly I was glad died the hardest he was homophobic, and he was making a point that he was a prude and yet he wanted the cheap sex and arrogance of being an American. He was perhaps a sterotype American and to the non-American's of the world they could identify that type of character, I was sort of scared that he would be the sole survivor as in other movies of a similar nature but I was glad it was not the case.<br/><br/>The horror was perhaps too strong for many but I agree it wasn't labored on and when you look around at horror films I found it hard to find anything that was scary enough to make me move and yes this film scared me and moved me so the goal was achieved.<br/><br/>I think that the last ""victim"" had a great twist and instead of all the movies where he manages to escape and the police save the day it was good to see someone getting revenge for a change, most movies are fairly predictable I guess this wasn't one of them.<br/><br/>As art which it should be seen as, I liked it overall perhaps I wasn't in the mood for this type as they promoted it as something it wasn't. Eli Roth picked good cast of not so well known actors and it was good to see ladies where not just the pretty bodies but had an important role to play.<br/><br/>To a point too much sex strong gore but if they didn't do it the movie wouldn't have worked, the eye scene was fantastic. I'm not a great Hollywood fan as I guess you could see with my comments, if you tried to tone this movie down wouldn't be even a decent bad movie, but if they did tone it down it would really just allow others to bag it as another boring Hollywood movie."

I gotta admit, I truly love Cabin Fever (Eli Roth's first) for everything it has done with the genre that's completely missing in Hostel. With Hostel instead, you get no outstanding soundtrack, no good characters, the casting is terrible, the camera never seems to get above average TV stuff, a stupid script, in conclusion everything you are used to have in a seventies exploiter classic. But instead of going the full homage way with inserting some ironic and self-disrespecting stuff, Eli just did the same stupid stuff they did in the seventies.<br/><br/>Nah, this thing has had some excellent marketing stuff involved and truly outstanding poster art, but behind all this, there's not much at all to explore.

""party 'till you drop and some sex on the side"" seems to be the theme of the main characters (notice all the flaws in in the beginning). there is no real moment in this film where i sat on the point of my chair. the first 40 minutes are very boring to be honest. to much beautiful, single, perfect-body-having-girls throughout the film, very unrealistic. all girls seem to be craving for sex, which ain't the fact in real life (ofcoarse). when the torture starts at around 43minutes viewing time, it gets a little exciting, but no more than that. it goes from an American pie into a James Bond flick, trying to be realistic, but with that amount of flaws in a movie, it's hard to create a realistic movie, ain't it? 4 out of 10 is more than enough.<br/><br/>flaws: -dutch people speaking German (are you kidding me?!) -the main characters telling the viewer they are in Amsterdam, which isn't the case (looking at the buildings and surroundings). -it's hard to travel without your passport in the east side of Europe (but for the main character it ain't a problem)."

And on top of that we have absolute crap like ""Skeleton Key"", not a remake but still lacking all kinds of creativity and fresh ideas.<br/><br/>One of the movies i did in fact enjoy somewhat was ""SAW"". And when i read what was written about ""Hostel"" it seemed this would be something similar. But i think that it's pretty far from it. While ""SAW"" was no real masterpiece as such, it did have a couple of nice touches. It was fairly original and most of all it had a definite touch of evil ingenuity to it that gave a certain touch to all of the unpleasantness. I found that touch sorely lacking in ""Hostel"".<br/><br/>This movie starts out like a college-movie. Three guys in Europe enjoying legal drugs and loose women. Then they hear of a hostel in Slovakia where the women are apparently insanely beautiful and willing, and they love Americans. Too good to be true? Of course it is, this is a horror movie after all.<br/><br/>It seems to me director Eli Roth really went above and beyond trying to create as many disgusting effects as possible in this movie. And in that respect at least, ""Hostel"" was a success. But all the blood in the world, nor a shallow ending trying to make some sort of commentary about human nature, can't save a movie that lacks style as well as substance. Without either a sense of humor or a distinct message in all the carnage it's just blood, and blood in itself is not very interesting.

The rest of the people all had the same exact expression on their face when the movie ended - you know the one that says I can't believe I just watched that whole movie and dropped like $40 because of it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong this is not that bad for a ""goofy gory movie get together night"" for a $4 rental (like Cabin Fever, Thirteen Ghosts, etc.), but don't expect anything more than that."

","Each year, less than 50 % of mainstream AMC films can truly be called ""good movies."" The majority of them are unoriginal, poorly made, or crowd-pleasers. When it comes to the horror genre, it is rare to see a true mainstream gem. <br/><br/>This year, Eli Roth's pseudo-horror film, ""Hostel,"" is best described as a modern Roman coliseum. It is a wasteful piece of violence and sex-filled entertainment, in which moviegoers, sadly, waste their money on. At the local Cineplex, ""Hostel,"" was sold out opening night. The audience laughed and cheered at the sex, violence, and torture. Entertainment, and film-going in general, has reached a pathetic new height.<br/><br/>The premise of ""Hostel"" has potential. Three pleasure-seeking males go on a foreign escapade of drugs and sex, hoping to sleep with as many women as possible. What starts off as an imitation of Eurotrip or a Van Wilder movie soon turns into a masochistic vacation from hell. Rich men have payed big money to torture and murder these American pigs.<br/><br/>When ""Hostel"" shifts drastically in its tone and filming style, one would expect some kind of substance or genuine type of horror. Unfortunately, Roth's film is a flat-liner. This film is not scary, and nothing comes unexpected. Unlike the best horror film of 2005, ""Wolf Creek,"" Eli Roth presents ""Hostel"" for pure shock value. His characters are ridiculously 2-D, and seeing them get tortured does not feel all that bad. The viewer should have some sort of empathy for these helpless victims, but they are seen as puppets in a circus act.<br/><br/>Takashi Miike, the modern king of Japanese horror, has a cameo in ""Hostel."" Referring to the warehouse where the torture is happening, he says, ""Be careful. You could lose all your money in there."" What a true statementÂ—for Eli Roth, for his worthless characters in the film, and for moviegoers squandering money to see a disgraceful waste of bad horror."

","Title: Hostel (2006) <br/><br/>Director: Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) <br/><br/>Cast: Jay Hernandez <br/><br/>Review: Of all the over-hyped movies in the world...this one takes the taco. I mean, Eli Roth the director of the disappointing Cabin Fever is back with his new creation: Hostel. And this time around he uses the same marketing strategy he wisely employed while promoting Cabin Fever which was hyped as a ""return to gritty 70s horror"" and we all know how that turned out. So here we are again, with Roths latest money making scheme ...did he succeed in making a better film then Cabin Fever? The story is about three friends who are out in Amsterdam backpacking through the country, enjoying all the girls, booze and drugs they can. On a certain occasion they meet this guy who tells them about a Hostel that has the horniest and prettiest girls in the universe. Of course they fall for that irresistible offer and go, they hook up with the girls and one by one the guys suspiciously start to disappear.<br/><br/>There were some good things in this movie. First off, the way the film was shot is beautiful. We get some nice lighting, some nice grissly looking sets. Art direction and cinematography were excellent.<br/><br/>We get good performers, Jay Hernandez being the one that stands out the most. He shined in ""Crazy/Beautiful"" and here he shows he wasn't just a one time fluke. The rest of the cast of unknowns do a cool job and the characters seem real and likable. So basically we got the elements for a good film right? The problem for me with Roths Hostel, was that it wasn't original at all. Roth has obviously been seeing a lot of Japanese horror films and he is just copying a lot of their style of storytelling. Roths appreciation and influence by J-Horror is so evident, that even Takashi Miike (one of the most respected Japanese horror directors) has a cameo on the film.<br/><br/>But again, the film was walking over all too familiar ground. Friends backpacking through a strange country? Thats almost as overused as the old stormy weather/car breaking down/ spooky mansion down the road plot device. But there it was. Similarities to Saw I'm sure will spread like wildfire. There's even a scene clearly ripped off from the Japanese movie called Suicide Club.<br/><br/>I guess Roths just doing the same thing that Tarantino does with his films which is basically ripping off stuff that he likes and using it in his own movies. But at least Tarantino makes up for that by writing excellent stories and dialogue. Not so on Roths film. Heck if you've seen John Woos Hard Target, you'll get the gist of what this movie is about. The movies plot is waaay to simple, so much so that I quickly got bored when I saw that it was going to go nowhere.<br/><br/>And then there was the gore. And this my friends was the thing that upset me the most. We get some gore, but this film is being marketed as a balls to the wall gore fest that will leave you gasping and it really isn't all that. The gore was highly restrained. I could feel the blades of the MPAA cutting away at this film, more sharply then ever before.<br/><br/>Watching Hostel reminded me a lot of the time when I saw Romeros theatrical release of Land of the Dead. You could just feel the censors holding back Roths film. Specially during those scenes involving the actual torture of the characters. Just when you think stuff is going to get good. Snip! The almighty hand of the MPAA cut the film. I'm guessing I can better review this film once I have seen the final directors cut of the film and not this hacked down version. I hope the gore will really be out there, cause the version I saw at the theaters was really tame compared to other horror films I've seen. It does have its moments (like that eyeball scene!) but for this seasoned horror fan, the gore was a bit light.<br/><br/>But movies aren't all about gore, so lets see. Aside from the fact that the movie was ripping off a gazillion other horror movies...some scenes were just too stupid. There's an instance in which a character looses two of his fingers at a certain point...yet he manages to drive a car, run around, hide and fight some bad guys, all without passing out. I wasn't alone in thinking that it wasn't at all possible. The dude would have passed out from hamerging a loooong time ago. Yet there he was hopping about. I know, I know, its just a movie, but suspension of disbelief will go only so far! All in all, Id say that Hostel was a film that had its moments and had some good things going for it, and yes, when compared to Cabin Fever, Hostel is far superior. But still it was missing one ingredient that matters a whole lot for me in horror movies: originality. Still, I think Roth can come up with something better. This sophomore effort is OK. But just OK. I'm still going to wait out for Roths masterpiece, cause this sure wasn't it.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 out of 5"

"crankyerma","Null","0","0","16 January 2006"," Prejudice and Bloody Aprons
","This is yet another Texas Chainsaw ripoff. It seems that is the trend in horror these days. Filmmakers are either extremely class-phobic or they are banking on the idea that the movie going public is. It seems like every horror movie these days is about some sort of sadistic person or group living in an isolated, impoverished area getting their jollies by torturing and killing snotty, over-privileged kids.<br/><br/>Films like TCM(especially the remake), House of Wax, Wrong Turn, Wolf Creek, House of 1000 Corpses, etc. all play on the idea that poor rural people are dark, dirty and evil things to be feared. It may be because this stereo-type of rural bumpkins is unattractive to an image and wealth-obsessed youth culture and it's easier to fear those who are unattractive.<br/><br/>Another reason for TCM type villains may be because the rural American image is usually shadowed by a reputation for racism and modern horror audiences are so saturated by urban pop culture that subliminally tying a villain to racism makes said villain even more despicable.<br/><br/>Obviously ""Hostel"" does not fall into this category. Though the prejudice in this picture is just as prevalent. Here we substitute poor foreigners for poor Americans. With the fear of the foreign ever increasing in an age marked by widespread Anti-American sentiment abroad, it only stands to reason that we we have evil, poor, foreigners looking to torture and kill Americans kids just out to spend spring break innocently spending their money exploiting eastern Euro whores.<br/><br/>So, if you count that Eli Roth combined the fear of the impoverished and the rural and tied it with American xenophobia as being original, than yes ""Hostel"" is original. Taking ""Texas Chainsaw"" and re-locating it in a war torn country that deserves America's pity more than it's fear, was a stroke of genius. The same kind of genius that decided to send John Wayne hero character to Vietnam for ""The Green Berets."" Roth may not be a good writer but he definitely knows how to profit off of people's prejudices. If he were around Hollywood for the early eighties we might of had ""Night of the Living AIDS Victims"" with zombified homosexual men hell bent on spreading a disease. I'm guessing that Reagan would have exec produced.<br/><br/>In summary, Roth's latest picture's incredible lack of plot or originality is the least of its sins. The greatest sin of them all is that I'd be willing to bet this steaming pile knocked more than one superior project off track for release."

The story line in any other film might have taken up twenty minutes. Okay here's the basic story, two college guys, go to Europe to do the whole ""Eurotrip Thing"" and meet this guy who sends them to Russia to get the best girls who just love to give it up for the ""American dreams"". They arrive at this Hostel, a hotel-like place that you share rooms with other guests (almost dorm-like conditions), and meet these two beauties who are just as they were told...ready and willing for the Americans. They continue to see the girls and find out that the Hostel is actually a supermarket for the Russian Mafia to find people to kill. They charge people to come and kill someone just so they can find out how it feels. It took you just as long to read that as it should have taken to show on the screen.

","Hostel is about a group of young men venturing out to fulfill their quenches for sex and drugs. Of course, torture enters into the movie later, as the previews depict, and at this point the movie takes a sharp turn. The film includes a very long introduction which exists simply to show that the protagonists like breasts and pot. The characters are certainly shallow, but the problem here is that it is difficult to feel empathy toward them at any point in the film. Hostel is better than most horror movies. For those who have seen The Grudge and the like, and were rightfully disappointed, you will find that this movie is undoubtedly better. But unlike the truly successful horror movies like Saw, this lacks an intricate plot and good acting--which, despite this common modern belief that gore and quick bursts of loud music or lights flickering on and off to make you jump is all that matters--is actually a problem. Again, the film is gory, although a good portion of the movie lacks any gore--or suspense for that matter. For those who love gore, blood, and fingers breaking off, see this. You will see some images that will more than make you feel uneasy. But this movie could have been better. And you'll see why too."

","Eli Roth's ""Hostel"" is the kind of horror movie that film buffs have been waiting for a long time. The horror and gore don't come until later. In fact it felt like I was watching the sequel to ""Eurotrip"". THe story begins with three friends in Amsterdamn looking for easy sex in the brothels. When they come back they meet up with a guide who tells them about this great hostel in another part of the country that has tons of hot girls living in it. At first when the guys get there. they hook up immediately with some of the women and they have a fun filled night of sex and debauchery. Then the friends begin to disappear one by one and they each end up in this factory where people pay a lot of money to torture and kill another human being. I don't want to give anything more away but what makes this film work is how the audience perceptions about violence change. At the start the violence is very horrifying and disturbing, but by the end I heard crowds cheering. The torture scenes are filled with enough carnage to make you squirm a little but it will never compare to the last fifteen minutes of ""Auditon"". The thriller by Takeshi Miike who has a cameo appearance in ""Hostel"" Another thing that made the ""Hostel"" not as scary as I thought, was the score. The composer was trying to make it sound more like a Hitchcock thriller than a horror movie. I do hope that horror genre will continue in this vain, and try it's best to scare us to our wits end ."

They here about a hostel with these great girls that will satisfy them so they head out there. Then they find out what awaits them at that hostel. I was pretty disappointed with this movie, the trailers seem to put it out as a real scary gory film when its honestly not. This movie is just about as gory as Saw.

I recently saw wolf creek and think both movies rank around the same score but i would say i enjoyed hostel a tiny bit more. Both movies start out pretty slow and could have been trimmed down in time drastically. If you really wanna go out to the theater and see a horror movie then this is the one to see right now but honestly i would just wait for the DVD.

Any movie goer going into this film with that notion will be disappointed. The bottom line: it really isn't that scary or gory. Hostel also tried to included social commentary. The film fails completely in this aspect. <br/><br/>(spoilers) The concept of how rich people will pay for anything and that there are sick people who will take the money and provide them with the product remains lost in the mess that comprises ""Hostel's"" narrative. (spoilers)<br/><br/>Eli Roth, the director, continues to exhibit the same weakness that his feature film debut, ""Cabin Fever"" suffered from. Both films should be more shocking and thrilling, creating a sense of fear and dread. But Roth's ""Horror Comedy"" approach deflates whatever emotional ride he was setting up his audience for.<br/><br/>This fault of Roth is a real shame. ""Hostel"" shows great promise and missed opportunities. Eli Roth's direction in ""Hostel"" does show some genuine ingenuity and talent. One scene in particular where one of the victims sits in complete darkness not knowing what will happen to him was very nerve racking and effective. The opening three minutes of ""Hostel"" are also quite good. <br/><br/>So maybe one day Eli Roth will make a good horror film.

However, if you actually want a decent plot without a 95 minute nightmarish feel to it, go see something else.<br/><br/>The thing is, we all have our own disgusting, torture-filled imaginations that could fill up numerous pages of a script. The real hard part is finding a way to weave them into a good storyline, not just chuck a bunch of blood and gore at the screen and call it a movie.<br/><br/>I thought Cabin Fever was a great movie, very smart and original. Hostel, however, is like Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino getting together in front of a computer trying to play a game of ""who can out-gross whom."" There's no doubt that you won't be able to get some of the images out of your head and will probably talk about them for a couple of days.

As most horror fans seem to confess, I've been nothing but bored by most of the American mainstream submissions lately, finding movies like ""Saw"" to be, at most, an interesting idea very poorly executed.

Still, that seems like mere pandering to any intellectual complaint that, let's face it, a whole lot of naked breasts will make some viewers happy no matter what a letdown the film turns out to be. The first half of the movie is worthless; the plot is barely inched along, and its totally obvious to anyone who has seen a horror movie before who isn't to be trusted. There is no air of mystery, or even a satisfying ""The audience is in the know"" kind of suspense. After all of the nothing, I found myself hoping someone, ANYone would get on with getting killed just so we could get to the meat of the movie. And it is in this very ""meat"" where the true disappointment lies.<br/><br/>The gore is NOT excessive. It is NOT disturbing, it is not, in fact, anything above ""Saw"" or ""Final destination"" or any of the other crap that fans were basically promised it was going to above. It is NOTHING close to the levels of intense ""I-need-to-look-away-but-can't-take-my- eyes-off-it"" Asian-style violence that ""Hostel"" PROMISED it would be. Everything you read that says the camera doesn't pull away is basically referring to one scene that caused me to laugh out loud (which, admittedly is probably what Eli would want me to do) at its over-the- topness, but one thirty-second sequence, and a few quick throat slits doesn't make up for the hour and twenty minutes of boring crap. I suppose that to a crop of ""Horror Fans"" who think something like ""Final Destination 2"" is ""Toally messed-up, man"" than yeah, this movie might be considered edgy. But, to a fan of real Horror, basically to someone Eli was MAKING THIS MOVIE FOR, ""Hostel"" is a just a let-down."
"JosephLee411","Null","0","0","9 January 2006"," Disturbing and shocking film.
","Hostel(2005)<br/><br/>Starring: Jay Hernandez as Paxton Derek Richardson as Josh Eythor Gudjonsson as Oli Jan Vlasak as The Dutch Businessman<br/><br/>Plot: Three backpackers are making their way through Europe, partaking in the sex and drugs in countries like Amsterdam. They are soon told of a Slovakian city where they can pay for anything they want from the girls. They soon become victims of a group called ""Elite Hunting"" in which innocent people are captured and then tortured and killed by paying customers. <br/><br/>Hostel is an interesting movie. It is directed by Eli Roth, the guy who made Cabin Fever(a movie I loved). This movie had a lot of pressure to deliver I thought. They went and attached Quentin Tarantino's name to it as a producer, talked up how ""shocking"" it was and made it seem like Horror's second coming. So naturally it had to deliver or would be considered a huge disappointment, correct? Well I'm happy to report that despite being over-hyped, Hostel does come through and bring the goods in disturbing fashion.<br/><br/>This movie lives up to it's exploitation image that the trailers were trying to portray, I thought. There's lots of partying in the beginning which equals lots of drug use and nudity in general. This lets your guard down for what happens later. The whole thing had a sense of dread throughout, especially in the beginning when the characters are having so much fun and you know that something bad is going to happen to them. <br/><br/>Then when the horror finally hits we are treated to lots and lots of gore. Severed heads, slashes with scalpels, nasty cuts, severed fingers, cut up bodies, sick hammer shots in which we see a skull cave in, chainsaw action, severed leg, gunshots, people run over, lots of vomiting and more. I haven't even gone into the eyeball scene, which was just so gross it was unbelievable this got an R-cut. I find it odd how people complained about lack of gore when there was just enough in the right amounts here. So in terms of brutality it certainly lives up to how it was played up. <br/><br/>None of the torture would mean a damn thing if we didn't care about who it was happening to. Jay Hernandez leads the pack with a good performance as Paxton. He looks genuinely terrified, as opposed to acting like it. And his character even has some decent back story which plays into the decisions he makes. Derek Richardson did good as Josh, and I liked his character. Eythor Gudjonsson played Oli well and he was pretty funny. How could you not love ""The King of the Swing""? Jan Vlasak was kind of creepy as the dutch businessman, but that was how he was supposed to be, so good job. The girls in this movie were hot, and that's pretty much all they were in there for. <br/><br/>This movie has some flaws, however. Some of the comedy felt forced. That was part of Roth's problem in Cabin Fever, trying to inject comedy in certain situations where it just didn't work. And in the beginning, we are treated to lots of partying. Then more partying, and more and more and more. I get the fact they wanted to show that these guys are out to party but you know, it just seemed a tad bit repetitive. I wanted to get to what was advertised. Also I'd have to say that parts of the movie were a little predictable, and the ending was anti-climatic. Also, what was up with the kids? I really did not like having them in the movie as this little juvenile gang. Even if I did get where they were going with it, it felt pointless.<br/><br/>Other than some hiccups here and there, Hostel does it's job well. It shocks and scares the audience and while it may have been over-hyped, it still lived up to most expectations I had for it. Plus in addition to being shocking this movie actually was pretty scary, as it sure made me never want to go backpacking in Europe...ever, and the audience I was with was definitely jumping when they needed to, and cringing in their seats during the torture scenes. I definitely recommend seeing it.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of *****"
"calmlikeabomb588","4","0","0","9 January 2006"," Better than ""Cabin Fever"", which isn't saying much.....
","When I heard about ""Hostel"" I was really intrigued. It looked like a really good premise for a thriller. My curiosity was titillated even more with the ""Quentin Tarantino Presents"" tagged above the title. After I saw it, I can not describe how disappointed I was.<br/><br/>First of all, Eli Roth seems to be a pretty good director. The way he handles certain scenes of this film were great. I will also say that he can come up with some good ideas for movies (yes, even ""Cabin Fever"" seemed like a good idea). Hostel's weakness is the way it was written. It seemed to follow the exact same formula as ""Cabin Fever"", only to a bit more of an extreme (i.e. more sex, more gore). The whole first act of the movie is basically porn. That's it. Roth as a writer obviously feels that making flat and some times unnecessary characters is a good idea. Even the story was non-existent. It's just as the summary says it is.<br/><br/>But I will say, I gave this movie some points for the third act. The payoff towards the end of the film worked excellently. It worked so well, that people in the audience were cheering and clapping for the character. That, is what made it better than the droll ""Cabin Fever"".<br/><br/>Better than ""Cabin Fever"" but still not able to be called a legitimately good movie, I give it a 4 out of 10."

","This was definitely a horror/thriller flick but superficial critics may not get the societal undertones. There is a lot of nudity and gore that will appeal to younger audiences but this is just the coating. Peel that back and you get a small peek at what people with money and political power do with that money and power. This is specifically shown when one of the victims has a conversation with one of the torturers. Now, in reality the rich may not actually pay to dismember unfortunate victims but the torture definitely mimic ks the deity like power that people with money often think they have over others. In other words, ""I have money and power...you do not...therefore you are less than human and I can do whatever I like to you whether it be cut off your toes or take your property to build a mall."" I assure you, that kind of power may not be ""real"", but money makes many perverse people think that it is and they will take advantage of unwitting, less than rich people than themselves. Don't let it be you."

","I don't think some people realized this a dark dark comedy in a lot of ways. I saw Hostel tonight and really enjoyed it. I love seeing people getting up and exiting the movie theatre after systematically throwing down 8.75 to see it. Eli Roth is a very interesting director let me tell ya. Cabin Fever was hated by a lot of people, because of the humor put in place of scenes that should have been exciting and terrifying. While this turns a lot of people off to his style, it gravitates me towards it, and that's what he did with Hostel. The humor is a little more straight forward, and is brilliantly done. If you can't notice the sheer comedy of this flick, then don't bother to review it because you are to stupid for me to care how you criticize it. Roth intently mixes dark humor and vicious, spine tingling torture in a nice hostel soup. Though not really a horror movie like advertised, it is a on the edge thriller without a doubt. Also, make no mistake that this movie is incredibly brutal and shocking. My advice is bring little Billy to this movie and let him get used to this kind of Hollywood because by the time hes 18, he wont even cringe at this sort of thing....just like I didn't. I loved the torture and it kept me glued to the screen to the last horrifying scene. This movie is one guilty pleasure any gore lover shouldn't miss. If you are a fan of dark comedies you might wanna check this one out to if you aren't squeamish. 7/10 baby"

","...and told my wife that ""Hostel"" will likely be the last horror flick I watch for a while. I want to wash off.<br/><br/>Good points; It is a well made film and is especially successful at putting the viewer in the victim's place. Not that pushing the envelope is always a good thing, but if you think seeing on film what might be in your darkest fantasies, then it's a good thing. It took balls to go where this flick goes.<br/><br/>Bad points; I don't know about the uncut version, but cutting 20 or 30 minutes out of the first half of the film would make it better (unless you need a lot of T&A to warm you up to the gore). It felt like 2 movies - the first half (T&A)and the second half (what you see on the previews). Maybe it was an expectation thing for me, but the way it was hyped, I figured to see the camera stay on some scenes just a little too long - which would have fit the premise of ""Hostel"" better, but maybe it was designed that way and it wound up on the editing room floor. It would be interesting to see the uncut version.<br/><br/>I gave it a 6 mostly because it took to long to get to the ""payoff"", but if that's the ""Audition Tradition"", then what do I know?"
"nfmadprops04","4","0","0","8 January 2006"," Gory? Yes. Sick? Yes. Scary? Eh....
","In the grand tradition of horror films, everyone knows that it's what you don't see that is scariest. In that sentiment, Eli Roth failed... miserably. Watching someone get their foot cut apart is NOT scary, it is just gross. It's the knowledge that your foot MAY be cut off that is truly terrifying. Some of the film's scariest scenes come from the anticipating of pain. I wasn't ever truly scared. At times, yes, I was upset and nauseated and even found myself rolling my eyes, when a certain female character gets a certain appendage amputated by our lead. The introduction of Jay Hernandez to his torturer is one of the only truly horrifying scenes in that, for the first five minutes, nothing happens, but we are on the edge of our seats waiting! Blood, screaming, torture, death, and an overabundance of female nudity? This film is nothing short of a snuff film with a big budget, with only about 10-15 minutes of ""good movie"" - 6 of which are the credits."
"truehorrorfan","5","0","0","8 January 2006"," ehhhhhh....
","To begin with, I just saw the cut version of the movie, so perhaps the uncut version was much better.<br/><br/>I am most disappointed with the first 30-45 minutes of the film. This is where Eli lost his way from cabin fever. The time was wasted mostly on T and A and partying scenes. In most effective movies of this genre, and I feel three things were missing in this movie in the beginning.<br/><br/>First, is something to jump start the movie, such as the gunfight in the devils rejects, or the opening murder in Halloween.<br/><br/>The second is character compassion. What I mean by this, is the characters are well developed and a personal or intimate moment is revealed to the viewer. This in turn draws the viewer in more to the character's pain when something unfortunate happens to them. Kind of like in the first saw, I could care less thanks to the Princess Bride idiot, despite whatever was happening to him. So despite these guys getting tortured, it was not that effective.<br/><br/>Finally, are certain hints or elements that bind the movie together as they go along, other than the kids who kill for candy. Given, the only one I picked up on was this, which began half way through the movie. Question for you all.... Would have the one surviving character still have gone back to save the Asian girl, if he had not witnessed a girl drowning in his youth? The movie needed more of those character traits. But the whole guy on the train thing, I figured him to be a torturer right off the bat.. They were showing way too much of him to not be involved.<br/><br/>The non-lethal euthanasia involving the girl's eye was a nice touch.<br/><br/>As far as the second half is concerned, it wasn't that bad. It had the whole Last House on the Left feel, where an unlikely killer returns the favor for all those involved in his friends deaths and his tortures as he comes by them.<br/><br/>All and all, I gave it right down the middle: because the beginning was almost useless, and the end was good.<br/><br/>My advise for those who are into this genre: Stick with more Indy films, like Eli's first one."
"j_am_86","5","0","0","8 January 2006"," Disappointing
","I think it's my fault for coming into the movie with high expectations. Really the only thing I actually liked about this movie is the acting, the actors truly did an amazing job (I think these people should have been in ""Saw"" instead). Unfortunately, the acting doesn't really matter if the story line is lacking (which this movie is definitely missing). The whole first half of the movie is about three college students who go around the world to do activities you wouldn't get away with in the United States legally (very clichÃ©d). They are then told about a hostel where the most beautiful women in the world are, where not too many foreigners visit. They get what they want (women), then consequently everything goes down the toilet. It turns out the foreigners are in for a rude awakening, when they get tortured by wannabe surgeons. The torture scene's themselves are not as gory as I expected, in fact the director doesn't really show us anything. The scenes rely heavily on screaming, sound effects and a good imagination of what the hell is going on. In fact the goriest parts happen outside of the walls of where they are tortured. ""Hostel"" disappoints in the aspects this movie is being marketed for, the gruesome scenes, the story, and the scare factor (in which it's not scary at all). If you don't mind a lackluster story line and go into the movie with low expectations you will find yourself enjoying ""Hostel""."

","{spoilers ahead} for all the hype my friends and the commercials put on this film, i left the theater feeling somewhat unfufilled. let it be known that Hostel is pretty damn graphic, but some of the things were so disgusting that i found myself laughing at its extremities instead of being scared. i mean there's {SPOILER!} people getting ran over, limbs getting cut off, pussing eyes, and lots of vomiting in between. i hope i don't sound weird for laughing during all this, but seriously the whole theater (which was full as hell) was laughing along with me. another thing that hurt the film is that the first 30-40 minutes is like a giant sex-fest, with very little scares...hell basically no scares at all. all in all hostel strives on gore, and i found that it does little to actually scare its audience. try the original Texas chainsaw massacre, and maybe even saw, but all in all i think Hostel will only provide an hour and thirty some-odd minutes of ""ooh""-ing and ""ouch""-ing."

","2/3 of this movie was more about nudity, beautiful naked women, and sex more than a horror flick. The rest was a terrible movie. The audience laughed and clapped more than they gasped or groaned, and the most exciting part was when two people in the theater started yelling obscenities at each other and almost got into a fight. During the first screenings, there are only 2 explanations as to why ambulances came. A) The movie company paid them to show up to create a buzz, or B) Someone choked on a Jujyfruit. While the movie isn't that good, the aftertaste it leaves is at least like a horror flick, leaving you a bit paranoid about those around you and a bit scared. Aftertaste, good. Taste, disgusting."

This is not say that I don't appreciate leaving some things to the imagination - the ear cutting ""scene"" in Reservoir Dogs was genius. However, if you advertise a movie as being gory then by all means - let it be gory. This was a good movie, I'd give it a 7 out of 10.

This is also not to say that I want gore just for gore sake.

","Decent enough story, but handled with great immaturity and stupidity. Granted Eli Roth wrote it and secured financing for it, so in fairness he should be able to make any movie he desired. However, someone should of stepped in and suggested filling in the many plot holes and logic lapses so that it actually felt like a real movie and didn't seem quite so convenient all the way through. Also, they could of removed a couple of the unnecessary tit shots and sauna scenes so it didn't so closely resemble a porkys or carry on film and felt more like a horror film. Don't get me wrong as a 26 year old guy I liked the first few, but after the tenth he did come off as a horny 14 year old with licence to see breasts, is he actually still a virgin? Geeze...<br/><br/>To sum it up, nice idea- badly handled by a immature filmmaker lacking talent. Which I could of expected coming from the writer/director of 'Cabin Fever', had it not been for the endorsement by Quentin Tarantino, which suggested a film of much better quality.

","It's important to start off by saying that I am not, in any way, a fan of gore or torture porn. I fins these Horror sub-genres to be in very poor taste at best. I recognize zero cinematic or otherwise artistic value in blowing your arts and visual effects budget on blood, puss and other bodily fluids, or severed organs (particularly when I ""get to"" watch them actually being severed). I don't enjoy it and I try to avoid films flaunting the use of these features the way Hostel did. Still, after all the buzz, I simply had to check it out.<br/><br/>I'm writing this review after watching it for the second, and it seems I have forgotten pretty much everything but the main plot revolving around torture. Indeed, there are plenty of scenes I would have rather not watch, but let's give credit when it's due - Hostel is far from tasteless. The gory scenes are not just out there for no reason, but in order to present a realistic and believable human phenomenon as both the main fear factor and a pinch of social criticism. What keeps you afraid is not the use of cheap jump scares (blissfully absent in this film) nor the disgusting gore, it's how you relate to the characters and experience the fear of what's about to happen to them through their eyes and experiences. The build up towards the torture, as people are tied up and realize that every single type of pain is about to be inflicted and there's nothing they can do about it, received more screen time than the torture itself. The helplessness and terror are delivered professionally and amazingly.<br/><br/>On this note, the film is absolutely taken to the next level by Eli Roth's direction of the characters and the cast's ability to play the role in the most professional and impressive way possible. Jay Hernandez (Paxton) and Derek Richardson (Josh) played the terror of anticipating their impending torture in a manner that was terrifying and authentic, stressing what a raw deal they received in their casting in Suicide Squad and Dumb and Dumber respectively. Barbara Nedeljakova (Natalya) and Jana Kaderabkova (Svetlana) are so much more than eye candy (though admittedly not painful to look at to say the least) as the hostel's occupants, delivering their role in the most realistic manner imaginable. And to top it all - Rick Hoffman (American Client) and Petr Janis (German Surgeon) are as discomforting, terrifying and revolting as you'd expect, meeting every possible standard.<br/><br/>Originally, I rated Hostel a 5, due to being younger, less experienced and honestly less fair. It's improper to criticize a gore torture flick for showing gore and torture, I know that now. My new more appropriate rate is 7, meant to reflect the overall level of the film while accounting for what I found to be a wanting plot and an unfortunate lack of a final twist. Also, some of the scenes were simply too much and frankly unnecessary. If you're a fan of gore and torture porn - you're in for a real treat. If you're not - think hard before you decide to watch this, as it will take you places you might not have wanted to visit or experience."

When people had to come up with other ways to scare you, than just ""shocking"" gore.<br/><br/>Okay, let's pick this atrocious film apart: <br/><br/>Characters - lame American tourists, very hard to care whether they live or die.<br/><br/>Dialogue - opening line is ""Amsterdam m*th*rf*ck*r!"" enough said, but I'll go on - It never gets any better than that little gem. <br/><br/>Plot - Stretches believability beyond breaking point, even for a dodgy horror movie. Things we are expected to swallow whole include, but are definitely not limited to: <br/><br/>1. That there is a hostel in darkest eastern europe populated ONLY by gorgeous women in their 20's. Uh huh.<br/><br/>2. That a girl can be heard screaming from outside a building, even when she is locked in a dungeon-like labyrinth of tunnels, UNDERGROUND.<br/><br/>3. That the exact 3 people you need to get revenge on will suddenly turn up in darkest eastern europe (though they live in Amsterdam) and furthermore, that they will all stand in a straight line and remain still enough for you to run them down with your car.<br/><br/>4. That our ""hero"" can find and execute EACH and EVERY person who wronged him, practically in the same order they appeared in the movie.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but frankly, this movie is not worth the time. If I can convince just one person to NOT see this movie, EVER, I have done my job."

","I don't care what anybody says, Hostel is an amazing film. It was the first horror/slasher flick to actually scare the bejesus out of me. Of course, I was intoxicated the first time I saw it but I saw it sober the next day and couldn't believe what I was watching. I wasn't a big fan of Cabin Fever but Eli Roth gained my respect with this movie.<br/><br/>Of course, the fact that Tarentino had something to do with this movie adds to it's magic. I'm only 19 years old, but every movie of his that I have seen I instantly fell in love with. I'm also a huge horror film freak so that helps.<br/><br/>And don't worry, just because this movie depicts Bratislava as pretty much hell on earth, it isn't. It is a very beautiful city and Slovakia has a lot of things to offer to tourists. Just stay away from stoned Russian dudes named Alex while vacationing in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>My grade for this movie: A++ definitely a must see."

","So. The review quoted on the DVD case of Hostel calls it ""The goriest, sickest, bloodiest movie you'll ever, ever see"". There are quite clearly a LOT of horror/gore/exploitation movies that this reviewer needs to catch up on. And now, having wasted 90 minutes of my life watching this crap, my only positive feeling is that the film was rented rather than purchased.<br/><br/>Hostel is a good idea put into completely the wrong hands - sorry, Eli Roth, but I'll not bother with this year's sequel. Or the next few films you direct, whatever their content. This movie is poorly conceived, has no credibility at all in its effects, and is repugnantly racist in its portrayal of Eastern Europeans (the only element of the film that disturbed me in any way whatsoever).<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just too jaded and desensitised - possibly something to do with watching the Guinea Pig series far too many times - but Hostel was about as horrific as Bambi and about as engrossing as housework. Avoid at all costs."
"EvilSimen","10","2","5","29 March 2007"," Eli Roth is a horror genius!
","Eli Roth is essentially the Quentin Tarrantino of Horror. There. I said it. The man takes influences from all over and fuses them together into his own, creative projects and Hostel is no different. You got the Torture from The Audition and Reservoir Dogs, you got the basic premise of American Werewolf in Paris (two American tourists in a foreign country find themselves in a bloody situation) and of course Eli Roth's own creative spins (those little kids rocked!).<br/><br/>But the cherry to this very tasty Cake has to be the inner social commentary Roth laid under the subtext. He tackles the subject of ""getting a high."" Essentially, basically Hostel asks what happens when you can no longer find a high to reach. What happens when drugs, sex, extreme sports and just about any other method to achieve that state no longer brings you there? What will you turn too? What will some people be willing to do in order to feel that high again, or at least a new form of it? And it's true, our society is a violent on in nature, so it's not that hard to believe that someone in that state of mind would be willing to PAY to kill someone else.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's all I have to say for this film. It was a brilliant film, one of the best horror films of the last decade. Eli Roth and the splat pack are bringing the balls and feeling back into Horror. Long live Eli Roth, Alexandre Aja, Rob Zombie, Neil Marshell and James Wan! The new horror gods!"

The diminutive plot has been done to death already in much better films.<br/><br/>Even though the genre does not call for spectacular writing or even a deeper meaning, the better horror/gore-movies at least has an interesting idea, an unsuspected twist or a psychological depth to character development.

","As far as new age horror movies go this really is a good one. Horror movies are a totally different beast then regular movies. You must expect poor lines, gratuitous nudity, and crazy death scenes. This movie has that. The fact also that the killers are nothing but everyday people makes it ever scarier. The movie effects are pretty good and the make is awesome. Compare the makeup in this to most modern horror films and this one is almost as realistic looking as some Italian horror films. If you are looking for some movie with a deep meaning you are looking in the wrong area. If you want a good horror movie in a day and age where there are none this is pretty good. Anyone who thought this was a bad movie, must not like horror in general and there fore should not be taken seriously."

What else? Oh yeah, when the guys came to the 'Slovak' countryside it was a Czech village and the person who was telling the passengers where they are in the speakers when they got off was using Czech language. The whole film was made in Czech republic and it's said in Slovakia, what doesn't mean Czech looks like that. The only Slovak were those two girls using a few sentences in Slovak and the big blokes getting out of the car in front of the bubble gum gang. I heard them to use a bit of Russian as well, so it's really confusing and really bad. Yeah and the songs used on the discos were not pop songs but Slovak rock, rock at disco?

"john-souray","1","2","5","16 August 2006"," Pointlessly nasty
","I love horror films, and though obviously I'm going to put films like the Devil's Backbone and the (original) Haunting at the top of my list, films with some character and meaningful plotting and subtlety, I'm not above enjoying a bit of mindless gore either, what Stephen King called ""the gross-out"".<br/><br/>But this film left me feeling dirty. It's just plain nasty. Two thirds the way through, there's a scene  SPOILER COMING UP  where the hero rescues a woman who's being tortured with a blowtorch. Her eye is hanging down her cheek, and our hero has to snip it off with a pair of scissors. I put the DVD on pause and went to make a cup of coffee to recover. ""No"", I thought, ""that's not clever. That's just taking the p***."" <br/><br/>The strangest thing about all this is the involvement of (as producer) Quentin Tarantino and (as actor and mentor) Takashi Miike. Those two between them have directed two of the most memorably nasty scenes in cinema history  the torture scenes in Reservoir Dogs and Audition respectively. It's worth pausing a moment to consider why those scenes are great, because they are everything this film is not. In Reservoir Dogs, the worst thing never actually happens. Slicing off an ear is bad enough, but it's not the most terrible thing, and all it does is establish that the psychopathic torturer is capable of anything. Everything after that is all in the audience's imagination; it's all in the thinking of what might happen. The torture in Audition is even more explicit, of course, shockingly so, and first bad things happen, then even worse ones. But it's timed perfectly, and it has a real moral purpose. The hero has done wrong, there's no doubt about it, but surely, we ask ourselves, not so as to deserve this.<br/><br/>No such intelligence or artistry or simple technical skill informs anything in this film. Not at all. There's nothing in the script or characterisation to make us care about these people in any way, and though the Director makes a sort of half-hearted attempt to build up some tension and creepiness, he just abandons the effort after about half an hour as though saying ""Right, that's enough nonsense for an intro, now let's get on with the torture"".<br/><br/>So incompetently is this done that we're presented with our first glimpses of the torture chamber from the point of view of the victim looking through a hole in the hood over their face. Any possibility that we might feel some empathetic fear here is rather spoiled by the fact that we don't actually know whose eyes we're looking through. We can make a good guess, and it turns out that probably our first guess is the right one, though it could have been one of several people. But this isn't clever or skillful: it's just lazy and incompetent.<br/><br/>The worst of it all though is that these aren't bumbling but enthusiastic amateurs. They're smart, experienced filmmakers. If they were amateurs, you might award them some credit for breaking out of the usual dismal ""re-making my favourite scenes from the Evil Dead/Blair Witch"" mode. But these people are clever, and don't they just know it.<br/><br/>This is what is finally hard to take, the sense of being patronised by these fools, who hold our intelligence in such disrespect that they think all they have to do is gross us out and we'll be amazed.<br/><br/>Here's an odd little trivial detail which I don't think anyone's noticed. Having arrived at the hostel and having fallen prey to the siren seductresses who lurk there, our two heroes enjoy a sexual encounter with them (not so much soft-core as parental guidance). This is accompanied by some exotic music, the first few bars (I was going to say snatch, but that somehow didn't seem appropriate) of which are a quote, too accurate not to be deliberate, from Britt Eklund's dance in the Wicker Man.<br/><br/>Yeah, clever. But not clever enough. Don't patronise me. First, make a decent film. Then you can set about dazzling me with your witty allusive references and homages.<br/><br/>Oh, and I'm not surprised there are protests here from Slovakians. I've never been there, though it's one of many places in Eastern Europe and the Balkans I'd love to see (one of the better musical choices in the soundtrack was a little hint of Smetana as we look over the river running through the city), but even without knowing the country, I can tell this is just a crass insult, almost racist in its generalised offensiveness and sublimely adolescent dismissal of the morals, intelligence, and integrity of an entire nation.<br/><br/>I'm being harsh. I think Eli Roth could make a good film. But first, he has to face up to what a bad one he's made here."

A couple young adults are doing a euro-trip when they get lured to Slovakia. The world they arrive in seems a bit strange at first, but all is brushed aside until.... It is very graphic and at times disgusting, but the scariest part is that they get put in such a helpless situation without any hope of escape..awaiting a most horrifying death.

Comparing this movie to, say Saw (I and II) or Wolf Creek or Venom, I'd say this is the bloodies and most original gore movie I've seen to date. Highly recommended for people who loves seeing a lot of blood in a realistic way (some gore movies are just not realistic, unlike this one). I especially like the scene where the Dutch Surgeon severed Josh's Achilles Heel... wow! For those who felt offended by this movie (e.g. people of Slovakia and Bratislava), don't be. I mean, if you know better about your country you shouldn't be offended at all. If this movie was set in the Philippines, I would be exhilarated. I mean hey at least people get to know that my country existed. Going back to the movie, I highly recommend you see it. The first time I saw it I felt I had to see it again and again.

The setup is very clever and so is the end. The problem with this film is that it lingers so lovingly on all the human-on-human violence that it loses its plot and its atmosphere.<br/><br/>This is not just a female reaction--my male partner was so horrified, bored and disgusted that he was angry with me for insisting on fast-forwarding to the end.<br/><br/>Not my definition of a ""horror"" movie and definitely not escapism. More like living a cat box horror movie and being forced to watch really gross stuff.

I think if you take a step back no matter if you loved the film or hated it you must admit it got your attention, and that's what it's all about. I don't think Eli Roth went into this film wanting everyone to love it. He wanted it to disturb you, and make you sick, and maybe even hate it. I think he did a fabulous job of that, and that's why I appreciate this film so much. It taps into that place in your mind that makes you uncomfortable. Some people enjoy feeling that, and others cannot handle it. So I say give the film credit because it is in no way a mediocre film no matter which way you look at it."

I can see how it can be difficult to keep such offensive materials from clouding your judgment, but if you succeed, you'll see and appreciate this movie for what it really is: The struggle of a man to overcome all odds. This basic theme is present in plenty of modern movies (Galdiator, Patriot, etc.), most of which receive much praise. One might argue, 'Ok, so the movie had a great basic idea, but why portray this idea through such graphic means?' Well, I think it added an extra element to the film. Not only is this movie the bold tale about the struggle of a man, but now it is an eye opener to the harsh realities of the world around us. There are places in the world the events of the film are as real as night or day. Having seen this movie, I am more aware of the world I live in, no just life within my small world.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line: If you are not easily offended or weak stomached, I highly recommend you watch this movie with an open mind.

"Mr_Jackhammer","10","2","5","21 April 2006"," Shocking, terrifying, and deeply disturbing.
","I am not a fan of gore movies and usually they are simply a dumb excuse to use gore instead of plot to shock people. While the plot of this movie is not extremely intricate, the realization pushed by the movie is something I haven't considered very thoroughly before. The terrifying thing about the movie isn't the torture itself, but the people inflicting it. The torture sequences are appalling enough, but the true horror comes when you discover that the people performing the horribly savage acts aren't insane psychopaths, but those who are rich and obviously of highly esteemed positions in society. That is the true horror of this movie, it makes you realize something that isn't thought about much. Every day the filthy rich satisfy their every whim and fleshly desire... New cars, drugs, sex, wasteful frivolity... but what about those people who have hidden desires for power, control, blood, the evil delight of inflicting hideous suffering on others? What do they do to get their foul needs satisfied? I believe that this is the true horror of this film... and what really disturbs me the most about it is that I am more than ready to believe such things happen regularly. There are a LOT of missing persons cases around the world every year, in America alone, approximately 2,300 new missing persons are reported EVERY DAY. That doesn't even include the ones that are not reported. Children and adults disappear, never to be seen or heard from again. Does anyone really stop to think of the things that are more than likely happening??? I know this movie has messed me up for a long time to come. I don't think I'll ever be able to shake the ideas... and I don't know if they should be shaken, because I strongly feel that this may be more reality than fiction, and I think people would be wise to keep things like this in mind during day to day life."

","When I initially saw previews for Hostle, I was totally turned off. It looked too much like Saw, and it was produced by Quentin Tarantino, which to me usually says that the movie isn't good enough to stand on its own, so advertisers use a good name to draw crowds into theaters. <br/><br/>However, I later realized that it was written and directed by Eli Roth, and I absolutely loved Cabin Fever, so this revived my hopes. Hostel proved to be everything that I expect in a good horror. It had humor and gore (the gore was very well done. The movie didn't rely on lame CGI effects. All special effects were old school i.e. make-up, prosthetics etc), and it left you feeling good. What I mean by ""feeling good"" is that it wasn't weighed down by the whole ""psychological thriller"" thing. It was a feel good horror/gore film, sort of like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste or Dead Alive, but with a bigger budget.<br/><br/>What I love the most about Eli Roth's films is the way he quotes great classic horror, whether it be with a character, or with a particular kill, or the way something is filmed, something always rings true and familiar, and at the same time he ironically makes fun of new Hollywood blockbusters by always having a lame character from like Euro Trip or something terrible. <br/><br/>Anyway, a lot of people may find this combination of old school horror and sell-out Hollywood to be lame or whatever, but I think it is brilliant and totally intentional, and I am anticipating many more great films from Eli Roth."

However, suddenly you could see a scene where one of the main characters ends up in a torture chamber. Reason? Who knows? I don't for sure... My overall opinion is: This movie sucks. It lacks any kind of conception, a true story, violence without even a little reason (a kind of art, or what they did say in the movie). I'm really sorry that the Czechs gave their actors, their resources, and even one of their villages to the film. The whole movie represents them as a wholeheartedly corrupt and deceived nation which allows anything to happen in their country and which has murderous children wandering on the streets, who kill even in exchange for a bag of chewing gums.

My companion suggested this movie as she thought she had heard about it. Afterwards, she admitted it was not what she thought it was. I am not normally a fan of horror movies (mostly turned off by the likes of Freddy Kruger et al); had I known we likely would have picked something else. That being said, I must rate this in a category of believable horror with movies like Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>Definitely NOT recommended for the squeamish.<br/><br/>The actors are largely unknowns but deliver good performances that are in line with the characters they portray. The setting and premise, which some might find incredible as compared to safe and civilized western society, was all too credible to my companion (who is from eastern Europe) and I.<br/><br/>******** Spoiler ************ <br/><br/>The central characters (2 American males and one Icelander), searching for hormone induced entertainment at its most basic human (read male) level, find themselves in an eastern European backwater city in a ""hostel"" where their disappointment at having to share a room turns to joy as they discover their roommates are beautiful young women. But as first one then another disappear without reason, the remaining one searches for his friend and answers to the mystery and is horrified to find both in a human slaughterhouse where 'clients' pay for the privilege of killing people.<br/><br/>Characters introduced early in the film re-appear when you least expect them, which is somewhat reminiscent of the typical Hollywood happy ending as they get no less than they deserve but this device is not overdone and serves to advance the story. At the end of the story, there is little in the way of happy endings for most of the characters.<br/><br/>At the end, the remaining survivor descends to deliver a little horror of his own to one who deserves no less.<br/><br/>******** End Spoiler ******** <br/><br/>Highly recommended if you like horror!"

I cannot recall one moment during this movie where I was thinking to myself, ""There's no way that could happen."" (as with so many films of this genre). It was 100% believable from beginning to end.

","first off this film really shows just how low our society has gone. really the fact that we see torture, and blood, as entertainment, it really makes me think of the Romans, and i'd like to think that we have grown past them. you know i have watched many of horror movies, and thrillers, and i have to say that this film is by far the worst thing that i have ever seen. the Texas chainsaw film, was tolerable only because it was based, however loosely, to actual events, yet Hostel was just an excuse to show boundary pushing blood shed. How long till we go back, and resort to real killing? an other thing, Tarantino, if you ever read this,, you are no better than the main killer. you put this film on the market, you ever thought to create it. and you know what the worst part is, that i know, and you know that out there someone loved seeing this blood fest, and i know that someone is making one worse!!!! how in the world could ever see this as a good thing? how can anyone ever make it and not be over come with gilt? its far beyond me. and you know even if it does happen, or the events are based on real events, do they have to become entertainment. the thing that degrades those involved and makes it seem OK to do such events. o and you know that this film is going to cause people to copy it, and this time it wont be fake blood!!!!!!!! well thats what i have to say, take it to heart all who read this, and help me do something about these perversions. thanks"
"alchemistmaster","10","2","5","25 January 2006"," What A Way to Start The Year!!!
","Well, all i can say is wow. I waited in anticipation to see this movie for so long, and it did not let me down.<br/><br/>Hostel is without doubt, the coolest, most sickening and believe it or not almost genuinely believable horror flick that perhaps i have seen. This film kicks so much ass, it is actually quite painful.<br/><br/>And all this from a film that is cut so heavily its almost criminal to watch it in this very shadow like state.<br/><br/>The one thing i cant understand is why people have commented when they say they hate it. How can you hate a movie like this? It has everything a good horror movie should have. It has good acting, it moves at a good pace, there is nice humour, likable characters, sexy ladies and the gore.... oh the gore.<br/><br/>And i couldn't help but notice that someone actually had the nerve to claim that ""white noise"" and ""house of wax"" actually done horror movies a favour. What a joke that is. I mean where do you get the idea that some guy using E.P.T to look for people to kill, or a town where people go to and ""get turn into wax works"" is actually better than this?? Are you insane?? Take it from me, horror movies are not movies. I don't want to go and see a horror movie, and leave saying ""hey that was a good story man"". I want to leave a horror movie with an overwhelming feeling to deposit the popcorn i foolishly ate back out onto the carpet. And Hostel does it like no other movie that is out there...FACT.<br/><br/>If you are someone who appreciates a good horror movie and not thriller crap like the ones above stated, then you are going to love this movie. You WONT be disappointed.<br/><br/>And to everyone else who sees ""Quentin Tarantino"" on the poster. This isn't an ultra cool gangster or revenge flick. Its an all out attack of everything that makes you cringe, and question the very morale fibre of human existence in the 21st Century. Its sick, its nasty and basically its downright in your face. So my advice would be to forget the ""tarantino"" element, and think more Cabin Fever gore multiplied by 10.<br/><br/>The film i have to say is very well made. There are lots of laughs and some nice settings also. Its very well directed, and there does seem to be a major improvement in Roths ability to make a proper movie, and not just an excuse to make you feel sick, much like Cabin Fever was.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact there was no subtitles. As at some parts in the film, it really added a nice touch, as you didn't have an idea what was being said, much like the American characters in the film didn't either. It added to the general confusion of the situation they found themselves in.<br/><br/>This film is Class, Pure Class. And the truth is your not going to see a film in the Horror genre that is so Raw, Original and emotionally challenging as this, until Eli Roth makes another one."

","Yes, Hostel is definitely not one of the better films of the year, but I still felt it was just kick ass. Entertaining to the max, and enough thrills to keep you on the edge of ur seat.<br/><br/>Okay, so there wasn't much of a point to it, other than to shock and disgust us, but, I think Eli Roth did that and more. The Film is in a sense.. believable for the most part, and the killings were so powerful and graphic that you can almost feel this happening.<br/><br/>A strong stomach is required if you are to enjoy this film, but I assure you, it is one cool movie none the less. I was entertained all the way through, I enjoy a good ol' gory horror film once in a while, and this one wasn't too cheesy, it actually had a few surprises for us, and coul often be pretty funny at times.

","excellent as far as finally a true horror movie with a real plot and a great excitement filled edge of the seat ending. But this was one movie that did not just ""gross"" me out it literally HAUNTED me for days and days. It made me think that this might actually be going on in the world somewhere and I had horrific nightmares of my family members suffering like these people did and I could not help them. No movie has ever stayed with me like this one did. So NOT a date movie or for kids under TWENTY FIVE !! You will never travel alone, or even with one friend and you will so definitely NEVER stay in a hostel. Travel to a foreign country you will probably never do after seeing this movie. All Hostels everywhere will be bankrupt by the summer because of this movie!!"

","Why in the world would you recommend this to other people? This has to be the biggest load of stank *** moldy maggot semen i have ever laid my previously unscathed viewing sockets on.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS *** The first 50 minutes of this movie shows the three main characters going around Europe, screwing every woman they see and smoking every plant they touch... Personally, I'm a college student, if i wanted to see pot-porn, i could just go knock on my neighbor's door. I seriously have no idea how i managed to stay awake all this time and not scrape my face off with a popcorn kernel. Seriously that bad.<br/><br/>Then we have what i would like to call the turning point, from just plain pointless pornographic weed-head non-entertainment expo to cringing torturous... whats the word I'm looking for? Whats the exact, extreme opposite of orgasm? Well, lets just pretend i know and i put it there.<br/><br/>The morning after one of the main characters ""finally gets laid"", their buddy (who is the only character that I actually remember his name) Olie disappears. We later find out he was tortured before being decapitated. Fun. Then we get to see his Asian chick get her toe cut off with a pair of bolt cutters. Double the Fun. This is the point where i was seriously considering leaving...really.<br/><br/>So we get back to the story, just the two main guys left, and wouldn't you know it, buddy number 2 disappears. Lame. We get to see him tortured and then killed. Where is the entertainment in this? If you enjoy watching that, you seriously need a psychological evaluation, because you have some sick and twisted tendencies that need to be monitored. This is actually the point where I began walking out the door, but, sadly, could not as i wanted to see what happened to the main character.<br/><br/>As he goes looking for his friends, he also is captured (big surprise), and has began being tortured. He manages to catch a lucky break and only gets a few fingers chopped off... and kills his torturer. At this point, I did not care, and walked.<br/><br/>Eli Roth: learn to write/direct you moron. Quentin Tarentino: Please don't put your name on another piece of garbage like that ever again... please? I'm begging you here man. Actors: I hope you made a LOT of money."
"TTKKane","7","2","5","17 January 2006"," Quite good surprisingly!
","Let me pre-empt this by saying that I was in no hurry to see this movie. I hated Roths previous flick, Cabin Fever - unlikable characters, poor script and not much horror. I decided to watch Hostel really only because there was nothing else I wanted to see at the theater, plus some of the hype probably got to me as well....<br/><br/>That being said, I think the hype (and marketing) they created is somewhat of a downfall to the reviews I have read here. This movie does not do well to the general public. People disgusted, walking out of the theater, too much nudity, too much gore. Well, really what were they expecting? I believe if this had been shown in a smaller number of theaters, with little or no publicity, it would be an underground hit, garnishing more good reviews by the horror fan base.<br/><br/>****************MAJOR SPOILERS****************************************<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought that I'd add my two cents worth. As other reviews have testimented, this really is a movie of two halves. The first being a Eurotrip kinda sex n' drugs road trip, introducing the characters and the foreign soil. The second is a frightening glimpse of sadism and retribution. However really it should be seen as having three parts...the last being a revenge piece.<br/><br/>So, the first part bring the audience 3 happy-go-lucky guys, 2 American and 1 Icelandic traveling in Europe in the search of girls to hump and dump. This section has a few laughs and lots of nudity. One thing is that Roth seems to be looking for a realistic feel to this movie, but all the girls (naked most of the time!) are super hot model types. I guess this is pandering to the target audience (also see Cabin Fever), but doesn't exactly help the realism. <br/><br/>Lets move on to the real meat and bones of the movie.....The guys do not realize that they have fallen into a ""honey trap"" and the girls that they meet in the titular Hostel are selling them into torture and death. A lot has been said of the torture scenes - I personally didn't find them shocking, but they were effective. What is really scary is that I'm sure this does go on in places in the world, and the movie's premise is feasible. Our villains of the piece are frightening as they appear so ordinary. They do not have super powers, return to life after being killed or any of the other horror clichÃ©s. They range from the creep on the train to the local police and the feeling of helplessness of being somewhere where nobody will come to your aid is palpable.<br/><br/>Once the torture is out of the way, it changes to a revenge flick where the protagonist gets back at the people who hurt him and killed his friends. <br/><br/>Let me first tell you some of the issues I had with this flick - <br/><br/>We do not see what happened to the ""King of Swing"" - just that he was dead - a missed opportunity I think. Too long of a build up - the first section could have been trimmed without losing any building of the characters. The pack of kids seemed like an afterthought, and didn't really fit in. Too many coincidences when the lead is getting his revenge - the American guy torturing the Asian girl is the one he met, having the 2 girls and the guy they met in Amsterdam standing in front of his car and finally meeting the guy on the train again.<br/><br/>*************************END OF SPOILERS********************************<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a massive step up for Roth and I may actually be excited to see his next movie. His writing and directing have both improved. This movie is not really that shocking to anyone who has an affinity to horror's, but it does have a lasting effect. It's one of those movies that gets better the more you think of it, after you have seen the movie.<br/><br/>I also want to reply to some of the comments I have read about this swing towards torture scenes in movies and how terrible it is...... there have been torture scenes in many, many movies throughout the years. It's nothing new - for example (off the top of my head) mainstream movies such as Pulp Fiction, Rambo, The Passion of the Christ (which has much more brutal and more detailed scenes), Payback, Casino, Goodfellas, The Marathon Man, Brazil, Robocop, Scarface to name but a few. And none of those are classed as horror movies!!"
"Jordan_James_Summers","10","2","5","16 January 2006"," This movie was gonna be stupid, but turned into something amazing!
","There I am waiting in the theatre by my friends, who I didn't really want to sit next to but am now glad for I got to see their hands hide their faces from the screen. I was watching these great looking horror trailers, and saw one movie preview that looked rather interesting called Pulse. I was getting bored with the waiting, and asked my friend how many dang previews are they gonna play? The movie starts then, all is quiet. I wasn't really expecting a good film, but as it went along I began to think wow, boobs. Boobs everywhere, boobs, boobs, boobs and hey look more boobs. And being the male I am, I rather liked what I saw. But I also thought well Eli, you sure do know how to show naked girls, but do you know how to freak me out. Well after a few laughs from insults the characters were throwing back and forth, we begin to see terror. And yes, the film did get somewhat scary especially if the thought of torture is something that freaks you out. Like ghosts or zombies. There is chainsaw real-time action shots, head pounding, flesh sizzling, drill poking, eye ball snipping love for everyone. So if your a kitty kat, stay home, but if you are gonna decide to take your head of the fluffy pink pillow with heart your crying on and start a new life as being a man, going to see this film might be a good way to start you off."

We were all sick to our stomachs, our day was ruined, and I asked for and received my money back from the box office. Do not go to this movie unless you have a vendetta against all things good. There was no plot, motive, point, moral, or even a remote message to take away from it. If a shred of decency existed in this movie I'd show a fingernail of a thumbs up, but alas, none there was. I would rather experience childbirth, chronic diarrhea, migraines, ulcers, and an album of Simple Plan than ever see this movie again for the rest of my days."
"baumer","10","2","5","11 January 2006"," A throw back to 70's style horror films
","I was born in the 70's. I began watching horror films at about the age of 8. Of course horror films are scary when you are that young, no matter what they are. But then I grew up and began watching those same films over again, and to an extent, they were still scary. Those were the films from the 70's and early 80's. Leatherface will always incite that incessant trepidation in me. How can he not? Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the all time greats and I don't really think another film can duplicate the raw intensity of that film. There were others of course, and anyone who knows me even slightly knows that Last House on the Left is what I consider to be the most disturbing film ever made. Horror films, the good ones that is, can affect you in ways that other films can't. They get inside you. Hostel does that. It is a nightmarish film that takes a grim look at the underbelly of society. There is no other way to put it. This film is scary because of what happens in it but it is even scarier because what happens could be true.<br/><br/>Like any typical horror film, everything is great in the beginning. Josh and Paxton and their Icelandic nomad are in Europe seeking out all the best parties and the best women. They are in heaven at first as the women and drugs and parties are as abundant as they first heard. And then they meet another man their age who tells about a city in Slovakia where the women are better than you could imagine. Our three adventure seekers are off the Slovakia and upon entering the hostel, they meet two half naked women in their shared quarters. Clubs, drinking, drugs and sex ensues. This is paradise. What could be better? Up until now the pacing of the film is fast and furious. There is enough character development and eye candy to please those waiting for the horror. And the horror is never far off. The interesting thing about a film like this is that even though the naked women and the bongs and the festive atmosphere is abundant to the viewer, there is always that pernicious overtone, that feeling that something isn't quite right. You can attribute that to knowing what's coming up or to the fact that the marketing for this film, including the trailer is very effective. For me, I knew this happy atmosphere that the boys were a part of was going to end, and that scared me. One friend goes missing and then the plot gets twisted. He doesn't leave them a message as to where he's going, who he's with or an explanation as to why he left. The two boys are leery of this but decide to stay in the hostel one more night to have a bit more fun. Big mistake.<br/><br/>By now the film had me intrigued. And when the torture scenes finally happen, although the gore wasn't as graphic as I expected, the situations that are presented and how everything transpires is enough to scare the hell out of you. What is bothersome is that these situations, while ostensibly fictional, are in fact completely realistic and utterly possible. Just like Last House on the Left had three would be regular people doing heinous things to two innocent teenage girls, this film is almost more macabre in the sense that it explores an element to the human psyche that enjoys the kill. It seeks the thrill of inflicting pain. The scariest thing about this is the notion there are people that are so sick, so depraved and so inhumane that they actually have to pay to inflict bodily harm to others. Far fetched? Hardly. Look at the news from any given city in the world and you'll see the heinous and disgusting things that people do to one another. This film is disturbing because it is a reflection of society, no an aberration. I'm not saying that the majority of people want to be able to pay to murder someone, but what I am saying is the realm of possibility is there. That in itself is about as scary as you can get.<br/><br/>Eli Roth is imaginative. He is a visionary and he is adept at exploring the darker side of humanity. Cabin Fever was a great horror film, a little off the wall, but quite disturbing. Hostel is a work of art, it is as close to the 70's style of guts on the wall horror as you can get in today's horror climate. I was terrified watching the film and at the end by the end of the film, when you are screaming for revenge, Roth even gives you what you want. Hostel is a brilliant film. As much as I love movies like Scream and Sixth Sense, the true gusto of horror has also been omnipotent in recent months with films like Saw 2, Wolf Creek and High Tension. Hostel is better than the rest. It builds the tension and then boils to the point where the horror is almost too real. This is a very effective horror film and I look forward to the sequel.<br/><br/>10/10 A truly terrifying masterpiece."

","i don't even know where to begin. HOSTEL is, in short, a great idea that is revealed slowly with a lot of nudity and humor along the way. Eli Roth knows how to film breasts just as well as he does gore and horror. but is this a horror movie? it reminded me of THE WICKER MAN in that the first half and the second half were so radically different and instead of being scared i was more physiologically invested in the characters and scenarios than anything else. the 3 males are all likable and your standard frat guys which is important to make this a universal 'this could be you' situation. for all the 'this should be nc-17' talk i was hearing, it really wasn't that bad - and the torture scenes weren't as gratuitous as i had been led to believe. the 95 minutes felt much more full and structured than recent outings like SAW II and i, like most the audience, clapped when it came time for the movie to end on a note of revenge - THE American WAY! i came to get shocked and i left shocked at how good the film actually was. very respectable to its genre while paving new way for the future."
"puddinstreet","10","2","5","7 January 2006"," Success!
","Tarantino's name holds a lot of power. This is because he is an incredible filmmaker whose taste in movies is clearly shown through his works. Based on this, people can easily tell if they enjoy the same types of things as he does; mainly violent sadistic ones. He obviously loves classic horror. With this in mind, putting his stamp of approval on Hostel by co-creating the concept and using his own money on distribution, is making a bold claim. When he paid for Hero to be released in the states, he became a force to be reckoned with. No one will argue Tarantino's taste. Hostel is a horror movie. I mean this in the most straightforward way. After an admittedly intentionally bland and typical opening half hour, the film is horrific and hyper-realistic. You are terrified and exhilarated, realizing that the movie is not just commenting on torture, but about us -- the audience who pays to watch this torture on the screen and get so much enjoyment out of it, even if it is purely from the endorphins and adrenaline. However, it does not condescend. No cheap one liners, no Uwe Boll action sequences. Torture, death, and a boatload of fear. Thank you Eli Roth for reminding us why we go to horror movies. I enjoyed Cabin Fever, but now I respect you as one of the great horror directors of this time."
"tahirjon6","Null","2","5","5 January 2006"," Brutal and frightening... but not for long.
","Eli Roth can be commended for attempting to do something other filmmakers have left only half done. He has attempted to put on film the actual, relentless and somewhat realistic image of torture and pain. The film achieves a cold level of intensity. It makes its audience feel isolated, and successfully prevents anyone from looking at the film with any humor. Its true and dry terror. But it does not last for long.<br/><br/>Only so many bodies can pile up, only so many human beings can be subjected to sadistic torture before the audience gets tired. Thats right: tired. After the first 40 minutes or so, you will desire to leave the theater; not because you can't handle it anymore, but because you've already handled too much.<br/><br/>Roth tried something. He tried a film without humor or cutaways. It didn't work. Hitchcock's old rule remains the same, I'm afraid, when it comes to horror. It's not what you see, its what you don't see. Roth would do well to remember it."

","Hostel (Toronto Film Festival Cut) Mr. Black's Grade: B+ Starring Jay Hernandez.<br/><br/>Hostel is a work in progress, and some effects weren't finished, and there was a temp soundtrack in use. This Midnight Madness screening was in a small theatre because the studio was only able to supply an HDcam version of the film. Well acted, spooky, funny and a very non-traditional Hollywood horror film. What more could fans want? Let's just hope they get as much as possible into the theatre.<br/><br/>In a year with - for the most - pretty crappy horror films, Hostel certainly does stand out. This is not your traditional Hollywood horror film, for there is a very different flow than your standard PG-13 rated thriller. Director Eli Roth admitted owing a debt of gratitude to filmmakers like Takashi Miike and Chan-wook Park. That's OK - Roth throws a very uncommon spin on things. This film is very effective.<br/><br/>Be forewarned, this film is very, very violent. What we saw on this day was likely the director's ""Dream Cut"". Roth said the film was going before the MPAA the very next day. He was not sure what would happen, but stressed that the film's producers knew what they had, and would likely try and buck the current trend of PG-13 rated horror films."
"jacksprat4555","10","4","14","17 September 2005"," If he keeps this up, Roth has potential to be an up and coming horror master
","So, apparently filmmaker Eli Roth had premiered his debut film Cabin Fever in 2002 at the Toronto Film Festival. Three years later, even when his sophomore film still had technical tweakings to be worked out, he felt obligated to the Toronto film fest audiences to come on back. And come back he did. His new film, entitled ""Hostel"" is just as gruesome if not creepier than his latter. It concerns a couple American tourists, Josh (Derek Richardson, who until now has been written off for his mistake in acting in the Dumb and Dumber prequel) and Paxton (Jay Hernandez), who have been backpacking in Europe with fellow Icelandic backpacker Oli for the last few weeks. When they arrive in Amsterdam, they are told by a kid named Alex that there is a town in Slovakia where the women out-populate the men 5:1 due to the civil unrest of past war, and that every woman there loves tourists, ESPECIALLY Americans. The three find all of this to be true when they travel to the small town and meet their sexy limber roomies, who somewhat resemble skyy vodka models. When Oli disappears after the first night they spend in their new hostel, the boys eventually shrug it off and continue partying, but it slowly becomes apparent that there is something very wrong going on. Very, very wrong, like a 15 on a 1-10 scale of wrongness. BOTTOM LINE: If your a horror fan, even if you've just began to get into horror, this (Cabin Fever as well) is a must see. Some parts make you laugh, other parts make you feel for the characters, and a lot of parts make you grit your teeth and clap in satisfaction afterwards - all the elements of a great horror film. Eli Roth knows what a horror film needs to be and he shows it in his work, and if he continues his work like he does, he'll be around for long time."

No one in the screening was complaining.<br/><br/>It is evident that as a scriptwriter, Eli has evolved since his last film. From pancakes, to bubblegum (I won't spoil anything or clarify what this means) 'Hostel' is a far more intricate, funny, scary, and suspenseful film than 'Cabin Fever'.<br/><br/>Eli Roth cares about his fans and the horror genre.

","Hostel (2005) <br/><br/>* 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Three backpackers, hitting every hostel in the area, get more than they expect when they go to a small country where people pay to kill other people. This here comes as a major disappointment because I really enjoyed Eli Roth's Cabin Fever. Technically speaking this film is pretty well made, especially some of the cinematography but outside of that the film was all downhill. I think the biggest blame goes towards Roth and his screenplay, which tries to do something different (American wise) but fails. The director said Miike and Audition were an influence on this film but Roth fails to bring the ""two stories"" together. Like that film, we're led to believe this film is simply about three guys finding girl but then we get to the torture stuff. The beaver hunting scenes don't work and the torture scenes don't work. The characters aren't interesting and that's another problem. The final twenty-five minutes is suppose to be full of suspense but none of it worked. In the end the film is really slow and boring."

Some say its like a soft-core porn film in the beginning, yes there is lots of sex.... but thats what these three guys are here for sex and drugs. I thought it helped add some character development even if ya don't like the guys... they are pretty disrespectful towards females. Once the sun comes out and the parties are over and done... the torture begins and now i will say this... this film is not nearly as violent as some have led you to believe. Don't get me wrong... it is still extremely violent, and often quite brutal. But some made it out to be vomit enducing, and while its wrapped in a different package you've probably seen most of this gory violence before. I wouldn't even really count this as a horror flick, id call it a thriller, the last 30 or so minutes are awesome, and the ending is one of best and most satisfying endings I've ever seen, i highly recommend you check it out and make your own choice about whether or not its stupid or not.... cuz we all have different tastes, so give it shot only if ya can handle some heavy violence."

","As I walked from the theater with a smile on my face I overheard a Quentin Tarantino fanboy exclaim to his friend, ""I don't see why Tarantino put his name on this film."" If you're going to see a film based on the producers then you probably have no grasp of film anyway, which would explain this fan's confusion. This film is far more straight forward than Roth's first offering, Cabin Fever which at times became silly (though I must admit I enjoyed it quite a bit). This film, like Cabin Fever sets it's story up to allow for maximum bloodshed and black humor. Oh, and lots of boobs too. If you can allow yourself to settle in for entertainment of that nature, and don't demand that every scene be a metaphor of some type, you will probably enjoy this film. It takes quit a while to build steam. In spite of that, it's never boring or lagging. I applaud Roth for not rushing things in our age of short attention spans. Once it picks up steam it becomes a real treat. I found myself delighted by the frantic pace of the last 20 minutes or so. Roth did a very good job of keeping the audience guessing the fate of each character and really rewards the audience in the end. A very nice effort. 8/10."
"Max_Doobermin","10","2","6","7 January 2006"," It's Like Saw With Some Talent
","Hostel is similar to the overrated Saw movies in the sense that it is not afraid to show excessive gore or mutilation. While Saw prides itself on the violence, Hostel prides itself on the characters. I've read many reviews of Hostel who hold it to the same level as movies like Saw. Calling it typical, clunky, or nothing new.<br/><br/>Hostel is nothing like Saw. Hostel is a well-made film about the terror of being in an unfamiliar place. Pair this with the typical American mentality, and we see our asshole American backpackers travel deeper and deeper into a nightmare that they won't be able to escape.<br/><br/>I am a huge horror fan, whether it be old American horror or modern Japanese horror, I love horror films. I heard so much about this movie, how great it was, how original is was, how good the acting is, everything. And it's all true. The only thing I found to be untrue was the amount of gore. If anyone thinks this is the goriest movie ever made they got some renting to do. This movie does feature some brilliant effects and scenes of violence, but it's not as brutal as I had hoped.<br/><br/>If you're a Hollywood horror fan looking for a date night scare, you'll come out disappointed as this movie builds up its characters before letting anything remotely dangerous happen to them. But if you're a horror fan looking for something more along the lines of the Devil's Rejects then Hostel may just be the flick for you."

Nothing but TnA during the first portion of the film, did i cry about it though??? Not at all as an 18 year old youth of society i love TnA in horror movies, it's kinda like finding 20 bucks on the street, nice and no complaints. But then the proverbial crap hit the fan and you realize that the TnA was nothing but a look into the utopia of young American men today. You see this movie shows you two things, everything want and everything you don't want in life. And yes this movie is not for the squeamish. That means if jumped in saw or Texas chainsaw massacre, go watch the Chronicles of Narnia. out of 5 stars, i give this movie a 37 and a half. I give it a half because of Japanese chicks.....ooooo i love me some Japanese chicks. So do the world a favor and stop reading this, go now and watch hostel, or the Chronicles of Narnia, or whatever floats your boat. Stop reading....go....go now....tool,"

It's not realistic that those girls didn't just vomit half the time because of those ape-minded dudes. The movie didn't even properly get going and I already couldn't wait for them to get tortured to death.* Slightly disappointing that one of them got out, even though his escape and revenge tactics were very satisfying. But I'm not sure whether that was and actual good scene, or if my standards were just on the floor at that point.<br/><br/>*The only thing that could've slightly redeemed this movie, was some gruesome excessive torture, but all I got was off-screen clipping and a laughable fake eye.

"jonsefcik","5","1","2","2 November 2019"," Decent buildup, silly final act...
","Last night was Halloween, so I knew I needed to watch a horror movie. I went with Hostel, one of the films infamous for helping start the torture porn craze of the 2000s. I guess I'm satisfied, but I have no desire to watch it again, either.<br/><br/>Two Americans are backpacking across Europe with an Icelandic guy they pick up along the way. On a train from The Netherlands to Slovakia, they meet a man who tells them about a hostel with lots of hot girls. Slovakia in this movie is painted as some battered post-communist wasteland. Even in 2005 I doubt literally everyone was driving 80s Eastern block beaters. The first half hour of this film is somewhat meandering and plodding, with a subplot of the shy guy not wanting to get laid that goes nowhere. At least the Icelandic guy is funny.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the Icelandic guy goes missing, so the other two try to find him. Every fishy character they meet is the most obviously evil looking guy and the ominous music plays, but besides a little cheesiness they build up the mystery pretty well. The cinematography/direction is particularly on point here. When one of the Americans is captured, the first torture scene is surprisingly held back and effective, and that quick shot of the Achilles heels always makes me cringe. The acting is good across the board, with the exception of the final guy/main character Jay Hernandez, who wasn't very convincing IMO. He convinces one of the sketchy girls from the hostel to take him where his friends have gone. He gets captured and tortured, and this is where the film goes off the rails.<br/><br/>In the final act of this movie, the torture scenes are so grotesque and over the top, it crosses the line of being scary or disturbing and starts becoming comical. I'm sure there was some intentional really dark comedy in there, but stuff like the German guy slipping on the ball gag and chainsawing his own leg, and the Japanese girl with her eye hanging out of its socket made me laugh. The implausible stuff our hero does from killing a dozen people to fitting a leather glove over his hand with 2 missing fingers without screaming in pain was also funny to me. On top of that, during his escape, he coincidentally boards the same train the Slovak man from earlier just happens to be on. The revenge deaths are satisfying, I'll give the movie that, but it's all just so, so silly.<br/><br/>Though an enjoyable watch, I don't feel the need to ever see this movie ever again. It has a plodding beginning, decent rising actions, and crazy ending that I found both genuinely and ironically entertaining. Feel free to give it a watch if it seems like your kind of thing, but there are much better slashers and torture porn movies out there."

"claudiamelania","3","1","2","7 March 2018"," Very dissapointed
","It wasn't the worst horror movie I've ever seen but but very far from good. Most of the movie is just porn with some stupid clueless characters that make you even care less about the movie then the story itself. The idea of rich paying to kill other people just for entertainment wasn't bad for a movie but it wasn't really new either. The ""horror"" scenes were exaggerated like in any other slasher movie, they were even disgusting. Besides the fact that the movie doesn't really have any story but they don't explain anything and how can this ""business"" work without any missing reports etc?
But the thing that really bothered me about this movie was what americans think about Eastern Europe! They think that Europe is just a playground for them! They think they can do whatever they want if they pay for it! They think that womens are just falling out of the sky for them, doing whatever to please them. And the idea that Slovakia is this country with no laws, where people go missing, are killed for no reason and that the authorities don't do anything about it is just revolting. They show us that people in Slovakia would do anything for money and that they have no morals but that's not how it works. Slovakia like other Eastern Europe countries is an ex-communist one but that doesn't make them prostitutes, pimps, thieves etc. I'am very dissapointed about how racist this movie is.
Again, not the worst horror movie, it has the killings, it has the terror, it has blood, sex and the survivior guy but that's pretty much everything that the movie has, yes some people may be crazy enough to pay to kill other people and that is very upsetting but the movie didn't focus on what could have been good but they only exploited nudity, how medieval Eastern Europe's people are are exaggerated gore."

Journey around the Europe is going really good but one bad decision will change it all and that decision is next place that they will visit. Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) came all the way from USA to see Europe and pick up a friend alongside on journey Oli (Eybor Gudionsson). After having ton of fun in Amsterdam they are persuaded to travel to town near Bratislava and there will horror for them and horror for audience start. There was a constant growth of tension and seeing them party and enjoy themselves it started to fell a little boring considering we are watching 1:30 horror movie with 45 minutes of story telling without horror on sight. Then after Oli disappears it was obvious something is wrong and he are flashed with his head on stick giving us sense of what might come. Actually there was some hope for the movie until horror came on sight and it was the funniest and the lousiest horror from a minimal budget movies without real horror and without any anticipation at all. Every scene inside old factory building is badly placed, horribly shot and directed that it looks like some comedy that that turned bad but is still funny. Nice try to make an horror movie with some story behind but considering how ridiculous it looks and even something like this that was put to people to see is offending to horror genre because of it's bad and not scary or terrifying or horrible or at least fearfulness scenes. It looks like a home-made badly written movie and it was supposed to end even before it started. 1.5/4"
"dale-51649","9","1","2","26 October 2016"," American guys do Europe,have trouble getting laid
","This was an excellent movie, with highest points for its realism re: Eastern Europe, other than the obviously contrived horror premise .. <br/><br/>To some who have reviewed it though, I say-LIGHTEN UP. Geeeez louise it's a freaking horror flick not a social commentary. Men are horny everywhere, and are successful with women if they are rich , good looking, or successful. When women are poor, those willing to pay get a pass. It's not Un PC, it's a fact.<br/><br/>Two Americans and one Icelander travel to Europe . Their plans of fun and frolic go a rye when they run into some eastern euro beauties who seem too good to be true, turns out they are. They are hanging out in the nude in a sauna with them, laughing at their corny jokes and being way too friendly. Every guy knows though, from experience, , chicks THIS hot who are THIS EASY ? It'll cost ya.<br/><br/>The chicks turn out to be more than they bargain for. Escapades include a tour of a scary burnt out old factory, a euro disco with techno zak, and a local bar with torture on the menu. Of course the film includes the required rich guys who are greedy and evil, but their lust goes beyond material things: was it John waters Divine who asked -who wants to die for the sake of art? <br/><br/>For the artsy crowd, there is an actual performance art show to delight. I wont be a spoiler but suffices to say that the hot chicks turn the tables on the dudes. <br/><br/>Most horror movies are too cheesy and too predictable. This one is not cheesy, its high end filming. In addition, it has some good twists. It is not a 10 because it languishes a bit toward the end, a little heavy on the gore, light on story line. But all guys know we pay one way or another, maybe we don't have it so bad."

","One of my friends talked about she'd want to watch movies by Eli Roth, but they are so full of gore she couldn't stand it. Then another friend mention she liked Hostel. I was torn between two options: I'd watch Hostel with the chance I might throw up or worse, or not watch it and feel like I missed out on something. I took the chance of throwing up, but I didn't!<br/><br/>First of all, it takes quite a while before all the torturing starts. And that's magnificent, because the opening credits hint of violence, so even if you'd watch this movie without knowing anything about it, you know something horrible is about to happen. But it doesn't happen right away and you just have to follow these three guys being gross and annoying, and you're just wondering when the torturing is going to start. And the longer it goes on, the more frustrating it is. You want the violence to start, so you can get it over with. The waiting is the most frustrating part about it, and Eli Roth handles that wonderfully. <br/><br/>The characters of this movie are annoying. They are very gross and to be honest, during the start of the movie I was hoping they'd all die. And I didn't like them at any point of the movie. They were the typical characters in a horror movie. You want to yell at them because they don't see the imminent danger ahead of them. Still. I didn't want them to be tortured to death, so during the most suspenseful part I was on the edge of my seat, hoping they'd survive all that. <br/><br/>About the suspenseful parts, wow! They were so thrilling I don't think I've ever been that thrilled while watching a horror movie. The suspense was killing me! It was so excellently written and shot, wow.<br/><br/>I will always praise horror movies for their dialogue. Especially in the beginning the dialogue is so ordinary, because nothing horrible is happening yet. It's real, it's the kind of dialogue you hear every day, and I love it, because while all the torture is going down, how realistic or amazing can dialogue be anyhow?<br/><br/>Hostel is the first movie of this type that I've seen, but I love it! Of course these kind of movies don't have much substance or themes or anything like that, but that's not what they are for!"

","Before I get into criticizing this movie, I feel I should admit that I am human. I often enjoy seeing movies that involve sexual material, and I also often enjoy seeing movies that have a lot of blood and gore shed. This movie certainly has both of those ingredients, and in great quantity, but all the same the movie failed to interest me that much. You can't just put great gobs of nudity and bloody violence in a movie and expect it to therefore be instantly great. You have to put substance with it as well, and that is where ""Hostel"" fails. For starters, the movie is very slow-moving - it takes forever for the protagonists to find themselves in trouble. And during that long period before the crisis starts, what we see of them is not exactly endearing - they come across as simple-minded sex-obsessed youths. While I'm speaking of the characters, the movie also fails when it comes to the antagonists - we learn almost nothing about them. As a result of that, there isn't a great feeling of danger to be felt. You'll just tiredly watch the mayhem and look at your watch to see how much time is remaining until the movie comes to an end. A real disappointment."

","This film uses a tried and true scenario-crass over privileged teens from North America travel to a less privileged country and get their asses kicked by a greater evil than having no class whatsoever. The film works at a basic level but without giving away the plot lets say the film creates a false sense of victory at the end that the sequel squashes within its first five minutes. In that way this film is nothing more than a conduit to an even darker tale of hopeless suffering & evil. It could be seen as a cautionary tale and perhaps in a way it is. Who knows what goes on in out of the way villages in darkest eastern Europe. Transylvania is in Eastern Europe. This story is derivative of the story of Count Dracula on many levels. 'Vlad The Impaler' was a sadistic individual who killed entire villages via cruel torture methods. Much like the antagonists in this film-a Russian gang operating out of a secret hiding place & camouflaging their particular brand of satanism beneath the disguise of organized crime. Whats the message here? I suppose don't go to such towns-if you value your life. I can see that."
"jonathondenesi","8","1","2","31 July 2014"," A good entertaining little thriller
","Eli Roth hasn't quite hit a home run with many of his original movies. His directing has been subject to a lot of criticism, but I won't let that get in the way of my review. Personally, I love Eli Roth's acting, he bring a relatively fresh persona to the screen. But this being the first movie I watched created by Roth, I heard a lot of hype, and downplay, so I didn't know what to expect.<br/><br/>I can't and will not criticize the acting in the movie, because a lot of it seemed suitable for the target audience. It wasn't bad in any way, and it had it's moments. So I won't dive to deep into the acting.<br/><br/>However the plot was intriguing, and seemed to be pretty creative. The premise was enticing me to watch the movie, though I didn't know a whole lot about it, however, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Since the movie is a thriller/horror, there is a lot of violent and graphic torture scenes. Since I have desensitized myself to some of the violence, or I just have a higher tolerance to gore, I found to be amusing. I could see what he was trying to do with the torture scene, and didn't think they fell short in any way. I imagine it to be similar to many Japanese gore flicks, like Guinea Pig, to a somewhat lesser extent. And maybe more like Audition in the veracity of the graphic torture scenes.<br/><br/>So I understand what he was trying to do, and it was not necessarily a high budget movie by any means. So with that in mind, you do not get many of the dull high budget Hollywood horror style gore. It remains under the radar of these cheap Hollywood gore flicks, and rightfully so. In that sense it seemed genuine to classic torture flicks, unlike a Saw 4 type thriller.<br/><br/>I cannot say the same for the following Hostel flicks, it seemed like later movies tried to capitalize on the legacy of the original. That being said, Eli Roth didn't direct the following, which may be why he stepped back but that is besides the point.<br/><br/>If you don't have the stomach for these gore flicks, then it should be easily for you to decide, just don't watch it. If you like gore art, then it would definitely be worth taking a look into. If you like the movies Audition, or really many Japanese thrillers, it is similar and seems more sincere."

Are we really that violent a species that enjoys watching people being tortured, maimed and killed? I just don't understand what pleasure anyone can get out of that, but apparently these movies are popular with a certain sect of our society. I find it disturbing that teens and even children would watch these particular kinds of movies and get some sort of thrill out of it. Sorry, I just don't get it or find them at all entertaining.

"videorama-759-859391","8","1","2","4 April 2014"," Hostel of death
","Here's a true horror film. Hostel is a true horror masterpiece itself, derived from not the sanest of minds. Roth has created something legendary here, where 8 years later, I still remember how terrifying the film was, when seeing it on the big screen. It's probably the most terrifying horror I've seen in my life. Roth is great as how he gives us a taste of gore at the start, blood and brain issuing down a drain from a tortured young victim, snatched from an infamous hostel, who's become the violent prey of rich Americans, whatever, getting their kicks, killing and torturing for a price. The idea is ingeniously sick, amazingly inspired by a real life torture and kill website. We follow three backpackers, two are whom are American, while the other stray, is an extroverted Icelanic guy who puts sparkle early into the affair before the high level gore and torture ensue. Like Wolf Creek, we get to know the characters where we're subjected to some nice nudity and some dangerously hot women who turn out to be shockingly evil. Even a swarm of little Slovokian street kids, are some of the dangerously underestimated. There's a nice easeful flow of story here. The torture scenes, aren't for the faint hearted and Hostel is a sick excursion into terror, that demonstrates how life can be cheaply disposed of, as in Wolf Creek, by remorseless beings. Rick Hoffman, as a sick American client, one of the most detestable, revels in in his role, that scene and the one with Takeshi Mike striding coolly back to his car, while delivering a killer line of answer to suss Jay Hernandez, who thinks he's about to look at some art, are my favourite two scenes. In this big old empty building, are rooms are death, from none of the survive. The Asian girl, having her eye burned out with an oxi torch, where the eyeball dangles out, leaving frenetic Hernandez, forced to make a decision, as to what to do, was one of the film's most intense moments. Later during their escape, I noticed a fault with Hernandez and Lim, evacuating a car in a line up, conducted by some corrupt cops. How they weren't spotted with the cops on close approach, I couldn't buy. For gore lovers Hostel's violence has a heavy style, and it rides high on bloodletting. There's humour too, where the whole story is structured brilliantly, it's finale just as violently shocking. It's a lot to take, where a lot of viewers will turn off. It's a truly underestimated torture show of terror, one which Roth with his great story structure is one to be proud of, but probably not for what he's doing for commercial backpacking. A scarring psychological horror, that will live on in memory for many years to come. Be prepared."

","Hostel is a disturbing tale of the darkest side of humanity. The fact that it may be based on a true story makes it that much more disturbing. Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson are perfectly cast as well-meaning (but flawed) characters looking to have some fun before returning to school. Some people have found the first half hour to be hard to sit through, but I thought it was interesting how the movie showed these characters fulfilling their desires - just like the wealthy businessmen attempt to fulfill their desires. As I compared the two, I wondered which desires were more sinister. Eli Roth's story is filled with social commentary not often found in horror films, which alone makes Hostel worth a watch."

","This is a truly rotten movie with nothing to recommend it. For example, the first half-hour or so has a lot of T&A, all of which is ruined by the three male protagonists running around going Oh Oh Naked Women! like a bunch of 8-year-olds snapping towels in a girls' locker room. When they do get lucky, it's all pretty much So That's Where It Goes! Stupid instead of sexy.<br/><br/>Personally, I'd tie 'em up (the guys) to a chair and pull out a scalpel. Which is precisely what happens to them and the rest of the movie turns into a very long, very boring gore-fest. Since these guys have already alienated the audience, the long, drawn-out process of dismembering them has all the satisfaction and drama of a medical school dissection.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the whole movie seems to have been stitched together in the worst possible way from Teenage Male Virgin and Teenage Slasher films.<br/><br/>Like most males, once I hit puberty I knew what I had, knew what it was for, and very much looked forward to my first test drive, making that Teenage Nerd Virgin snickering at Naked Ladies seem just plain weird, just pain offensive and just plain retarded.

"tacomunky303","6","1","2","22 November 2012"," A movie that teaches us that backpacking in Europe really is a stupid idea.
","Eli Roth's second film ushered in what is known as ""torture porn."" And man alive, does this rub me the wrong way. Why exactly is it that we have to lump all things into sub-genres? Let's put it this way. Porn is made to excite some sort of sense, and in most uses of the word, it's used to sexually excite people. How does torture in mainstream movies excite anyone? Not to mention, there really isn't anything lingering in this film. I've seen far more love and dedication paid to murder scenes in the old Italian Giallos. They relished the gore. This film really doesn't. It does spend a lot of intimate time with the people being tortured, but we don't get spurting bright red blood. It's called torture porn just so people who don't want to watch horror have an excuse.<br/><br/>And this is a pretty decently executed piece of horror. Like ""Cabin Fever"" before it, humor dominates the opening twenty minutes. We get to know Paxton, Josh and Oli, as they take in Amsterdam's vices, smoking pot openly and visiting whorehouses. We find Josh to be a bit indecisive, even hesitant. And because this was one of my first horror movie experiences when I saw it in 2005, I bought into that false sense of security for him.<br/><br/>However, he meets a gruesome end when two girls who work for a torture club sell him as a victim. He encounters a man who he had a strangely sexually suggestive encounter with on a train, and that man takes great pleasure in stabbing, drilling, and basically ripping Josh apart. Just when we think Josh is going to escape, he gets one of the most brutal cuts you'll ever see in a movie.<br/><br/>So the rest of the movie is basically Paxton looking for both Josh and Oli, asking one of the prostitutes to help him. She takes him to the torture club, where he has to make his way out of the gruesome and disgusting rooms without being seen. One of my favorite scenes is when he encounters one of the members of the club getting psyched up to go kill. The scene is creepy, but funny and over the top.<br/><br/>Eventually Paxton does escape, but not before helping an Asian woman with one of her eyes gouged out escape with him. The two start to make their way through town, avoiding the most brutal group of kids you can imagine, before she throws herself in front of a train. And before Paxton makes it back home, he has one more piece of business in a bathroom stall to take care of.<br/><br/>This movie is gory, well paced, and not as lingering as the sub-genre may suggest. It doesn't revel in its brutality. There is a story here, and the characters have some depth. I know a lot of horror fans don't respect or even like Eli Roth's work, but his first two movies, including this one, deserve a second watch.<br/><br/>__________________________ For all the Horror Banana's reviews, visit http://morozov924.hubpages.com/"

","I am amazed this film has been given a low rating by everyone. Most probably because there are no big ""stars"". I judge a film on its own merits rather than who is in it or who the director is etc. This film is better than the Saw series and other cut and slash films as you get to know the characters before the cutting and slashing begins. Three guys are out drinking looking for females and go to a hostel where they are led to believe there are girls and more girls all willing to have sex.The honey trap is set. Looking back after watching the film the girls most probably did more than they had to but most guys will not complain about that. The guys are then held captive and tortured by people who have paid to torture/kill people. As with any film there are unlikely events but who wants to watch boring real life.

The word sickening, peers would have had me believe, is not nearly dastardly, nor emotive, enough for what horrors I was about to witness as I whistled along to the mellow tune of the opening sequence.<br/><br/>It was, therefore, with great disappointment that I reached forty minutes into the movie and absolutely nothing had happened. I say nothing, but credit where credit is due, what actually happened was a bit of character backgrounding, mixed in with scenes of dull and uninteresting exposition. It is understandable for a horror movie to want to build up character profiles to allow for empathy, and to want to set the scene to allow for a pseudo-realistic plot, however even with the gratuitous and vast introduction that Hostel employed, and a fair amount of emotional lenience and suspended disbelief on my part, it was halfway through the movie and I neither cared for any of the characters, nor felt particularly engaged in what seemed to be a fairly placid and purposeless plot.<br/><br/>It was through this general cinematic ineptitude that we reached a point where one of the introductory trio, an Icelandic ""King of Swing"" (don't even ask), was dead, and the other was being tortured and then killed. I make no apologies in saying that I have cared more for the toilet-bowl bacteria I regularly slaughter, than I did for these characters and their untimely demises. Considering the amount of time the Director was given to make me care about the characters, even slightly, then this can only be construed as either lazy or amateurish; perhaps both.<br/><br/>Due to the overwhelming amount of discussion about the degree of gore in this movie, I feel as though I should pay it some attention. The scenes of torture, however few and far between they may have been, were relatively good at showing how people react in that type of situation, thanks to very good acting from the victims. I would like to point out however, that although there were some nearly-nail-biting moments, most of the gore seemed to be there just for the sake of filling up time. It is also worth noting that the body parts being cut up, and cut off, were at times very unconvincing, which very much detracted from the seriousness of the scene.<br/><br/>Overall, it wasn't a terrible horror movie. The plot did quicken towards the end, providing a bit of a rush, but nothing to write home about. I think people would like this movie to be the big, bad, and ugly one, that puts a defiant lock on the doors of gore, but it's not even close. Half of the movie is what appears to be a watered-down Eurotrip, and the other half, a fast-paced yet emotionless bloodbath, resulting in one- and-a-half hours of wasted time. Unless you're looking for short, cheap thrills, this is definitely one to avoid. In fact, I'd avoid it even if you are. You'd get more excitement, and better storytelling, from a trip to your local old folks home. Less than half a movie, gives this less than half a score; a resounding four out of ten."
"Supachewy","8","1","2","24 August 2010"," A Fresh Film For the Horror Genre
","The Horror film Hostel is directed by Eli Roth and stars Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, and Eythor Gudjonsson. The film takes place in modern day Europe.<br/><br/>The film begins with a shot of a torture chamber and then cuts to two Americans, Paxton and Josh (Hernandez and Richardson), and an Icelandic man, Oli (Gudjonsson), in Amsterdam. After being locked out of the hostel they are staying at they are brought in by a young man who claims that there is a much better hostel in Slovakia, with all the best girls and no other Americans. So the three decide to travel to the hostel by train and on the way they encounter a middle aged man who creeps Josh out by touching his leg, and at the time he seems to have no significance. When they arrive at the hostel they discover that everything they heard about it was true and their roommates are two beautiful women (who they get to know quite well). But little do they know everything is not what it seems...<br/><br/>The writing of this film was quite ingenious. It reminded me a lot of a Hitchcock film because it really focused on characterization for around the first thirty minutes before focusing on the plot. By the time the plot actually came around I felt that I knew the two main characters Paxton and Josh very well and rooted for them when the film turned into horror. The actual screenplay was quite original I have never seen anything quite like it and I enjoyed how realistic the film was. At points there were noticeable coincidences but not so unrealistic that it ruined the whole film. Eli Roth proves with this film that he is a great addition to the horror genre.<br/><br/>The direction of the film was also very good. Along with the writing it really helped develop the characterization and it also kept the film interesting the whole way through. Roth created an extremely gory film and he succeeded in making me flinch at the screen by the brutality. This is one of the goriest films of all time and Roth did it all necessarily, by necessarily I mean he never overdid it just for the scares. This is Roth's second feature film (his first being Cabin Fever) and he proves with it that he is a director that is going to stay around for a while.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is quite good as well. Hernandez is the lead and starts off as an enjoyable, relaxed guy. As the film goes on he evolves due to the circumstances he is into a much darker person that is confused, in pain, and angry. He plays his part very well and is very convincing. Richardson plays Josh and is probably the most relatable character in the film. He just got out of a serious relationship and is just looking for a good time. He is a genuinely nice guy who gets into tragic circumstances and I rooted for him the whole time. Gudjonsson plays the part of Oli, he is basically just there for comic relief and he is pretty funny, so good job to you. This is a well acted film.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a strong 7/10, due to the fine acting, direction, and writing. This film is definitely one of the best American horror films of the past decade, along with Saw and 28 Days Later. I can't really think of any other ones at the moment. Another thing I really liked about this film is how it is divided into two parts and how they are separated. The first part is the pretty part with all the girls and drugs, you can tell this part by how the two roommate girls are very attractive and wearing makeup. The second part is the not so pretty part and the two roommates are not wearing makeup during this part. I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of the horror genre."

","With all of the hype behind this movie I thought I new what to expect going in but the movie completely floored me. It starts off slow and focuses on three guys backpacking though Europe two of them are American and one is Icelandic. For the first 30 to 40 minutes there is very little horror but a lot of character development goes on, so that when the horror does start at least for me it made what the characters where going though more horrific. This is where I am going to spoil so if you haven't yet seen the movie I do recommend it so stop reading go watch it then finish the review. When the horror does happen it is being instigated by someone that the guys met on their journey, even the girls the where sleeping with at the beginning are in on it. From that point on it is about Jay Hernedaz's characters escape. There is a lot of violence and gore but not as much as I was expecting and for the last 30 minutes the film turns into an action movie so as far as a horror movie goes I was disappointed because I was expecting more. It does have a satisfying ending in that all of the people directly involved get killed in brutal and very memorable ways. All of the guys were very good at there parts and they start out as very unlikable but through the course of the movie that changes. I definitely recommend it but don't go in expecting a epic horror cause you will be disappointed."

","I haven't extensively researched the genesis of Hostel, but after watching it, I can imagine the sole idea that sparked the entire film: ""What if there was a brothel that charged patrons for the opportunity to torture and murder people instead of having sex with them?"" Very sick stuff, this, and an intriguing idea to boot. Problem is, you have to build a film around an idea to bring it to life. While Hostel has its concept in place, the movie that Eli Roth constructs around this premise is an incoherent mess.<br/><br/>There are so many things wrong with this inexplicably popular gorefest, it's hard to know where to begin. Let's start with our cast of obnoxious frat-boy meat-heads, whose exploits we're supposed to vicariously enjoy, but who are so utterly unlikeable, we're left hoping that they die within the first five minutes. We should also mention the seemingly inhuman ability these characters have to lose eyeballs and fingers throughout the course of the film, but somehow not lose enough blood to induce shock, or even mild discomfort.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if there's a message intended in this film, but the moral I got out of Hostel is that people who live in small European countries are completely insane. They'd pretty much have to be to necessitate an entire industrial complex where a dozen rooms are filled with paying customers inflicting unfathomable tortures upon anonymous flailing victims. While this concept is certainly frightening, I'm a bit more disturbed to find out that in some European locales, bands of unbathed children roam the streets committing acts of murder in exchange for bubble gum. This is not a joke, by the way, but actually a crucial factor in the climax of this wretched offering.<br/><br/>But you probably aren't watching Hostel to see any intelligence on display are you? You're really more interested in seeing grisly fates handed out to these bland, interchangeable characters for no apparent reason, right? Well, you certainly get that here, and if your weapon of choice is the Unrated DVD release, you're going to get plenty of it. Problem is, you have to wait about an hour and sit through roughly 14 soft-core sex scenes to get there. Should you decide to weather the endless barrage of gratuitous nudity (okay, not so bad... I'll give you that) and heavy drinking, you will find out fascinating things about the human body. For instance, did you know that when you cut someone's eyeball out, egg yolk drips down their face? I do now. Thanks, Hostel!<br/><br/>I really don't want to waste too much time talking about a movie that I already squandered 90 dreadful minutes on, so I'm not going to spend many more words discussing this. But I want to at least address the biggest problem with this film before I finish this review and sell back the useless DVD I just finished dirtying my player with.<br/><br/>Though the film eventually turns into an over-the-top Grand Guignol feast of sanguinary delights, the journey there is so long-winded and barren of suspense, most viewers without a penchant for self-loathing will turn this film off before the horror part of our program even gets underway. While there are certainly ample breasts on display during this hour-long road to nowhere, if this is enough for you to justify sitting through the antics of characters whose ability to annoy outshines even the most bravura splatter on display in this film, I really think you should leave your house more often. The light-hearted tone and ""look at us talking like normal teenagers"" dialogue don't mesh with the brutality that follows, and this juxtaposition doesn't make the torture scenes in this film more scary or powerful, it just confuses what the point of this whole mindless offering really is.<br/><br/>I offer this film a 4 simply because the core concept is a very intriguing one, even if the execution of this concept is so inept that it renders the original idea impotent. A 5 might be a bit more fair, but I had to chop off a point because this film actually features a hunchback wearing medieval chain-mail.<br/><br/>If there's any resolution we get out of Hostel, it's that torture is never pretty. Well, the agonizing process of sitting through this very stupid film is a lot more painful than anything the characters in the movie go through, so exactly why anyone would praise this senseless and artless piece of crap is beyond me. Maybe someone gave them some bubble gum?"

"debbiekirk24","10","1","2","26 December 2008"," The best modern horror film I have seen in years
","I have decided to add a comment because I am so shocked and surprised by all the negative reviews that appear on this website. Hostel is quite simply a great story in the classic tradition of horror movies - I can even draw parallels with Hitchcock in the way the atmosphere is created and the story unfolds with the audience guessing all the time. As a 45 year old mum, I am still able to identify with the main characters and whilst I was never a sex tourist, I certainly did the trip to Amsterdam staying in a hostel in the red light district as a teenager. I visited the bars and clubs and got locked out of the hostel one night - the guys are totally believable. I know from my husband's experiences in Amerstam in his youth that young guys definitely go there to experience sex and drugs and live it up before settling down to marriage or college or whatever the normal, humdrum existence has in store for them - I was with them all the way.<br/><br/>Almost every sex scene in this film is suggested, not graphic. Apart from naked breasts and Oli's bare bottom you actually see very little and the fornication is all in the mind. Contrast this to the sex scenes in 'Where the Truth Lies' with Kevin Bacon and Colin Firth which I found so graphic - especially featuring actors with whom I am familiar - that I was unable to watch. The torture scenes as well leave almost everything to the imagination - you see the instruments, you see the blood but you don't really see anything happen. The gore is artistic in the Clive Barker tradition and when the girls talk about an art show, that is truly what the torture scenes amount to. There is a definite parallel between the exhibits in the torture museum and the exhibits the characters become and in my view this kind violence constitutes the art form typified in Barker's Hellraiser.<br/><br/>The pace of the film is break-neck. You are gripped from beginning to end. You can't look away for a second in case you miss an important lead. The film actually feels longer than it is because so much is crammed into such a short space of time. Nothing unnecessary has been retained and everything you see is crucial to the outcome. This is quite simply a beautifully structured, well-acted, artistic and atmospheric film with its roots firmly in a reality we may prefer to ignore. In my view a lot of writers on these pages have completely missed the point."

It is more subjective than that: I visited Bratislava few years ago and I don't know if the footage took place there, but mark my words: Bratislava is one of the most civilized and developed cities in the former Eastern block. Any war there? But excuse me. Kids gangs haunting the streets? You must be kidding me. I don't know why those bloody Americans don't place their plots somewhere in that south-central L.A. Or in Buffalo, for example. 'coz this movie is an insult to Europe - Amsterdam is about drugs and Eastern Europe is about poverty and misery.

"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","3","1","2","23 September 2008"," Torture... to watch.
","A key thing in setting up horror is making sure that we as an audience care for the characters and are thus frightened and/or disturbed when they are killed off. ""Hostel"" simply presents killing and torture for the sake of killing and torture. The characters are drug and sex seeking college students with lackluster character development and very graphic and disturbing death scenes. This film is practically snuff legalized - ""gorno"" (as I've heard it called) - or whatever you wish it to be called, but the point is, it is sick. It is a lazy, sadistic, bloody mess that desperately tries to be scary but is mainly just repulsive. It has all the things that slasher fans would want - sex and nudity and graphic killings - but absolutely nothing to put them together in the form of a solid story. The string of events is just a thin string that leads the audience along and not really caring where it ends up, just as long as the need to show sex scenes before showing lots of gore scenes is fulfilled.<br/><br/>The scenes of torture are admittedly well-done movie splatter, and if their aim is to disturb, then they do their job very well. However, in the age of the art of special effects, the art of story telling (which used to be the primary driving force for films) is taking a backseat. Or rather it is being intentionally put into the backseat by filmmakers who only want to get cheap material sensations out of their viewers. Any fan of horror can name many films in the genre that have considerably less gore, but are so much better due to them having a storyline that is worth paying attention to. ""Hostel"" is just splatter and gratuitousness in one package. What is even worse is that the slasher sub-genre is essentially the simplest form of horror (killer, victims, blood, scares), but this is even worse than that, since they intentionally spoiled the most critical element. --- 3/10<br/><br/>BsCDb Classification: 18+ --- brutality, violence/gore"

The horror industry is failing and its a sad reality that to sell a horror film to the public you have to first get the film banned and then build up its notoriety then everyone will have to see it. Torture scenes and more blood than German sausage this film is very poor. It has all the hallmarks of a c grade gore shock flick. and if your interested in watching people being tortured well I am personally not up for it. To me contemporary horror films look back on great flicks from the masters of horror-Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter, Chuck Russell and John Landis. But these contemporary films have really nothing to offer. Torturing people and then killing them sounds like snuff to me not 'horror' it all went wrong here in this film. <br/><br/>I would leave this title on the shelf and rent 'hellraiser' if you want horror don't waste your time."

","Eli Roth wanted to make a statement. He wanted to show Americans about there ignorance of the world outside there own. Hence he decided to use his talent to make a ignorant film about a fictitious place in the hell hole of a former soviet block nation, where rich people visit to fulfill there dark desires of killing a person the way there minds intends. A well oiled industry of Slovenians performs the duty of finding the victims for there clients. Whether the statement the director intended to put forward had reached or not through this movie is not known, but it surely does not matter, as the message about the ignorance of common Americans is reiterated each week by several Hollywood films. Eli Roth need not have tried so hard.<br/><br/>But looking back at the movie Hostel by Eli Roth which is backed by master of gross, greasy violence in cinema Quinton Tarrantino does not does perform efficiently on the gore quotient. Yes they are very much there, but cannot be said that was the only thing in director's mind while making the movie. The three leads in this slasher movie are straight out of the American Pie franchise. All they have in there minds while moving around Europe are Breasts. Our frat boys, two friends from U.S and other one from Barcelona (so you pretty much know who is going to die first) give us a very insightful tour of Amsterdam's erotic world. Every corner they go girls over there are ready to get laid. A very whacky sequence of the boy's trip down a whore house gives us the idea of the broad and bold textures the makers have planned to use for the film ahead. So showing Amsterdam as sex capital of Europe is very much top of the director's mind. Heck! When our boys enter a local apartment, a couple are busy in there all stoned lovemaking session, oblivious of anyone else being in the room. This is where a very helpful person for our sex starved American tourists informs them about the much better quality of breasts available in the eastern block at Bratislava where due to some war there are very few men left, hence chicks over there are really sex starved pouncing over any stick. So we enter Bratislava, complete with run down factories and yes, the information is right, sex starved women. I mean, for the first hour or so there are breasts hanging all over Europe (some deeply affecting war they had!). So the scene is set and the boys have fulfilled there appetite on the very first night and the Barcelona guy has gone missing apparently with a Japanese girl, who is also present in the hostel with her other friend named Kaana. Now moving around Bratislava, one finds out that the only talent these people had in there country was Torture. They even had a torture museum. And the kids over there are ready to smash heads of anyone for even a packet of gums (after all they are nurtured by the best in the world). So now the movie begins, as our frat boys are sucked into the crowning glory of Bratislava, The torture industry (looking at the rates the clients pay and the voluntary work of the entire town for the cause, this industry must be the economical hub of Bratislava). So our boys go through the entire torturing process with only one survivor, who then goes over to save the Japanese Kaana from a maniac whose torture process of using a burner to melt the eyes off is the ultimate bottom. And then our frat boy hero, uses scissor to cut off Kaana's hanging eyeball (after which I lost my appetite for mustard sauce). Slashing, chopping and then some rescue effort from hell, this movie simply wont cheer you up.<br/><br/>Eli Roth's jumbled screenplay wastes too much time in build up to the ultimate slash fest and breasts. The boys are not exactly charming either for us to care for them. There is no room for creativity in the film except for a very chance confrontation of a client and our hero discussing about how to fulfill the rush for killing. In the end what was suppose to be a global Texas chain saw massacre kind of epic gore fest turned out to be a dampener. And the message Mr. Roth wanted to spread about the ignorance, this movie did made me check about Bratislava and Slovenia on the net. Success!"

The first part of the movie relaxes the viewer with some nice eye-candy, a bit of simulated sex and some fit eastern European girls showing off their wares before the lads find out they have a free invitation to a torture chamber. It reminded me of watching From Dusk Til Dawn for the first time and how the movie suddenly became a vampire flick halfway through! Pretty boy jay hernandez made for an unlikely hero but unlike many horror films which go all silly just to show some gratuitous gore, director Eli Roth keeps the suspense going to the end and really kept a seasoned horror fan like myself squirming on the edge of my seat. This is definitely not one for the faint-hearted or a date movie, perfect to watch with a few mates after the pub has shut."
"StevenFlyboy","10","1","2","14 February 2008"," Hard-hitting flick
","Hostel might be the most upsetting film I've ever seen. The director was amazed when the film received an R-rating instead of NC-17 and I agree. The film starts innocently enough, with two American backpackers living it up in Amsterdam with their Icelandic traveling buddy. But when their quest for sex and debauchery takes them to a mysterious hostel in a quiet Eastern European town, the guys find themselves in a world more disturbing than anything they could have imagined. The scenes of torture in this film are absolutely brutal and even fans of conventional horror may find themselves flinching and squirming at times. But just when you begin to think you're watching nothing more than a $4.5 million snuff film, the film changes direction and shifts into high gear. Hostel eschews the modern thriller convention of ""the more plot twists, the better"" and simply goes right for the jugular and the gut. The film certainly hits both targets, and it doesn't let go until the very end. Famed Japanese horror director Takashi Miike makes a cameo appearance (which is not surprising as all his movies are full of graphically horrible scenes as does this movie). Quentin Tarantino is credited as an executive producer but I think a lot of up and coming new directors use his name as a spring-board to get their movies noticed. These days it seems that ""Quentin Tarantino presents"" EVERYTHING. Anyway if you are a graphic horror movie fan and haven't seen this, you owe it to yourself to check it out. I just hope this doesn't turn out to be a ""fluke"" on the part of Eli Roth. If he can make more movies as well as this one, he'll be a superstar eventually. This great movie doesn't end with just the credits either. It is capped off by the line, ""I get a lot of money for you...and that make you MY bitch!"""
"dead_sky_dawning","6","1","2","8 February 2008"," Haha... oh man.
","Well, after reading all the negative ""lynch mob"" press surrounding this movie, I just HAD to watch it in order to see what all the fuss was about. In the typical Yankee style, Europe here is portrayed as a backward continent full of psychos and prostitutes, where the ""kick-ass"" and cool, cultured American youth can get laid and stoned anytime. First off, contrary to what the movie will have you believe, the weirdo town where the hostel is located is not in Slovakia, but in the Czech Republic (leading me to believe that this picture was made for an American audience, whose knowledge of world geography generally ends somewhere around the border of Canada, at best). Second, Slovakia (or in this case, the Czech Republic) is not really considered Eastern Europe by any reasonable geographical standards. But what the hell... The plot is pretty thin. Two Americans and an Icelander (nice touch of exoticism) can't even get laid in Amsterdam (hahaha), so they head out to some hostel in a small town in Slovakia (ahem), heeding the advice of some Russian stoner they met a minute ago. Yeah, makes perfect sense. <br/><br/>Once there, they hook up with two hot chicks who show them how to drink, party and have sex. Slowly but surely, they also discover the other main cultural attractions of Europe from the American perspective: filth, poverty, horny chicks who all speak English with a Russian accent, kids with sticks and stones wandering around the streets at 2 a.m. looking for tourists whose skulls to bash, and an organized gang of wealthy upper class psychos who pay tens of thousands to torture and kill youngsters for the heck of it. (All this in a run-down, abandoned factory, transformed into an all-out torture center, complete with pit bulls and some shade-wearing, machine-gun wielding bad ass Russian/Ukrainian/Slovakian/who the hell knows anymore- mobsters in black suits and commando boots, acting as security guards. The whole joint is run by some shady Russian (who else?) ""Elite Hunter"" company/organization, whose members all need to take a nasty looking blood hound tattoo on their arm. Wow. Evil. The innocent victims (who are naturally dumb, dumber and dumbest) are brought in straight from the hostel, which serves as some sort of a central victim-finder-source, with the staff members all affiliated with the ""Gang"".<br/><br/>Anyway, Yank dude No.1 and Icelander get killed, and Yank dude No.2 makes a heroic escape from torture central, later exacting revenge on the two chicks from the town and the weird Russian stoner from Amsterdam, who fooled him and his buddies into the joint in the first place. Yank dude No.2 runs them over with a car, after coincidentally (and rather conveniently) seeing them standing in the middle of the street not doing anything, probably waiting to be run over by a car driven by angry Yank dude. <br/><br/>I guess this thing could be considered as an attempt at a snuff/porn/horror flick, as some of the torture scenes are pretty gory. And well, in all fairness, there is some amount of suspense every now and then. The escape scene, for instance, is pretty well done. <br/><br/>The main problem here is, that the movie isn't really scary. It's brutal, it's bloody, it's gory - but it's not scary, like a horror flick should be. I even thought, that a few scenes ended up being unintentionally funny. For instance, the bar/cafe scene in the morning, which was intended to be dramatic and a turning point in the film, with the main character finally realizing something's not right. The situation is just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. The two girls are hung over and having beer and the dead serious main character walks in and demands to go to the ""art gallery"", as the entire bar, packed with some 100-year-olds dressed up like the Gestapo, stare at him angrily.<br/><br/>Anyways, the point is, there are way better horror movies out there. Check out ""Tesis"" or the original and uncut Japanese version of ""The Ring"" (the American version isn't bad either), if you don't feel like sleeping for a few weeks."

What follows I suppose is intended to be shocking, but the set-up is so horrendous that I was waiting for some sort of twist or extra dimension to rescue this film which was already circling the drain.<br/><br/>What follows mixes a few stereotypes in with some slightly substandard special effects, and finishes it off with such disdain that you wonder if the screenplay was written in an afternoon.<br/><br/>I'm unsure of the intended target demographic of this film, given that it would have appealed more to me if I had been around 14-15, although as far as I'm aware its an 18 certificate.<br/><br/>And as for Tarantino, I truly wonder if he has lost the plot a little, and it puts me off watching his future work if he was so ready to plaster his name over this half-baked project.<br/><br/>Avoid this if you can, there's a huge range of better films out there."

The most entertaining bit of the whole movie was seeing Takashi Miike speaking English, now that is impressive. And on a note about Takashi Miike, if you want to see a gore filled movie just watch Ichi The Killer. It was evident in this movie that Roth wanted to copy Miike's style and did it quite badly!<br/><br/>Honestly don't see this movie...it'll only disappoint you."

There was of course the teenage guys saying how awesome it was, people saying how gory it was and then people saying its just like an hour of porn with a bunch of violence thrown in. So finally this past year I saw it at someones house, I fought it as best I could but I was finally drawn in to the naked bodies and the moans.<br/><br/>To me this movie accurately portrays the two bases of human nature, sex and violence.

","I cannot decide whether Hostel is a commentary on the history of European torture and an analogue to the Holocaust, or a nasty, sadistic, cynical and juvenile mix of soft-porn and gore designed to appeal to, and up the ante for the 'Saw' cinema-goer market. Who knows what went through the mind of its creator. Reviewers comment on the realism of the effects. Well it was realistic enough for me. How do they know what the bottom portion of a leg separated by a chainsaw looks like unless they've seen it? What is obvious is that Hostel uses a very American POV about Europe, to the point of satire. The Czech Republic, a perfectly charming recent addition to the European union is depicted as a grimy, post-Industrial hellhole generally populated by the criminal, insane, perverted or a combination of all three. One thing to consider is that torture, an unavoidable part of our European heritage - and now our heritage industry - is an aspect of life that America as a nation, is too young to have experienced. Of course, now they are making up for lost time, and the irony is that some former East European states are giving them the facility to engage in it. Then again, who knows? Also, torture, beyond its role as an instrument of the state and ideology, but as a hobby pursued with a complete lack of humanity, has happened within our lifetime, where some of the events depicted here, may well have happened. Is this film making us remember that, or forgetting it? Certainly, anyone who regards the blowtorching of an eyeball as entertainment, has, in my opinion, deep issues. Likewise projectile vomiting brought on by sheer terror, and other episodes of voyeuristic sadism. I found all of those deeply disturbing to watch, as much as because they had nothing to do with the plot, but were designed to be enjoyed in their own right - to give the viewer a rush. Sadism one step removed. Sensation has to be the lowest form of artistic merit. I just hope some viewer isn't inspired to try and go one better in terms of realism."

","3 friends backpacking through Europe look for sex and booze. They hear about some kind of Hostel that offers beautiful naked women and no attachments. They go off in search for this place, but instead find a torture house. Soon they are finding themselves in a heap of trouble.<br/><br/>Eli Roth is being hailed as the new face of horror. As of right now, with the current features under his belt; I must ask myself, why does this guy have this title? Granted I liked Cabin Fever, with it's homages left right and centre to the genre, but was it good enough to have its director considered 'Horror Master'? After watching Hostel, I still sit here dumbfounded.<br/><br/>Upon this films release (and after it as well) the only thing I kept hearing was how sick and twisted it was. How there was no real story and that a film like this should not be in print. Being the horror fanatic that I am, I was hoping to see something that I, and the fans of the genre, can enjoy while everyone else trashed it. Now after seeing Hostel, I sit here on the fence as to whether or not I liked it. It's not the vile, porn-torture, disgust of a film that I thought it was, but it wasn't a horrible piece of trash either.<br/><br/>Roth knows the genre well, which is evident in how he presents the film and the style throughout. This is it's high and low points. The film looks beautiful in the second half, but Roth overexposes the viewer to what makes horror movies horror movies. For example, an action film usually has gun fire and car chases; horror films usually have blood, sex and violence. In Hostel, we get overexposed with an obscene amount of nudity, then the second half is an obscene amount of sadistic violence. The film plays like two different movies. The first half is soft core porn and is shot like a teen slasher film, while the second is 'considered' a snuff film, shot with a grittier look.<br/><br/>My problems with the film are scattered throughout it's running time. For everything good in the film, there is something bad. Horror films are suppose to make you feel a certain number of things. One is to be scared, yet this film is not scary. Instead Roth relies on graphic violence to scare his audience. People claim that the film is a gory trip through hell and back. Did I miss the train? Hostel, to sum up in one sentence: Does Not Live Up To The Hype. I don't know if it's the sick films I've seen prior (Cannibal Holocaust, Dead-Alive, Evil Dead), but Hostel is not what it seems. The film tries to go for shock, but fails to deliver any in its poor attempt.<br/><br/>I appreciate the acknowledgement of other horror films Roth shows us. Any horror fan can point out certain places and things Roth homages. One that I liked was seeing Takishi Miike walk out of the warehouse. Here is a person Roth admires greatly and by the time you're reading this has probably already directed 3 more films. While I am not a total fan of Takishi yet, I can respect his films. You can see a touch of his style here. Nobody should be fooled by the title Tarantino Presents. Other then promoting a friends film, he has no touch here. It's a shame, cause this film could have used a touch up.<br/><br/>It is suspenseful in some scenes, but the way Roth constructs them is horrible. We are suppose to believe that the main character will go back to save a life, simply because of one line of dialogue earlier? To explain, our so called hero says that he once saw someone die and he could have done something to save her. Later on in the film he hears the screaming of a woman and goes to try and save her. Despite this never happening in real life(unless the person is someone you know/love) the fact that the only suspense in the film comes from this poor explanation, it taints the rest of the film.<br/><br/>So in the end, I can't recommend this to any real horror fan, or even people looking for a good film. Instead watch it if you're a fan of the stuff. If your favourite movies include Saw Wolf Creek, then Hostel may be the film for you. I found myself wanting to enjoy it, but simply couldn't. I'll have to wait and see what Roth can deliver to us later, then maybe he can earn his horror title."

","I'm not fond of this kind of movies. A movie, with sex and gore as the main theme, definitely not my favorite kind of movie.

If you're talking about ""don't talk to stranger"", it's a kid talk. It's not a morale anymore. <br/><br/>Hostel, at one side just show us how a bunch of kids like to j**k off and have sex, while the other side, just a bunch of people who are hungry for gore, and torture's show. <br/><br/>What happened when the both side met?

"heavybloozer","5","1","2","16 July 2007"," Roth did everything right-----------almost......
","Hostel is awesome-------but why have i given it ""only"" 7 stars. Well,let me go into detail. The idea for Hostel(perverted people pay to torture and kill helpless victims in a giant factory)is interesting and while pessimists thought that director Eli Roth would be tamed by the studio he spares none of his actors and leads the viewer into a no holes barred violence freak out. To all those with a weak stomach or the light hearted ones-don't watch Hostel cause it gets gross and downright sadistic and violent. Roth shows everything and has some pretty evil ideas-----which obviously makes him (together with Alexandre Aja) one of the greatest hopes for genre that many already laid to rest. But what breaks the films' neck is its first hour: While Roth concludes with a very strong final and very impressive last 45 minutes the epilogue and the establishment of the characters is too flat and also quite boring. It's not as atmospheric as it could be and the dialogue fails to be memorable. Acting (except the villains) is quite low and you don't feel any sympathy for the characters. Films like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which gets quoted in one of the final torture scenes) have shown that even young actors can be impressive and convincing. But when the normal acting stops and the main characters are nuthin more than meat that can be tortured Roth is in his element again-and the last 45 minutes are what saves ""Hostel"" it's 7 stars rating. ""Hostel 2"" got rid of all this flaws but for the horror fan the first Hostel installment is well worth the time if he can look over the weak beginning."

","A group of young and, quite frankly, rather moronic guys go to Amsterdam to do the only thing (as the cliché goes) that guys like them would and will do there. They're told they can get the exact same thing, only cheaper, in some lost-in-time country where girls are extremely hot and nymphomaniac and, WHY OF COURSE, they go there. They are more than welcomed by a couple of stunning chicks and we get to spot a few perfect and serviceable female bodies in the nude. Once, twice and so forth, you know, because... Because. If you like girls, take a look, you know. And go visit.<br/><br/>But alas life is cruel. It turns out paradise ain't paradise after all and the girls are evil scouts for an evil organisation where guys are kidnapped, tortured, mutilated and ultimately killed. You see one or two stomach-churning scenes which are okay. Yes, it sounds remotely exciting. Yes, the film actually has its moments and is overall amusing. But it's mainly more ridiculous than scary, which is very disappointing because it's gone great lenghts to prove its gory & ideological seriousness (the Evil Bar with the commie memorabilia was a riot, and the same can be said about the vegan vs. meat-eater standpoint).<br/><br/>The idea was good: post-communist countries set up as amusement parks for unscrupulous, hypocritical and nihilistic capitalists, engulfed by an unsatisfactory and numbing life where freedom takes its toll, who may buy female companionship and other forms of ""extreme entertainment"" and thus feel powerful again. That's happening, minus gory exaggerations. However, a good idea is quickly ruined. The film takes the easy way out: sex, gore and pure entertainment. Which is NICE, but it doesn't even excel in that department. Characters are unsympathetic (it might even be said that the psycho old guy they meet on the train is the only one that showed some real depth), storyline is badly told, the film runs out of ideas often and wastes precious time and as for the shocking scene, I couldn't care less about the guy who's suffering it and shock is alleviated by indifference.<br/><br/>Yet another lost chance."
"rixrex","Null","1","2","26 May 2007"," Not exceptional, but better than average, with an homage to original TCM
","I recently saw the unrated DVD version, and the main difference seems to be that the DVD has an excessive use of the F word, which is rather distracting and unnecessary. Generally this is just as good as Cabin Fever, Roth's initial film, and very similar in style, not subject. The nice thing about Roth's films is the time he spends with what seem fairly ordinary or mundane activities of the characters, behaving in mostly superficial fashion, but there is actually more to this behavior within the development of the plot. For one thing, these mundane activities are later shown to be paramount to the scenes of horror that are to come. Also, they allow the characters to behave as most people actually do, which is to maintain a fairly superficial persona except amongst the closest of friends and family, until in here when faced with their impending death. The sex in the film is always non-personal, and this is a precursor for the murder-club. Within this framework is a horror film that is grisly and gory enough to satisfy most of the gore-fans who don't care about plot, though obviously not all judging from the comments stating that the film took too long to get to the scenes of terror. This is actually a nice combination of American styled horror films and European Giallo terror, just as Cabin Fever was, and has a satisfying revenge-type ending. I will not divulge the 1973 Texas Chainsaw Massacre homage, but it will be obvious to those who know the original TCM and is quite enjoyable."

","""Hostel"" is definitely not a film for everyone. With intense depictions of torture and camera shots that force the viewer to observe every gory detail, ""Hostel"" pushes the R rating to its limit. <br/><br/>Produced by Quentin Tarantino and written and directed by new comer Eli Roth, this film gives the horror movie genre a wake up call that it desperately needed.<br/><br/>The film begins with three friends Paxton (Jay Hernandez) Josh (Derek Richardson) and their new found friend Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) who are backpacking through Europe. Paxton is the typical college guy who encourages all of the bad behavior that they participate in. Josh on the other hand is the shy type and has to be forced to do anything. Then there is the laid back Icelander Oli who Josh and Paxton met on their travels and has now joined their group.<br/><br/>Of course they partake in the activities of drug use and other debauchery that characters in horror movies usually do, but what they are really looking for are beautiful women. This is when the three bump into a local in Amsterdam who tells them of a secret hostel in Slovakia where the most gorgeous women are located. <br/><br/>Unable to resist, the three jump on the next train to Slovakia. At the hostel things start to take turn for the worse when after the first night Oli is missing. After worrying a bit Paxton and Josh brush it off and decide to continue partying with the girls they have met. Naturally the next morning Josh cannot be found. Paxton then becomes desperate to find his missing friends. Interrogating the girls they were with Paxton is lead to a place where people are violently tortured as a way of fulfilling people's fantasies and reaching a new emotional rush. <br/><br/>The horror movie genre has become extremely formulaic recently with movies that are either remakes of older films or use every cliché possible. Fortunately Roth being a fan of horror movies knows what has become tiresome and tries breaks away from the sameness that has corrupted the genre. Although he does resort to using characters that are the typical young rule breakers, they are given some characterization that allows the viewer to feel sympathy for their situation. Not to mention when the characters do something that might seem stupid, he gives ample reason for their actions.<br/><br/>What Roth does well is he understands exactly how to build tension throughout the film. Recent horror films have relied on the use of quick cuts and cheap scares in order to frighten the viewer. Roth though utilizes the atmosphere of the scene by using close up shots that allude to the painful acts that will soon occur. Do not worry though because when those acts do occur the camera does not switch over to something else. Roth instead decides to show the whole gruesome act. This gives the film an intensity that other horror films have begun to lack.<br/><br/>Realism is a key element that Roth emphasizes throughout the film. The premise for the movie originated when Roth stumbled upon a website that said one could kill someone for $10,000. Thus the movie advertised that it was based on true events. Here he uses ordinary people in a plausible situation in order to cause fear. This strays away from the typical plot of an un-killable monster or a ghost that has been overdone.<br/><br/>""Hostel"" is a horror movie that is not only new but refreshing due to its original story and strong direction from Eli Roth. Be warned though that this movie is fairly intense at times, but any fan of the genre will appreciate this fresh approach to horror film making."

","When asking about ""Hostel"", several persons suggested i shouldn't waste time/money on it. When some friends bought it, i asked whether i could borrow it. About 120(minutes)of watching, i realized why others thought it was a waste. There wasn't enough there to complete the horror experience, this movie could've been, that horror-movie-goers paid admissions to see. However, ""Hostel"" should've earned much more appreciation than what people were giving it. The center idea around the movie was probably to be sickening, with its gruesome torture, and literally shock you, in this ""Hostel"" highly succeeded, keeping me looking over my shoulder at times throughout the night. The whole of the movie is not nessecarly based on torture though, accutaly its more of a pornographic movie, focusing 3/4 of the movie on the hawt women, which was disappointing, when you're expecting scares, rather than orgasms. The language barrier between the Americans, Germans, Iceland, Etc. is another positive remark ""Hostel"" offers, leaving movie-goers to focus on expressions/emotion to understand the basics of what someone is saying. The characters were fantastic, except there wasn't enough sympathy, so while their being tortured you'll not be saddened by the character, but by the disturbing methods used to torture. Sets/Props were always believable, while sets never left you questioning. Overall, an exhilarating experience, that'll leave horror fans craving more! 7.5/10"

These are great films in the horror/thriller genre but recently Saw re-wrote the formula, with the ambiguous motives until finally revealed in the last few minutes, then topped with the franchise twist. Turistas and Hostel are the byproducts of this new formula and have exploited it to the point where even the new Saw seems a little overplayed. <br/><br/>I too was foolish to think that this film would be at least original since it had the Quentin stamp of approval, but I guess he just loves picking up the checks or maybe the copy that I watched was totally different than the one he thought he was putting his name on...that must be it because this film is straight up garbage."

","Admittedly, I was deceptively seduced by this film's trailer and movie poster into believing that this film would cross the threshold into uncharted territory of the horror genre. OK, OK, I know. That's the desired effect the movie makers hope to accomplish with those two vehicles. However, the disturbingly haunting advertisements were so reminiscent of dark films such as The Shining, The Exorcist, and even The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (all three breaking new ground in cinematic horror), that I took the bait. Unfortunately, as is all too often the case, I was disappointed. When will I learn my lesson? What worked for me: I found the premise that wealthy perverts pay Slovakian mobsters big bucks to torture and murder kidnapped tourists to be quite chillingly possible, just as films like Hardcore and 8mm exposed the feasibility of ""snuff"" films. I must also confess that I found the blatantly gratuitous lovemaking scene extremely hypnotic. Two beautiful and quite nude Slovakian ladies writhing to The Sneaker Pimp's ""How Do"" playing in the background was intoxicating. Please forgive the male hetero dog in me.<br/><br/>What didn't work for me: the director, Eli Roth, failed in his obvious attempt to assault me with an ""over-the-top"" sado-sexual exploitation film. Sure, there were a couple times when I winced and said ""Yuck!"" (such as when a victim's eyeball is torn from its socket and left dangling whilst she screams), but at no time did this film remotely deliver the fear it promised. Even the violence was an overall shock-less ""blah."" Character development was so non-existent that I felt not a smidgen of sympathy for the protagonists. Roth would have had better luck if this film had been geared towards a public health message warning ""keep it in your pants and don't sleep around or you might have your fingers cut off and your eyeballs ripped out of your head"", as the two protagonists come off as a couple horny imbeciles looking to score on anything female, awake or passed out. The ending was not only inconceivably unrealistic, but I found myself shaking my head in disbelief at such a botched attempt at irony. The only irony I enjoyed was reading the film's tag line: ""Welcome to your worst nightmare"" as I left the theater. There was no art here, only the greedy intent to capitalize on violence looking for their next fix. I enjoyed Cabin Fever more than this film, and I hated Cabin Fever.<br/><br/>I'll leave you with this: if ""I Spit On Your Grave"" floated your boat, then you'll probably see this film as a masterpiece, and if you do, I have two words for you: Get Help!"

","Of all the movies I've seen this year, ""Hostel"" is second only to ""Date Movie"" as the worst movie of 2006. Hostel might have come in as the third worst movie had I actually went to see ""Little Man"", but who in their right mind would actually pay money to see that movie? . Anyways, back to Hostel. I saw Quentin Tarantino's name on it as the promoter for the film, and the ads for the movie looked slightly promising, so off to the movies I went. At least the popcorn was good...<br/><br/>So, first grievance: about fifteen minutes into the movie I get a general feel for the characters: I hate them and can't wait for them to get killed. I'm honestly not sure if it was intentional or not, but the characters come off as some of the most unlikable people I've ever seen in a movie. I've seen movies, plenty of movies, where I just plain did not care about the characters because they weren't developed properly or I just found them extremely uninteresting. But these characters...God, what the hell? <br/><br/>Second grievance: I guess this is supposedly based on true occurings, but could they have at least gone the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" route? For those of you who don't know, the actual events had almost nothing to do with the events of the movie. ""Hostel"" should have just used the basic premise and done something, I don't know, Interesting, with it. Instead the story is extremely run-of-the-mill. A bunch of horny stoner teens want to get laid by whores, so they make a trip to a Hostel and HEY! THEY GET LAID! But oh no! Bad things start happening, one of their buddies is missing! There's a message that he left but, hmmmm, that's strange, isn't it? Oops! He's dead! Blah blah blah, they start getting tortured and killed one by one, until only one of the unlikable characters is left alive. Bleh, the end. Not a single shred of originality is exhibited by this film, not even any neat camera tricks or anything to keep someone at least slightly entertained.<br/><br/>Third Grievance: When I became aware of the insanely lackluster plot and unlikable characters I also noticed something else. It seems as if, when coming up with the concept for this film, someone said ""Hey! Let's just make it really gory! Then it won't matter how lame and predictable the plot is!"" I like gory movies but...the gore in this movie even seem uninspired. There's no technique or anything applied to the way the gore scenes are shot to make them seem more disturbing, they're just...""hey look, a guy getting hacked up, be disturbed"". It's hard to explain, but I think big horror fans should get what I mean. You have to do more than just show something happening to get an effect from it.<br/><br/>So yeah, my conclusion, this was definitely a turd.<br/><br/>P.S. Anyone who saw this movie and writes a negative review saying that it was bad because it ""disturbed them"" is an idiot, considering that's the ENTIRE POINT OF A HORROR MOVIE: TO HORRIFY.

","I went into ""Hostel"" thinking it would be similar to ""Saw"", but I was severely disappointed. This movie makes Saw look like the greatest film ever made. The characters had no personality and I honestly felt nothing for them. The plot was so simple it barely existed, and it contained a lot of questionable turns (going back for the Japanese girl? WHY??). Eli Roth is clearly out of his element when it comes to crafting an interesting story line and characters. All he is good at is coming up with scenes of senseless and unnecessary gore (cutting the eye? A point to that?).<br/><br/>I love all of Quentin Tarantino's movies, which is another reason I was so surprised at this. I can't figure out why such a brilliant filmmaker would attach his name to this piece of garbage.<br/><br/>That's what this movie is: really disgusting garbage. In fact, staring at a pile of garbage would probably be more entertaining/interesting.<br/><br/>The 2 stars I gave are generous. Extremely generous."
"Michael Kenmore","5","1","2","29 October 2006"," Mediocre blood & guts horror film as a treatise on nihilistic amorality
","(Minor spoiler ahead, but nothing crucial)<br/><br/>I consider myself a jaded horror movie fan who is seldomly surprised anymore. It is my contention that the atmosphere and tight editing make an intensive visceral horror experience. That fact is pretty much non-existent nowadays with the insipidly self-important & almost maladjusted ""Splat Pack"" relying on the pure spectacle of blood and guts to inspire revulsion and absolute disgust rather than go the route of psychological horror that actually inspire fear and terror.<br/><br/>Hostel almost made the cut (pardon the expression), but it did not impress me that much. The first one-third of the movie is a borderline sex comedy with gratuitous nudity which irritates me a bit. After that it went into the horror show that feels almost as authentic but even after the creepy & grimly lit atmosphere is established it nonetheless fails to scare the bejesus out of me as Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween (the originals) did. Over-reliance on gallons of blood and guts is overreacting in vain attempt to inspire genuine terror, but I make one exception which I will explain in detail.<br/><br/>For the record, I saw Alexandre Aja's Haute Tension at Sundance Film Festival in 2004 and it was so over the top in pointless gorefest and outrageously idiotic plot twist that I ended up loathing the movie. I dismiss Alexandre Aja as a hack French filmmaker who can't write good sh*t.<br/><br/>On the contrary, Eli Roth did a fairly good job establishing the atmosphere that is borderline creepy with vile evil with the introduction of the fresh concept based on, with a sad note, true events. Somewhere on Earth there exist evil that some conscience-less people indulge in perpetrating inhumane acts against the innocent human beings.<br/><br/>We know the historical facts on the atrocious likes of the CIA, Israel-Mossad, Spanish conquest of the Americas, Torquemada-Inquisition, Josef Stalin, Idi Amin Dada, Saddam Hussein, pre-Revolutionary Iran SAVAK and WWII-era Japanese Imperial military that utilize torture, rape & murder to the extreme. Only that such people actually pay the lucrative price for the opportunity to commit torture and murder of innocent human victims.<br/><br/>If that is true, it is a commentary on the inhumanity of humankind that under the circumstance of absent conscience (psychological & mental) and law even the meek & timid would be given the freedom to do what one wish would do to another human victim, perhaps in revenge for the perpetrator's personal failures in life attributed to societal and academic rejection. Or just partake in the endorphin rush of killing a victim to feel the surge of pleasure in the organic function of the perpetrator's brain (theoretically this is common with serial killers who keep doing it for the rush).<br/><br/>Hostel serves as the exposition of this evil that the audience have not been aware of, and here belies the real horror that even the thought of someone paying the underground business to become personally involved in the pleasure of indulging the grisly homicide of a wrongfully imprisoned victim without interference is revolting to the nth degree.<br/><br/>Yet this underground criminality seems like a no-brainer to make the ill-gotten profits arising from utter amorality on the dual side of business runners who abduct to imprison and clients who can afford the price of executing victims for the fun of it, just as the post-WWII United States foreign policy dictates profit and power above liberty and respect for human life, especially the current situation in the Middle East and Central Asia. Nothing is sacred and out of bounds, it seems, especially when it comes to maiming and killing 'average' humans for convenience and profiteering sanctioned and afforded by the Elite.<br/><br/>The infamous French novelist, playwright & philosopher of Nihilism the Marquis de Sade had it right in perspective when he wrote on the natural impulse of barbaric cruelty to satisfy the inherently maladjusted human psychology free of the confines of law and conduct: ""Never lose sight of the fact that all human felicity lies in man's imagination, and that he cannot think to attain it unless he heeds all his caprices. The most fortunate of persons is he who has the most means to satisfy his vagaries."" So that concludes my mini-thesis on the film's main point.<br/><br/>Besides the point laid out above, the film isn't scary in the remotest. I am very jaded and was not pleased with the film's nauseating wave of gory violence and non-stop F-bombs that dilutes the tension of 'living the horror of the dingy dungeon' imagined from the terrified victim's perspective. I liked the revenge exacted in the end, because it justifies doing inhumane act to truly inhumane monsters who walk freely in broad daylight after concluding their amusements of depravity.<br/><br/>That's exactly what I would do to one another who is proved beyond reasonable doubt that have committed unspeakable acts and which I would do equally horrible things to in order to avenge the victim(s).<br/><br/>** 1/2 out of four"

","Watching Hostel has been one of the worst mistakes in my life.When it starts and you see ""Quentin Tarantino product"", you think that it might be a surprise and you could have a good time, but you realize that Tarantino's name is the way to sell a film that has nothing interesting to show.<br/><br/>The film starts with three stupid guys in Holland that decide to go to Bratislava. During their voyage they meet a man in the train with a curious behavior. Has anybody realized that it is a copy of some of the scenes in the humor movie ""Eurotrip"".<br/><br/>Then we arrive to Bratislava, and there Is when is when you find that you're watching a stupid film. The city that appears in the film is not real. Bratislava is a fabulous city full of tourists. However we find a city where there is nobody in the streets, where children kill people if they're given chewing gums, where the police is blind... Sorry for mister Roth, but if he doesn't know anything about Bratislava, or even Europe, he should not imagine a city following the American imaginative ideas of Europe. PLEASE, INVESTIGATE A LITTLE BIT.<br/><br/>So finally, when you think that the action has begun and that it may interest you, you see some stupid gore images as the one when the killer falls and cuts himself, or when the main character decides to come back after being free, to save a girl by cutting his eye.<br/><br/>To sum up, I must say that nowadays, directors have decided to show blood and stupid characters, instead of making a well written script that could have made this film an much better one"

It is really astounding how unbelievably all the cultural ignorance in Hostel is meant literally (as opposed to humorously in Eurotrip) In my opinion this should have been a straight to video production most likely successful in your average Midwest redneck towns.

This is not because the movie is set in Slowakia. It's because he wants us to believe the crude facts presented are common in that country and everybody living there is somehow or other involved in the unspeakable.<br/><br/>In a way this crude and ignorant superficiality is laughable, in another it's not. Especially knowing that Slowakia is a country filled with normal and mostly very kind people rather on the poorish side who can use the extra income from tourists."

I'm really scared in which way can show we Italian in the second episode he's about to shot just in Italy. Beware to yourself, Roth! What else? The players are very bad.

","I've read many of the comments on this page and everyone seems to be complaining about the sex aspect of the film...

The site of so many boobs ultimately was the only thing that made the film worthwhile in my view... The story line was of course interesting but implausible... The wholesale disappearances of teen backpackers in Europe would raise a few eyebrows would it not? And the whole town seems to be in on this murder for pay scheme... That building must have had 12 rooms at least with people being tortured... if that does add up to 12 people a day... that's 4,272 teenagers murdered in one town a year!!! And if the Yanks are going for $25,000.00 a pop... this is a big money business! Ultimately the film was not scary... at no point in the movie did my heart start to pound... did I feel fear for my own safety etc etc... at times I felt a little sick to the stomach because the film is filled with gore and I did feel a little happiness when a few of the bad guys got their just desserts in the end... especially the annoying Dutchman... But at no point in the entire movie was I ever scared... so much for the scariest movie of the decade! In short I am very disappointed with Eli Roth... Cabin Fever was a pile of putrid nonsense and Hostel was only marginally better... I would suggest that the studios stop giving this man money and also filming greats like Tarantino should be very wary of endorsing Roth's work...<br/><br/>I look forward to Hostel 2, although I do not look forward with parting with my hard earned money to watch it...

","For the most depraved movie of 2005 category at an awards ceremony, Hostel would hands down be a winner.<br/><br/>Now obviously the whole shock value of the movie is what the Director Eli Roth was going for. And he did it well. The acting was good if not great and there were times that you believe the actors are in pain, as in, some scenes where the actors was physically sick, I actually felt a little queasy inside. There are some movies which just shouldn't be made and left in script form only and Hostel would definitely be one of them The amount of gore in the film was surprisingly less that what I was initially expecting, and while the last hour of the film is definitely fast paced, there are some ""breather"" moments where the gore is out, and just more thrilling action is in.<br/><br/>The sad fact of the matter, is that there are most likely countries or people out there who would love to pay to murder another human being. In countries where life is cheap then this movie makes it out to be easier to do than buying a loaf of bread.<br/><br/>The whole time I was watching this movie I kept thinking, ""Turn it off, TURN THE MOVIE OFF!!!"" but for some reason I could not turn away, and credit to the movie crew for doing that. I like a horror movie as much as the next guy, but there are just some lines that shouldn't be crossed. ""Wolf Creek"", brilliant movie, but crossed a line, as did Hostel.<br/><br/>Beware of attractive foreign woman who want to sleep with you is one of the messages I got from this film. The drug happy chicks in this film are a scary bunch as are the killers themselves. As a previous comment mentioned the amount of sex and nudity in the film, I will have to agree that it was a little overdone, although many European countries do talk freely about sex and are quite happy to walk around naked.<br/><br/>If you have any shred of human decency left, you will not watch this film."

I mean, we don't even give a sh** if the guys die because you seriously know nothing about it besides their sex cravings. The first entire half was this one word: sex, sex, and MORE SEX. Actually, make that boobs. This is more like a porn movie instead. Come on, Oli is ****ing some broad in her ass in a club, then some sex house in Amsterdam or whatever! It's either Eli Roth is just a retard who's obsessed with sex and has nothing better to do or he's too stupid to direct any movie at all. Shockingly, even Cabin Fever was much better than this.<br/><br/>Now, I can't blame everything in this movie. The setting and props were amazing and very eye-catching. Rusted chairs and torture instruments were set out pretty good. All that vomit gave you an extra touch of disgust. What disgusted me was when Josh's ankle was cut off in order for him to ""escape"". It showed really good detail and realism. One last thing that amazed me only for a few seconds was the suicide of Kana. The expressions after seeing her gruesome face showed how much sorrow she felt.<br/><br/>The thing is, there was nothing in this movie that made your mouths open wide and leave with shock. Just obvious conclusions and a thought of ""THIS WAS A PIECE OF SH**!"" I best off say, don't rent this movie. Especially if you don't like torture and violence. The torture wasn't that heavy, but if you haven't noticed all of it was basically shown on Yahoo. If you have high expectations for this movie, like I did beforehand, then watch it.

He is owns a murder-for-money business or as I call it Pay n' Slay. Forget about the other two and focus on Paxton and his astonishing ability to halt massive blood loss. He gets a few fingers chain sawed of before the customer slips on the blood and chainsaws him self.

Well written and acted. It's a shocking ride. If you are expecting Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, why? Because somebody mentioned QT's name? Forget it. This is a different movie and certainly NOT trying to be like any other. Many people didn't seem to understand the soft porn galore, but the movie takes place in Amsterdam. Prostitutes REALLY DO advertise by dancing in glass windows along the street and absolutely anything goes. It's for real. Roth didn't invent this stuff he's bringing you in on the real deal. We are in Amsterdam folks. It sets up the premise for the rest of the movie... that... money can get you whatever you desire... and be careful what you wish for.

Especially when you combine this film with the endorsement he gave ""Wolf Creek"", which almost everyone seems to have despised.<br/><br/>Now, this film was presented as a gore film. It was not a gore film. There was gore, but if you watch movies like ""Saw"" and ""Saw II"" and expect this to be on the level, you'll be let down. You might have heard a certain scene was intense. But you were probably lied to, because most of the violence seems so fake. I don't know what dangling eyeballs look like, or what it's like to get run over by a car traveling five miles per hour. But I don't think it looks like this.<br/><br/>Also, you might have been told it's a film about a place where you pay to hurt people. Yes, that's in this movie. But only for about twenty minutes. The first half hour (time it on your watch if you doubt me) is just a variety of sex scenes and naked women. I like naked women, but I have no idea what any of it had to do with making a horror film.<br/><br/>It wasn't an entire waste. The idea was decent and some of the characters were interesting. The American client is cool, the Dutch businessman is creepy and there's a surprise cameo by Takashi Miike (the director of several Asian horror films which have been banned for excessive disgustingness).<br/><br/>I guess you may as well see it if you wanted to, but there are other films I'd recommend first.

When the guy escapes the compound he is at in a car, where all sorts of illegal medical operations take place, and sees the people who sent him there, he mows them down in such glorious fashion that it made me clap, smile and laugh.

What is shown here, must have been a shock for the American rating board! But after all this fun, the violence starts to kick in. Now it might not have been that explicit, but that wasn't the point. Although I'm pretty sure, that for some people it wasn't violent enough and for others it was too violent. But you can't please everyone.<br/><br/>And it's not only about what is shown (and there is quite a bit of gore to see here), but you caring about the characters. I've heard that people said that the main characters where not sympathetic, but I beg to differ. You've got a cool gut, shy guy and a ""crazy"" guy in the group, so Eli Roth (director) has good variety of guys thrown in the mix. And I did care for them. In fact it might be that I cared too much.<br/><br/>One thing is for sure: I'll never see East European Girls like I saw them before. ;o) Seriously though: If you don't have a problem with (female) nudity and violence, than this can be a pretty cool fun ride!

","In the same vein as gritty horror films such as Seven and Saw, Hostel is less challenging but more believable. In an interview I saw with Eli Roth, the writer and director, he explained that his passion in film making was rooted in horror films of the 70's and 80's. Anyone who's seen Cabin Fever will know what type of films Eli Roth has set out to make. By setting out to scare the pants off viewers, Eli Roth has created a film that is not pretentious or proud of itself, it's just a really scary, well executed story. Whereas Cabin Fever contains the energy and enthusiasm of someone new to feature length film making, Hostel is a more polished example of what is essentially a shockingly graphic horror film.

","Hostel seemed almost pointless in the beginning, and the transition from basically porn to the torture portion was abrupt and slightly awkward. Though it was gory, especially the torch and Kana's eye, when finished I couldn't really determine any plot to the movie. Kinda like a snuff film, without the sex. If you still want gore but want a little plot-line and character development to go along with it, as well as a twist thats true to the horror/thriller genre, definitely check out either of the ""Saw"" films. In my opinion, much more fulfilling. However if your ultimate goal is to simply to be disgusted and entertained, then this movie is definitely for you."

","I am a huge fan of Tarrantino, his work has always been daring and different. Starting in Amsterdam two young lads on a college break decide to travel Europe. They meet another traveller and whilst on a train journey they strike up a conversation with a seemingly normal man about a place in Russia where you can have the woman of your dreams its a Hostel (Obviously!!) They arrive and there are many nubile, barely dressed young hotties, to attend to their every whim and fantasy. Obviously, men being men, do not think to themselves ""Hang on a minute, somethings not quite right here"" they just get down and dirrrrrty!! There is quite a lot of sex shown in the beginning, I felt this was necessary to the plot line, as it showed how they could so easily be led by these harlots. One of the group, the extra traveller, goes missing, (no need for too much alert as he is a traveller so one would assume he went off ........erm....travelling)Then another, leaving a very dishy young man (whose name escapes me but the dark haired one)To try and find him. anyway it turns out, that one of the Russian Strumpets has set them all up, she has been trafficking Travellers to an abandoned warehouse where rich, sick Mo Fo's Kill their prey in any way they like. It's gory but not over the top there is more gore seen on an episode of Casualty! And I feel again, it was necessary to the plot as you really did feel what these poor blokes went through. The only problem I had with the film was the ending. Our dark haired hero manages to escape, but goes back in?!? To save a young Japanese girl who has her eye badly mutilated by a sick American. Thats not what I have the problem with. He saves her, risking his neck and when they are trying to sneak onto a train without the Nasties seeing them she catches a glimpse of her eye socket and throws herself under a train!! A) How Vain - I would be made up that I was still alive and B.) How selfish - He risked his life, what a waste of time. Anyway he gets away (although it's not sure he will) and who does he happen to see on the train home? Yep thats right the nasty buggar who set them all up in the first place, the Dude on the train! What a huge coincidence Hah? Overall the film was well made, well scripted and well performed by all the cast, many of whom I had never seen in my film obsessed life. There are a few drug taking moments,Cannabis and Ectasy, but it is not a major occurrence but again necessary to the plot, they are in Amsterdam & Europe after all,it's takes place on a day to day basis. Recommended, but don't let it fool you us European girls aren't all that loose.....Oh who am I kidding. Ha Ha<br/><br/>Rating 7/10 thumbs up Quentin."

","I was drawn to this film with low expectations, as I have been for the last several years with horror. Understanding that this was to be a shock and gore fest, and not a revolutionary new horror film, I was not disappointed. Honestly, I was delightfully surprised. Some felt that it took all the old cliché's and ruined them. I think they've forgotten that these old cliché's of teenagers backpacking, through the US, Europe, Australia, or where ever. These groups of people traveling and running into some type of horrific terror has the most probable suspension of disbelief. That is to say ""Could this actually happen?"" With Hostel, that's a resounding yes, this is something that really and actually happen. Whereas some movies end and the viewer says to themselves, ""Yeah, right, that isn't even possible."" Hostel can leave one asking what they might don in this same situation. I felt that all of the T & A added to the story, and I'm all in favor of any movie with that much T & A.<br/><br/>To simplify, when it comes to Horror, ask yourself, next time you watch a horror movie, could this really happen? and if your answer is yes, then you know the movie scored."

"Artistic_Differences","8","1","2","11 April 2006"," Okay Movie, Excellent Premise
","What you see in the screen when concerning Eli Roth's newest project, Hostel, is okay although not excellent. This movie, like any other, has its ups and downs; the ride was dark, curious and definitely entertaining, and it displayed a nihilistic view through not entirely unsympathetic characters. While watching it, especially after the first admittedly fun half hour, I found myself thinking it quirky, but not exactly a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It was once the movie was over, though, that I got to think. And it was thinking about the premise, about the truly dark, sinister and yet perfectly realistic theme. About the subtext which, maybe, I didn't catch the first look through, but which definitely was present when viewing it later. And you might not want to see it, but once you have a deep thought on it, this gory, at times comedic film becomes something entirely different  and by all means effective  which haunted me days after I realized so.<br/><br/>If you're willing to give this movie a second thought, and actually glance at its true motives, it becomes *terrifying*. The classic formula of sex and gore really disguises the dark message, but it's there  and it's true. Very, very true.<br/><br/>Relating to the plot, this time's excuse moves on as we follow three colourful, happy characters who present a clear and radical contrast with the flick's dark setup. This movie tricks and truly plays with the viewer by making them believe exactly the opposite of what truly is going on as our joyful, enthusiastic heroes meet abrupt ends at the hands of antagonists who are gruesomely mentally perturbed, and yet extremely realistic.<br/><br/>Through the first half hour, the characters are introduced as basic stereotypes, but while one of them doesn't live enough to be properly developed, you do get to feel for them as they crave escaping from their torturers. At one point, one character (one I was particularly empathic with) is given a predictably false chance to escape, but the short sequence where he crawls for the exit of the room where he's being held captive is so intense, you can practically feel the fake pain. A friend I went to the cinema with started whimpering at this point, eyes shut as the character met a particularly grisly end.<br/><br/>It's true, maybe, that this movie takes its time to get to the real 'meat and potatoes'. But nothing, and by that I mean literally _nothing_, happens without a plausible and unquestionable explanation  and reason  to back it up later in the movie.<br/><br/>So I'm all for people giving this little movie a chance. Hostel is twisty, disturbing, and freaky  you have to give it that."

","When I see movies like Hostel, it makes me sad for the state of the so-called ""horror"" genre these days. Hostel is far from ""the most terrifying movie of the last 10 years"", as it has been billed. All it actually is is the two things that get young males going - nudity (for the first 50 minutes of the film) and the pointless violence (for the last 40).<br/><br/>The fact that this film even got made speaks volumes about Lion's Gate Studios. The film does not even get properly started for about 50 minutes, the majority of which plays like a bad soft-core porn flick. After that, we get to the ""Hostel"" of the title. The only problem is that the characters are so poorly developed and frankly, unlikable, that you don't really care about what is happening to them.<br/><br/>The second half of the film is just a mass of gratuitous human torture scenes with absolutely no point in any of it. The violent street children seem like a pointless exercise in trying to comment on the situation of the world today and it fails.<br/><br/>In fact everything about this movie fails spectacularly. It's not erotic. It's not scary. It doesn't have anything intelligent to say about the world (contrary to what other people have tried to claim). Overall, I would seriously suggest you avoid this video nasty. I would rate it at less than 1 star, but the site won't let me."

","I went to see this film with a couple of friends yesterday and I have to say I didn't really liked it, in fact I can't understand how people could like it. First of all this film creates a very wrong image of Europe and Europeans. The storyline is simplistic and the only thing that isn't predictable is how disgusting the next scene is going to be. It is also very unrealistic, many aspects just don't make sense (you won't run back into a horrible place after you escaped from it just because someone is screaming, would you.) Except for Jan Vlasák the acting was awfully weak, especially by the two Amererican lead actors (although they only have to be high or run around screaming.). I think director Eli Roth isn't really talented because the only thing he is able of is creating a claustrophobic atmosphere during the torture scenes. But I have to say that Nathan Barr his soundtrack was pretty good. And the film does show the darker side of the human being, but they could have done that with some good dialog and a little bit of gore and not the other way around, because now they kinda lost their believability. I only recommend this film to people who enjoy excessive gore and really don't care about an intelligent story."

","Let's see: This movie has no suspense. The story is bad. The performances are amateurs and laughable. The movie plays like a SAW wanna-be in some parts. The message? There is a message, but it's obvious that its delivery was the lesser of the intentions for the filmmakers. As it is hinted, it does not justify the movie. So what are we left with? Well, of course, with the ""visual impact"", the thing that this movie is getting famous for. But since we are so concentrated in THAT, we expect a lot from THAT. And guess what? The gore is handled with so little style and impact, leaving well evident the intention of the filmmakers of producing shock, that it doesn't work either. It would have helped a little that the actors playing the victims could act more convincing during the torture scenes. But their performances are so laughable, that we lose any sympathy for them, and just wish for the torturer to finish them right away. It's ironic that this movie is in some way related to Quentin Tarantino, since he has made graphic violence and gore something with style in his movies. But that's exactly what we miss here: in the hands of another director, it may have been a better product. As it is, it's a very good movie...for the 15 year old crowd.

The simplicity and subtle brutality of the lone figure cleaning one (of many it turns out) of the torture rooms whilst whistling nonchalantly is a vivid and unsettling opening to a movie. The ""Whistle while you work"" sub-text within the scene is also very clever.<br/><br/>From there the film takes the viewer on varying journeys. From drug-fuelled sex-a-thons in Amsterdam to a well deserving revenge in a railway toilet via un-deniably horrific scenes of torture.<br/><br/>All in all I was impressed with the film as a whole but was left with the feeling that it could of been so much more.<br/><br/>On a final note was it me or does that eye makeup on the Japenese Girl look just like the make up used in the Horror/Comedy April Fools Day?

","It must have been a curiosity  related to my Slovakian motherland which prompted me to screen ""Hostel"" in cinema after Slovakia  the country in the heart of Europe popped up in previews and reviews.<br/><br/>The horror seemed to be executed quite well when considering ""a fragmented structure and explicit violence"" (Courtesy of MS Encarta ®) are the hallmarks of the master director: Quentin Tarantino. <br/><br/>I don't think the movie's can be branded an A movie or place itself among Top 10 though. Although the storyline is that of credible real life situation with exception of upbeat action-hero-up-for-justice style ending, it is the amount of violence and gore which all of a sudden bursts out in 2nd half of the movie; the very shocking & sickly images that drove away a few fellow cinema-goers.<br/><br/>While ""Hostel"" is not for the faint-hearted, people who liked ""Wrong Turn"", ""Saw"" or ""Creep"" and similarly creepy, flicks packed with human butchery will surely find it quite enjoyable. Paradox as it is, consider yourself lucky to find this sort of savagery confined only to silver-screen aimed to amuse in a weird way unlike real life victims e.g. somewhere in bagdad where psychopaths roam freele without inhibitions.<br/><br/>And perhaps this might be a reminder for young travellers: if something looks too good to be true, it most probably is. Feel safe to visit Slovakia or Czech republic  I insist on these places to be as safe and civilised nowadays as Spain, Britain or US. Few distortions in the local character can be found. Featured pop music originates in before year of 1990 and based on this fact you would be hard pressed to find such relic 50's style TV sets even in early 80's Czechoslovakia. Uniforms with the Slovak signs which the police force flashed several times appeared for the 1st time aftermath 1993, but that would mean not such communist models of cars only like those depicted in the movie. My judgement clearly says that the location for the train scenes and storyline in Slovakia movie itself was solely shot in Czech Republic even though the countries shared common past and places may look alike.<br/><br/>Well, this movie might be a refreshing addition to your horror collection once you've waited long (or rather short) enough to buy it cheaply in sales."

The first 25 minutes or so was like a cheap softcore porno, which ultimately led into a tenuous link whereby people were seduced/abducted and murdered in horrible ways.

Anyway... they get a tip off from some shifty looking guy to go to Slovakia.... by this point you're thinking ' i swear they said this was meant to be a horror film'.<br/><br/>On the train going towards Slovakia, they meet in a rather cliché manner the 'baddie' of the film, and you get given a piece of information that is completely useless up until when the 2nd guy gets killed ( i.e. nearly towards the end of the film). They get to a happy happy hostel where everyone is happily still taking drugs and still even more happily having cliché sex with random eastern Europeans... the sex fest carries on.... then one of the guys goes missing... Then another goes missing... but roth put a special little twist on this one... it looked like he was going to get away due to a change of heart of the baddie.... but it turns out his feet had been half cut off.... well.... there's a surprise and a half * yawns loudly* And then... surprise surprise... our hero appears... saved only by getting locked in a stock cupboard. Where the hell is the superman cape when you need one?! He tries to find his friends at the hostel, where there's a tiny little spin ( one of the only half clever things about this film) and then finds them in an alleged "" art show"" he gets taken to by one of the evil slut girls ( this is apparently the twist in the story....) and finds himself being subjected to the same torture his friends were subjected to.<br/><br/>.... he gets away because... get this... the butcher guy slips on Pax's blood, slips, and gets sawn to bits by a chainsaw. Then he gets away using what looks no more powerful than a golf cart, kills the shifty guy and the two girls, rescues another girl and BLAH BLAH BLAH.<br/><br/>Oh... and then he gets his own back on the baddie because he just so happened to be on the same train as him. Contradiction... he despises the actions of the bad guy ( and he said previously that he'd let girl die which haunted him for ages), yet he does the exact same thing to him? Fair play, but a bit more originality was needed!!!! I gave this film a 4/10 basically because the potential was there, but it was very badly executed because: a) the plot line was extremely confusing, with not enough emphasis on the REAL storyline ( who cares about people getting stoned and the red light district?.... to see a true glimpse of it, look no further than your own town!!) b) the start took up most of the film so nothing was developed thereafter c) The only SLIGHT sympathy was towards the knight in shining armour, and that was due to his character development that lasted roughly 30 seconds.<br/><br/>d) The way that Roth and Tarantino made all the little subtle clues link together to what really happened to the group of friends was good.... it just wasn't well developed and quite unrealistic in the way that he found exactly where they were just by talking to the two girls who were MIRACULOUSLY traceable.<br/><br/>And this film is one of the reasons why box offices are generally not doing well."

","I saw Cabin Fever. I hated it. I went to see Hostel not knowing it was an Eli Roth film, and the second that I saw his name on the screen, I KNEW it would be bad. I didn't know it was worse than Cabin Fever. Save for the eye-snipping scene, most of the horrible parts were shown in the trailer. The plot points were so ridiculously weak and ill-conceived. There was little driving force to the film, just lots of horrible drawn-out parts that replaced substance with nudity. Seriously, when a film has to distract me from its plot with naked chicks, it's pretty bad. And I have seen MANY MANY horror films- I KNOW that sex and nudity are very common. However, this movie wasn't trying to be a ""bad"" horror film (as in so bad it's good- and if it was, it missed by a long shot)- it was meant to be seriously disturbing. But I kept finding that instead of being led down the dark path, breasts were thrown in my face to ""confuse me"" or ""throw me off"", meaning to be a disruption to the tension but only served as a cheap ploy to show more mindless nudity. <br/><br/>OK, after the nudity (which, by the way, would have been just fine had the rest of the film been worthwhile AT ALL). I can't think of anything more predictable than the outline for this movie, of ""who is going to die next/when is that person/plot point going to resurface at JUST the right moment?"" I could make out basically every connection. That does not build a suspenseful film, other than the suspense built by the hope that the movie would somehow magically get better. Additionally, the driving force behind this concept was just idiotic. I liked how it sounded in the trailer, but once I learned of the whole scheme where an entire nation was supporting this gruesomeness, I had to laugh. And stop myself from getting sick all over the person next to me- not because I was horrified by the gore, but because I was horrified that Eli Roth was allowed to make another one of his movies, and that I was lured in by the ""Quentin Tarantino presents"" tag, which has now made me lose respect for Tarantino because he helped finance this atrocity.<br/><br/>If you are looking for suspense, horror, and mystery of any sort, do yourself a favour and rent something else. This film was so unimpressive that I can barely remember the ""scary"" elements after only a few months."

The first half does drag on a little bit, but it was far more enjoyable than the ridiculousness of the second half. I imagined that the first half was supposedly grounding us in the characters so that the later scenes were more emotive.

There were some yuck moments, but the idea of what was being done was far stronger than the dodgy effects they employed.

The final scene, pretty good where a chick is getting her eye slowly burned out by a blow torch and it's all melted away and she's screaming in agony. THAT'S what I thought that film would be throughout and unnerving like that scene was.<br/><br/>But it wasn't This film is hardly graphic, SAW II was way worse in terms of brutal graphic violence. The plot was lame, the acting was indeed terrible and the visuals were truly ungripping.<br/><br/>Not scary, not brutal, not explicit  at all"

","Well personally in my humble opinion, this film could have been produced on your local farm and the animals used as the acting cast.However i do see how certain viewers who just like bad acting, a few scenes of gore and mild pornography could like this picture...actually wait...no,i really can't see how anyone who has ever watched a decent film, or possesses any form of imagination would rate this movie anything more than a 3.<br/><br/>The dialogue is too cliché, the acting poor and honestly the so called ""sceens of gore"" have been found wanting in many areas. If you are a fan of the film ""Beyond The Limits"", then you may be able to bear this amalgamation of visual sleeping pills coupled with some of the poorest acting you've ever seen. These low budget films if they are to stand out needs a good plot, which this particular film lacks entirely.<br/><br/>My advice is to watch this flick in order to protect yourself from overhiped films like this in the future.

It fails to deliver effective, mesmerizing horror, and most part of it, it's just about 2 drunk-ass American guys trying to score chicks. That's NOT what i had in mind when i BOUGHT my ticket! I've spent the whole movie waiting, wishing, begging for some damn horror but, when it finally comes to that part (yes, i've said PART, as in -> it's not all horror. It has comedy in it too!!!!

If this is the best we can get, I'll just stay at home and watch TV. It's disappointing to many many levels.<br/><br/>Note to Quentin: you're better than this, don't support movies like this one just to help someone! It has its moments, but that's about 2 or 3 scenes of barely average horror.<br/><br/>If you're a true horror fan, you'll be disappointed.

","I was reading the interviews with the director, and he said he saw a website in Thailand. I'll bet there are some websites in MY country, which is in the same Asian region as Thailand. So the perspective I'm coming from is it CAN be real and it CAN happen, not just in Slovakia or (more realistically) in Thailand. <br/><br/>The movie itself is decent, with maybe a bit too many coincidences happening that favor the heroes, but the real point of the movie is people can become a commodity. We can now put a price on anything, love, war and even a human life, and that's not an original idea, because even before the 20th century there were a lot of countries being conquered by other countries. My country the Philippines being taken over by Spain, for instance. That's when the abuses and the torture comes in, because a commodity for you is a something which you can take care of or break, whatever pleases you.<br/><br/>The gore isn't the real horror. It's the idea that taking a human life is a business that makes it all truly disgusting. I think this point of view elevates Hostel past its imperfection to a pretty good horror film (despite being not violent enough for horror nuts and being too violent for the regular moviegoers). <br/><br/>As for the people who deplore horror films, they should meet two horror masters, Cronenberg and Miike. I haven't really met them in person but I hear they are very gentle, funny people in person, and Cronenberg's movie set is the most un-tense, relaxed and collaborative set an actor can work in. <br/><br/>So do violent films really beget more violence? Should horror film directors be aborted after conception? Or do they actually perform an important aesthetic function for mankind?"

","eli roth has come a long way since Cabin Fever, a completely underwhelming film that seemed calculated to do little more than earn roth a title as heir apparent to the legacies left by his horror forebears. playing off his newfound industry buzz and access to horror auteurs, roth has cobbled together a team of celebrities-turned-sycophants including Tarantino and Miike to champion his latest endeavor, a wanna-be Asian extreme gorror. the result? a spectacular film. roth may be calculating in his Hollywood machinations, but that same calculating mind has brought us a film of such ferocity and brutality that it's nothing short of astonishing for Hostel to be a mainstream American release in 2006. this film is as enigmatic and fearless as Cabin Fever was obvious and safe. the critics' reviews versus the box office speak volumes on this one: although the press may not be ready for an angry America, the audience certainly is."
"Scatmover","6","1","2","8 March 2006"," Delivers the goods!
","Its so rare these days that decent horror movies are actually made, for every ""The Ring"" there are 10 ""Saw's"" and its a real shame because I have always been a shameless horror movie fan. But finally there is a horror movie in theaters that actually delivers the goods and its name is Hostel.<br/><br/>I wasn't a big fan of Eli Roth's first film ""Cabin Fever"", in fact I downright hated it so my anticipation for his next film wasn't that high, that was until reviews began to come in and everyone talked about how brutal and gory the movie is. This really peaked my curiosity because I am somewhat of a gore freak so I figured that I had to check it out.<br/><br/>Now the first 20 minutes are for the most part.... Terrible. I admit for most of the first act I was pretty sure that I was gonna hate this movie. The first act is sort of like what would happen if they made American Pie 4, but looking back on it after the movie is over the first 20 minutes look better because they are sort of your breather because the rest of the movie is freaking brutal!<br/><br/>The middle section of this movie is simply brilliant, all of the scenes in the dungeon are truly frightening in a ""this could happen to you"" sense and somehow through the movie Roth actually makes you like these characters and we want to see them escape.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is the ending where our one remaining lead decides to get him some good old fashion revenge. The last 10 minutes are simply laughable. I think the movie would have been a lot better if the movie had ended with Paxton escaping from the Hostel and returning to America a broken man but they decide to take the juvenile route.<br/><br/>A lot has been made of the gore in this film and to me it wasn't really that bad although there was a lot of groaning and screaming in the audience I saw it with so it seems to work for people not used to this kind of thing but for any horror movie fan there is nothing in this movie that you haven't seen before.<br/><br/>In closing, I think that with a tighter script and a better beginning and end this movie could have been a modern horror classic but as it stands now it is an enjoyable time at the movies (Well maybe enjoyable isn't the right word.)And I recommend this film to all you horror movie freaks like me out there!"
"jerikoone","3","1","2","7 March 2006"," Disappointing
","I've just watched Hostel and I am very very disappointed. The concept has potential, but the result is so poor. Not a single character is developed. The plot has almost an hour of unuseful premises. The kidnapping/torture/killing business could have been made plausibile, but it has not and it looks like a public fair, without any need to keep it hidden from any possible investigations. The whole context is totally unrealistic. Finally, the end is very predictable and banal. As regards the core of the movie, the torture scenes are not disturbing as you would expect from a movie like this. Last week, I have seen Syriana: there is a single torture scene, which is enormously more effective than all the Hostel gore. If Takeshi Miike and Quentin Tarantino are Eli Roth's torture-scenes masters, well he hasn't learned the lesson."

Plenty of hot women and nudity and when we finally get to the ""gore"" and action, it does not last long, doe the famous change camera angle as we are about to see something brutal and then the movie suddenly ends with a slightly happyish ending in terms to what it could have ended like.<br/><br/>If you go see this movie hoping to see some brutality and such, don't. If you want everything I said above, sure go for it.<br/><br/>If I didn't go see this film expecting everything they hyped it up to be then I may have enjoyed it more, but most of my disappointment came from the fact of how hyped up it was, built me up just to let me down.<br/><br/>I will not recommend this to friends but rather advise them not to go and there are many other films I would recommend in what this movies genre was suppose to be."
"polysicsarebest","1","1","2","12 February 2006"," Embarrassing for everyone involved
","Eli Roth called this film his ""masterpiece""... A ""dark, disturbing, gritty"" take on modern horror. Unfortunately, he somehow forgot he was making a horror movie and instead made a movie that is more like Road Trip meets an action movie with some dark horror synthesizers and a little gore thrown in.<br/><br/>Strangely, this movie is paced almost identically as Wolf Creek (which came out about 2 weeks before this). The first 40 minutes, pretty much nothing happens. Okay, there is tons of nudity and drugs, but all that got old. I think Roth watched a few too many 80's B-horror movies and was like ""OH! There are boobs in these!! Well, let me put six times that amount in my film!!"" However, he forgot that, in most of these films, the nudity added to the adolescent feel and humor of the movie. In this case, this is one of the biggest problems with Hostel: Hostel is NOT funny. It is NOT scary. It is NOT gory. It is NOT well-paced. It is pretty much NOTHING.<br/><br/>Anyway, after the first 40 minutes, there are a few lame gore set pieces thrown in, and the movie turns into a ridiculous action movie after a few minutes. This got annoying pretty quickly, as action movies are known for totally unbelievable character situations and elements of revenge. Well, you get all that here, and it's all pretty lame.<br/><br/>Roth seems intent on making a masterpiece by design; by taking his influences and somehow raping them and turning them into a mess of alienation. By having so much language spoken in this film without any subtitles whatsoever, the viewer quickly becomes angry. That was probably Roth's point. And by promising this gritty, dark horror film and instead delivering a druggy sex action movie with a couple lame gore pieces, the horror fan quickly learns to despise the film.<br/><br/>Hostel isn't a bad film. In fact, it's very entertaining. The first time through, the revenge elements and the kid street gang and random stuff like that is actually pretty interesting to watch. But upon repeated viewings, you realize this film is actually pretty stupid. Roth seems like the type of guy who I would love to talk about horror films with, but he seems completely incapable of realizing his vision. People can blame the studios messing with his film or the MPAA or whatever, but it seems that Roth basically screwed up his own movie by having such stupid pacing. The first 40 minutes of a film not devoted to any horror whatsoever would usually typically mean that we have plenty of time to get to know the characters. In the least, something major could have happened that would have been important later. Nope. You could have taken the first 40 minutes, chopped it into 2 minutes and you would have had the same film. Pretty much a waste of celluloid.<br/><br/>Sadly enough, this is probably one of the best nu-horror films out there. And it's about a hundred times better than Cabin Fever. So, yeah, Roth has failed to impress me yet again, but he's getting better, and at least he is trying to do something different... even if he is failing at it. Sometimes, failures can be just as interesting as successes."

"barkleypaloma","8","1","2","7 February 2006"," Hostel Assault
","Hostel makes cinematic history... no other movie has ever had so much graphic torture... clearly groundbreaking.<br/><br/>It begins with a fairly genteel account of some twenty-somethings having a good time backpacking across Europe... a dream on every American's to-do list.<br/><br/>BUT, once the hammer drops on this one, it don't let up until the very last frame. The hammer falls in one scene in particular, where one of the three disappears, and the hostage's picture mail appears on his buddy's phone with the phrase ""I go Home."" From this point on, it truly gets as medieval as anything ever seen on screen.<br/><br/>Hostel reaches all in the audience on a visceral level, as torture of this nature is truly the most common, deep-seeded fear that exists. It's no accident that Hostel's homonym is hostile... as this is one of the most hostile assaults on an audience in cinematic history.<br/><br/>I would recommend three things: one bucket, two toothpicks and three shots of rye. Hug the bucket during the movie, toothpicks for you eyelids as nightmare preventative, and the rye will help in the deprogramming phase afterward. You don't want to go to this one alone.<br/><br/>The criticism I have is that there could have been more comic relief. A few well-placed Tarrantino's would have really escalated this movie to the top of the heap. Like a soup with too much garlic, and nothing to help kick it down a notch, the recipe of hostelsoup called for too much ghastly, and not enough comedy.<br/><br/>In the end, this is the groundbreaking high water mark of torture movies. I hope I don't see another try to top this one for many years to come... but somehow, I know I will."

","After I read all the comments in this site about how graphic and brutal Hostel was, I was expecting at least something in the vein of Audition a movie with far better make up and way more perverse than this one, but instead all I've got is something like a Scooby Doo film with some gore and to be honest, lame gore. Cabin Fever was neat because at first you thought it was a slasher flick and it turned out to be something different. It was a fun trip. But Hostel seems like a video game. An absurd montage of gory scenes with no purpose at all, and it's not even disturbing or exciting. It's just stupid. There was some nice humor, like the Pulp Fiction part. I was laughing at that. Oh, and by the way I really don't understand why you people complain about all the nudity. That's a human body with no clothes on and that's it. Why do you find it so offensive? Maybe because there was almost no male nudity, but it's not something to be offended about. But it gets dull. Yeah, that I will give you. The eye part was the worst. I couldn't stop thinking about how fake it looked. Roth did a great job in Cabin Fever with special make up. But this is terrible. You can't get fooled by it.<br/><br/>The ending was far convenient for Paxton. I mean, I was waiting for a scene where the T -1000 would show up to help him through. It's not realistic, nor even suspenseful.

Don't waste $7-$15 on seeing this in the theater. Hell, don't even waste $5 to rent the DVD.<br/><br/>The only way this movie is going to make money is PURELY on the ""hype"" from the TV previews/trailers.<br/><br/>It had a decent plot and pretty good actors, but there was just WAY too much dead time. For the first 40 minutes, you sit there wondering when something is going to happen. During that time, you figure out the whole movie and then nothing is a surprise later on. But then, after they DON'T surprise you (because you already figured it out), they try to explain it to you. Only a total moron wouldn't have figured it out already. The whole movie and every single character was so friggin' obvious.<br/><br/>Additionally, the previews say things like ""In test audiences, ambulances were called and people were puking in theaters because it's so graphic!"" What the hell are they talking about? Graphic? OK, sure, I wouldn't suggest taking a child to it, but it's nowhere near as gory as they made it out to be. THE DEVIL'S REJECTS was 100 times more gory and it was MUCH MUCH MUCH more entertaining.<br/><br/>Simply, it was a good idea that they threw in the toilet with lousy directing. Part of it is because they thought they were so smart they'd have to spell everything out for the stupid movie-goers. It's a blood-and-guts movie for god's sake; it doesn't need much of a plot and you don't have to spell anything out (as long as you have a decent director and screenplay writer).<br/><br/>I'm no movie director/writer/producer, but as I walked out, I thought, ""Even I could have made this SO much better."" There was so much room for more action and more gore, but they didn't take the opportunity. Maybe they were trying to avoid an NC-17 rating or something, but it could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time or your money on this steaming pile of anal leakage..."

","If we are to believe it, HOSTEL may be based on real-life goings-on in Asia, although the director has changed the setting to eastern Europe, a place few American tourists visit. Some backpackers are lured from the relative safety of western Europe to Slovakia on the promise of hot sex. But after the hot sex, they are drugged, tortured and murdered, along with hundreds of others in an old mental asylum refitted as a series of torture rooms in which affluent males from around the world pay heavily to play torturer. Jay Hernandez leads the unlucky backpackers, and the film takes a good 50 minutes before it gets down to business. The suspense is killing, and the last 40 or so minutes is all about killing. The gore and the production values are great, although most of the torture is suggested rather than seen, with terrific sound effects for those things we are not permitted to see. A good thing, too: the few scenes actually showing nasty deeds being done are patently fake, and had us alternately laughing and groaning. SPOILER: Sole survivor Hernandez has a great time avenging his buddies' deaths, and we're right there with him as he gets every last one of them in various, novel ways.

","Okay, we watched it last night, and my tummy was pretty much upset for the rest of the night. Since some people already explained the plot, Ill just give you my reaction: I can handle horror, ""normal"" horror (what most might call kiddie horror like the Texas chainsaw massacre or things like that), but this went into absolute sick horror. I thought I was prepared...but I wasn't. First and last time I've seen it, and honestly, I just cant believe these positive reviews!! I've seen Cabin Fever, and I liked that movie, was kind of funny, but Hostel was straight out Sickening.<br/><br/>I actually wanted to get out of the theater, but didn't because my husband and brother in law wanted to finish it (not that they liked it or anything...). The whole plot is just simply stupid. They did a good job making Europe look pretty bad. Prostitutes, messed up looking back streets etc, but come on, you can find that about anywhere in the world no matter what country you go to.<br/><br/>I read the movie was graphic sexually as well as bloody, but to be honest - I only thought the bloody portion of it was true (oh gee was it true and not a bit exaggerated!). Being from Europe originally, you can see sexual scenes like that in about most of the 8pm prime time movies by now. America is just not used to that, simply because many, many of these scenes are cut for American television - I've seen if for a few years here now.<br/><br/>I can only suggest to everyone to use their money for more useful stuff.<br/><br/>***My opinion***"

America has to butcher such great horror films and all that just because people cant handle it? If you cant handle a movie don't go to see it! The European girls were sexy, and they did a great job promoting them. In fact, if you threw in some shots of ""Sneepur"" then you could even call it soft core porn. I just feel that it was hyped up to be more gory than it really was. Think about it..You saw a cut on the back of some guy's leg. Then you saw fingers getting cut off. OK? Like we haven't seen that before. It was scary and a good movie, but look at it this way - there was no suspense to the movie. Everything was to the point and not built up... Nothing made you jump out of your seat. The best part of the movie were the European chicks."
"rrclimber","6","1","2","17 January 2006"," Disappointing
","I have read a bunch of comments stating that this movie is ""hardcore"" and ""real horror"" but it's not. The truth is the horror movies that are being produced today are just so terrible that this movie appears to be for real. I was really disappointed by this film. So much potential and so little actual payoff. The beginning of the film that is supposed to be setting up the Hostel sequence is waaaay to long. I don't really need this much character development. They are a bunch of early 20's morons who travel to Europe to take drugs and have sex. How much more do you need to know? Apparently you need half of the film. When you do finally get to the Hostel the violence and horror that could have been never appear. Granted there are a few scenes that make you cringe but nothing that hasn't been done before. Much like Roth's last film Cabin Fever, this is nothing more than an homage to better films. (If you want to see a great power drill sequence check out Feluci's Gates of Hell.) I am willing to give Roth a break since the movie had to be edited pretty severely in order to get an R rating. I would wait for the DVD to come out and see this movie without the constraints of rating system. In the meantime I am throwing all of my hope for good horror films on Aja shoulders with his remake of the Hills Have Eyes."
"EVOL666","8","1","2","16 January 2006"," Solid Second Film For Eli Roth
","OK...forget all the hype...I'll give you the real deal about HOSTEL. Now of course I am one of the seemingly few who actually also liked CABIN FEVER, so I guess you'll have to take that with a grain-of-salt as well, but I think HOSTEL was a good second film for a director who definitely shows some serious potential...<br/><br/>HOSTEL starts off with 2 friends back-packing through Europe. During their ""adventures"", they meet a European ""drifter"" kinda guy and they all decide to pal around and check out the sights. They do the types of things that any young, single guys would do (namely - smoke dope and check out the hookers...) and while in Amsterdam they hear of this great place in Slovakia that houses all the hot poonanny. Sho' nuff they get to the joint and it's drippin' with hot European ass. The guys are all having a great time, until after a night of heavy partying with a couple of Euro-ho's - their drifter buddy disappears. This kinda worries the two Yankee cats as Euro-boy didn't bother to say any good-byes...but they chalk it up to the drifter mentality and try to put it out of their minds. Well, another hard night of partying goes on, and one of the American dudes disappears, too. This leaves the other American guy with no idea what's going on and he's obviously more than a little concerned about his homey's well being. The remaining American guy starts nosin' around as things seem pretty fishy, and one of the Euro-ho's tells the Yank that his boy is at an art exhibit. She takes him to some abandoned looking sh!t-hole place (keep an eye out at this point for a brief cameo by Japanese uber-director, Takashi Miike...) and tells him to go and find his boy. Obviously, the place is no art museum, and as our hero goes in search of his supposedly art-loving friend, HOSTEL really starts to take off...<br/><br/>Honestly, I really liked HOSTEL. It definitely is a little slow paced in the beginning, but I think that this was intentional (if not completely effective...) on the behalf of Roth. He said that he was going for an ""AUDITION"" (hence the cameo by Miike...)type of feel to his film, and anyone that's seen AUDITION knows full-well that that film is slow as dirt until the last 15 minutes or so. Personally, I would have preferred a quicker build up or perhaps a little more ""teaser"" footage in the beginning of the film. Even so, the last 30 or so minutes of HOSTEL really makes up for any lag preceding the ""climax"" of the film. And even the relatively slow beginning DOES have enough hot tits-and-ass to keep the average male (or female if you roll that way...) viewer interested. When the gore DOES come, it flys pretty heavy, especially for a U.S. theatrical release film. It's nothing compared to some of the more rough ""underground"" films out there, but still plenty of red-stuff for a mainstream film. Also, many people gripe about Roth's use of ""frat-boy"" style humor in his films. I personally think he does a good job of handling the funny moments and does a good job of knowing when to turn them on or off depending on the vibe of the scene. Not many directors can handle balancing comedic timing and horror in the same film, but Roth does it admirably well. Overall, HOSTEL is one of the better horror films of 2005 and is definitely worth a peep for any horror fan. It appears to already be another ""love-it-or-hate-it"" film (much like CABIN FEVER...) so I'm sure the debate on this one will go on for a while, but I give HOSTEL a very solid 8.5/10..."

","Hostel (2006) 8.5/10 It's been a tremendous amount of time since I've sat in a theater and suddenly glanced around me to see so many people intrigued or stunned by what was happening on screen. With Hostel, there's no gloves, no decent nature, no pleasure-combing dreams. It's simply a developing nightmare. What made this film so interesting, even in its slow beginning, is the mysterious gravity thats centers your attention on every character's moves or hellish interest. And while the film runs a bit slow, you always sense that there's a disgusting destruction on its secret way. There's absolutely a cinematic static when it comes to this film and its audience; a sick, yet honest treat beneath its colorful and violent nature."

The only redeeming value of this film is the lesson that if a girl puts out on the first date and/or shows herself naked before the date, you don't want to hang around for the second. No matter how hot or good in bed she is. Never go to Europe and leave the safety of other Americans. The best thing to do is wait for the rental and eat dinner before you go."

","Like ""Wolf Creek,"" Hostel's reputation is horribly over-hyped. As I was told, Hostel was the be-all end-all of disgusting, bloody horror and mayhem, so naturally I had high expectations. What I got in exchange for my nine dollars was an hour and a half of ""what the hell is this?"" Without going into detail, I'll sum the movie up: the characters are boring, and one watches them do their thing for a good solid fifty minutes before anything interesting happens. If you've seen ""Eurotrip"" you've seen the first FIFTY MINUTES of this movie. By a certain point in Hostel you are guaranteed to stop giving a care in the world to the main character(s) and wish only for them to be subjected to painful, awful things like you were promised in the trailers you saw on TV or the internet.<br/><br/>Hostel surprised me unpleasantly. I expected to see brutal torture and plenty of material worthy of making me put down my bag of popcorn lest I vomit in it. What I got instead was an urge to tell my mate to ""wake me when we get there."" If you're looking for a movie to satisfy the sadist in you, you're looking in the wrong place. Avoid Hostel unless you're dying to see a mediocre Saw with watered down violence and a sleep-inducing story."

After people started leaving, I made myself stay thinking there would be some plot twist or something... that might resemble an iota of a plot. Turned out the people who left saved about 45 minutes of their own lives. I couldn't tell if I was watching a snuff movie or a soft core porn. I decided it was more of a snuff movie because soft core porns have some plot lines. This movie sucked. Eli Roth sucks and the only person who wasted more money on this film was Tarantino.

Eli Roth has us despising these characters, like the one the Jay Hernandez character meets in the locker room. However, in a sense we are similar to these people in that we spent our money to go and see this torture and horror on the big screen. Obviously, I know there is a big difference between the actual act and watching it in a movie. However, I did see the irony that Roth (perhaps unknowingly)displayed to his audience in the entire experience of Hostel."
"rgilmour","8","1","2","9 January 2006"," Exciting Slasher-Gore-Horror
","Hostel is the story of two young American backpackers, Josh (Derek Richardson) and Paxton (Jay Hernandez) traveling across Europe after graduation from university. They meet a guy from Iceland, Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) and all end up in Amsterdam together searching for drugs, sex and post-adolescent ""Spring Break""-type fun in Europe. The film is really well shot with some incredible visuals and backgrounds (according to Roth he filmed most of it in the Czech Republic). After meeting an Eastern-European guy in Amsterdam the trio of hungry guys head to Slovenia to find a hostel known for its beautiful Eastern-European women. What they find instead is a place where beautiful young Eastern-European women collect men and women from all over the world as playthings for international torture afficianados who pay exorbiant sums of money to have their way with their unsuspecting foreign victims. The nationality of each victim is understood to be part of the attraction, part of each torturer's desired object/fetish.<br/><br/>Debuted un-rated and in an un-finished format at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005, viewers felt it was one of the best horror films they had ever seen. According to viewers who saw it then, the horror-gore-torture scenes were graphic and explicit, leading most reviewers to fear for its eventual presentation after editing for wider cinematic release (thank goodness for DVDs, everyone suggests that then at least viewers will be able to see the deleted scenes). The released film is still extremely graphic and filled with marvelous scenes of explicit gore and horror (for those who like such stuff). Anyone who enjoys slasher-horror-gore films will be entertained. Roth has made an enjoyable film that is well scripted, well filmed and well acted. Unlike most horror-slasher-gore flicks which spend a great deal of time focused on the traditional male on female heterosexual violence, Roth plays with this and turns it on its head. In Roth's interpretation female bodies are objectified as sexual objects while his male bodies become objects for torture, an interesting twist which heightens the horror of the film (not to overlook the superb acting by Derek Richardson).<br/><br/>While Roth's film plays with traditional horror films (and to a lesser degree ""Spring Break/European vacation"" films) at the same time his film re-inscribes morality, hetero-normativity and justice in ways that are far from innovative. The good guys are Americans. Americans when in immoral situations rise above them and make morally justifiable decisions. And bad guys are tainted with homosexuality, making their sadistic desires more repulsive because of their sexual orientations. Inevitably the ""good-guy"" American must punish the ""bad"" homosexually inclined European ""other"" in order to bring about a cycle of redemption that is traditional and normative. Roth's film would have been more interesting if he had not fallen back on the characterizations of ""good-guy"" Americans and ""bad-guy"" European ""others"" and instead played with the amorality of the world he is depicting. The subject of Roth's film is at once disturbing and riveting. It is important given the nature of our world today. According to Roth in an interview with Arrow in the Head he had come up with the idea when a friend had showed him an internet site which marketed such horrors. We live in a world where human lives have become commodified and marketed as experiences of desire. Experiences that for the right price can be purchased and consumed. The world Roth portrays whether ""real"" or not draws attention to the fact that sexuality, desire, sadism, torture and pain have all become a part of the greater world of capitalism. We live in world where all experiences are commodified and subject to the amoral laws of the market, a subject that certainly needs to be addressed on a critical level. Beyond the slasher-gore-horror aspects of Roth's film these fundamental problems lay at the heart of his film and need to be discussed."

","I went to see Hostel with a friend who insisted we go. Personally, I was a bit afraid after hearing all the hype about this flick and comments like ""the goriest movie ever made"" and bla bla...

It does play on a common fear of being helpless and at the mercy of a sadist but it does it in a very ""lazy"" way, without any originality. It also re-uses the 1970's clichÃ© of showing boobs without much connection to the story.<br/><br/>The characters are sympathetic but they are ""offed"" so fast that we don't really have time to empathize with their fate. It's a lot of building up a capital of sympathy only to see it written off in a minute or two. The main evil female characters are two-dimensional bitches, and no justification is offered for their actions except pure greed.<br/><br/>The story is also very thin and would have easily fit into a 60 minutes TV format.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie is part Tobe Hopper, part Russ Meyer and part run of the mill B-movie.

","First off i must state that when i saw previews for this movie, i was very excited! This movie looked sick, and therefore very interesting. i told people how i was going to go see it, and everyone told me how horrible it looked (in a good way) and how it would be way to scary for them to see it. i brought my friend along with me, and we were both very nervous but excited about viewing this movie. we sat down, with every intention of being scared out of our minds. we wore hooded sweatshirts and big baggy coats so we can curl up into balls when the movie got too intense. i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this movie was the most disappointing movie i had ever seen. the first 45 minutes of the film closely resembled the movie Euro Trip. which is not a horror movie at all, but a comedy about a few teenagers taking a trip all over Europe and having a good time. This movie resembled Euro Trip down to the silly scenes on the train, and with the fanny pack. i felt like this movie was not only a rip off of a dumb movie, but it also had terrible acting. Finally, when they got down to the good stuff, i sunk into my chair with relief. pleased that the movie will now start with the gory, good parts. The first scary scene was about to show the man torturing someone, and they just cut to a black screen. they also had some ""deep"" plot points explaining how one of the lead characters witnessed a young girl drown and he wasn't able to do enough to help her. Come on Quentin Tarrantino, give me a break! i sat through that movie for and hour and a half, waiting very impatiently for some decent part to come on. which it never did. i prayed for the main character to be killed, so the movie would end. i eventually look up at my friend who is just sitting there staring blankly at the big screen, and i say ""do you want to just leave? this movie sucks!"" and she says ""yea, lets leave. i thought this was going to be better."" I continued to stay in my seat and give it one last shot. then when the scene came up with the main character getting out of the building i was excited because I figured it was almost over. he ran to the car and was about to get away when he heard a girl scream. of course, thats where that plot point from before comes into play. at this point, i was seriously done with this movie. i grabbed my things, and walked right out. i must say i have never walked out of a movie, especially one that i was so very excited to see in the first place. <br/><br/>thank you very much for ruining my day off! i thought Kill Bill was good though -Barbara Vetri"

","I have tried for years to understand the works of Quentin Tarantino, and why he is so highly acclaimed, but this movie didn't help me at all. Now before I get jumped on for this, I must say that even though I don't 'like' any of his films, I have respect for anyone who can stay fresh in Hollywood these days, while still doing the movies he wants to do, seemingly, without compromising his vision.<br/><br/>Now, after presenting my stance on the main driving force behind ""Hostel"", I must say why I loathed this movie. I first caught a 'restricted' trailer of this film before ""Saw II"". I was horrified at the preview, even though it was no more than three minutes long. Now, I love horror movies, (hence how I saw the preview), but seeing how many gruesome images someone can cram into 95 minutes of film is not scary, it's more sad than anything.<br/><br/>I'm not ripping on the violence because I'm squeamish, but because it's so over the top. I like a horror movie with a fairly comprehensible storyline. In Hostel, not only was a decent plot nowhere in sight, but it seems, as if to compensate for this, the torture scenes were more elaborate to divert attention from the fact that the plot was thin, and, the characters one dimensional. So in the end, you care very little about them, so it isn't a big deal when they die. Most horror movies have at least one character that can be liked or identified with by most people on some level.<br/><br/>For those who like the film, I am not saying anything against the fans; I just can't see any appeal in it."

","When you go to see Hostel, you have an idea just from previews and commercials on TV that it's about 3 backpackers (Josh, Paxton and Oli) that backpack in Europe looking to be with some of the finest Euroupean woman seen to man. So you can just imagine much of the first half is beautiful naked woman who they have encounters with. The first half is very funny, very light hearted. Almost can't believe it will somehow turn into a film that will have you clutching your eyes every now and then to look away from certain sadistic scenes. It was almost weird being in a theater and actually seeing people around me reacting to the torture scenes and looking away. It was weird. Not even while watching Saw this happened. <br/><br/>Hostel is directed by Eli Roth who also directed the much hyped 'Cabin Fever'. Almost can't believe it's the same guy doing this film. There are difference between films but the humor we get in Cabin Fever also shines through in Hostel.<br/><br/>Oh, so you want to know about the torture scenes eh? Well, in all honesty. It's not the blood that pops out that makes it gory but it's the fact that we are seeing humans being tortured is a good enough to have anyone shaking in their boots. Almost makes me not ever want to backpack to another country ever lol.<br/><br/>In closing, in a day and age where most tend to stay home and watch most of their movies on DVD. Hostel is one film you won't regret seeing in theaters. I must say the best part of watching Hostel is actually having an audience that is into it as much as I am. It was great.

Everyone else should be able to proceed with confidence.<br/><br/>Based on IMDb message boards and various reviews, I'd guess that HOSTEL is supposed to be controversial; some have even applied the label ""exploitation film"" to it. There are a few disturbing moments--the previews allude to at least one involving a toe and some pliers, if I remember correctly--but the movie didn't scare me, or even gross me out, that much. More than content (which is of course disturbing), I'd say that this is a matter of timing and the balance between humor and horror. As with his film CABIN FEVER, Roth indulges in a lot of silliness. The beginning sequence of exposition (which is rather long) establishes a goofy tone that I don't think the balance of the film effectively subverts. In fact, while I'm no prude, I found the overt sexuality of the movie's first half perhaps its most disquieting element--not because the characters are indulging in it (and in fact, I think their weaknesses are critical to what eventually befalls them, a pretty class move), but because the director is so clearly indulging in it. I think he'd claim some higher artistic merit, too, which is the maddening part. (Not T&A in general. Horror films and T&A generally go together, right?) Now for the torture sequences. Sometimes Roth puts it all out there for you, and yes, there's gore--nothing particularly new, though; the HELLRAISER movies of my childhood were much worse, I think. Sometimes he plays coy and darts away, which is perhaps a relief but also irritating. What he fails to do, though, is offer any of that slow, unbearable suspense or slap-in-the-face surprise that has distinguished earlier horror films. (Even CABIN FEVER--I'm thinking here of the scene when it's revealed what the dog did to that girl's face.) The film is both breakneck in its pacing (again, once you get past all of that set-up) and completely predictable. You know which characters are going to do bad things later on as soon as you meet them. You know what that unfortunate, disfigured girl is going to do before she does. And so on."

","HOSTEL is the story of two young Americans traveling through Europe (Josh and Paxton), joined by Icelander Oli, who tire of the crowd of Americans in Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Act I: Desperate to find easy and beautiful women, they meet a friendly European (Alex) who tells them an unbelievable story about a small city in Eastern Europe that has no men. They've all been killed by civil war. What's left? Beautiful women, of course. Alex shows pictures of him with naked women and the three men are convinced. Off they go! Until this point, Roth has written/directed a fairly standard and expected teen flick, with Josh as the shy and reluctant tall boy and Paxton as the gruff, obnoxious, and egotistical leader. Roth plays with the theme of American greed, capitalism, and imperialism, but only at a surface level.<br/><br/>Act II: Josh, Paxton, and Oli arrive at a hostel that is beyond their wildest dreams. Filled with beautiful women, a spa, in a charming little town, this will be their heaven until they can seduce every woman available. The women they meet are modern-day sirens, luring the men in order to sell them for the ""exhibit"". Oli disappears first, then Josh. Paxton, at first full of bravado, is now forced into action, and once he discovers Josh, his innards exposed after a gruesome torture scene, he's forced into the role of prey. It's only a chance moment, the torturer slipping, that Paxton survives.<br/><br/>Act III: Paxton escapes and enacts vengeance on several of those responsible for Josh and Oli.<br/><br/>Roth starts slow and gets stronger in Act II, but he can't carry the weight of either the anti-American theme nor the gruesome terror. The shock value wears off rather fast, though Jay Hernandez does a commendable job. However his is the only character that has any arc. Unfortunately Roth manages to tie everything in a nice bow rather than leaving story and ending up to the imagination."
"lb072287","2","1","2","7 January 2006"," why I gave it a 2
","I gave this movie a 2 for a few reasons and the reasons are..... -the movie took to long to get started, and it also developed slowly. -the whole torture thing isn't torture it's more less someone getting their kicks from killing people. Why?, because torture is about making someone suffer other than just killing them because they can. Torture is about making someone mentally scared for the rest of there life, it's the whole fear of dying or fear of pain, not death. -if you want to see this movie, i'd wait to rent it, in three or four months cause thats what it's worth. so take my advice and wait til it comes out, and until then we can only wait til a true horror movie comes out."

","I advise anyone that thinks this movie might turn out good to not watch it. I was so pumped up and ready to see this film and was disappointed. The script and acting was terrible. I actually found myself laughing at most of the movie because it was so ridiculous. Now, as a guy I can't complain. There was a lot of nudity and just great scenes a guy would probably enjoy. The ending was pretty good. Director Eli Roth also did a pretty good job. I just don't know how he was able to direct a movie with such a bad script. One of the lines in the film spoken by Jay Hernandez is ""I don't want a drink. I want to see art!!"" Terrible line. The acting was terrible. I knew in the first five minutes that it was going to be bad. I've never seen so much nudity and bad words in the first ten minutes than I saw in this film. I wish I would have seen something else. Very disappointed."

The first 60 minuets of the movie is just 100% nudity, so much that I felt strange and after the movie it ran through my mind if they where trying to win the audients with that? Well it just looked ridicules. Finally we started to see some action after 60-70 minuets. The torture seemed real but it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be. The audients didn't really got to see anything except how scared the characters where and every time the throw up. Then the movie becomes a normal James Bond movie.

Did the movie suddenly had to have some ""horror limed""? - What did the Japanese girl expected to see in the mirror after her eye had been burned out? Why was she so surprised? - When the Paxton (Jay Hernandez) Escaped how did he know that the kinky ""eating with his hand"" man on the train killed his friend?

","I was all excited to go see this movie. The reviews I've heard said it would be one of the scariest movies. It wasn't. It was, however disturbing. Seeing the previews and hearing that some people were being taken out by paramedics and others were passing out was all bogus. The crowd at the theater was laughing at certain parts that were not funny and weren't intended to be. I read all these reviews that were making it seem like a real horror, one that would finally live up to the standards. It was more grotesque than anything. I liken it to the Texas Chainsaw Massicure. What was all the hype about? I could see worst things in movies like House of 1000 Corpes or even Aliens. It was good to an extent. I can't wait to see if the come out with either an unrated version or directors cut on DVD. Perhaps then it will truly be the horror it was hyped to be."

","My only question is this: Why is Quentin Tarantino's name even on this film???? They should rename the film ""Breasts and Blood,"" maybe that way it would make some sense and the viewer would have a complete picture of what they were about to get themselves into. Lets talk about unnecessary nudity. Don't get me wrong, I like a little nudity in a horror flick, in fact, it's usually expected, but this movie goes far and beyond the point of normal. There is so much needless nudity that it actually becomes a turn-off. And now the blood.... oh boy the blood... I don't like ruining movies regardless of how bad they were, but lets just say you won't be gasping in terror... you'll be ""cringing"" at how they cover just about every way there is to make a movie goer reach for a body part and go 'ouchhh... i can almost feel that."" Aside from the above mentioned, the movie does merit watching... but only in a group... and only if you'r willing to laugh through the entire movie with the rest of the audience. I personally hate when people cheer and comment during a movie... but in this case.. its simply necessary<br/><br/>oh... and as for kabinky? don't worry, it doesn't give anything away... its just the only think my friends and I took out of that movie... that and some nacho cheese..."

Similar to ""Saw"", I think the plot of the movie was great, but it could have been better executed on film. Some of the makeup & ""effects"" looked cheesy and when the action finally does come, it was rushed and just seemed sloppy and thrown together. I also love how they use ""Quentin Tarantino"" on the posters to promote the movie when he didn't write, direct, or even cameo in the movie... he was the executive producer!! wtf!?

They made it seem real scary, didn't they? Well, unless you can't handle true horror like Halloween and a few nasty scenes (Which to me aren't all that nasty thanks to quick camera shots) -- you'll be fine.<br/><br/>The movie spends about 45 min. (Which feels like the entire movie) in a crappy version of Eurotrip. Then comes a 'nasty and scary' bit in the middle and then for the, what it seemed like, last 10 min. of the movie, a ""scary"" thriller.<br/><br/>I will admit this movie had potential with the set and suspense but still, it failed as a movie. Also, the humour and cameo by Rick Hoffman ruined the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>Hope I save you 8 bucks.<br/><br/>4/10"

","Just recently saw ""Salo: The 120 days of Sodom"" which reminded me quite a bit of this movie and the underlying message.

Anybody seen both movies and see where i'm going with this?<br/><br/>Basically, I think the movies are very similar in message, I wouldn't be surprised to hear that Eli Roth knew of ""Salo"".

","How can I say this? Quentin Tarantino is no person to listen to when choosing a horror flick. He doesn't KNOW horror! He doesn't know jack! Was this a horror flick? Yes. Was it realistic? Yes. Does it scare you? Yes, if you have the intellect of a troglodyte, and you puddle when nervous. But predictable!!! Gawd, how predictable could this movie possibly be? The scene with the chainsaw...I laughed my ass off! I mean, who laughs at people being tortured? The second guy to be killed, Josh, at least his acting was realistic. Everyone else was so stone cold boring, bland, and blasé. It smacked of Auschwitz, with its racism, hatred, and lack of respect for human life and existence. And to be honest, I thought that part of it was rather a turn-off. When is this world going to come to its senses and leave those kinds of pains and ugliness in the past? And to top it all off, why does the director/writer assume that it would be a bunch of idiots backpacking across Europe that would get themselves in this kind of predicament. I say scrap the whole dang thing and watch porno. That was the only part of it that was the least bit entertaining. Don't even buy the video. SUCKOLA!"

"stephie1175","8","2","7","9 January 2006"," Horror that sends a message
","When I first saw the preview for this film, I said to my guy ""this looks like ""Saw"", and he agreed.<br/><br/>Plot: Three single men, two American and one Icelandic travel to Amsterdam, Netherlands to get their freak on. When they return to their hostel, the manager locks them out because he will not let anyone in after midnight. In need of a place to rest, they manage to bunk at some other guys place. He tells them if they want to get freaky with a lot girls, Slovakia is where they should go. However little do they know, they are in for a real deadly surprise.<br/><br/>A lot of horror films have either he same plot or the same feel so that is why the movie is a bit cliché. While writer/director Eli Roth takes bits and pieces from other films like the two American backpackers (""An American Werewolf in London"", ""Eurotrip""), the Hotel (""Psycho""), the wax museum (""Tourist Trap"",""House of Wax""), the body parts (""Body Shop""/""Dr. Gore""), he shows the viewer that the women are smarter than the men, and how some serial killers are sexually turned on by the murder and torture. In this film Slovakian businessmen decide that instead of selling woman for sex, they will sell humans for dismemberment. The males will be sold to the homosexual men, and the females to the heterosexual men.<br/><br/>The movie starts off very slow and sluggish to the point where it is just boring. Where is the horror and suspense? It is at the middle, close to the end of the film. What happened? I read an article that an ""NC-17"" rating was supposed to be given but there was a lot of editing done to make the film ""R"" rated. There seemed to be too much editing, but there was still plenty of blood and guts to go around. Moreover like in ""An American Werewolf in London"", there is some dark humor. However, If you are a real horror fan, then wait for the directors cut. Also if you are a new horror buff, check out any Alfred Hitchcok film and see where it all began.<br/><br/>If you decide to see it in the theater be warned that what ever you do, don't eat popcorn or anything during or before this film."
"strong-122-478885","1","2","8","20 June 2014"," Ever Wonder What Roth's Parents Thought About Hostel?
","Since director Eli Roth's father (Dr. Sheldon Roth) is a prominent psychiatrist and clinical professor at Harvard Medical School, I'd sure like to hear this man's viewpoint (as a psychoanalyst, as well as a father) on Hostel, which is a perfect example of his son's sadistic mind and black heart. This film definitely promotes cruelty (of the worst kind) to others.<br/><br/>I'd really wonder if Dr. Roth would actually defend Hostel for his son's sake, or would he be able to offer those interested an honest, unbiased opinion of Eli's loathsome, hateful movie, which was clearly made by his son solely for the purpose of making a whole pile of money by handing us, the audience, (through the graphic depiction of hideous torture) the most excruciating example of human suffering imaginable.<br/><br/>With Eli's grandparents being immigrants from Austria, which is a country situated right next door to Slovakia (where Hostel's horrific story takes place), I'm also questioning whether this close proximity of Hostel's vile story to his grandparents' homeland was in some way Eli's screwy way of showing us all his utter contempt for his ancestors and his non-American heritage.<br/><br/>I understand that in his late teens Eli Roth was an on-line cybersex operator for Penthouse Magazine. In this undoubtedly rewarding line of work Eli posed as a woman. He was also a production assistant for a number of Penthouse porn films.<br/><br/>And, finally - It really figures that the likes of that slime-director, Quentin Tarantino, would have his name attached, as producer, to this truly vile and abominable picture. From start to finish, I could clearly see Tarantino's despicable, snot-encrusted presence smeared all over this one."

","(Note: my comments refer to the unfinished version of the movie. I've seen the final cut, and a bit of careful editing has resolved most of my issues.)<br/><br/>I saw this movie at the Toronto Film Festival this year, and I have only a few things to say that you can't get from the other comments and reviews: Drink a Red Bull for the first third of the movie, because it is BORING. All the character build-up stuff, all the development of the so-called plot, all the set-up as the characters travel across Europe to Slovakia... snore. The actors are decent, but the characters are just so two-dimensional and uninteresting that all the life injected into their performances is wasted. Worse yet, you aren't going to this movie to see interesting and deep characters, which makes the first 25 minutes of the movie even more wasteful.<br/><br/>But... when they get to their destination and strange things start occurring... well! Eli Roth is not much of a writer, but as a director and creator of gruesome and terrible things, he shines. The villains are evil, the ""heroes"" are disturbing, and the climax and denouement, such as it was, left everyone in the theatre shocked, aghast, and cheering.<br/><br/>Overall I give it 4/5 for style, and 2/5 for substance, resulting in my 6 overall score."

"jason-955","8","2","9","20 September 2005"," He borrows from the best... Horror beyond imagination
","You are unlikely to find another contemporary American horror movie with as much intensity and style as this one. While it pales against some of the contemporary Asian flicks it aspires towards (Ichi, Sympathy for Mr. Vengenace), Hostel is nonetheless a strong contender for the most intense American horror film made, with stylish gruesomeness intact. A fine addition to this year's Toronto International Film Festival Midnight Madness slot, even in the work-in-progress form.<br/><br/>While Cabin Fever had the usual slew of volunteer actors, I found that several performances in this flick were top notch, transcending the genre ghetto into real, capital-A ""acting"". Jan Vlasák is great as the creepy train-main, but particular note must be made of Jay Hernandez's ""Paxton"" role. I don't think I've ever seen a twenty something role played with as much believability in some time, he totally nails the American-in-Europe schtick without ever overdoing it. While some of his acting compatriots strut their stuff in scenes of agony, Hernandez actually rises above it all and creates a nuanced, completely authentic performance.<br/><br/>Shot in Prague, the locations are suitably decrepit. You can almost feel the smarmyness of the Hostel, the rank of the dungeons, the smell of the hash in the Amsterdam sex clubs. If you think too hard about the flick you'll find all kinds of clever interplay between the early scenes where the boys are lecherous schmucks to the setting of their eventual doom, but that would be silly. This is popcorn fun with popped-out eyeballs, ample buckets of blood without overdoing it to the point of comic overexuberence. At times, this film is downright badass.<br/><br/>In an age of PG-13 ""horror"" flicks taking the theatres by storm, it's hard to see what wide audience a flick of this nature will find. Still, it's got enough of a plot to keep it interesting, and enough intensity (when it finally arrives) to please all by the most jaded of genre fans. Not a masterpiece, but certainly a fun ride, and with the help of rabid support from the likes of Exec. Producer Q.T., it should do very well among a select audience of horror fans. Let's all hope that Roth continues to learn from the masters, and that he finds success in bringing this type of stylish gore to mainstream American cinemas."

I not only think this film is unique, a strongly held concept, and a situational horror that is not only realistic, but actually capable of happening... I believe it is a one-of-a-kind, edge of your seat, well-acted and well-written masterpiece. When your main characters are college-induced vacationers who enjoy the wonderful perks of youth, which of course include alcohol, drugs, and banging hot chicks, I believe the dialogue and actions are spot on when it comes to portraying the mindset that the average collegiate tool obtains.<br/><br/>I love the idea of humans taking the lives of others for a price. It takes you beneath the surface of human nature, and our need to attempt anything to get a spark of euphoria. What I think Eli was trying to accomplish is that some people do drugs, some people drink, some people have meaningless sex, and some people murder. It's all about what a human is willing to do at the expense of others to receive their own personal thrill. I very much applaud the acting, the script, the cinematography, and the concept.

"MaximumMadness","9","1","3","19 October 2016"," ""Hostel""- More than just gore (thought there is that aplenty), there's a little more going on here beneath the surface than most people will recognize...
","If there's one label that has been thrown around way too much the past decade and that I detest with my very being, it's the current trend of referring to everything as ""porn."" A new romantic comedy comes out? It's ""Girl Porn."" A new Stallone action-flick comes out? It's ""Action Porn."" A new R-rated horror flick? Of course, it's usually saddled with the inflammatory and unflattering moniker of ""torture porn.""<br/><br/>The trend more-or-less was set in motion in the mid-2000's, with the rise of a new stable of horror films that put their focus on extreme situations and circumstances, which often included a degree of torture or gore. Most people seem to point their fingers at 2004's release ""Saw"" as the start of this trend, however inaccurate though this may be. (It's actually quite a tame film.) In my mind, though, the 2005 film ""Hostel"", helmed by gore-maestro Eli Roth is probably when the popularity of this term unfortunately picked up, with its storyline based around a corrupt and vile company where the ability to torture and murder can be paid for by the rich elite of the world.<br/><br/>It was a controversial film to say the least. I remember the tension and the excitement and the backlash that built around it like it was yesterday. Angry parents condemned it for glorifying violence while film-goers hungry for something new and extreme offered glowing praise for pushing the boundaries. I even remember going into the theater opening night and seeing that there were literally cops on hand to kick out under-aged teens who tried to sneak in, and being double and triple-checked for ID practically every time you so much as turned your head. It stopped being a movie. It became an event in the world of film audiences. Something I hadn't ever seen before as a teenager at the time.<br/><br/>And yet, in the years that have passed, this initial rush of excitement has been replaced with a palpable sense of indifference and apathy from those same audience members who had so excitedly rushed to theaters to see it opening weekend. The cultural phenomena died down as people stopped seeing it as a special experience and dismissed it with that term I hate so much. People now crucify it in reviews as simply being ""shallow gore for the sake of gore.""<br/><br/>But I don't agree. Yes, it is most certainly a blatant, brutal and bloody film. And yes, it most certainly is exploitation cinema at its most obvious. But I do think there's a lot more going on under the surface than most people will see (or at least admit), and for me, it's actually held up quite well.<br/><br/>We follow a group of American college students (Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson) backpacking through Europe with their Icelandic friend Oli. (Eyþór Guðjónsson) Seeking no-strings fun and indulging in drugs and sex, the group are having the time of their life... without realizing how corrupt and selfish their actions are making them. Upon the suggestion of a young man they meet, they head to Slovakia and stay in a mysterious hostel where they are promised to be met with grand parties and beautiful women. But things are not what they seem, and soon they will learn that they have been lured into a vile trap... now targets of a devious company that sells humans for torture and murder to the highest bidder.<br/><br/>At its heart, ""Hostel"" is for all intents and purposes a very dark fable about morality and the things we take for granted in the modern world. It's also most certainly a commentary on American culture and consumerism as a whole, and concepts like American Exceptionalism and the idea that we as Americans are inherently ""superior"" or ""invincible."" At the time of its release, the US was in a very turbulent period in its history, with patriotism running high (many would argue too high to the point of being blinding) and a shaky government at war with various enemies. This is very much reflected in the film, which is brimming with a lot of subtle satire. It's actually very well developed and delivered.<br/><br/>The elements of horror and the performances are stellar as well. Roth has a good, slow-build to his narratives, and it gives the film a nice old-fashioned vibe in comparison to the increasingly complex and extreme content presented. <br/><br/>While it will continue to be dismissed, I do think that ""Hostel"" is far more clever a film than many will admit. And I think that for fans of horror... or even fans of film analysis in general, that it is a journey through depravity that is well worth taking.<br/><br/>I give it a very strong 9 out of 10."

","This is going to be an easy review because the film put me to sleep. Literally put me to sleep because of how boring it was. The acting is lame but whatever, we need to talk about the director, Eli Roth. After being boring for a while and watching the film, I checked my phone because I needed to check out Eli Roth's IMDb. And that explained everything this. The man is a proved failure as a director. Anyway, the film is very forgettable and will make you want to take a nap.. which isn't a good thing when it comes to a so-called horror movie. What a waste of time but at least I got some shuteye out of it. But more importantly, now I know I should avoid anything with Eli Roth's name on it. Talk about failing your way up."
"Leofwine_draca","10","1","3","1 August 2016"," A gripping horror-thriller, if you have the stomach for it
","A blood-and-guts horror film made by a horror fan for horror fans. That's probably the most fitting description I can come up with for this movie, which I had low expectations for; surprisingly, it turned out to be a very hard-hitting horror-cum-thriller with plenty to recommend it. Eli Roth (who first bloodied himself with CABIN FEVER) works with a low budget but brings style, verve, and atmosphere to his film, which benefits from some excellent Eastern European locations to add to the authenticity (yep, this film is shot in the same places that Van Damme and Seagal now shoot all of their films).<br/><br/>The film starts off in Euro Trip territory as two American jocks, and an insane Icelander (Eythor Gudjonsson playing Oli, who is EXCELLENT and steals all his scenes) go around boozing, doing drugs, and having sex with lots of beautiful women. Indeed, the first half of this film is chock-full of attractive beauties, who are willing to bare all for the camera. Roth builds up the tension with some eerie location shooting; this is a place with run-down streets and buildings and packs of kids going around mugging people. The music is old-fashioned but extremely suspenseful, really adding to the sense of isolated horror. When the torture scenes come in the film's second half, I was pleased to see that they were short and more powerful because of that; Roth shows plenty without giving too much away, and you'll really be wincing when a guy gets his legs drilled. There is one particular sequence (involving an eyeball) that goes way beyond the bounds of good taste into pure gross-out territory, and I could have done without that one but, but everywhere else, the violence has a point and is deeply unsettling.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty strong from the cast, with the exception of the annoying Derek Richardson. Jay Hernandez starts off as a typical jock character but he grows on you throughout the film, and it turns out he's actually a damn fine actor; I hope to see him go far. The rest of the cast are authentic foreigners, and stand-outs include the pair of beautiful girls, the American businessman, the German surgeon (weirdo!) and, of course, Jan Vlasak, as the Dutch businessman, who is extremely psychotic.<br/><br/>The latter third of this film gets really good, turning into your typical revenge-style thriller, with lots of chasing and violent death. Roth pumps up the adrenaline so that you end up cheering the hero on, willing him to escape from the bad guys. Seriously, when I came out of the cinema, I was so pumped up I was ready to beat anyone who looked at me funny it's that kind of film. Roth certainly knows how to please the crowd after making them wince, so when the good guys turn the tables on the bad, the film becomes sheer perfection. All in all it's uneven but strong, realistic, quite disturbing, and unpleasant through-and-through. I recommend it for those with strong enough stomachs"

","Hearty party animal Paxton (a solid performance by Jay Hernandez), his wimpy friend Josh (likable Derek Richardson), and their happy-go-lucky Icelandic buddy Oli (a lively and engaging portrayal by Eythor Gudjonsson) run afoul of an underground murder for profit business in Slovakia while backpacking through Europe.<br/><br/>Writer/director Eli Roth's no-holds-barred ferocious and unflinching cinematic kick to the stomach not only serves as a trenchant cautionary tale on the perils of ugly Americans happily indulging in all kinds of crass behavior abroad without thinking of the potentially severe consequences until it's too late (for example, the protagonists go to Slovakia with the specific goal of getting laid), but also offers a profoundly disturbing commentary on how people are willing to pay big money in order to act out their worst, most base, and downright cruel impulses simply because they can. Moreover, Roth deserves extra praise for showing just enough of the torture set pieces so that the viewer gets the basic idea without being too grossed out. The grimy subterranean setting projects a potently unsettling sense of dread, isolation, and vulnerability. In addition, there are chilling contributions by Jan Vlasak as a blithely sadistic Dutch businessman, Barbara Nedeljakova as the enticing, yet dangerous Natalya, and Rick Hoffman as a jaded, but still eager and excited American client. Nerve-shredding stuff."

","I don't write reviews usually, but when I saw the low ""Hostel"" reviews, I had to express and speak out. I am sickly obsessed with movies of every genre. I am an ACADEMY AWARD fanatic. If it won it, I've seen it. I've seen every horror movie that everyone needs to see. The twists in Sixth Sense and Scream are timeless; two of my favorites. I like very well made movies; American Beauty, Dead Poets Society, The Usual Suspects, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Good Will Hunting. I am a huge fan of all movies as you can see. I am VERY picky about acting and LIKABLE characters. As far as horror movies go, HOSTEL has the creepiest people I have ever seen. Did you like Hannibal Lector or Buffalo Bill in the silence of the lambs? I find the characters in Hostel MUCH creepier. A Dutch business-man on a train whom when eats his salad with his fingers says ""I prefer to us my hands."" Where did they find this guy? He's SO CREEPY. When 2 of 3 friends have lost their friend Olli, they are convinced that they are chasing him through alley ways and a building, only to find when they catch up to him it is someone else. A creepy man who looks like him from behind and WEARING OLLI'S CLOTHES! When he turns around, he looks very creepy. When PAXTON asks the man where he got the jacket, the man replies with a creepy accent, ""This is MY jacket."" Then smiles the scariest untrustworthy smile showing rotten teeth. The DESK CLERK at the Hostel is PERFECT! Suspicious, and creepy, replying, ""I think they left.. this morning."" -with an obvious lie behind his words. This is the MOST CREEPY movie EVER. A suspicious Hotel is a great idea for a horror movie. What is going on at the Hostel? Very well made. Very well written. Very Original. 10 out 10 horror stars."

They are told the area is filled with incredibly attractive women who love having sex with American men.

","The premise of all three Hostel movies is rather absurd. The gore is over the top and at times it seems medically inaccurate. They build on the classic slasher film formula and through the use of ball gags and fetish suits, become fantastic examples of torture porn. If you accept the fact that its all just a story, I suppose the film can be thought of as frightening. The idea of such a powerful institution created for the sole purpose of catering to the needs of sadists and psychopaths is a spooky one, but a series of B rate performances and C rate characters makes the story difficult to sell. The Hostel movies do nothing new with the horror genre, the idea is fantastic, though so much so that we have to acknowledge how ridiculous it is. A good fright, but there are so many better movies in the horror genre, if you consider yourself a fan. Watch these movies when you have plenty of popcorn and nothing to do."

"CptFastbreak","8","1","3","11 June 2012"," Not half bad, though not as violent as you might think
","Although I'm a huge Horror fan, I never really got warm with the whole ""torture porn."" It was therefore relatively late that I got to see both Saw and Hostel, probably the best known exponents of the genre, and both I only watched them because they are so well known and I wanted to know what everyone was talking about.<br/><br/>I found Saw to be better than I expected, which isn't generally saying much, but at least it didn't suck. As for Hostel, I read somewhere that Eli Roth liked Saw, but found the final ""twist"" (which I obviously can't talk about) to be silly and unbelievable. A sentiment I strongly agree with, so I had to see this one as well. And I was positively surprised with it, more so than with Saw.<br/><br/>The story is that three backpackers tour Europe in search of women to have sex with, and drugs to consume. The first half hour or so introduces the characters and their motivation, as they get stoned and rent prostitutes in Amsterdam. A slightly creepy Russian dude they meet tells them of a hostel near Bratislava, that doesn't appear in any guide book, and is supposed to be some sort of insider tip for hedonistic travelers. The description entices them enough to cancel their previous plans and travel there immediately. At first it appears to be everything that was promised, as they hook up with beautiful girls and take lots of drugs in a disco, but gradually, the atmosphere becomes more threatening, until the first of their friends disappears.<br/><br/>I won't go into any detail as for the events that follow except that it involves violence and torture, as should be expected from the genre. Both are, however, not too graphic or shocking, especially if you have seen films such as Tokyo Gore Police, or pretty much anything by Takashi Miike (who has a cameo here BTW). A lot of the violent acts are shown in gore discretion shots, which makes you wonder why the camera suddenly pans away if you're familiar with aforementioned films. In the first part of the film, we get treated to lots of gratuitous nudity, even by horror film standards, which my girlfriend didn't like all that much, but as for me personally, things could be worse.<br/><br/>The acting is generally decent, especially considering that there's no big names among the actors. Particularly outstanding was Rick Hoffman as The American Client, as remarked by lots of other reviewers. But I also liked Jan Vlasak as The Dutch Businessman, who was very creepy from the first shot he appeared in. Also, Eli Roth has shown again that he knows how to integrate dark humor and suspenseful horror - a feat that is in no way easy and can fail spectacularly at times. Yes, I'm looking at you Rob Zombie. What ultimately sold me, however, is that he builds up tension and suspense very well, and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. This is also what mainly sets it apart from Saw, which I found kind of tedious at times. Not to mention the solution to the plot - say what you will about Hostel, it is a lot more believable than Saw's silly twist. On a side note, the beatings Hostel takes while Saw is generally praised makes me think less and less of the cumulative IMDb ratings, and is one of the reasons I wrote this review.<br/><br/>A final word to common points of criticism from other reviewers. Lots of people seem to complain that it wasn't made by Quentin Tarantino. I don't know how they managed to write this in reviews, as they must clearly be illiterate: the movie starts with the words ""presented by Quentin Tarantino"" followed by ""written and directed by Eli Roth."" Seriously, have you ever considered how many films and TV shows Alfred Hitchcock ""presented"" without having anything obvious to do with it? It is a common device in Hollywood. Also, I don't get the complaint by Slowakians. Sure, it is portrayed as a pretty bleak and impoverished place, but who in their right mind would watch Hostel as a source of real world information on Eastern Europe? Roth clearly takes artistic liberties here. Deliverance portrayed inhabitants of Georgia as inbred rapist crackers and you don't hear them endlessly complaining about it.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you don't buy into the hype and don't expect too much, you will find that you could have spend 90 minutes far worse than watching this. If you squirmed at the violence in Kill Bill, and somehow expected another Tarantino flick, this isn't for you. If you thought Koroshiya Ichii was too tame and hope to see a more violent and gory film, stay with Japanese productions. But if you're looking for a nice, suspenseful horror flick with a small dose of dark humor, and don't mind looking at naked girls in between, this is worth a try.<br/><br/>Final Rating: 7/10 might watch again, but I added a star in the final rating to countermand the plethora of unjustified one star ratings."

","One of the scariest and grossest films ever made. With a chilling soundtrack and freaky and haunting settings, the 1st delivery of the Hostel trilogy sets the pace for a world of horror, suspense and yuckiness.<br/><br/>I don't know if most people would realize, but the errors in geography were very noticeable and off-putting when it comes to the movie (it was shot in the Czech Republic).<br/><br/>When the guys are cruising Amsterdam, the first glimpse you get is of the streets of Prague (AMS and PRG are NOTHING alike at all!!!). Then you have Paxton speaking German with the hostel owner (instead of Dutch, as it should be in the Netherlands), then you see how everything in ""Slovakia"" is read in Czech (the town used for the movie was the Cesky Krumlov famous for its music festivals). Yeah I know, for the average viewer this is a whatever comparison but those of us who've been all through Europe will find this ridiculous.<br/><br/>Not to mention the Czech train station plastered with German signs (to make it look like it was Austria, yet had Czech signs all over).<br/><br/>Going back to the movie: It is interesting how two Americans would get so concerned over some Icelandic guy they've met like 2 days ago. Like Paxton says in the movie ""this is how people do it here"" but in America they have that tendency to do that as well. Anyways, the desire to get laid is what get them dead in the first place. There is no explanation at all as to why there's a hunting club, who manages it or why is the hostel involved (that is solved in Hostel Part 2). <br/><br/>SPOILER: While it is very unlikely that Paxton would be able to leave Europe after killing 14 people in his rampage, we feel happy for him once he leaves -fingerless- to his country.<br/><br/>This movie rescues something that had been lost for decades when it came to the horror genre. After the thrillers from the 70's and 80's, the 90's felt to deliver good horror flicks. They came across as humorous and tacky. While Hostel in 2005, rescued some of that including some movies coming out at the same time like Ringu, The Grudge or REC. Gore sells.<br/><br/>Anyways, despite the horrific geographical errors (to sum it up.. you can certainly TELL the difference between the Netherlands and Germany - both 1st world countries- and the Czech or the Slovak Republic which are notoriously poorer and less advanced) this is a movie worth watching every time, and as the head of the Bubble Gum Gang said, worth every ""Dolla!!!!!"""

","I don't want to spend too much of my time or energy on this review because this terrible movie doesn't deserve even the 24 words I've already typed. Slasher films historically were low budget, inconsequential forgettable nonsense that Hollywood depended upon to bring in just enough teenage cash to cover their costs and maybe help finance another more creative, worthy endeavor. But Hostel actually aspires to something more. It actually has lofty ideals, and it sincerely strives to be profound. It wants to be taken seriously. And that's the sickest, most depraved aspect of a film that has no moral or ethical qualms about plunging to the lowest depths of depravity in its quest to shock the most unshockable, desensitized, deadened generation of film goers ever. Director Eli Roth has exquisitely exploited the most modern technological cinematic methods in crafting his damaged, deranged Frankenstein of a film. It barely lives in any human sense. It lurches and lumbers like a lobotomized linebacker, slowly and deliberately strangling the life out any sentient being in its path. By the last half hour I felt so ashamed and so disgusted to be in the same species as the wretched creature that contrived this horrendous mistake. It's just so deeply, sadly, desperately sick. Just like the deeply, desperately sick society that would ever consider this mess to be anything else but a complete tragic abortion.<br/><br/>So maybe Hostel is deep and profound in that regard, the way it reflects just how hopelessly corrupt is our culture and how it's all coming to a horrible, grisly end so much faster than anyone cares to imagine. The feeling of helpless despair I have for our poor, crippled world I also feel for the makers and fans of this poor, crippled film."

It also made me think, does this stuff actually happen in real life? This is Eli Roths best movie to date. His first film Cabin Fever was terrible. However he came a long way with this film. If you want to see a film unfolds as it progresses and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through from beginning to end, I would recommend Hostel.

","Hostel 11/25/2009<br/><br/>Eli Roth is one sick bastard! This is exactly why he is one of my favorite directors. He is a complete horror fanatic and it. His first film Cabin Fever is an instant classic which will be reviewed on this blog in the coming weeks. Both Hostel films carry the ""Quentin Tarantino Presents"" credit; which of course adds a little street cred to them.<br/><br/>This was one of the first movies, along with Saw, to carry the lame media label of ""torture porn"". Extreme gore and sadistic violence used to shock the audience. Seriously, you know there's going to be some sick disturbing stuff in this flick. So if that offends you don't frickin' see it! The story revolves around three college grads who are backpacking through Europe. These are really good guys, that you could actually see yourself hanging out with. They are played by Jay Hernandez (Paxton), Derek Richardson (Josh), and Eythor Gudjonsson (Oli). The first half of the movie is set up like a skin flick on Cinemax with lots of gratuitous nudity and debauchery. The guys start out in Amsterdam, enough said. Paxton seems to be the leader of the group. Josh is a little more reserved, as he was just coming off a long relationship. Oli (the king of the swing) is most responsible for the comic relief. They meet a local guy named Alex at a club. He directs them to Bradislava, Slovakia for all the hot women they can take. He states that with all the wars, there are few men for so many beautiful women. This scene makes a strong statement that most young Americans have no idea what is happing in the world today. As there actually haven't been any wars in Slovakia for the past 50 years. This movie has a very strong social commentary on the youth of America. Americans seem to think they have a bullet proof sense of entitlement when traveling abroad. While many people in many other countries despise Americans and their cockiness. <br/><br/>On the train to Bratislava, a small picturesque town in Slovakia, they meet an older business man. The man strikes up a conversation and proceeds to eat a salad with his hands. Josh freaks out when the man touches his knee (a little homophobic) and the man excuses himself. <br/><br/>They arrive in Bratislava and check in at the local hostel. This place is quite nice but they will have roommates. When they get to their room they walk in on two hot foreign girls changing. These are the bait girls. They invite the guys down to the spa and they instantly pair up and that night party at a local disco. Josh goes to get some fresh air and is threatened by the Bubble Gum Gang, a group of local kids that extort the tourists. He is saved by Mr. Saladhands. Coincidence? The guys all end up sleeping with the girls, but as morning breaks, Oli is missing. The next night the girls slip something into the two guy's drinks. Paxton gets himself locked into a supply closet, saving his life. While Josh doesn't have such luck. Josh in brought into a dank, dark, dungeon like complex and is chained to a chair. Mr. Saladhands then has his devilish way with him. He always wanted to be a surgeon, but has unsteady hands.<br/><br/>Paxton's search for his friends comes up empty and he eventually confronts the now less than glamorous women they been partying with that last few days. She leads him to an ""art show"" at this old factory, where we get a cameo appearance by legendary Japanese horror director Takashi Miike. This crumbling building houses the operations of Elite Hunting, a worldwide organization that offers the experience of killing for a price. If you want to kill a local its cheap, while killing an American will cost you. Paxton is able to escape his torture cell, minus a few fingers. He finds out his friends are dead and plans his escape. The clients of Elite Hunting are seen as regular people with regular lives. This is part of the plot of the sequel which will be reviewed next. <br/><br/>The Hostel films bring forth a frightening question. For wealthy adrenaline junkies that have traveled to world; what would be the ultimate high? Writer/ Director Eli Roth came up with the idea for this story from a foreign website that offered such services. Whether this site was legit is up for speculation."
"Davebop","8","1","3","18 November 2009"," What a gruesome horror movie should be
","As a fan of horror (good and bad) and gore-fests I was looking forward to seeing Hostel when i first heard about it, but then two things were putting me off. Firstly, Eli Roth as director, having seen Cabin Fever which could have been really good but turned out a massive disappointment I was worried the same would happen here. Secondly, a lot of reviews had described the film as 90 minutes of pointless gore and torture and that was not what I wanted to see.<br/><br/>Thankfully neither of these things came to fruition. With Hostel, Eli Roth has stepped up as a director both in the way the film was shot and how the story was told. Whilst there are some gaping holes in the plot, the story flows throughout and doesn't descend into violence and gore for the sake of it. The torture scenes are very cleverly shot, showing you just enough to start turning your stomach, but leaving some to your imagination if you dare try and think about it.<br/><br/>This film delivered what it set out to and exceeded my expectations, it is what a gruesome horror movie should be. That said it is sill a teen horror movie and won't ever escalate into the more grown up genre of films such as The Omen or Alien, but then I don't think that was its intention."
"hasosch","10","1","3","6 October 2009"," The horror dropping out of slavering mouths
","""Hostel"" (2005) consists of two parts. And just let me say it frankly: A first part that could not have been made in a more stupid way and almost caused me stopping the movie, and a second part which belongs to the best horror I have ever seen, and believe me, I am experienced. That the director had chosen Slowakia as a background for the second part shows anew that Eastern Europe is not just a cheap place for making a movie (with horrible wages for the indigenous stunts and no Eastern Europeans in the main roles), but delivers a scenery of Medieval castles, Kafkaesque towns and wide-spread farm-land as far the eye-sight reaches. The place where the movie was shot belong one thousand years long to Hungary until it had been taken away during the Trianon treaty in 1920. Since then, what has been called Slowakia for a few decades, has been and is degenerate, corrupt and brutal, and frankly, I would not be astonished if the horror that the movie depicts is been based on true events. On the other side, Slowakia or Upper-Hungary was also the place of the Hungarian countess Erzsebet Bathory who was one of the first known series killers. The Eastern European earth is imbued with history, every pebble tells you a story, so it is no wonder that Herzog shot his remake of Murnau's Nosferatu in the Slowakian Carpathians.<br/><br/>What makes the horror in ""Hostel"" so powerful is that it is not realistic like practically all horror movies that had been issued in the last decades, but naturalistic in the literary sense of the term. The camera stands behind the tormentors and turns so long until each angle of the gruesome scene is floodlighted and exhausted. The director, Eli Roth, does not make the mistake to try to give his naturalistic shots an aesthetic icing by heaving it off the actual scene. When you see the acts, you are really shocked, the movie achieves a hardly ever reached immediacy. Foreign businessmen travel to Slowakia simply and solely because in a decrepit factory amidst the trash that the communists left, there are kidnapped young foreign people imprisoned whom you are allowed to torture uninhibited by any moral bond if you just pay enough. You even see the pathologic lust dropping out of the slavering mouths, when the tormentors finally stand at the goal of their life-long dreams to get an orgasm from drilling out the eyes or burning through the Achilles tendons of innocent people.<br/><br/>""Hostel"" is without doubt one of the top-horror-movies of all times."

","Please stay away from this film at all costs. It is honestly one of the worst films I have seen, with little to no redeeming qualities. The characters are flat. The dialogue is generic. The acting is mediocre. The gore is laughably fake. The story is next to non-existent.<br/><br/>To be fair, the idea was a decent one, which is why I give this movie a 2/10. The concept of an international torture ring is genuinely engaging. However, the idea fails before it is even introduced into the movie. It starts off in what was supposed to be the Netherlands, but extreme inattention to detail resulted in many many inaccuracies. We get some soft-core pornography to start the movie off with some T & A for..... some reason. We are also introduced to several dull, stereotypical and unsympathetic characters. After a lame discussion between these characters, we learn that there are apparently no males in Slovakia due to a ""war""..... which one, I'm not sure. So, our dull, stupid characters go to Slovakia for the noble cause of scoring some pussy. Follows, several minutes of generic and pointless dialogue.<br/><br/>Then comes the gore. For a few seconds when the main character enters the torture building, we get the feeling that the film might actually become good at this point.... it doesn't. We see the violence from a distance at first and the directing is quite good- very creepy. Then however, the crap-fest continues. Horrible acting is complimented by lame special effects and dumb horror-movie clichés. I'm not going to spoil the ending, but rest assured it's no better than the rest of this garbage.<br/><br/>In short, this movie has mediocre acting and directing, little story, no character development- no scratch that, no real characters at all. It is completely inaccurate in just about everything it portrays from violence to the Dutch speaking German to portraying Slovakia as a 3rd world hellhole. There is even a little WTF sequence where a group of bubble gum-addicted gypsy kids rob people by broad daylight.... of course, at that point in the movie, it didn't really even surprise me. Please do not watch this movie. It is not scary, cool, deep or anything. Lastly, just because Tarantino attached his name to this turd, doesn't make it any the better."

","I was so looking forward to this film, but it was a great disappointment. Don't waste your breath, energy, or time on it. It was bloody ridiculous, it did not really concentrate or concentrated on anything really. One of the worst horror movie ever. I do enjoy some of Eli Roth's work, but the was completely b.s. So was the second. I was all Porno if you ask me. More than 2/3 of the film is Porno and men getting there jollies on it. There was not much torture in it as I was expecting. So if you want to watch this or was looking forward at all, don't bother. I couldn't go to the movies to watch the dumb movie so I was dumb enough to buy the DVD.

"jonathanruano","4","1","3","15 March 2009"," Hostel -- Review
","The infamous ""Hostel"" is about two teenagers (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) and their Icelandic companion (Eythor Gunjonsson) traveling across Europe in search of women for the most basic reason: sexual intercourse, of course. They end up in Slovakia where they get exactly want they want. However, they soon discover that the endless sex is too good to be true, because the girls intend to lure them into a particular nasty trap that makes all three men into torture slaves for this underground ""Hound"" network.<br/><br/>Now some reviewers have given this film very high ratings; others have called it utter trash. The truth lies somewhere in between. The first half of the film was actually very good. Director Eli Roth (who also wrote the screenplay) succeeds in building up the suspense and you get a strange feeling that things are not what they seem. Aside from that, the viewer beholds some lovely cinematography of Slovakia.<br/><br/>But once the dark secret of the film is revealed, the film descends into the familiar monster fest of blood, gore and body parts. Now some people like that, but frankly I don't. This is one of those movies that uses torture, blood and gore not to advance the film's plot in a meaningful way (much like Eastern Promises did), but simply to entertain viewers by shocking them. These horror tactics have gone on for more than three decades now, perhaps the most infamous example being Caligula. But frankly it takes more than cutting off fingers or pulling an eye from its socket to create a good film. In other words, the problem is that the plot exists for the sole purpose of serving the film director's sadistic fantasies. It would have been much better (especially if much of the gore and blood was edited out) if the sadistic scenes actually advanced the plot (as they did in Hitchcock's Psycho, in The Godfather parts 1 and 2, Scarface, or Dressed to Kill). Instead, what the viewer gets is a pile of sadistic trash. Aside from that, the film is very offensive to Slovaks and Slovakia in general."

","I really can't understand the hate on Hostel. Sure Eli Roth is a dumb ass. Sure, Hostel has a bad setup, some crappy acting, some awful dialog and a some unneeded nudity but come on. What about Last House on the Left (Another movie I liked). It has very bad acting, even worse than the acting in Hostel. There's a lot of great horror movies with bad acting. The Evil Dead, anyone? What i'm trying to say is Hostel is not an excellent movie, it's not great and it's not a classic but it's not one of the worst movies ever made. And it's not a ""torture porn"" flick. Because if Hostel is torture porn then Last House on the Left and Cannibal Holocaust are torture porn too. Hostel is better than any of those awful remakes that came out in this decade.

But they don't know that this vacation maybe the last for them. I wasn't expecting much of this movie because I'm not a big fan of this kind of films, because usually in this kind of films there is only violence and a mindless plot what is OK, but still kinda boring. I was surprised how good this movie was. First of all because they didn't hurry with a story trying to pass to the killing and torture scenes as fast as possible. There was many realistic violent scenes and it really was shocking, just try to put yourself in their position, it made me sick. So it's kinda worth viewing horror film."
"ed_zeppelin","2","1","3","26 October 2008"," ""I am the king of the swing!""
","I hadn't planned to watch Hostel, particularly after cringing all the way through Cabin Fever a few years ago - but after noticing that it was on TV, I decided to see what the fuss was about. Very quickly, I realised that my opinion of Hostel was going to be based pretty much solely on how I reacted to its portrayal of extreme violence, which in the event generated a sense of indifference I began to find rather troubling after a while.<br/><br/>Eli Roth's petulance is something to behold. If you don't like his films, you're ""out of touch"", apparently. Because this is art, yeah? It's metaphorical, yeah? It's probably symbolic of something too, maybe, probably, yeah? I don't know if this has occurred to Roth, but if he wants to claim that those trained, articulate, professional critics who bayoneted this film back in 2005 ""don't get it"", then maybe Hostel isn't doing its job properly.<br/><br/>I can, if I'm generous, see the basic genesis of some kind of artistic statement here that only goes as far as Roth's limited ability can take it. All the obvious touches are there that suggest a film trying to pass itself off as high art - dramatic reversal of roles, characters who talk in silly epigrams, that sort of thing - but Hostel never becomes the modern day Texas Chainsaw Massacre it wants to be by dint of being extremely badly written: the actors maul their way through dialogue that clunks like a broken clock, while all the time being characterised as weird cartoons. (A quick glance through IMDb's ""memorable quotes"" section reveals just how banal the dialogue is.) The narrative is just as shabby, as time and time again our hero is rescued in the nick of time by a chance event (such as a knock on a door) happening at exactly the right moment. After a while this kind of contrivance just distances me from a story that's supposed to suck me in and unnerve me; Roth lacks his mentor Quentin Tarantino's ability to present the Postmodern and therefore just comes across as crude and shoddy, rather than subversive and self-analytical.<br/><br/>I won't say much more, except that I'll grant one more star than Cabin Fever got because it doesn't strike me as being quite as smug. Ultimately though, if you don't get turned on by the extreme on screen violence, then there isn't much in the film I can recommend to you. If you do get turned on by the extreme on screen violence, then stay a very long way away from me."

When the nasty stuff starts it gets even more boring and stupid and sick, sick, sick. There is no plot line, no real story. What was the point of it? I stuck through to the OTT ending.

"Jacques98","9","1","3","1 September 2008"," Beats ""Battle Royale"" where intelligence is concerned.
","First of all, let me say that contrary to what reviews are stating, this is possibly one of the most intelligent horror movies out there. While foreign horror movies like Frontier(s) get perfect ratings because of they're not the norm here in America, thus SEEMING superior, they lack the intelligence that this lower rated movie had.<br/><br/>Hostel is essentially a parable. The movie is divided into equal 45-minute halves that both parallel in every way, except they have different subjects: sex and violence. From the scenery to the events, they're pretty much a mirror imagejust reversed. I'll talk about both.<br/><br/>Sex People complain about (or enjoy) the nudity, calling it semi-porn. Being someone who really doesn't like nudity in films, I can say that it isn't quite up to porn level because it simply pretends to be porn. You can decide for yourself if that justifies it as being porn or not, BUT, Hostel uses nudity for a reason. I think one of the strongest things the film has going for it was to back up the point that all naked women are the same. Porn, your wife, some whore, your daughter . . . all the same. It showed that amazingly well through the nudity. I think I was most impressed that it used the nudity for a reason, unlike other movies.<br/><br/>Violence Whoever says this is more violent than any of the Saw movies, please tell me you're joking. It roughly is just about as violent as the first Saw, but after that the Saw franchise makes this look babyish. There are cut-off scenes, scenes that simply show NONE of the gore on screen, scenes where it doesn't show the graphic details. In no way shape or form way this pushing gore on screen. If they took out about a minute more of it, I'd honestly say it could have gotten a hard PG-13 because it uses PG-13 strategies to try NOT to show the gore. But intelligently, it uses the violence to mirror the sex and make its point.<br/><br/>Overall, it had a trite, almost cute, way to wrap the entire movie up. ""I got some pussy the other day, but I don't even remember what color her tits were, man. But THIS, this I'll remember forever."" When given the opportunity, violence replaces sex.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of movies that pretend to be smart. No Country For Old Men was one of them. But those kinds of movies aren't smart simply because they lack anything new to saythey repeat trite clichés. Death, love, blah, blah, blah. And though Hostel lacks any kind of a plot twist, I think the major twist was that it DID have something original to say about the correlation between sex and violence. It said something about human nature I've never heard before.<br/><br/>In the end, it feels almost like Saw's brother. They're utterly different but somehow linked by similar gore and their morals. I'd take this over yet another tired old man movie that thinks it's so intelligent but just repeated a cliché, like There Will Be Blood, any day.<br/><br/>9/10"
"sneakythief-1","9","1","3","26 August 2008"," The most effective horror movie I have ever seen
","There are a few things I love about this movie, and most of them are pretty unusual. Probably the thing I love most about it is the fact that so many people hate it; if you speak the words ""Hostel"" and ""Eli Roth"" in the same sentence, so many people crap on about how it is the worst movie ever, it's disgusting, its repulsive, I never want to see it again, and so forth.<br/><br/>The funny thing about that is, in going on about how disgusting it all is, they're just pointing out what is so good about it. This is a genuinely effective horror film, and the fact that so many people in this day and age are disgusted by it proves that there hasn't been a horror movie nearly as effective as this in years. The fact is that these days, people aren't used to seeing a horror movie that actually does what a horror movie is meant to do, so when they see something like Hostel, they can't take it.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about it is why it is so effective. Think about Hostel in comparison to other similar films. The example I'm thinking of is Saw 3, because it came out around the same time. Saw 3 is a significantly more violent film than Hostel, yet it doesn't have anywhere near the impact that Hostel does. This is because it relies on straight blood and gore to get it from point A to point B (point A being calm audience, point B being audience going ""ew"" on regular occasions). Hostel, however, plays on our biological urges to intensify the feeling of horror. Many people describe this film as ""part pornography, part gornography"". Its pretty accurate description, because the first half of the film does have a lot of nudity and sex. Many people call this gratuitous and pointless - how wrong they are. They obviously haven't thought about the fact that the purpose of pornography is sexual excitement. Hostel is about human beings getting excited by the idea of hurting each other, so when the second half of the film portrays graphic violence and the first half portrays soft pornography, the result is that by the end of the film the viewer is left all the more horrified by the violent second half because not only was it disturbing by itself, it is all the more disturbing that the violence appeared almost attractive.<br/><br/>I will also just say that when I say the violence is ""graphic"", ignore anyone who says that this is a film based on violence. It's not. Certainly it is a violent film, but it is not an hour and a half of non-stop butchery.<br/><br/>Another thing that is great about this film is the setting. The fact that the main characters are backpackers in Europe makes them appear all the more vulnerable, and I love that the film is almost like a light comedy until they wake up and one of them has disappeared. There's that unsettling feeling of not knowing what has happened and having no way to find out what happened. And the hostel itself, which was initially a fairly warm and comforting if still apparently weird place, suddenly seems like a claustrophobic, inescapable prison. Furthermore, by the end it feels like everyone everywhere is an enemy, and there's just nowhere to go.<br/><br/>The character development in Hostel is also superb. The contrast between the character of Paxton at the start and end of the film is startling. He begins as just another young man in Europe following his sexual urges around, and I don't want to give away how the film ends, but lets just say he's a long way from where he started, and the transition is completely natural.<br/><br/>I could probably go on for a lot longer, but the most important thing I can tell you about Hostel is to ignore anything you've been told about (except, hopefully, this review). If you're a fan of horror, do yourself a favour and sit down and see its best entry in many many years. If you don't want to be genuinely affected, steer clear."

","I don't consider myself too pretentious when it comes to film; but I have studied film at both a secondary and post-secondary level. So, I feel like I've had just preparation when it comes to judging the calibre of a film. What that being said, this is by far and away the worst film I have ever seen. Ever.<br/><br/>Eli Roth is the horror genre's Ed Wood. The only difference being Plan 9 From Outer Space is awful for all the right reasons, Hostel is awful for all the wrong reasons- and hopefully they won't glorify Eli Roth with a film about his life.<br/><br/>The film begins with gratuitous pornography. Don't get me wrong, the dime-a-dozen fake boobed blondes are nice to look at, but I could watch that at midnight on cable TV, I don't need to spend money to see it. So after getting laid often (the girls in those scenes may have been the worst actors in the film, by the way) the boys (who I think technically are our protagonists though there's no plot development to warrant that title) decide to travel across Europe to get with other hot chicks. Uh oh, I smell horror film cliché! That then turns into gratuitous torture. No, I didn't skip how they get there, the film elaborates on the plot about as well as I did. This was when I wretched my guts out. Not at the incessant gore, because while disgusting I frankly wasn't the least bit scared. The only thing that frightened me was that everyone around me in the theater seemed to enjoy it. What happened to the days of Hitchcock, or Wes Craven, where the build up was the best part. It wasn't watching the person get hacked to pieces that made it scary, it was the build up that really got to you.<br/><br/>The torture just went from slightly disturbing (I will admit that the achilles scene got to me a little bit) to flat out humorous. After a certain point I couldn't remember if I was watching a horror movie or Jeffrey Dahmer's wet dream. At one point Quentin Tarantino had class... or more class. Reservoir Dogs had its moments, as did Pulp Fiction, but there was depth to those movies. Reservoir Dogs made an actual point to develop each character. I don't want to know what back-room negotiation techniques Eli Roth participated in to get Tarantino to give this piece of trash his backing.<br/><br/>The ending had no plot twist, nothing. Unlike Saw 1 or 2 (I won't dignify the third or fourth) there was no intention to wow us at the end. Although after a certain point of watching Hostel I just didn't care. The only reason I didn't leave in the middle of this movie is because I'm too stubborn to admit I'd wasted 10 dollars.<br/><br/>Hostel was one of the original movies to follow the new horror film trend, which is to avoid actually scaring us, and trying to just make us sick. There's nothing terrifying about the gore in these films, in fact most often the acting is so bad I'm glad to see the characters getting what's coming to them for taking my money. The only thing that is actually scary is that there are people sick enough to want to make these types of movies, and sick enough to pay money to watch them.<br/><br/>I'm ashamed to have given my money to Eli Roth, and more ashamed that somehow this movie garnered a sequel."

"RainDogJr","8","1","3","20 October 2007"," In a way disappointing but in general aspects good
","""Hostel"" came to Mexico in 2005 whit a lot of expectations because Quentin Tarantino presents the film and also because a lot of people who already see this film said that this film was the most disturbing film ever. Finally the certification in Mexico was D, just for adults; it was the first not porno film that have this certification in Mexico so i couldn't see this film in the cinema. Well first, for me this film wasn't the most violent ever and in consequence is not so disturbing as the publicity said, and of course i think that the certification was excessive. In that way i feel really disappointed when i watch ""Hostel"" in DVD for the first time. I mean, ""Hostel"" is as disturbing as the mainstream could be and even the most disturbing photo that appears in some posters and later in the DVD cover (the man with a drill in his mouth) doesn't appear in the film.<br/><br/>But that doesn't mean that i don't like this film, for me is very entertaining and in general aspects is good and could be better without the excessive publicity. The plot is simple but good, two young Americans and another from Iceland are on vacation in Europe, first in Amsterdam where they only want to have girls and later in Slovakia because a guy told to them that in an hostel in that city they could find the most beautiful girls in Europe. In Slovakia they are part of a business for sick people that want to kill a person. The Americans are the most expensive so the girls of the hostel help to put the Americans in that business. There are like three chapters in the film; first Amsterdam where is only parties and fun and looks as a teenage film, later Slovakia where also is some fun whit the girls but the fear and the bad feelings start to affect the character's mind and the film start getting good and finally in the factory where there's only pain.<br/><br/>I like the idea of Eli Roth to put this kind of original business in a film: you pay for kill a person and the prices are different according to the nationality of the person. I read once in a newspaper that the story was based on a true story of a place that Eli Roth finds in internet where yo pay for shot a unknown person. I mean that is truly scary, to know that places like this really exist.<br/><br/>Well the cast is just good, mostly young actors and the makeup and the visual part of the film is really well done. Also i love the cameo of Takashi Miike, even he can't speak English, he accept to participate with Eli Roth who is a fan of ""Ichi the Killer"".<br/><br/>Conclusion: thanks to an excessive publicity ""Hostel"" was disappointing but anyway i don't recommend this film to sensitive audiences. And for me the film is good, very entertaining and worth a look. 8.5 out of 10<br/><br/>DVD: great, whit a lot of comments by Eli Roth, Quentin Tarantino, producers and the cast.

"dewit_jacco","1","1","3","15 August 2007"," A bad, bad, very bad movie.
","Even though there was some minor gore - nothing worth talking about however - this awful movie has been an completely waste of time and money. Of mine, as well of the makers, actors and producers of this so called film, being no more than a piece of junk.<br/><br/>Okay, this movie mightn't have had the intention to be known as one of great script and/or story line and it had it's arrows probably aimed at being gory to the max, but it hasn't at all succeeded in doing so. There was less gore in this whole movie than there was in the first ten minutes of, for example, Bad Taste (which also had a pretty meek story line to it, but nevertheless managed to turn out to be one (to me even THE) of the classics in gore).<br/><br/>Hostel is a very, very bad movie with an awful plot, countless errors in continuity and and a massive amount of absolutely nonsensical scenes and actions (like there is the miraculous escape of Paxton with Kana ...). It's also full of facts that don't (in any way) connect to reality. In Amsterdam, for all I know, they speak Dutch, not some invented whatever language (see scene in the disco somewhere in the beginning of the movie). And then, most of the people in The Netherlands speak English rather well, especially in the capital, and not with the strange accent as they do in the movie (like the fat guy in the coffee shop). When our friends arrive at the closed hostel at night in Amsterdam, they all of a sudden start speaking German(!?) to the aroused people that they woke up. Do hostels in Amsterdam these days really still have curfews? Get real.<br/><br/>This movie could probably have scored a lot higher if it were filmed from the other perspective (the torturer's, I mean). And not from the horny kids'. But who am I? Nobody, that's right. And I am not getting paid sh1t-loads of money for making movies. It'd be an interesting thought, though.<br/><br/>There's also something else I find very disturbing. And that is the fact that master producer, God himself, Quentin Tarantino PRESENTS this movie Why, Mr. Tarantino? Please tell me why. Because of a few scenes of gore? Don't try to convince me that it's about the story. Slovakia might produce, in the imagination of people who don't live in Europe, an image of a country that's inhabited with retarded people that speak a language that people wouldn't even teach their pigs if they were allowed to speak, but it has a history that goes so much further back than ... well, you know what I mean.<br/><br/>And then there was this subtle hint of the Russians, being the bad guys. Again? What's that American turmoil against Russia coming from, these days (besides the obvious)? I thought we all enjoyed Night Watch and Day Watch. Reading in the press that Russia was finally able to compete with Hollywood ... Russian e-mail addresses end on .RU and not on .RUS. Sure that everyone filming knew this, but decided to make it .RUS anyway, so people'd be sure to think that it was Russia behind all the atrocities, and that it was them we should blame.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, though. I am very PRO gory movies and atrocities visualized on screen (it's my favorite genre), but there's a thin line between good and bad. Man! This scene where Paxton is lying on the cart, under a bunch of corpses and where the butcher is cutting up the bodies in order to dispose of them in an oven (Treblinka?), is one of the worst things I have ever seen. It's SO stupid and not scary, gory of unnerving at all. At all! It's plain stupid and it therefore is (one of many) a good example of the movie's accomplishments. A nothing-movie, on all accounts.<br/><br/>True: the cutting off of the fingers of the bad guy on the end was more or less decently filmed. Why Paxton had to slit his throat, though, I'll probably never know. Wasn't he supposed to be so freaking' good' and honorable? He wasn't in this godforsaken country of Slovakia anymore, but in Germany. He could've called the cops. No? Well, whatever. I am happy IMDb gives me the opportunity to vent a little, after having an afternoon wasted on this junk.<br/><br/>Want to see gore, with a more or less decent story (or for that matter, a bad story but still watchable?), go and check out Saw I and III, for example. Or Bad Taste (if you haven't already) or, or, or. There's too many to name.<br/><br/>I am very sorry that mister Tarantino has sold his name to this very upsettingly bad movie. He's still one of my favorite directors, though. Maybe, mister Tarantine, maybe you should direct Hostel III yourself? I have very little faith that Hostel II will be any better. But, as I am, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and will watch it anyway, just for, well, whatever reason.<br/><br/>Dikke Jules"

They were definitely not scary only disgusting...<br/><br/>I am not a faint hearted person. In my life until last week I even used to choose particularly the action and horror movies to watch. I don't know how many times I watched Kill Bill or some Japanese movies. They were all some sort of fun for me. BUT, this movie was like a wake up call, right after watching the Hostel, I sat down and asked myself "" What am I doing? Why am I a part of this insanity and cheapness?"" Every time directors and writers are being a bit more disgusting and insane for the sake of impressing the audience. For the sake of impressing the audience they can sell a whole nations reputation, Slovakia became one of the most corrupt countries in the world. I am not from this country and I know this is just a silly movie, but what really annoys me is the reckless approach of Hollywood. They feel like that they have the rights to make bad whichever country they want. A country is corrupt or not, this is their problem, not an idiot American director's. By the way, another cheap flick was promoting the movie as Tarantino's last work, just to create a higher reputation.???? <br/><br/>The bottom line is I want to watch movies, I mean real movies from now on; I do not want to waste my time for such a rubbish any more."

","I saw it first in theaters and years later the unrated DVD as a Blockbuster free rental. The movie feels like a con job, all you heard was how it's just way too violent and shocking but then when you see it all you really get is lots of talking, gratuitous soft core sex, and near the end of the movie some really bad gore effects. I've seen Troma movies that had a budget of what change they could find in their couch cushions that had far more realistic gore and of course much more creativity.<br/><br/>The problems with Hostel are that they took a decent idea and didn't even try and go anywhere with it. You have some American tourist who end up being kidnapped and tortured by wealthy Europeans. A big problem is that there is way too much talking and sex and not enough of the ""horror"" element. There aren't very many kills and what you do see looks insanely fake, like the blowtorch scene where all you see is the guys back and then they cut to the girl with red plastic glued to her face. You'll be better of just hitting fast forward through most of the movie since you won't be missing much, just lots of long conversations there to pass the time that don't add anything to the story.<br/><br/>There just isn't anything worth seeing in Hostel. Very little plot, badly filmed soft core sex for filler, and some of the worst gore effects you'll see in a major Hollywood movie. Do yourself a favor and get something good, may I suggest getting a Troma movie like Terror Firmer which has a perfect blend of horror, comedy, nudity, and loads of gore. All I can say is that Hostel has no redeeming qualities, maybe if it didn't take itself way too seriously it could have been slightly more watchable."

","If this is the level that Tarantino is nowadays being associated with, then things are really turning for the worst in US-film-making.<br/><br/>Now I always liked B-horror-flicks. Buth then you know you'd expect cheesy sfx and bad acting. Usually associated with Roger Corman but not Tarantine. But this is so over the top. Right from the start they hand out so much clichés and factual errors that it hurts more than actually build up the story. For instance in The netherlands they speak dutch NOT German. Unless mr. Eli Roth still thinks that WWII isn't over yet. Apart from depicting everyone in Holland as a sex- craved junkie...<br/><br/>And it goes on. Near the end the sfx on the Japanese girl with her eyeball flopping about her bloody face (which in itself is so badly done that it becomes funny instead of gory) look so stupid that you actually start to wonder if this isn't comedy instead of a horror-movie.<br/><br/>In fact the only believable sfx are when the lead guy drives the car over the group that put him to this ordeal and at the end when he cuts off the fingers of the businessman.<br/><br/>This film is a complete waste of time and money.

","**mild spoilers** In the last few years, Hollywood has made lots and lots of horror movies. Unfortunately, they have been mostly gore and no scare. ""Hostel"" was perfect example. There was plenty of gore, as well as nudity. The nudity wore me out after a while, but I'm a woman and boobs do nothing for me. When are these characters going to learn that backpacking Americans in creepy, back-road villages is just asking for trouble? It's not hard to guess who's the first to get killed and we feel nothing for these characters. Josh was the only normal guy, the other two were like little horny frat boys who had never seen a breast before--shesh. The torture scenes are very odd. We see very little, hear a lot and then it's over. What I didn't get was ""Igor"" who was chopping up the body parts to toss in the fire--why did he chop them up? He could've just tossed them right in whole. Anyways, I digress. There was absolutely no fear factor. I never got scared, no ""jump out of your seat scenes"" and nothing that made me cover my eyes. And trust me, I'm a horror flick wuss. I spent most of ""Silent Hill"" in my husband's lap with my eyes closed. That movie scared the bejeezus out of me.

"Dxamanda","1","1","3","26 March 2007"," What is there to like?
","Ech, where to begin.<br/><br/>I went into my viewing of Hostel with extremely low expectations. I wasn't necessarily expecting to hate it- in fact, I was hoping to like it. But after hating Roth's previous film, Cabin Fever, I decided it was best to lower my expectations. Had I actually expected to love the film and been looking forward to it, it's difficult to imagine how much I would have hated it and how let down I would have been.<br/><br/>I figured there wouldn't be as much torture as the TV spots would like us to believe. I didn't think it would be ""shocking"" or ""disturbing""- an enjoyable gore fest at best. However, because of Roth's own comments about the film, I was very surprised in how little torture there was, and how lame the scenes that did feature it, were. As a horror fan, I must say I was let down with the death sequences. First, there is the blonde college student who gets tortured. Drilled leg, barfs on himself, cut tendon, and that's pretty much it. Hernandez gets a couple fingers cut off and then is able to escape because his torturer accidentally cuts part of his own leg off in a terribly forced and out-of-place homage to The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. After this, Hernandez saves a Japanese girl from getting tortured and cuts her half-dangling eyeball out of it's socket. The girl screams, Hernandez screams, pus squirts. Partially comedic, sure. Gross? Eh. Shocking? Yeah, right. And finally, the Japanese girl meets her bloody demise while escaping with Hernandez, by throwing herself in front of a train after catching a glimpse of her now deformed face, in yet another terrible homage to Sono's Jisatsu Saakuru.<br/><br/>Death scenes aside, Roth does not get a free pass from creating an intelligent, atmospheric, or even half-original horror film just because his apparent motto in life is ""Gore and boobies- what makes a film great"". Just because Hostel is a film about three cocky, annoying frat boys getting tortured, does not mean his film has to be void of any originality or intellect. Most recently, Saw is an incredibly overrated film in the horror genre that gets overpraised for it's use of violence and (self?) torture. However, I am quite fond of it's at least somewhat original story. The film also has a dark atmosphere that makes it fun to watch, even in it's moments of unintentional comedy (the clown on the bicycle? seriously?). Hostel, however, is a film about a few frat boys who mistake a torture chamber for a fun night out and end up getting picked off one by one.<br/><br/>Roth also said Hostel is America's reaction to Miike's Audition. Audition is a slow-burn horror, which starts out a carefree love story, then gradually becomes more disturbing until the final scene, which is pure insanity. Hostel, on the other hand, is 40 minutes of sex and nudity, then after the first friend goes missing, it immediately shifts into a paint-by-numbers thriller until the end. The comparison between the two films ends at their torture scenes. Audition is a genuinely creepy, unsettling, atmospheric, great horror/suspense film. I find it purely idiotic to compare it to generic kitsch like Hostel.<br/><br/>I was originally going to rate Hostel 2/10, only because I don't like giving films a 1. However, the only thing I remotely enjoyed about this film was Jay Hernandez. Not his character, an arrogant ass whom I wanted to die, but because Hernandez isn't bad to look at.<br/><br/>However, I'm not going to rate it higher because it's main star is attractive. What is there to like? I have no idea. 1/10."

However, it seems that when you get Quentin Tarantino on your poster everybody thinks it is his film, and thats why people went to see it. I wonder how much of kiss a## it took the director to get Tarantino to support such a disaster. That's a good trick - have a bad movie, get the right sponsor, and make money, even though one has almost zero talent. It makes one thinks about some ways that the consumer (movie goer) should be protected from such a sham. Thinking you are going to see one's director movie, and ending up irritable. If it was a bad movie by Tarantino it is one thing - i choose to see it based on his name, but the way i, and my friends were tricked to believe that it was his movie, makes you realize that more research should be done before i see my next ""Quentin Tarantino"" movie."

Our world is already full of criminals who murder others and do awful things. My fear is that this movie could give people like that more ideas. It may promote more violence because in the movie violence was portrayed as a ""fun thing to do"". Weak minded individuals out there would believe that it is a fun thing to do to others.<br/><br/>The other reason I disliked this movie is due to the way it portrays Europe.

The same old horror clichés get the same tired treatment, with no surprises and very little to interest anyone but those who are easily entertained. Made by profiteers, who apparently believe that by hacking off limbs and cribbing from every horror movie in recent memory, it will pass as an original.<br/><br/>Eli Roth, the movie's writer/director, should stick to direction and leave the writing to someone else. It's so thinly plotted, with obvious situations and badly developed characters, that it threatens to evaporate before the series of incredible coincidences that end the film.<br/><br/>On the plus side, there is some very attractive location photography in Prague and the usual excellent makeup effects from Howard Berger & Greg Nicotero. The fact that Roth had the guts to employ real makeup artists instead of using cheesy CGI is to his credit and that is what earns this movie a 3 instead of a zero."

Not once did I wonder ""Whodunit?"", there was no slow buildup of tension or fear, no in-depth character encounters, just 94 minutes of mind-numbing, IQ-draining nonsense. I realize that there will never be another Shining, Exorcist, or Rosemary's Baby, and maybe those standards are unfairly high, but surely filmmakers who probably make more money than god should at least try to EARN some of it."

OK, there is some gore but nothing spectacular and not very much, except you call a few body parts lying around and a few puddles of blood as gore.

"Shusai","2","1","3","27 December 2006"," Appalling for the wrong reasons.
","HOSTEL begins surprisingly enough along the lines of EUROTRIP, as a crass rite-of-passage sex comedy about a trio of young Western backpackers chasing after exotic thrills in the seductive form of a bevy of loose and kinky European women. The film takes a sudden turn for the sinister as they head east in the direction of Slovakia. While on the train they share a carriage with a slimy Dutch doctor who sets the scene for the horrors to come by messily eating raw mushrooms. Upon arrival they find themselves the victims of an unsrcupulous honey trap. Next thing they know, these silly lads are strapped up in an underground torture complex at the mercy of some leftover Josef Mengele types(If only Eastern Europe was really this exciting).<br/><br/>I didn't have a big problem with the uneven structure of the film. From the opening few minutes it was clear that I was watching unadulterated trash - not always such a bad thing. I had more of a problem with the drably hedonistic and totally transparent characters, the strange lack of involvement I felt towards the nasty events, and the somewhat retarded attitudes of Eli Roth towards women, foreign countries and just about anything you can't learn about from watching splatter movies.<br/><br/>The unpleasantly childish fratboy mentality of the writer/director spreads to most levels of the film. There's a puerile self-regard in the characters' motivations, their attitudes towards women and gays, and in the revenge scenario that later develops. Especially offensive is the vile treatment of Asian women in the film. I get the idea that Roth was weaned on Japanese films like GUINEA PIG and the more extreme works of Takashi Miike (who has a cameo in HOSTEL). Seeing how awfully Japanese women are treated in their native cinema, he had to try a ham-fisted imitation in his own film. I also have a disturbing suspicion that the film might have had more problems with American audiences and censors had it shown a beautiful blonde American girl having her eye burned out with a torch. ""People won't mind so much if it's only a Japanese...We beat them in the war after all"" I hope I'm wrong about that. <br/><br/>Eventually the ridiculously contrived plot sees the uninteresting 'hero' of the film escaping and taking bloody revenge on the various people who set him up and tried to murder him. But there's no gruesomely thrilling catharsis of the kind experienced while watching I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, for example. The honey trap women are lined up for easy disposal like ducks in a barrel, the mushroom chewing doctor is wiped out with the blandest kind of gloating sadism. We're meant to cheer the hero on but we never gave a stuff about him in the first place.<br/><br/>In sum... there are horror movies that chill your spine or provoke your mind... there are those that legitimately shock and appall you. HOSTEL merely annoys and offends. If I had to say something positive I would note that the women are beautiful and I don't have problem with simple eye candy. A setting in the gorgeous continent of Europe can't hurt either. Eli Roth is capable of creating an atmosphere of sickness and menace, but I'm left with the impression that he's a myopic individual with all kinds of dubious outlooks, even more so than his patron, Quentin Tarantino, who can at least create characters that we care about.<br/><br/>If you want a gruesomely enjoyable thrill-ride, I recommend WOLF CREEK, HIGH TENSION or NONHOSONNO. If you want to be appalled and brutalised, see THE UNTOLD STORY, MEN BEHIND THE SUN or SALO. I'd only recommend HOSTEL to the most undemanding splatter fans."

"special_unicorn_feelings","1","1","3","1 December 2006"," Exploitative and Boring
","***Hey! This Comment Contains Spoilers!***<br/><br/>I'm not sure why Quentin Tarrantino decided to associate his decent name in any way with this dog of a movie, which is yet another in a recent series of xenophobic slasher films(Wrong Turn, The Hills Have Eyes, House of Wax, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and now, apparently Touristas Go Home, which I haven't seen, but I'm guessing I don't need to) that derives it's so-called ""horror"" from the cultural and racial biases of its white middle class viewer constituency. In Hostel, the cliché clan of kill-crazy hillbillies has been changed out for a town filled with callous, desperate Eastern Europeans willing to kidnap and sell model-esquire meatheaded Americans to the highest bidder, ""prostituting"" them, if you will, to a sort of brothel where the very rich can pay to play out their most depraved fantasies of torture, rape and murder. You can't really feel too bad for the Americans though. The first half of the film depicts the main characters as basically a bunch of unlikeable buttheaded jocks who spend all of their time vapidly pursuing drugs and poontang, so it's hard to really empathize or even care when the dudely protagonists are later forced to race through a post-industrial hell of rusty grating and secret dungeons towards salvation from their rich tormentors, who are as one-dimensional and uninteresting as their prey. What I hated most about this film was not that it was dim-witted, poorly scripted/shot, conventional, and just plain not scary (though it WAS all of those things) but that it was sexist, racist, classist, mean-spirited and misanthropic. I know that's a lot of social criticism to heap onto any movie, but it seems warranted given that Hostel itself is sorely lacking any kind of social criticism (unless we are supposed to believe that the film's central trope, in which all rich men are depicted as secretly evil, is supposed to pass for some kind of class critique), and based on the outtakes, the filmmakers seem just as dull and stupid as their protagonists. Speaking as a HUGE fan of horror films, both crappy and otherwise, I don't make such accusations lightly. I have an incredibly high tolerance for tastelessness, gore and misanthropy, but Hostel, more than any film I've seen in the past 5 years, left me with an incredibly bad taste in my mouth. And this is coming from someone who liked American Psycho. There certainly ARE interesting social issues brought up by the plot of such a film, but only accidentally. When it comes down to it, Hostel only knows how to be exploitative."

If I'd known this was from the hand of Eli Roth, the same man responsible for the dire and truly pitiful afforementioned Cabin Fever, there is no way I'd have committed myself to wasting 2 hours on it.<br/><br/>Hostel is set out in the Eastern Bloc of Europe, namely the small nation of Slovakia, after initially being set in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.<br/><br/>A group of 3 friends are enjoying the hedonistic pleasures of the flesh offered by the seedy districts of Holland's capital, before a chance encounter with an apparent pimp sets them on course to travelling east where a hostel hosting the most beautiful and sexually precocious women is apparently situated.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for them, it is also the location for a torture chamber, and they have no idea of what visceral depravity and horror awaits.<br/><br/>As one can clearly tell, this is inspired by the style of Texas Chainsaw Massacre - a 'group' of conspirators try to lure unsuspecting victims into a dungeon in which vicious and unspeakable hells lurk, carried out out by psychotic lynchmen.<br/><br/>Regrettably it shares only that similarity with TCM and nothing else; a truly appalling, shallow, and thoroughly disjointed plot which commits the cardinal sin of being fundamentally boring completely undermines this movie's chances of being half decent.

I was very close to quitting entirely, but it switched elsewhere, deluding me into thinking there might actually be a moral or purpose concealed within.<br/><br/>But there simply wasn't. This mess was a monumental hash - implausible, pointless, bereft of originality and poorly conceived. Plus if you only watch the first 30 or so minutes, you'd think it was practically soft porn.<br/><br/>The one saving grace is that the acting was actually OK, and nowhere near as pitiful as Cabin Fever's, for example.<br/><br/>Eli Roth clearly cannot do horror, and I plead with him to refrain from trying again."

I just don't get the torture thing. It doesn't shock or disturb me. It is just so bleeding boring. I feel like I am the one being tortured. I just sit there, twiddling my thumbs, waiting for the the torture scene to end so that the story to move on. I actually fell asleep in the theater watching ""House of a 1000 Corpses"".

"adwalters-1","10","1","3","13 July 2006"," A journey into what is possible....
","It is certainly possible to see why some people were put off by the tits'n'arse quotient a the start of this film, subsequently writing it off as another stupid American horror cliché. However, I can honestly say that the first half or more of the movie was SUPERBLY bland, thus making it all the more realistic when confusion sets into the Backpackers hostel when people start to disappear. The sex, drugs and clubbing might be a caricature of people's travelling lives, but believe me, it is certainly accurate in describing some.<br/><br/>What makes this film truly great, is that it doesn't resort to ridiculous plot twists or any other particularly obvious horror stupidity to draw the audience in. It simply wends its way along, with the path of events gradually becoming clearer in a quite natural way. There were very few elements of the whole thing that I thought were just movie rubbish that could not possibly happen.<br/><br/>***Big Spoilers***<br/><br/>This counts double for the central tenet - rich sadists paying to torture and kill people any way that they please. You can say that this is not likely to happen in the world, but you probably would not say that it isn't possible. This is horror at it's base - trying to find the common denominator of fear lurking in the backs of our minds. Torture must be high on the list for most people, but this isn't the middle ages any more. Suddenly we have a realistic enough premise to bring these fears back into focus. And what is worse, the protagonists are simply normal, paying customers - not drooling, cartoonish, shadowy evils. When you see the Japanese girl having her eye blowtorched, and the matter of fact way that the American goes about it, you finally realise that the film makers have touched on TRUE HORROR - that which is inside the minds of everyday people, given vent.<br/><br/>Best film I have seen for a long time - one that is brilliant for it's simplicity."

","This is the worst movie i've seen in a long time. It's a lame story without suspense. It is not frightening at all and there is no real plot, at least, not a good one anyway. You can really see it's a low budget movie (for example: when they arrive at the train station in Bratislava, the camera moves, like it was filmed by some amateur). I'm from Belgium and we speak also dutch, but what the actors were talking in Amsterdam in the movie, was German, certainly not dutch. They make it seem like Europe is some kind of poor continent. When i saw that Quentin Tarantino had something to do with this movie, i thought it was gonna be great, but it turned out to be a big disappointment! Short: 3 guys wanna get laid in Europe and they get killed 1 at a time in Bratislava, without any real reason. Go see it and see for yourself, it's LAME!!!"

","Having been a movie buff for many many years, going to video shops long before blockbuster came along,, I never thought I would see a more gut wrenching movie than, Madman, The Burning, I spit on your grave, Last house on the left, Scanners, pure horror at its best,, this was until I saw Hostel, fantastically well made movie, that has everything from comedy, sex, violence and above all the imagination of a truly great Writer/director. Excellent movie, not for the faint hearted. Even when someone has told you about the film in detail,, this still does not prepare you for what you are about to see. Its not the fact that you see every gory detail, its left to your imagination on most of the scenes, but having seen the gory films of yesteryear, this is truly a magnificent piece of art, which only makes me wait in anticipation for the next instalment. Tarrantino/Roth,, a remarkable combination, may the pair of you continue making films like you do, for many years to come."

","A first glance at Hostel made me remember the first time I saw Saw. A bloody, gory, thought-provoking, weirdo mess that was just entertaining. Hostel (on the same hand, just maybe a different finger)accomplishes the same thing, except, this movie made it feel real. Who the hell cares where they were, but we do know it was somewhere in Europe, which is foreign, which is automatically creepy. Europe is supposed to be cozy and warm, and the first 40 minutes demonstrate the friendliness. But when people start to get... hostile, things turn bad. I won't spoil anything but I do want to say that Jay Hernandaz's acting was impressive. Eli Roth is also a very underrated director and both of these men prove their surprising brilliance through one scene(of the many, especially in the second half.) That amazing bit where Paxton is tied to his chair, scrambling, screaming and throwing himself about... until he hears the chainsaw, and stops, slowly grabbing the chair-support bar as it gets closer, and closer. Brilliant director. Great acting. Excellent ending. All in all, its definitely worth a watch. And what a watch it is."

The girls just happened to be there as they some how explode when being hit at 30 mph by the car! The torture scenes were very short. But the soft-core porn wasn't. I have to say though that the acting was good and the directing had some decent moments. There were some good shots. I'm not dissing Eli Roth. The guy has talent but he can't write a script! I just don't see how anyone can compare this with Saw. Saw is one of the most original horror\thrillers ever.

","I just came back from watching the Hostel premiere in Germany and am a little bit confused on what to think. I went into the cinema with extremely high expectations, having seen the well-chosen trailer I could not help but be amazed and excited about it. I expected one very unique movie with extreme, never-seen before perversity and gore. What I saw then was still a very good movie with not as much pornography as I feared and as others have posted in here, and some very good horror scenes. What I didn't like was the shortness of the movie. I think, there could have been way more of the gore as it didn't seem cheap or forced into the film. The perverse scenes rather seemed like a prefect fit for the movie, but in my eyes, Eli Roth didn't go as far as I hoped. I really hoped I would get to see something that would make my blood get ice-cold and my teeth tremble in agony, but Hostel just didn't cross enough lines. Still, a very good movie out of a very good idea, but more could have been done with it."

"SirDennis_C","10","1","3","22 April 2006"," Believable
","Thilling, really sucks you in. Many(including me and my wife) mistakenly thought it was a Tarantino movie but he is just a producer. In reality it's the second big release from Eli Roth, the director who did Cabin Fever. As someone else said Hostel is a better movie than Cabin Fever in every way. Like Cabin Fever, it's pretty heavy on the realistic gory spfx. Horror fans will not be disappointed with this one but there is more to this movie than that crowd is usually looking for.<br/><br/>Hostel starts out like a buddy movie with a few echoes of Eurotrip. The humour is incidental to the plot, the jocular type you might expect given the situation. Roth went out of his way a bit to include a nod to Peter Jackson in a scene that involves an altercation with an ""Angry Elf."" Roth had his share of crap from LOTR fans walking out of his last movie... many went to see it solely because Cabin Fever was praised by Jackson at the height of the LOTR's popularity. This was the first taste of how skilled this director is at weaving layers of meaning into his movies.<br/><br/>In fact the Hostel reminded me quite a lot of Hitchcock movies the way it meanders while setting the stage for the nastiness to follow. Like Hitch, Roth is skilled at building suspense rather than diving right into the madness like most horror flicks do. And like most Hitchcock films the Hostel can be enjoyed on many levels. Their is the top layer where neither disappoint in providing escapist entertainment. And then there's all the deeper stuff that film buffs get off on. One of Hitchcock's standard layers was having characters who make morally wrong decisions and then end up being punished severely in a seemingly unrelated event. (think of Janet Leigh, how did she end up at the Bates Motel? Well she stole some money from her boss and was on the lamb. Of course Norman Bates had no idea about this -- he didn't even bother with her purse when he disposed of her and her belongings -- but the director did. This relationship plays itself out in several of his movies.) This relationship between loose morals and being punished in an unrelated way is a strong element of the Hostel.<br/><br/>There is a social/political layer in the Hostel as well. And it is believable. The most believable element is that people in Europe generally don't like American tourists. The movie explores this reality in the extreme. But there is something even deeper than this going on. The film presents a view of where those who develop boredom with sex tourism could logically end up. In an exaggerated way it shows how this industry destroys lives and communities. In the ""Slovakian"" town the buddies end up in, war has provided a culture where people are not bothered by cruelty and human life has no value beyond what tourists are willing to pay for it. On the one hand it has some tourists being victimized by the prostitutes in that the tourists become the commodity. But as it is in the real world of sex tourism, it is the uber-rich (some of whom get punished in the Hitchcockian way tho) who end up victimizing everyone. To show how clear the directors vision is in this area there are two Asian women, tourists, that are really the only ones who succumb to a tragic end without having done anything to ""deserve"" it. I hope that people can get past the sensational gore and think about the larger issues this film explores. Damn fine movie with something for everyone (over the age of 18 ;))"

"garethareeves","1","1","3","16 April 2006"," Basically a snuff movie.
","The film is not a profound study of the effects of torture on human beings; it's not a sharp insight into hidden recesses of the human psyche; it's not a fascinating portrait of Americans abroad; it's not even an entertaining horror movie. It's a snuff movie. And it's not just the gore that had me reaching for the proverbial sick-bag.<br/><br/>Although the acting is generally very realistic (esp. Derek Richardson and Jan Vlasak), it works against the film: on the one hand, to go for verisimilitude with the actors' performances, and on the other to go for laughs with slapstick (e.g. the German guy with the chainsaw), doesn't balance well at all. At the cinema, people were laughing because they felt they had to, in a vain attempt to alleviate their feelings of revulsion and awkwardness.<br/><br/>The denouement is terribly contrived and the desultory nature of the film's narrative would've been given far greater credence had it all been some drunken dream-turned-nightmare; and the fact that such an uninspired twist would salvage the film speaks volumes.<br/><br/>Not only was this film bad in the sense that it made me want to vomit, it was also deeply immoral (I can forgive a violent film or book if there is some underlying morality). I think directors have to be very careful when dealing with a theme as dark as torture: if you're going for pure entertainment, then you don't want realistic performances, and if you're going for morality, profound hidden messages, etc., then pass on the puerile jokes.<br/><br/>The worst film I have ever seen at the cinema: avoid!"
"vishnu1","6","1","3","5 April 2006"," A poor cover version
","I don't normally get too carried away with movie hype, I have been burned too many times in the past to let my inner geek run riot. When I heard about this movie for the first time on Ain't it Cool news I was trapped in a Shelob's web of anticipation. The film's premise was born out of a conversation between two gore hounds, Harry 'King of the nerds' Knowles (founder of AICN) and new kid on the block director Eli ""Cabin Fever"" Roth. Harry described an underground Asian website that could hook you up with an organisation who actually offer the chance to kill another human for the right price, reportedly in the £10k region. Eli went home, had a look on the net and Hostel was born.<br/><br/>Let me just state for the record that I'm a major gore hound, I love extreme cinema, I love being scared, and I love provocative and stimulating films. I love to be challenged on an emotional and intellectual level. So when names like Fukasaku Kinji and Takashi Miike are being dropped into the mix as apparent influences for this work, I was positively moist with anticipation. Battle Royale and Audition after all are two of my favourite extreme masterpieces. Bring it on! OK, so the premise, three backpackers are on a hedonistic spree across Europe, seeking sex, drugs and rock n roll. While in Amsterdam they hear of a Slovakian hostel that promises to be a utopia of indulgence, so off they head for paradise. Naturally they are soon knee deep in Slovakian honey and all promises appear fulfilled. Not quite. They have been ensnared by a trafficking ring specialising in human hunting for those too rich to know better, and are systematically subjected to all manner of torture, pain and eventually a grisly death. You'd think I'd be pleased then? Well, not really. Firstly, after about five minutes I absolutely hated all three obnoxious annoying main characters so much that I wanted to take a ball hammer to their tootsies myself. And that's basically the critical flaw with this film. You see, the most devastating and affecting films of this genre are set up to perfection. They give you characters to identify with, they try to build some sort of relationship or bond with the audience, so that when the darkness descends, you are there with them, sharing their fear, feeling their pain. The cheese wire sequence in Audition is only so powerful because we have spent an hour getting to know this guy and can relate to his loneliness and longing to find a partner. So when he suffers some extreme acupuncture, ouch, we are right there with him. That's the real power of this genre, we need to feel in control of our universe, but these film makers show us the real illusion that is existence, they expose our mortality, our vulnerability and complete lack of control over the random madness that this life is. And that's the real scary thing!! Not the blood and entrails.<br/><br/>So when two annoying American students and a baffling Icelander get power drilled in Slovakia, it is hard to care about their fate, perhaps the world is better off, we lost three idiots, the world just got lighter! Yes of course I understand all the thematic inversions taking place on screen, the hunter becoming the hunted, the objectification being turned around on our protagonists, the Pinocchio parable, blah blah blah. Again, I hated the morons, so all else really is irrelevant. Without engaging characters, the plot falls on its fat derrière and we are left with mindless meaningless gore, titillation and overriding apathy. Could have been a contender, but instead plays like a poor American cover version of an Asian masterpiece."

","Eli Roth was the master who brought us the neat little shocker 'Cabin Fever' which was a pretty gruesome piece of work. Now, he has donned the role as director in Quentin Tarrantino's torture shocker, Hostel, which completely over goes the limit of how far a hardcore horror audience will go. This sick little shocker relies on it's main cast, and it's low budget, but believe me, this is far more believable than your average J-movie ghost stories, and arguably more scary for example. The story is pretty simple. 3 guys looking for booze, sex...and well...booze and sex, stumbles upon a seemingly superb hostel...and...you know the rest.<br/><br/>Roth was clearly feeling peckish, with limbs flying about like a tennis tournament, and scenes to curl even the straightest hair. an eye for an eye i must say, as a women is literally ripped apart.

"darioattanasio","10","1","3","26 March 2006"," Chilling, Daring, Exhilarating, Compelling... oh and, ahem, ankles... ouch.
","Wow, so many adjectives could help describe this film... but that would only be scratching the surface, as Eli sophomore effort is a story littered with multifaceted themes that allows the film to literally jump out of the screen and break away from the conventions of ""Horror"" movie. Recently I have acquired a taste for horror films, mainly the ones that attempt to try something new... actually its fair to say not so much horror but the inventively titled ""horror porn"" a la Saw. Hostel is definitely a step in the right direction, for two reasons. This is the kind of contemporary horror that captures audiences attention, especially when they are so thirsty for the Saw-like films. And it allows us to see that Eli Roth is certainly an inventive and a wickedly evil person, albeit in a funny way.<br/><br/>The story of American backpackers Paxton and Josh both played well by Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson respectively who, whilst travelling across continental Europe, meet Oli, played superbly by newcomer Eythor Gudjonsson - possibly the most likable screen character in recent horror history. Together the three travel to Amsterdam where they are told about a place just outside Bratislava in Slovakia where the town, which has been left sparsely populated by an array of gorgeous women who have been left alone without husbands after they left for ""war"". The apparent socio-historical ignorance of the horny trio leads them to this town. Immediately we are plunged into a surreal world: postcard picturesque buildings, friendly hostel contrasted by Tortury museum- surely foreshadowing events to come, and grimy underground nightclubs wrapped in drugs and sex with willing women. Its too good to be true, and obviously, it is. One by one our trio is reduced to just Paxton, the overall protagonist who goes searching for his friends, who out-of-character, just pick up and leave. When Paxton eventually finds and stumbles onto the main plot conceit of torturing for fun and pleasure with the aid of human trafficking, we are abruptly plunged into something far more sinister, and this is where the film really picks up, and has you knee jerking for the remainder of the film, praying for no more gory tortures.<br/><br/>This is the main storyline, yet as I said the themes that play throughout can be lost due to the huge controversy surrounding the film, of just plain gratuitous violence for the sake of art. Lets get one thing straight here, yes there is violence, but its not as much as the trailer would have you believe, and yes, it is integral to the story and leaves a poignant and chilling mark with the audience. The most intricate themes that I picked up on were the idea of basic human desire, our primal instinct, on the torturers side being the alpha male, dominating and making a mark by hurting the opponent. And the poor captives, who are reduced to our most weakest human characteristics: pitiful, whimpering, lost, innocent and naive. These themes bring out one argument: we are all as low as each other, as the basic human desire, the primal instinct of survival, is imprinted on everyone, just witness Paxtons retaliation to notice his loss of innocence and eruption of sub human violence. Another theme, and one that was portrayed the best, in my opinion, was the idea of horror-porn, or erotic violence. The belief that our very own base curiosity as humans and subconscious thirst to witness violence, which is enacted by the torturers, who are representations of the audience as we have now become viewers, more importantly, the idea that we are enclosed in the cinema, there is no other thing to look at but at the screen, we feel compelled to look at the most squeamish scenes, because it is curiously interesting, and possibly erotic as our adrenaline rushes, it is a voyeuristic mechanism that Roth employs to full effect, and is what makes the film so good.<br/><br/>The film is a twisted piece of imaginative thinking, elaborated to the worst extremes. Whilst the torture scenes are not long, they are extremely intense and are a test of nerves on the audiences part, especially after Roth and his clever writing pitches us an almost Tarantino-esquire introduction, we are allowed to interact with these characters, we enjoy Paxtons jock, pretty boy charms, Oli's dirty, yet good natured quality and Josh's naivety, yet there is somewhere deep beneath, our gut feeling, that we should not invest too much love in these people, as something very bad is going to happen. This is where the film packs a punch, because as soon as we settle and accept these characters... BAM, gone, we are embroiled in a seriously twisted film... if any comparisons are invited, i would say its Pulp Fiction Redux: The drug addled Directors cut - we are talking ""I'm gonna get medieval on yo' ass"" stretched to its utmost possibility, and there is a huge sigh of relief when the film is over... we suddenly feel that Slovakia is just too close for our liking, and regardless of any critical bashing as gratuitous nudity and drug references, they seem to forget this is about human desire, the vices that we all desire, yet when you have the opportunity there is a divide, the social divide... how far will your thirst take you? the ultimate rush it would seem is killing and this is why Roth is giving us the respect as an audience, we full well know the dirty side of life, and this is just a segment. Regardless of what people will think, Roth had managed to get people talking about all sorts of ideas,the kind of cerebral film that not only is a sign that audiences are much smarter than any blockbuster film will give them credit for, and that is a sign of a good film.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Despite whatever criticism Cabin Fever received I personally thought that it was a decent horror film with suitable amounts of gore and a general unpleasant atmosphere hanging in the air. It was one of the best horror films i have seen, this is saying something as I generally find them boring, clichéd and NOT scary. I'm not saying cabin fever was particularly ""scary"" as such but rather that it creates a very unsettling atmosphere and builds on it to create a panic stricken ""adventure"" in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>Now hostel is quite a different beast. While starting, to me at least, in quite a similar fashion to cabin fever with a bunch of loudmouthed stoner friends and frat-pack humour, it divulges into a far more perplexing film. It is hard to say much about the film without spoiling it but i'll try my best.<br/><br/>First note that this is not as the posters claim "" the most vicious brutal bloody film ever"" or whatever, because that implies that it is some kind of all out gore fest. NO that is not Hostel. In fact i felt that the use of violence was quite reserved.....OK well there is quite a lot of blood here and there but the films success is rather on the disturbing nature of what the film transgresses to. From the trailer you should have gathered the focal point of the film, a place where people are allowed to torture other people. The torture scenes are quite disturbing, as one must consider why the hell anyone would actually pay to do this. The way the place is shot is very unsettling, with stark use of light and grimy, deshevled surroundings. Although, this place is not actually introduced right at the start, Roth instead builds up his characters so the film is not quite what one might expect.<br/><br/>Overall, a strange film but a successful one it is quite uncompromising however and Definitely not for the weak hearted or easily offended."

","I have read Mark's comments on this film and i have to agree that it does take some time to reach the climax, however as with all Tarantino films the plot, the characters and the intensity all make this one of the most thrilling and equally gruesome films i've ever seen and some scenes towards the end of the film did make me cringe and i had to look away for a few seconds but obviously you will see this for yourself when you go to watch the movie.<br/><br/>The settings and scenery especially in Slovakia are dark and cold and just add to the drama of the film and this in my opinion is another Tarnatino classic that is a must see for all horror fanatics."
"dilbertsuperman","9","1","3","10 March 2006"," The perfect Amsterdam horror movie for the 00's
","I can't rave enough about this film. It has a real story to tell and so much character to it that it really goes above and beyond the call of duty for a horror flick. What I find so awesome about this movie is that not only could this actually happen- rest assured my friend, it actually does happen- on a grander scale than your American mind can imagine. I won't say exactly what IT is but this could absolutely happen to someone and that is what makes it so perfectly creepy and horrific.<br/><br/>The story takes a long time to introduce you to the characters and this is important in a real horror film because you need to identify with the characters in order to be horrified by anything happening to them. The tension of many scenes is like a razors edge that suddenly snaps into either a roller coaster of terror or evaporates as if the tension was only your silly imagination. This is great suspense and I loved every single frame of this film.<br/><br/>There are side-plots galore, interesting characters and situations and it is all in a European vacation sort of setting but instead of the fluff we have been fed in the past this is the harsh European vacation that shows you a bit of the toughness of the war torn areas and the people they produce. I was reminded of Lilja Forever with their representation of the Quasi-pseudo-Slovanian/Batslavian areas.<br/><br/>If you never see this film you are a total idiot.<br/><br/>BTW this is indie style- not Hollywood so be prepared to get REAL funky.<br/><br/>PLOT: 3 friends arrive in Amsterdam looking for whatever off the hook wild times and partying they can get themselves into with the intention of creating memories to look back upon fondly when they grow up and be responsible. Two are longtime friends and the third they picked up along the many countries they visited before Amsterdam. They enjoy the rich delights of Amsterdam's red light district and then they meet someone that tells them about a place.. a place they HAVE to check out man! And the fun begins. Muahahahahaahha."

"boyinflares","8","1","3","24 February 2006"," A Modern Day ""Video Nasty""?
","I had two expectations when going into this film. Firstly, that it was going to be just as good as ""Cabin Fever"", and secondly, that I had heard it was brutal. Both expectations were met - and then some. Roth's direction and writing was terrific, there was never a dull moment in the film.<br/><br/>The cast were all fantastic too. Jay Hernandez was great as hottie Paxton and moved from being care-free to fighting for his life with real conviction. Derek Richardson was also good as nice guy Josh. It was extremely difficult watching what happened to him. Ethor Gudjansson was rather annoying at times as Icelandic backpacker Oli. Barbara Nedeljakava and Jana Kanderbkava were both well cast as Natalya and Svetlana. Jennifer Lim doesn't get enough screen time as Kana, but she was awesome. Finally, Jan Vlasak was terribly creepy as the Businessman.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, I describe ""Hostel"" as a modern day 'Video Nasty' (not that we really have video anymore, but you know what I mean) due to its extremely gruesome moments. The pain that you see these people go through, even though not real, is shown with such conviction you can almost feel it yourself. The little 'business' that is being run in ""Hostel"" would be deemed so socially unacceptable that I'm surprised this film wasn't banned.<br/><br/>A tremendous job well done to all those involved, the DVD will be great. Again, without saying too much, Natalya and Svetlana most definitely got what they deserved."
"Vomitron_G","8","1","3","19 February 2006"," Hostel Paradiso
","When Eli Roth's CABIN FEVER came out in 2002, the opinions amongst horror-fans were divided. Quentin Tarantino, however, claimed himself being a fan of Roth's debut, so he agreed on placing ""Quentin Tarantino presents"" on the promotional poster for HOSTEL. Though he isn't in any other way associated with the making of this film, it did result in the fact that HOSTEL is now receiving a wide-scale theatrical release across Europe. Smart move, Mr. Roth.<br/><br/>HOSTEL's story-line isn't too complicated. Two American backpackers, Paxton and Josh, are travelling across Europe together with Oli, a friend from Iceland. In Amsterdam they're being told that Slowakia is a real paradise for backpackers because it's the country with the most beautiful and well-willing European woman. The horny three-some wastes no time and heads off to Slowakia. At their arrival, they check in at a paradise-like little hotel and hook up with Natalya and Svetlana. And indeed, the women are gorgeous and the sex is splendid. But little do they know that they're about to descent in the underground world of organized crime and torture-tourism as they will be confronted with mankind's darkest and sickest nature.<br/><br/>The subgenre in which HOSTEL pleasantly revolves itself has been around for a long time. It all started in the 60's with the making of the first gore-movies and continued during the 70's and 80's with the release of numerous exploitation-films and shock-horror features. During the 90's such movies vanished from the horror-scene. In the new millennium the sadistic reality-horror genre is back, and the first thing we notice is that it's much more stylishly portrayed. The genre got a considerable boost with movies like SAW and Takasi Miike's ICHI, THE KILLER. The screenplay of HOSTEL is a bit less intelligent than afore-mentioned movies, but director Eli Roth clearly knows what a horror-fan wants to see, and therefore he delivers the goods. In other words: Expect a LOT of female nudity and bloody gore. During the first part of HOSTEL you actually have the impression that you're watching the umpteenth teensex-comedy, so the sudden blow to the head is as hard as it gets when this movie starts showing off with its disgusting torture-scenes. The bloody make-up effects are done by Greg Nicotero and, as to be expected, excellent and believable. Except maybe one make-up effect seemed not too realistic and reminded me a bit of those early 80's Italian zombie-movies (I think you'll know it when you see it). But it was fun anyway.<br/><br/>I have to tell it like it is: Eli Roth has improved as a film-maker. Not only does he seem to have taken some lessons in script-writing, making him aware of things like ""3-acts-structure"" and ""point of no return""; he has even learned how to build some suspense in certain scenes. Okay, the plot may contain some unbelievable coincidences, but if we make up the over-all score, we have a very decent, politically incorrect horror-movie that's recommended for gore-hounds. I might be over-rating it a bit, but it's just that I had so much fun with it and it is a solid improvement over Roth's debut CABIN FEVER."
"GLemerond","9","1","3","17 February 2006"," Brilliant, terrifying film-making at its most primal...
","Hostel is a terrifying ride, from almost beginning to end. Although it takes over 40 minutes for the action to set in, the most horrifying thing about this film is that all the while, as you watch these young men have fun, you're fully aware of what will eventually happen to them. They laugh, smoke, have sex, and generally enjoy themselves as the audience winces in their seat, unsure of what moment will be their last. And then, when the violence finally starts, it fails to ever let up. Rather than having gore spray like fountains, you're treated to snipped tendons, puncture wounds, and the like - all of which are far more cringe-inducing than a head popping off. A unrelenting film, coupled with a very satisfying ending, make this one of my top horror picks for 2006. I think the US will be hard-pressed to find something that out-does this in the next ten months."
"my_lunchbox_thoughts","8","1","3","11 February 2006"," Torture at its best
","I completely enjoyed Eli Roths Hostel. It had me from the beginning to the very end. As I sat in the theater with my family and friends, I enjoyed their reaction as well as my own. I mostly heard screams and saw some jumps. It makes you think about the way things are and the what ifs in this world. We talked for hours on the movie and I believe that if you haven't given this movie a shot, you should, that is if you are not weak in the stomach and have the residual: I am afraid to sleep tonight after that movie. It could have been more focused on the last half but you would have to see it for yourself to decide how you would react to this powerful movie. I would compare it to many others but I would rather you made your own mind up."
"gorgeous_blackman","8","1","3","1 February 2006"," another view
","I think Hostel is a bit more subtle than some have given it credit for. <br/><br/>***spoiler First, it can't be a coincidence that the whole torture Americans thread appears in the context of our current political climate. Also, it seems fitting that the character some are calling a ""hero"" in the movie gets away partly because he knows a foreign language and is able to kindle the additional sympathy of his torturer. I don't think we're necessarily supposed to feel any more sympathetic toward him than we do toward his friends--it just happens that his slightly wider world knowledge helps save him. <br/><br/>***spoiler Next, I think the scene in which the American businessman preparing to torture a victim talks to the ""hero"" is far and away the best part of the movie. The guy is just creepy. But believable. I consider this in some ways a Tarantino touch, evoking the great rants some of his famous characters go on in other films. It also reminds me (a comparison I have not seen elsewhere) of American Psycho. In this case, the theme of the psychotic American businessman driven to murder by the emptiness of his existence is drastically downplayed, but it IS there. It would not have taken much for Roth, should he have wanted to, to turn this film into a more explicitly powerful social/political/economic commentary. Whether it was Tarantino or Roth who is ultimately responsible for this touch (the businessman) I am not sure. <br/><br/>***spoiler (kind of) Finally, there has been a lot of debate about whether it is worse to actually see violence (drills going into legs, etc.) or to be left to imagine the worst. This film basically takes the latter approach. Personally I am divided about the issue. In the end, though, I think this one would have been a bit more effective had the torture been more directly shown. <br/><br/>This can't compare to some of the TRULY sick films that have been made (Sado, Cannibal Holocaust), but I think it's as disturbing in its way as the re-make of Texas Chainsaw or either of the Saw films."
"quietviolence","9","1","3","26 January 2006"," Not the non-stop gore fest it's being billed as, but amazing nonetheless
","Before I even get to reviewing the actual film, this needs to be said: I would have most definitely given this a 10 if I would have went into this movie totally blind, without seeing any trailers or reading any reviews. Unfortunately, that was not the case, as I've been following this film for months and couldn't wait to finally see it. That being said, if you haven't already spoiled yourself(which by now is damn near impossible), don't do it. The hype will probably ruin it for you.<br/><br/>This was a fantastic film. No, it's not the non-stop gore fest that you're expecting. On the other hand, it's not for the squeamish PG-13 horror fan either. This is a truly sick film, and it will scare you.<br/><br/>Hostel centers around 3 young men, backpacking all around Europe. To put it bluntly, they're basically just looking for some action for one of the lead characters, who just got out of some kind of bad relationship or whatever. They're having a pretty good time where they are, then some guy tells them to go to this other hostel in Slovokia(sorry if that's not spelled correctly), where women will just basically throw themselves at you. This is where the story picks up...please, if you do see it, don't leave just because the horror hasn't started 10 minutes into the movie. Anyway, so they head over to this hostel, start hooking up with hot chicks, yada yada. They're having a pretty awesome time until one of the guys goes missing, they get panicky, and that's where the real fun starts.<br/><br/>I'm not going to explain the gore in this review, there are threads upon threads on the message board that will explain the scenes to you if you want them. I personally thought, though, that it was extremely well done. The parts that will disturb you the most are the scenes not of the actual slashing/cutting/drilling/etc., but the ones of the cutaways, the stills of the instruments that will be used, the screaming you hear from the victims. This is where Eli Roth breaks away from the mediocre horror directors and will one day be a legend.<br/><br/>All in all, I loved this movie. It's not for the faint of heart, it's not for kids, but if you're a fan of real horror, go see this...then go rent some Miike(loved his tiny cameo!). Don't let all the hype scare you away from this excellent film!"
"Robert_duder","8","1","3","25 January 2006"," One of the sickest films ever made!!
","I think I've pretty much seen it all. Especially as an intense horror fan for the last 15 years, I've watched almost every kind of horror and gross out blood spattered film out there and Hostel made my skin crawl!! I have to say that there is an enormous percentage of human beings that should NEVER see this film because god knows there is enough sick twisted psycho's out there. What differentiates this from other blood soaked, gory films?? Reality. There is something very real about Hostel, there is something abnormal and disturbing about the situations, the setting, the captives and the men torturing them. Or perhaps it's just the incredibly sick premise in the first place that will turn your stomach. If this film was any more intense I'm not sure I would have been able to sit through it. I almost feel like slapping a disclaimer on this review because although I seem to dump praise on the film with a nine out of ten...I don't feel many should see this unless you've got a STRONG stomach, and a need to see something abnormally twisted. But fifty million dollars worth of people have already seen it. Perhaps Eli Roth's sick creation is this day and ages Texas Chainsaw or even The Exorcist which shocked and awed people decades ago.<br/><br/>It's not the buckets of blood or even the goriest scenes, it's just the imagery and the acting. The lead actors do a top notch job. The film starts out for the first half hour or more and I was beginning to wonder what I was watching because it seemed more like Harold and Kumar go to Europe with another guy. Getting high, ""F"" this, ""F"" that and showing breasts every possible chance just for the sake of doing so. No hint or horror anywhere in sight. And then comes the intrigue when the friends began to disappear one at a time. A factory in a small European town allows rich men to pay to dismember, operate, murder, do anything they want to live human victims who are tourists that are being kidnapped right off the street. In all fairness there is a small handful of gory, disturbing scenes amidst a basic story but those scenes are powerful enough to make you crawl to your core. Derek Richardson plays the lonely, geeky, Josh. He does a good job although he disappears early but his paranoia is the first to be explored as he suspects something isn't right. His scenes being tortured and murdered are gut wrenching and his screams are terrifying. That's not an easy thing to pull off in such a capacity. Newcomer Eythor Gudjonsson plays horny, party guy Oli and in that rank he does fine. He never really gets to show off his acting chops as we never actually see him getting taken or murdered. The real shining star of the film is Jay Hernandez. Over the years I've seen him in many other things but he has never stuck out or shined like he does in Hostel. He performs the crazy party teenager part to the point where I thought...these kids are just stupid annoying teenagers and then he gets submersed in with the killers and fights his way out. He commands the screen, and is definitely leading man material and his screams and scenes of torture are brutal. The three men shown to be the torturers also do a good job especially Jan Vlasák who actually meets the boys on a train to Bratslava. He seems like such a normal, every day businessman, with a family, friends, personable and then to see him in the capacity of a sick twisted killer is revolting. The supporting cast are all very well done but the main character(s) really do make this film.<br/><br/>Eli Roth who both wrote and directed the film has created something far beyond his usual average campy films. This film is very, very real. It holds a record for using the most languages in a film with no subtitles which simply holds it's realism. Filmed entirely in Europe the setting is both beautiful and frightening, dark and grim, old fashion, something very creepy about every scene. Blood and gore is everywhere as well as female nudity abound...it's a cash cow without a doubt but it's also well made and hits the mark as a disturbing, psychotic thriller. I can honestly say I don't wish to...and hopefully will not ever watch Hostel again because it's something I don't wish to sit through. Not because it's a bad film...it's brilliant...but because it's that disturbing!! For anyone and there will be plenty who says this was crap and not scary and yadda yadda yadda...I think you better make an appointment with your shrink. 8/10"

It starts off as a nice movie about three friends in a Hostel in Slovakia, but soon takes a turn for the worst, which isn't exactly the surprise of the century. The acting was good, especially the parts where the poor actors had to yell out in excruciating pain. The lead character (Jay Hernandez) is a guy who you like from the start until the very end. The only bad thing about it is that it is shorter than you think. It runs about an hour an a half, but it goes by much quicker than you can notice. If you like the blood and the guts and if you liked, Kill Bill, you will enjoy this film. Pay particular attention to the subtle homages to director Quentin Tarantino."

","I actually just got home from seeing Hostel and am extremely satisfied. Out of all the horror movies and all the luridness of my interest in things like rotten.com and death, this movie effected me dramatically. Afterwards I felt light headed, my knees were weak, and my stomach felt like it was churning butter.<br/><br/>It follows a similar scenario to the movie ""House of 1000 Corpses"", travelers being lead by seemingly kind strangers trying to help them out. Then, finding they were actually lead to their most horrifying nightmares. Also you can see Quentin Tarantino's connection to the film, as Pulp Fiction was playing on one of the TVs in the middle of the film.<br/><br/>After seeing both ""Saw"" and ""Saw II"", I thought that gore couldn't be brought to a higher level, and this proved me wrong. I cannot wait for Hostel to come out on video, though only one thing disappointed me. The ending.<br/><br/>The cliché' of the victim running back to what he was running from, in order to stop whatever terror it brings, is far too common in horror films. If I were Paxton, and I heard a woman screaming, that'd be one more reason for me to want to get out as fast as I could. Though he does the heroic thing, goes back and saves her, only to lose her to a train.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the gruesomeness of the movie makes up for this common cliché', and as I said before, I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL IT COMES OUT ON VIDEO!!! =D ~T~"

After I watched this movie, I felt a renewed disturbance to my core as to how human beings could do such horrible things to each other. I would prefer to just delude myself and think that such things don't happen, but I know better. If you read a bit of honest history, you will hopefully understand this statement: the most horrible things that you can possibly imagine being done, have already been done.<br/><br/>This movie disturbed me so greatly because it made the idea of the Elite Hunting club seem completely plausible.

","POSSIBLE MILD SEMI-SPOILERS<br/><br/>Despite what everyone would have you believe, Hostel is not an exploitive piece of ""torture porn"" - it's a good little movie with no self-doubt about what it is: a pulpy, unpretentious but scary and effective flick, made for horror fans, by horror fans, with no attempts to try and pander to the general public.<br/><br/>I won't lie to you - the torture scenes are pretty goddamn gnarly, and in a couple of places even downright disgusting, but in truth they only make up a very small portion of the film, and the picture has a lot more going for it than just blood and guts. For starters, characters are all pretty likable; I felt actually concerned for them, which is more than can be said for 99% of horror movies post-1980. The scares don't come as much from single, individual acts of torture and depravity, but from an overall feeling of dread of being a million miles from home, in a European village where everyone is in cahoots and is against you. If anything, it belongs with Deliverence in the subgenre of ""Vacation Gone Wrong"" movies...the kind of fear that I'm sure everyone has experienced at least a little of when they've taken a trip for some R n' R.<br/><br/>I saw this in a theater full of teenagers, and I for one really like horror movies with an audience because I get a kick out of the shared reaction.

Yes, it's true, many people will be sensitive to a movie like this, and it isn't a movie for the general public. Some may misinterpret the idea behind this movie, especially because they do not know what the director was aiming for or what his reasons were while making this movie. I don't know if many of you know, but the director based the plot of this movie on real events, as sick as that may sound, and what you saw (or are going to see) is just a display of a very probable situation. You can go psychological here, but honestly I won't feed you a bunch of BS, a movie is a movie, and not everyone will understand the psychological reasonings behind it. In my humble opinion, this movie is worth seeing, if you are a real horror fan that is, because even though some may think that those who start as victims end as victimizers, but if you ask me, I think they're wrong, the turn of events just shows justice. It actually has a plot, and it's not some mindless, time-wasting concoction that in the end will just bring you back where you started."

","From all the interviews I've watched and read from Eli Roth and Quentin Tarrantino, they both appear to be bright and well adjusted. Nothing I have read from either one of them could have prepared me for the unrelenting homophobia and misogyny of their film Hostel. <br/><br/>It has often been said that horror films really need a female protagonist to work. The movie Hostel appears to subvert that convention by appearing to be about an extremely sensitive young man (perhaps even a closeted one) on a trip through Europe. The standard horror film treatment of this topic would be that he would have to shed his more feminine attributes to survive and in the process would develop more self-knowledge. <br/><br/>Instead, we are treated to an abrupt shift in protagonist half-way through the film, no sympathetic characters, an incredibly xenophobic tour of Europe, female characters who are at best whores and at worst murderous sadistic whores, and a man who we are led to believe is a homosexual being drowned in a toilet filled with his own excrement. The one character we could have sympathized with is killed and the one we are left with is impossible to momentarily like. His late conversion from boor to hero is singularly unconvincing. <br/><br/>The film is so busy subverting horror film tropes that it ceases to be one and is instead a glorified snuff film. And not a particularly interesting example of that either."

Compared to Saw this isn't as horrified due to it taking too long to get too the actual horror plus even when it got to the horror there was a good amount of gore but sadly there could of been more but once it got to it was very fascinating. <br/><br/>It's almost like Hostel was just to scratch the surface and Hostel 2 which comes out early 2007 will be the psycho nightmare that will make Saw and Saw 2 look no better than the petty Alone in the Dark movie (atleast I hope so). Overall I would have to say it was a pretty good movie if I do say so myself.."

","Meet Porn & Hellraiser all wrapped up in one movie!!! I did not see a preview, and had no idea what i was in for - the summary does say what you will be watching. Had i known, i probably would not have gone to see it. I looove a good scary movie, but i am not sick in the head and this movie was really trashy and disgusting. Anyways, awhile back i drug my family out to see 'cabin fever' because i thought it looked creepy and good- it was sooo lame that we left after an hour. sooo, when i told my husband how gross Hostel was, he said 'like another cabin fever movie?' i said 'no, different' turns out the same person who did cabin fever - did this movie too- i found that to be quite funny. if anyone out there liked cabin fever - well perhaps you would like this retarded movie too!!

","Hostel was absolutely terrible. I was expecting a psychological thriller or a mystery suspense and it basically amounted to a whole lot of graphic sexual content and body parts getting cut off. There is no plot or likable characters. It had some really gross bloody scenes, but it was not scary at all. It was the most boring movie that I have seen in two years. I was ready for it to be over after about twenty minutes. The sick part really did not begin until the last fifteen minutes. I definitely would not suggest this movie to anyone. It was a waste of time and money. My friends and I thought about leaving during it several times. It was so bad that I can't think of enough stuff to say about it to finish my comments on it. That's it, end of story."
"nolanm_182","8","1","3","15 January 2006"," Not bad, not bad at all for a horror film of today
","I love horror films and have for a long time. I have probably seen every type of horror film out now. I enjoyed Eli Roth's Cabin Fever but I still gave it a bad review. Hostel has a good story going for it. The film is about three college buddies who are backpacking around Europe and going from hostel to hostel hooking up with gorgeous women. One night they hear of a different kind of hostel in Slovakia that has the best women. They are duped and one by one end up in this place. This hostel is for people who want their most sickest, darkest, and twisted fantasies come to life. They pay money to torture, mutilate, and kill a prisoner in this place. The movie is well-done with lighting and camera shots with lots of blood and gore to spare. The movie has lots of moments that make you squirm in your seat, which is what it is supposed to do. Eli Roth's Hostel is a very gory film. Just a word to some guys, don't bring a girlfriend to this movie because they won't like it (trust me). I have to say that Hostel is one of the better horror movies released today and I did enjoy the film and with a simple story with the right mood and plot is good enough for an audience."

","I have seen many horror movies, some good and some only B movies. I have to say I didn't think that the twenty minutes or more of constant sex contributed to the movie and I found it to be too much. Also, I saw this movie with friends and we agree that the movie went beyond the bounds of what could be shown in the theatre. Those with weak stomachs or an aversion to blood and bodily fluids should not see this movie as there is much vomit and blood. The movie, in short, is a huge bloodbath with no real story, just one graphically detailed torture after another. The unrealistic nature of the movie, both in regards to the huge amounts of sex and the torture scene would be laughable if it did not make me lose my lunch. The Eyeball snipping could have been left out as well."
"MatrixCBC","1","1","3","14 January 2006"," Why Quentin Tarantino Should Be Shot...
","Hostel is the worst movie I have seen since Cabin Fever, which, ironically, was also directed by Eli Roth.<br/><br/>I'm not sure WHY people rave over Eli Roth, claiming him to be some sort of new-age visionary of the Horror Genre. His movies are horrifically bad - yet another wink-and-nod to the self-aware post-modern crap that the new generation of film goers believe to be the greatest thing since sliced bread.<br/><br/>Hostel is just another example of such mental masturbation. People speak of how effective the movie is, but I failed to see this. The first half of the movie is all exposition, and fails to endear any of the characters to the audience. You feel nothing FOR the characters, and the only character who receives any development is Josh. In fact, his character is the only one who is likable, and yet, even on the most basic levels, I failed to actually care about him.<br/><br/>As the movie continues, only one scene was TRULY ""eerie"" or ""gross."" In a near-empty theatre, my friend and I were the only ones laughing at how the audience failed to react to the ""gore"" effects, brought to us by the oft-acclaimed Greg Nicatero (Land of the Dead).<br/><br/>Which brings me to the special make-up effects. This is where I was surprised to be let down. Greg, a student of Tom Savini, a true MASTER of horror make-up effects, was also on the staff of George A. Romero's Day of the Dead and Land of the Dead. His work on Land was some of the most phenomenal make-up in modern movies. However, I was sorely disappointed in the originality (with the exception of the eyeball) of the effects, the execution of almost every effect, and his amazing lack of ability to make them look in any way realistic. Particularly disappointing was the fact that he comes from Savini's school of make-up effects, which tends to lead to some of the best effects in the industry.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a one-star film, over-hyped by an industry in desperate need of a new face for horror. As is tradition in the film industry, whenever something slightly different comes along in the horror genre, it gets marketed as being the great innovation of our age. What makes it more disappointing is the fact that the new generation of film-goers believe it, verbatim. They reel with disgust at scenes of ""violence"" that are simply banal and old hat. These are the same death scenes we've been seeing for three decades, but no one bothered to catalog them, apparently.<br/><br/>What the industry REALLY needs is a resurgence of the classic horror film. We are re-entering the age of self-assurance. We are going back to what made the eighties a great decade for horror. When we become complacent...when we get too comfortable in our own shoes, we need to be reminded that bad things happen to good people. That is what Halloween, Friday the 13th, Sleepaway Camp, and Nightmare on Elm Street were REALLY about, and that is why they scared us, so much. Now, when we watch them, we think them campy, humorous, and outright laughable. As we near this new age of comfort and security, we need these films to remind us that, when removed from our safety zone, we open ourselves to a whole new world of terror. However, if Quentin Tarantino and Eli Roth are the new faces in this genre, I'm going back to the classics."

Eli Roth redeemed himself in my opinion, from cabin fever. lots of intense scenes and hot women. If you are looking for lots of gore and naked women this is a movie for you. But if you're looking for a movie like saw 2, with lots of twists and surprises. This isn't a movie for you.

How am I supposed to know that ""sexual content"" means full out naked orgies? Other movies have this same description have no nudity and but implied sexual themes.

","When I viewed this film I found the first portion displeasing. There is too much female nudity. A balance would have been a better choice. The audience is held captive by hints. We squirm in our seats to see what it is that is not being revealed. It is a strong quality when a movie can cause restlessness in the viewer. In the movie Seven towards the end there is a wonderful example of hinting. We think that we saw the head in the box, when it was not shown. Only hinted at. I found that this film did not use this trick to its advantage. There were more than enough for us to come to the conclusion that these were sex hungry young kids. In the future I would encourage movie makers to second think these types of choices. I very much enjoyed the bloody gore of the rest of the film. I jumped with excitement when the girls eye was hanging out of her head. Then he cut it off! All the juice gushed out. That was SO cool. I love the part where the guys slips on the blood of the main guy and gets the saw cutting him. I also love the part where the guy who like to eat with his hands gets his fingers cut off and then his head put into the bloody toilet water. A thriller. Aside from the overabundant scenes of nudity Ireally enjoyed this film."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this film & while I was watching it I didn't foresee just how much it would trouble me the next day. I find myself wondering how true this story is & it terrifies me to think that places and activities like those depicted in 'Hostel' may actually exist. I keep imagining the scene involving an American businessman who is drilling the eye of a helpless girl while she is awake through the whole disgusting act.<br/><br/>The film is also extremely realistic which also added to the whole atmosphere of it. I can't help but still visualize scenes from the film as though they were real. Of course I realize they were just actors and special effects but it is a testament to director Eli Roth that he could create such realism.<br/><br/>I witnessed at least 6 people who walked out of the cinema while we were watching & whilst I never felt the urge to do this myself, there was one moment in which a character is vomiting in fear that almost made me throw up myself. I don't believe a film has ever caused that sensation in me before! In the end it is worth sitting through brutal acts that shock & disgust purely because the entire end piece does provide satisfaction & this viewer certainly thought that it ended appropriately.<br/><br/>If you are of a weak stomach don't even bother watching this, but if you can handle shocking stuff & can appreciate them for plot value you will thoroughly enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>It's been quite a while since I saw a movie that had this many talking points and I doubt there will be anything to come close to it for shock value for the rest of 2006!"

","I must say there were several times in this movie that I just cringed and clinched my teeth. I didn't know what to expect with all of the hype surrounding this movie. There have been some many MTV-style, junk horror movies that have come out. Movies like Cry Wolf, Wolf Creek, The Grudge have been disappointing. Enough on those, I've already wasted too much time on them already.<br/><br/>This movie is a breath of fresh air from a director, Eli Roth, that tried to make a good horror movie not just money. I enjoyed Cabin Fever for the most part. Its not the best horror movie I've seen, but still it was pretty good for a young director. In Hostel, Eli Roth showed growth in storytelling and in sickness.<br/><br/>The hype lived up to the billing. The deaths and premise of the movie are all twisted and creative. The scripts and performance were also very good. Eli Roth does a very good job of creating memorable characters that add to the story. The script was humorous when it needed to be.<br/><br/>Almost all of the elements, with the exception of 80's rock, were in this movie. Sex, drugs, hot chicks, deaths, and torture are all in good supply for this movie. I can see why Quentin Tarantino put his name on this one.

Even though there wasn't just one killer in hostel, the guy still killed the killer in his eyes (and i would like to think he goes back home and tells of whats going on there so it doesn't go unnoticed) but compared to every other horror movie, the has what others seldomly don't have. a plot."

","Hostel, proves Eli Roth can do suspense, which is great. Cabin Fever proved he could do gore, which is great. Hostel was a solid disturbing and suspenseful movie, yet it was not ""balls out"" extreme by any standard. Personally, I thought Cabin Fever got away with more in theaters.<br/><br/>Hostel was only disappointing because the gore was implied gore. Maybe once an unrated DVD comes out, will we truly see what Hostel was made of. Don't get me wrong here, the implied thoughts were sick, but thats all the true gore was, implied and not shown.<br/><br/>I am not bashing this movie. This was an awesome movie, which will hopefully raise the bar for suspense. This was the first good suspense film in the 21st century. I guess message boards are really the reason I was disappointed. Message Boards everywhere compared this film to the disturbing pictures like Salo, Cannibal Holocaust and Men Behind The Sun, when in fact it really didn't compare to modern movies like The Devils Rejects or House Of Wax. Both of these films were nothing in terms of movie quality, but they sure as hell got away with a lot more than Hostel did in theaters.<br/><br/>So I am saying, go see this great movie, only go seeing it as a solid suspense movie, not a gore-fest like the previews made it out to be."

","Eli Roth's brilliantly horrifying story of what fate awaits three young men looking to sow their wild oats while vacationing in Europe.

After a period of partying and cheap thrills, these friends discover they're nothing more than unlucky possessions in grisly games of torture and death.<br/><br/>I think the gradual unraveling of how these sadistic events come to be ia very intriguing and distrubingly real. I've subsequently learned that there were at least two endings filmed, and without going into detail I'll just say that the version which was re-shot to play in theaters upon the movie's original release was the much stronger and satisfying of the two."

Nevertheless, the beginning was far from boring, as it made you attach to the characters more emotionally. I don't mean to contradict myself, but it isn't the goriest movie ever, not by far. Only a handful of violent acts are actually seen taking place, the rest are left to the imagination (which can sometimes be worse than any digital effect).

","Wow, what potential this film had! Billed as ""the most terrifying American movie in a decade,"" ""Hostel"" had all the marketing savvy to lead me to believe I was in for one helluva ride. Alas, this was not to be the case; sorry to say, considering the interesting premise. Incidentally, the pseudo-retro ""it's only a movie"" campaign is nothing more than a con job.<br/><br/>From the seemingly endless beginning leading up to ""the action,"" to the failure to make me give a damn about any of the leading characters, to the MILDLY satisfying ending, ""Hostel"" left me secure in the knowledge that once again, I'd allowed myself to get suckered out of $10 and 1 hour and 50minutes of my life. I should have known right from the credits - ""Quentin Tarantino presents..."" (when there are, indeed, TWO additional producers) - that this whole project was your typical Hollywood bait-and-switch. And incidentally, even if Roth had been allowed to retain every frame of violence shot, his inability to build suspense renders this footage, and this film, completely ineffective.<br/><br/>What makes the failure of this film all the more tragic is that Roth does succeed in two or three oh-so-fleeting moments to genuinely terrify. Without citing spoilers, allow me to say that these brief moments demonstrate that he's paid attention at some point to an important lesson or two.<br/><br/>I just have to throw this in....I didn't know precisely what would happen during the course of this film. I knew the general premise, and that pretty much interested me in seeing this, no matter WHAT the marketing campaign had to say. As hard as I tried, I simply could NOT care about the characters, sympathize with their fear and plight, let go of the plot holes or suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>Now on the other hand, Marcus Nispel's remake of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" had the completely opposite effect on me. Going in, I knew exactly what would happen - almost frame-by-frame. So much so, that I was all but convinced I was wasting my time. However (and what a pleasant however this is), Marcus succeeded in scaring that daylights out of me, and without nearly the gore Roth felt compelled to use. The secret? Suspense and artistry. ""Chainsaw"" had me completely hooked on every level - visually, aurally & viscerally. I remember walking out of that picture, and calling everyone I knew to just say ""hi!"".<br/><br/>Now THAT was a horror movie. ""Hostel,"" unfortunately, pales in comparison."

This movie isn't anything you haven't seen before in this type of genre, in fact, if you believe all the hype, you will be disappointed.

For the rest of us, this isn't anything more graphic or bloody than plenty of other movies that sell them self as the scariest movie of the year. If you have seen Ichi the Killer, you've seen a bloodier movie than this. If you have seen Irreversible, you have seen a more disturbing movie than this. Hell, if you've seen Passion of the Christ, you've seen a more brutal and disturbing film than this.

What was said in the other review on here is all true, the level of gore and violence is extreme. Not necessarily in its graphic nature (although that is there) but more because this is NOT fantasy violence. Its all human on human actions with some very nasty people and a very bleak final comment on human nature (at least thats how I read it). I enjoyed the first 45 mins as we get to know the protagonists a little before they head into the real story and the blood starts to flow.

Someone needs to teach him how to make a great horror movie that's scary and creepy, not a crock of crap. The acting is as bad as anything else. Jay Hernandez should've never auditioned for this film. Everyone in the cast must be desperate for work, this movie has mainly no storyline. Just torture and the killers cutting off their victims' body parts. The special effects maybe cool to watch on the behind the scenes feature DVD, but in the film it's way to graphic and explicit. Shock value, should not be the main source for trying to create scares. It only disguises the viewer and make them want to throw up.

It was directed and written by Eli Roth, the director of Inglorious Bastards, Knock Knock, Clown and also the sequel, Hostel Part: II. Hostel is very strong and graphic in all ways possible. The idea of it is amazing, but something must've went wrong during production, because the turnout of the film in the end is completely terrible. It's a flush the DVD down your toilet type of horror film. <br/><br/>I'm shocked that the studios and the production companies decided to go through with making this movie. It's a shame that they produced the wrong horror film when another amazing one could've been made instead of this trashheaped garbage. The horror factor is nothing scary or creepy, only blood and guts. Body parts being torn and the film is mainly pure torture. Nothing to get excited about or want to see again, and again and again. So on and so forth this movie should be banned from all stores that sell DVDs and on the internet. Sites like Amazon should not have this movie in stock. The fact that this movie reminds me of human trafficking is somewhat interesting, because it does happen in real life. Having said that, there's nothing else in this movie that makes it worth a second viewing or even to watch it on Halloween. It's a load of crap with terrible dialogue and way to graphically over the top extreme violence with gore. Featuring tones of cuss words, which horror films can do without or very little of. If you own this movie, throw it out. Just know that this film is the kind that is banned in certain countries. I wish that it was never made. Eli Roth should be ashamed of himself. We want new horror that's good and creative, not the same old junk that has been coming out what seems like every year or so. Since he went to film school, I wonder at times if he really paid attention on how to make great films, or if he was just in a rush to get into the industry. If I knew what I know now, I would've never watched this film in the first place. I'm glade that I saw this piece of junk for free. It's in my Grandma's movie collection. Otherwise, I wouldn't have even paid a penny to see this. We need better horror films than this, we need scary and creepy, not gore, swearing and all of this graphic nudity and sex scenes they put in now a days. That distracts the viewers and they can't really concentrate on the storyline with nudity and sex every ten to fifteen minutes within the film. It's not worth anything. Save your money for a great film that will wow you. This film will just make horror fans feel dumb that they got tricked out of their money and want to smack themselves in the face.<br/><br/>Overall it's a thumbs down.<br/><br/>2 and 1/2 stars."
"a_chinn","10","1","4","23 December 2017"," Unfairly dismissed as torture porn, it's one of the most effective horror films of the past 20 years.
","Unfairly dismissed as torture porn by many critics, this terrific horror film plays off audience expectations and takes them on a terrifying ride you cannot predict where it will go. The story revolves around a group of three Americans traveling through Europe, staying in hostels. Two are obnoxious party-boys and one is the nice-guy character. When one of the obnoxious guys is lured away by pretty girls, the two remaining become suspicious of what happened and begin to investigate. All the while, since the film opened with images of horrific implements of torture in a dark, dank torture chamber, the audience has already had seeds planted in their minds of what really happened. Writer/director Eli Roth does an amazing job of playing against horror film tropes and audience expectations, particularly (SPOILER ALERT) when he kills off the nice-guy hero of the film Marion Crane-style and the audience is left without a safety net. After that, it feels as if anything is possible, which has the impact of creating genuine suspense now that we've seen that all of the characters are expendable. Roth really knows his horror films (his first film, ""Cabin Fever,"" was a slasher film without a slasher, and it completely worked), and he uses that knowledge to surprise the audience throughout. When the nice-guy is killed, it's as if all bets are off and anything can happen. It also helps that the film doesn't feature and name actors, because when you cast Brad Pitt in your film, you know Brad Pitt isn't going to be killed. This tension is olstered by Roth establishing early on in the film that he's not going to cut away from the violence and that he is going to show the audience the full bloody graphic horror of what's happening (and it's extreme!). As with the best horror films, ""Hostel"" has an interesting subtext about America's interventionist nature around the globe and how that's received by the rest of the world. American arrogance is a ripe topic for a revenge-like thriller, especially when it's framed around an underground Eastern European business that caters to the depraved murderous desires of wealthy men who want the exotic adventure of torturing and murdering attractive youth without consequences.This film is credited (or accused) of ushering in the ""torture porn"" horror subgenera, which it most certainly did. Extreme horror films, like ""Audition"" or ""Ichi the Killer"" had been around Asia Cinema for awhile, and Roth rightfully gives a not to those film with a cameo appearance by Takashi Miike, the likely the originator of ""extreme"" horror films. ""Saw"" did come out the year before, but it relied more on traditional implied horror instead of showing all the graphic violence (unlike it's subsequent sequels). Roth also provides other nods that horror fans will likely pick up on, such as the slow tracking shots of the door at the end of the torture hallway as a nice homage to the menacing door at the end of the hall in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Overall, ""Hostel"" is a film that is not intended to appeal to a wide audience and not even to all horror fans, but for horror film fans of a hearty nature, this film is amazing!"
"mshavzin","10","1","4","2 July 2017"," why the hostility towards this movie?
","Its really not worth ten stars, but so many people are disliking the story for no good reason, I felt like i should even it out. First of all, I am EXTREMELY disturbed by people saying they had no sympathy for young men being tortured to death because they ""didn't like them enough"". Really? I would have sympathy for anyone brutally murdered. Then we have the people who are upset with portrayal of Slovalkia, or upset that a gay character was portrayed as a bad person. Get over it. Gay people can be as bad or as good as anyone else. The film is clever enough. There isn't much story, but what there is fits together very well. The reason they were killed is because someone felt like killing them for gratification, and they had the opportunity because they are foreigners. Thats it."
"bowmanblue","8","1","4","14 October 2014"," Sets a new – and disturbing – standard among modern day films
","In case you didn't already know... 'Hostel' (the second major film by Eli Roth) kind of spawned the rather dubious genre of 'torture porn.' This is where gratuitous on-screen violence is displayed for our – the audience's – entertainment.<br/><br/>And that's basically the premise of the film. If you're okay with that, you'll enjoy it. As, believe it or not, there's also a story woven somewhere in there. Two American teenagers are backpacking across Europe where they hear of a 'legendary' hostel in Eastern Europe where the girls outnumber the guys and do all sorts of other stuff (to put it mildly). Naturally, they head off there and – even more naturally still – they fall foul to all sorts of unspeakable scenarios.<br/><br/>And, if you can get over of the violence, it's not actually that bad. You'll like the characters – they're dumb enough to be believable as your average backpacking teenagers, but not so stupid enough that you'll be shouting at the screen when they make the wrong decisions. Plus the 'threat' element is pretty original and based on numerous urban legends.<br/><br/>So, just to check, if you're okay with gratuitous sex and violence and generally like horror films then you should probably enjoy this (and part II even, but just don't bother with part III – it went straight to DVD)."
"adamscastlevania2","2","1","4","23 August 2014"," Gross and gripping, but lazily rushed together
","(17%) The concept of a slasher movie in which the victims cannot escape or fight back unless the person doing the slashing is clumsier than Mr Bean, or is as incompetent as a Nazi jail watchman in a silly WW2 set yarn, as it doesn't matter how many chainsaws get waved around, or toes get cut off, this just isn't as intense as it needs to be. Mr Roth may know how to hold a camera, but I doubt the words ""rewrite"" or ""2nd draft"" hold much meaning to him. I expect he's of the opinion that for as long as there are plenty of on-screen bare breasts then no one will notice the fact that the actors are spouting totally awful dialogue, and that the plot really needed a rethink, whilst at the same time all likelihood, contrivance and normal human sense is bent to breaking point when the last remaining character finds his way into the chamber of horrors by a preposterously lazy manner. Overall this is a nasty, juvenile, black-hearted, though quite well shot, exploitation feature that really has nothing new to offer apart from repackaged ideas. And while it's vile enough to to upset most normal people, it's not to the extent in which it gets the dreaded NC-17 rating resulting in the produces lose all their money. True exploitation money focused trash then."

"Calaboss","8","1","4","8 March 2010"," Why All The Squeamishness?
","I watched this movie last night on the SyFy channel. I enjoy a good horror/slasher movie now and again and I was quite impressed with this one. A much more elaborate story than you usually get with movies in this genre. So I came to IMDb and slapped an 8 on it.<br/><br/>Then I checked some reviews and saw comments ranging from ""impressed with the utter carnage"" to ""This is an absolutely horrible film that only sick people would watch"". Having just watched it on SyFy I wondered how much horror I must have missed due to editing for TV. So I dash up and rent the unrated version (not the R rated) to see all the good stuff I missed.<br/><br/>Silly me. There was about 3 seconds more movie in the unrated version than the version I had just watched on basic cable. One second involving an ankle and two seconds involving puss coming out of a wound. Frankly, the stuff they DID show was much worse than the stuff they DIDN'T. And, of course, they blurred the boobies on cable. Good movie, but I didn't see more gore than has been shown in other movies long before this.<br/><br/>On a side note, how about our American morals? It's OK for kids to see limbs chopped off with a chain saw on basic cable, but by god, don't let them see a woman's breast."

When you plonk down 10.00 it would be nice to think you are getting something that has some thought involved.

","It's really hard to review this film without using bad words, which I know IMDb wouldn't allow. So I'll try to keep things civil. This is a sick, sick film. And NOT in the good way. Not in the ""Tarantino is so cool because of the way he looks at violence"" kind of way. Just in the perverted, amoral, sick-MINDED, ""somebody seriously needs to get some therapy"" kind of way. Yeah, THAT kind of sick. The kind of sick film that you can't have any fun watching because you can tell the person who made it is truly as depraved as he seems. The kind of ""horror"" film that offers no horror other than what is BEHIND the scenes: the horror of Eli Roth's mind, the filth and sleaze that lies within it. The kind of film where physical violence is conceptualized as a kind of pornography and where you're supposed to get your ""I Heart Torture"" jollies watching it. Think snuff films. Think those ""Real Death"" videos that you see in the bin at the Slurp-n-Snort on the interstate. That's the level that Roth/Tarantino were stopping to here, and, though someone will certainly argue that Roth is so ""cool"" because he draws your attention to social phenomena blah blah blah mental masturbation and it's a reflection of intellectual spew which shows us how we artist wannabe claptrap.... No, it's petty, it's disgusting, it's vile, it's corrupt, it's debauched -- and Eli Roth wants you to think it's art."

","The first thing i thought when i saw the movie was: Is this Europe as Americans see it? ... sex, drugs, murder all day long. A run down continent? - Then i knew! It's irony! Ha! The movie should point out how stupid Americans are, that think this way, by just overdoing it. And that the guys in the movie had to pay more for an American to kill wasn't arrogance, that was some kind of mirror held up in front of US - kids. Or, was it? Finally I thought: No matter whether the director sees Europe like this or the audience he wanted to mess around with ... some seem to do.<br/><br/>So here's my question: Do any of you somehow believe that the image you are getting of Europe in this movie is true in any single way? <br/><br/>Would be interested ..."
"donquixote","1","1","4","29 May 2007"," Destroy every copy of this film!
","Lesson 1: It pays to do your research! The plot of this film is utterly wretched. I simply can't find adjectives bad enough to describe it. Save yourself the trouble and find something else to pass the time. Having seen 'Tarantino' somewhere in the opening credits, I felt casually reassured that the film would be worth watching in the erroneous belief that it was he who wrote and directed it. Monumental mistake! OK I thought, so this is maybe not another 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Kill Bill' - no one can keep churning masterpieces forever, can they? - but it's Tarantino and anything coming from him must be worth a look.<br/><br/>When the film had finished I sat a few minutes in disbelief. Had Tarantino finally 'lost the plot' ? Delirious with shock, I reasoned that he's maybe in a 'transitional period' exploring the boundaries of gore and decency: new avenues to shock, horror and disgust? Or maybe past successes have finally gone to his head. Thus every now and then, bored, he might emerge from retirement and make a few more bucks knocking out a flick, secure in the knowledge that his name alone would get the audiences (and money) rolling in. But of course, Tarantino didn't write and direct this film as I found out ONLY when I ventured to air my disgust here. As I say . . . do your research! In some frighteningly obscure way the film oversteps the boundary between acceptable horror fantasy and a horrific plausible reality. It explores incomprehensible sadistic depravity at its most extreme making it effortless to place yourself in the role of the victim! There is no detachment: the scenes of torture are as graphic as you can imagine. In this sense it is wholly irresponsible. Such is the theme of this film that it conveys a grave and disturbing sense that somewhere out there it will serve to fuel the perverse appetite and imagination of a sick, sadistic monster that may go out and re-enact exactly what they've just seen.<br/><br/>If I had my way, I would destroy every copy of the film in existence, ban Eli Roth from ever making another film and fine Mr Tarantino for his part in its production. The makers of this film are evidently devoid of any moral responsibility to society in lacking the foresight to realise that there really are sick, perverted monsters out there who could use such material as a blueprint. Had the torture scenes featured children or pregnant women there would (hopefully) have been moral outrage. As it stands, Eli Roth has sailed as close to that precipice as he possibly could and so far seems to have gotten away with it."
"Phantasm01","2","1","4","27 January 2007"," 1.5 STARS: ""New Age"" horror (if you can call it that)...a tale of torture, pain and suffering may be more accurate.
","must admit that these ""New Age"" horror movies like ""Hostel"", ""Cabin Fever"" and the ""Saw"" movies really make me laugh. If Stanley Kubrick were alive, he would laugh too. These movies are not difficult to create, nor do they exhibit any real talent on the part of the director and certainly not the actors. Nevertheless, I found ""Hostel"" somewhat entertaining in more of a dark comedy kind of way than a horror flick. Let's face the fact that there is nothing scary or horrifying about this movie. It's gruesome and makes you want to recount your fingers and toes to make sure they are all there, but it's not a horror movie in the classic or traditional sense of the genre. The fear, scary if you will, and atmospheric elements are completely lacking.<br/><br/>What ""Hostel"" stands for is the new age of horror movies (if you can even call it that) that focuses more on torture, pain, suffering and gore more than anything else and is largely unimaginative invoking no sense of fear in the audience but a sense of dread more than anything else. ""Hostel"" is indicative of the fact that the horror genre is undergoing a kind of metamorphasis probably because of a lack of creativity and imagination on the part of the creators of such flicks. For the life of me, I don't see how anyone can call the ""Saw"" films, ""Cabin Fever"" or ""Hostel"" scary in the true sense of the word.<br/><br/>""Hostel"" is primarily about a group of sex-crazed young men who decide to go to Amsterdam to pick up girls, (mostly prostitutes) and have a good time. Well, they end up at a place where inflicting suffering and pain is sold to those who would pay to indulge themselves. The problem is that our sex-crazed young men are some of the most prized torture-objects of these sadistic individuals' insatiable desire. What proceeds is simply ""a tale of torture, pain and suffering"" which is basically what ""Hostel"" is all about. If this appeals to you, ""Hostel"" is right up your alley...if you are looking for a scary movie or traditional horror movie, you need to stay clear of ""Hostel"". As I said, I found ""Hostel"" entertaining from a dark comedy standpoint and that's all. However, I think it's significant to the viewer that not only is the acting extremely poor in this movie, it is also worth noting that there really aren't any characters in this movie (of any significance) worth sympathizing with except for maybe the oriental girl, but she's not a main character.<br/><br/>I do not want to give ""Hostel"" any moral credit as that would insult the creators of this fine flick, but one could look at ""Hostel"" from a variety of different ways. Perhaps we should look at the irony in ""Hostel"" in that when you are on the hunt for something, you could also be the hunted as well, especially in lands that we know little about and where we are also not protected by the laws, liberties and rights that we have in the United States. A great example of a movie where this is true is ""The Midnight Express"" starring Brad Davis. While the parallels may be weak between the two, I think the reader can see where I'm coming from in this regard. All in all, I mildly enjoyed ""Hostel"" but not for the reasons that most people liked it. Truth be told, this movie does not deserve two (2) stars as a horror movie, but for its entertainment value, I'll give it 1.5 stars. After having seen Eli Roth's ""Hostel"" and ""Cabin Fever"", I think it's safe to say that Mr. Roth would not know a horror movie from a cheerio."

"fedor8","Null","1","4","2 January 2007"," Slowakians must love this sadistic thriller.
","It's hard for me to give this movie a rating. I am torn between 9 stars and 2 stars. This is possibly the most depraved, nightmarish, most sickening horror film I've ever seen. Except that even I'm not sure whether that makes it an excellent film or a piece of s*** that would've been better left unmade. However, I shouldn't have been too surprised by such unhinged sadism; after ""Saw"" had such success, I should've known that irresponsible sadism would hit its stride in horror. (Not that there wasn't any before) But while ""Saw"" is supremely idiotic and utterly logic-free, ""Hostel"" is not as far-fetched (though that isn't saying much, actually, ""Saw"" being so INCREDIBLY dumb). There is no question that a criminal (soft word here) operation such as pay-to-torture is not only realistic, but could even already exist in some form. To criticize the movie on the basis of its basic premise I'll leave to the reality-challenged. What IS far-fetched to the point of ludicrousness is that such a crime net would involve such a large number of people, practically an entire town, and perhaps even the whole state of Slovakia  in this case; I'm not sure if that was implied or not. Ah, yes The Slovakians must be thrilled about this movie. Needless to say, it's probably banned there, and Elli Roth, the writer-director, is probably at the top of everyone's s***list. And here's the other point about the premise: it would've been far more realistic if set in some African or especially South American country. While a solid choice if the choices were limited to Europe, Slovakia is hardly an ideal choice in general. As for Europe: Russia, Ukraine, Byelorussia All those would have done. However, Paraguay or Bolivia, or some such semi-developed country would've been more realistic (though I admit a little less effective). Since the movie is out for realism and not fantasy, I think the main character's escape is ludicrous. Sure, the movie would've been even tougher to watch if there hadn't been a good dose of revenge at the end, but the escape was too easy  relatively speaking. The sadism is self-indulgent and clearly stemming from a sick mind. Elli Roth can talk all he wants about wanting to make a truly frightening film (which he succeeded in, no argument there) and that he researched for it, bla-bla-bla, but the bottom line is that Roth is a mental patient, just as those cretins who did ""Saw"" are. Kids will watch this, and they shouldn't. Hell, even I shouldn't be watching such sickening depravity! There is no real point to the movie, except on the dumbest level i.e. ""don't go backpacking to remote places or make friends with strangers or have sex with Russian girls whose breasts are too good to be true"". The film is a sheer exercise in the most degenerate kind of enjoyment in physical torture, and should be liked only by psychopaths, sociopaths and other ""paths"". I am anything but a proponent of the ""Golden Age"" of film. i.e. the naïve 30s and 40s (with their mostly dull and silly movies), but it is interesting to compare ""Dracula"" from the 30s with something like this. How far has it all gone? Or: how low has the world sunk? Never mind that the movie is fascinating and unforgettable: so are train-wrecks, but that doesn't mean we should have them and enjoy them. Trust Tarantino, that prototype of a 90s geek, to give this thing his blessing. The fact that someone as retarded as him spearheads modern US cinema is truly sad. Leading directors of the past were hardly intellectuals, but next to Quentin they were gods. This little nerd, who so perversely and gleefully enjoys sadism and torture, would scream like not one but 38 little girls if a psychopath so much as said ""hello"" to him. People like him need a reality check. To treat torture as a form of mindless entertainment is a sign of high retardation and having the moral sense of a lizard. That is why I've always called him an ""idiot savant"", a moron genius. Talented, but utterly hollow, no substance there. Visually, the movie is highly effective. Roth is clearly very talented. The chamber scenes are unbelievably somber, and compliments for not directing them in the MTV style which would have made it all less effective because less realistic. The atmosphere Roth creates in the dungeons is uniquely brilliant. A drawback, which I nearly forgot considering the other aspects, is that the movie takes a half-hour to get started, which I hate in horror films. (I believe in the ""Evil Dead"" school of horror-film-making where no minute is wasted.)"

The violence however will be a talking point but i don't see what the fuss is about. The Violence is fast but effective the only real section where the film focuses on violence is the last 30 mins and that is totally justified. i know that some people will write on here ""oh what was all the fuss about?"" well the fuss is that everyone in my screening left feeling confused about enjoying it because the violence is so real and most of all how spectacular the movie was, even though at times i was watching it through my fingers.<br/><br/>I just wanna congratulate Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino for giving me one of the best cinema experiences of my life cheers fellas"

","Hostel based on content, acting, suspense, and story line, is a great horror movie. Until I realized that Eli Roth directed this movie, he came a long way and grew a lot from Cabin Fever (which I thought was cheesy and weak). Eli did a great movie because the camera shots, angles, movements, lighting, and acting seemed very believable. I would be proud if I produced a movie like this. It left me clenching at the end of the movie, and that's the type of horror movies that should be shown on the big screen, not those cheesy-zombie-horrible acting with bad writing movies. Hostel deserves 9 of 10 stars. Wonderful job to cast and crew of Hostel! =)"
"Ky-D","9","1","4","2 February 2006"," Roth makes good on his second feature.
","I will be quick to admit that I was a long time hater of 'Cabin Fever'; the film simply failed to work for me on any desired level. It wasn't until I perused the special features on the DVD that I gained some manner of acceptance for it's quirky charm. That being said, it would be fair to surmise that I had little expectation for 'Hostel'. How violently I would be surprised...<br/><br/>Three back-packers (2 Americans, 1 Icelander) are Euro-trippin' their way across the continent in search of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. Beginning to wind down some, they have their collective interest piqued when a man suggests a hostel in Bratislava where they can satisfy their youthful urges. Unable to resist an offer they would never want to refuse, they hop a train and are on their way. The initial arrival is unceremonious, until they reach the hostel and it turns out to be everything they had hoped for. After a night of partying, one the group disappears, seemingly having moved on by himself. Things continue for the lads until another member goes missing. Now the remaining thrill seekers decide to find their friends, only to get caught up in something far darker and more sinister than they ever could have imagined...<br/><br/>For pure bang for your buck, 'Hostel' out guns pretty much every mainstream movie ever made, even out doing most of the infamous gaillo films is has taken inspiration from. Little is spared the viewer in the depictions of violence and sexuality (I found myself questioning the R-rating more than once), yet it manages the difficult feat of never slipping into exploitation. The violence is brutal and jarring, never once fun or jokey; the sex/nudity is cold and detached, never presenting the feeling of sensuality or eros; and the overall tone of the film perfectly transitions from that of happy-go-lucky party hardy to sheer, gut-churning fear.<br/><br/>The actors (a talented group of unknowns) bring the right amount of youthful decadence to the roles while still feeling like any ol' joe shmoe; they my be a little wild, but it seems more like a phase than who they are. Happily, the characters are developed to the proper point without the filmmakers having to beat details into our collective viewing mind.<br/><br/>The film does make a few small mistakes amongst all that it does right, however. For one thing the first story arc runs a little long while the second movement is over with a tad too quickly. For another, the conclusion is aesthetically satisfying, yet is a little short on post-script. And finally, the film is really dark; not as in the content, but as in the lighting, it's so dark at times so as to make viewing difficult.<br/><br/>Falws considered, this is a masterful horror tale from one of horror most talented new directors.<br/><br/>9/10"
"che_edwards","8","1","4","3 February 2006"," blood for the sake of blood
","if you've seen cabin fever, you'll know that Eli Roth likes humor as much as his horror. Hostel is no different. firstly hotel is leaps and bounds above cabin fever in every aspect. it is very gory, but that isn't why it works. the premise of men paying money to torture others is a truly terrifying prospect, and this idea is treated well here. gore fans be warned; this film has it all, chainsaws, blow torches, drills etc. it is extremely dark, and yet at times very funny. one exchange between our hero and an American sicko discussing the best way to dispatch somebody is actually pretty funny. only one scene (unlikely, but necessary) brings the film down, but by that stage i was so impressed with the gore that i didn't care. one tip though. don't take your girlfriend. mine nearly threw up!"
"suzeclark","8","1","4","22 January 2006"," Horror Evolution
","Finally - a horror movie that nods to the Japanese greats (Audition, Ju-On) and is accessible to US viewers.<br/><br/>I am really excited about this evolution - having grown up on Friday the 13ths, The Shining, The Exorcist and Halloween, I'm glad to finally see the genre move away from the much studied and lampooned ""Men, Women & Chainsaws"" formula to a new style (which is probably bound to become formulaic, but at least it will be a new formula, eh?).<br/><br/>I saw Hostel with trepidation. I've been disappointed by American horror movies over and over - we even saw previews for some of the same old, same old - ""When a Stranger Calls."" Sigh - now our childhood slumber party stories are being turned into movies. I eagerly await the one about the escaped crazy man with a hook and the teenagers necking in the car.<br/><br/>The reviews I read were mixed - one of them caught my eye though. In the SF Gate website, the reviewer mentioned that the first part of the story wasn't horror - a bit funny, even. I immediately thought of Audition by Takashi Miike.<br/><br/>How pleased was I to find that Miike made a cameo in this movie?! The story starts out normal enough - a couple of Americans are in Amsterdam, partying it up - Roth even puts in a sly reference to the carnival aspects of Amsterdam that most Americans see when they go there when one of the characters asks ""Do any Dutch people live in Amsterdam?"" They move on to Slovakia - and I remembered my own European jog - the alien-ness of the newly accessible Central Europe. It is beautiful and seems desolate. Like other parts of the world, the environment makes you cast aside any ideas you had about privilege. No one really judges you for being American but there is no safe-haven either. There are few embassies and far less English is spoken than in other countries. You've got to behave yourself and hope nothing bad happens.<br/><br/>Roth's message is clear. These boys are like pampered beef wandering out of their pens and into the wilderness. They are picked off one by one, the last finally realizing, through a series of mishaps that something odd is going on.<br/><br/>Then the horror begins. The character I liked least, the pretty, lets-get-laid, smarm meister becomes the hero. That was a nice touch. Roth does a great job of setting up a series of situations that allow you to hope he will escape. He nearly does - and then, in typical hero style, goes back for the girl that he wasn't even interested in screwing (also a nice touch).<br/><br/>Like Audition, the ending is satisfying from the viewer's point of view. There is no lingering feeling of ""darn, he was so close to getting away"" and a nice dose of revenge. Although it was satisfying, I was a tad disappointed by the ending.<br/><br/>Before I wax philosophic about my own trip to Central Europe and how I misplaced a traveling companion there for a bit, I will conclude this review. However, this movie is definitely worth seeing - and hopefully the director's cut on DVD is not too far off.<br/><br/>Yea Eli Roth!"
"benoit-3","1","1","4","18 January 2006"," The perfect date (rape) film for Bush's America
","So, this is what is to be found at the bottom of the long, slow, slippery slope of America's gradual moral degradation and ""cultural roll in the gutter"", from Coppola's first glorification of organized crime, in ""The Godfather"" (the ""creed of greed""), to that old reliable sicko Quentin Tarantino's more explicit oeuvre of populist sadistic know-how (the ""culture of torture"") Thirty years ago, Hollywood's schlockmeisters started to glorify the creed of greed by which anything can be had for a price, by which the fastest acquisition possible of your neighbour's material goods justifies all moral turpitude before the planet caves in under global warming, from individual get-rich-quick schemes to giant corporate appetites like Enron's to the takeover of entire nations in search of fossil fuels. The soap-opera about the Corleone family now looks like a timid blueprint for the career of George W. Bush. Hollywood then proceeded to desensitize a willing public to violence, death and the dignity of human life, by feeding it a steady diet of round-the-clock mortuary thrills, uncensored slasher films, detailed depictions of sadistic behaviour, TV movies recreating the Bernardo-Homolka murders (over the objections of the victims' families) and other real-life or imagined atrocities, crime scene investigations and sitcoms/dramas/reality shows about the private lives of undertakers, Mafia hit men or serial murder profilers. Finally, American popular cinema now delivers the ultimate goods, films where the viewer becomes the virtual torturer and, if he has any inkling of morality left (hey, it might happen), he will be tortured in return - at least mentally. I don't think there is a more despicable way to make a buck. Do you? But then, what do I know? I'm only Canadian.<br/><br/>On the one hand, ""Hostel"" cynically plays upon the legitimate fears Americans have about the way they are perceived by the rest of the world and, on the other hand, films like ""Hostel"" make those perceptions even more problematic by picturing Americans as a people with a very unhealthy appetite for violent entertainment exclusively concerned with revenge, torture and sadism. And that can't be good...<br/><br/>P.S.: Need further proof of America's attitude when it comes to violent entertainment? Count the number of negative reviews on this site who consider this film is not gory or scary enough and who blame the director for not delivering the psychopathic thrills of ""Saw""..."

","I saw this movie the night after it came out and I was very pleased with it. I was talking about it for weeks, building it up, and it still didn't disappoint. With regards to the gore and suffering expected after viewing the trailers and hearing the rumors, it lived up to the hype and then some. If you enjoy gore movies along the lines of Saw, this will be a step up in the right direction (a huge step up).<br/><br/>What made this movie one to remember is that the story is not as far a stretch as you may expect. You are given the opportunity to bond with the characters, something that is often lacking in other movies in this genre. There is a buildup that creates a tension that the whole theater can feel.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the story does not rocket out of control as it approaches its climax. Everything within the movie is completed with a purpose and it gives the audience the opportunity to understand the escalation with clues along the way.<br/><br/>Most of all, as discussed by some others who have voiced their feedback, this movie actually gets better as you think about it afterwords while piecing together parts that you may have missed during the actual viewing. It's not hard to miss something when you have to turn away due to the gore and the suffering seen within.<br/><br/>So overall, if you are reading this, you are most likely interested in checking this movie out. I say do it out because you will not be disappointed. Finally, make sure to see it soon, as a packed theater only adds to the atmosphere. Enjoy."
"cultfilmfan","8","1","4","7 January 2006"," Hostel
","Hostel is about three young men who are backpacking through Europe. Their names are Paxton, Josh and Oli. Once they get to a Slovakian city things start to get weird and the friends begin to see less and less of each other. Eventually they discover a torture chamber where people come to watch others getting tortured for amusement. Soon the three backpackers might end up as victims of this chamber and of the unusual people around the city. Hostel has good direction, a good script, and good performances by the cast, good film editing and good cinematography. The film is a real adrenaline rush. It has a lot of energy and action, especially in it's second half. In the film's first film there is some good humour as we get to know the three characters and as things go along and people start to disappear the film really kept my interest and I was really curious to find out what would happen next. This is a well crafted horror movie with a pretty original script and some good atmosphere and style. It is very entertaining and full of action. It also has scenes that will make you squirm and get a little uncomfortable as well. All in all Hostel is a stylish film that is an entertaining and action packed film that also has some good horror in it as well. Hostel is the second film from writer/director Eli Roth who brought us 2003's Cabin Fever, a film that I also enjoyed. Roth does a good job here again and if he continues to stick to his own original scripts and his own direction, then I think that he may become one of today's better horror directors because he did a good job with the well crafted and smart Hostel."
"shulmanator","7","1","4","7 January 2006"," Almost a classic. The best film of its kind since the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"".
","This isn't a perfect film, but this is far better than Ego, I mean Eli Roth's previous effort, ""Cabin Fever"", which failed at marrying serious horror with zany comedy. I guess he's been trained to be a good filmmaker by Tarantino himself. Even the speech about the torturer wanting to be a surgeon seemed like something out of ""Pulp Fiction"". There even seems to be a repeat of the ""Pulp Fiction"" scene where Bruce Willis spots Ving Rhames crossing a street.<br/><br/>I came in expecting it to be a gimmicky exercise in freaking out the audience and nothing more. I was pleased to find that it engaged my interest beyond the simple showing off gore and violence as if to say ""Look what we can get away with on film!"". Yes, there are character arcs in this. The film is similar to Wes Craven's ""Last House on the Left"" in terms of basic events.<br/><br/>Here's the weaknesses: <br/><br/>-The first half feels a bit slow and empty and could have cut out about 5 minutes of under-dramatized setup.<br/><br/>-While KNB gave us top-notch gore, the eyeball makeup effect (you have to see it to know what I'm referring to) was over the top, phony-looking and anatomically nonsensical for the sake of shock value.<br/><br/>-Towards the end, things seem to become conveniently coincidental and all downhill for our hero, taking away from the tension the ending could have had.<br/><br/>Still, I came away rather satisfied once we get into the second half of the film. The audience was loudly cheering in satisfaction upon witnessing bloody comeuppance. I'd say this is a good start for 2006. Let's hope the rest of the year will wash away the bland aftertaste of 2005.<br/><br/>Much better than ""Saw"" and ""High Tension"". Go see it before it gets ruined by bad sequels and copycats."

This movie was very violent, but that is the exact point. Before I went to see this movie with a bunch of friends and my girlfriend, someone puked in the seats. If you were a Horror freak like me, that just get's you pumped. I thought this movie had too much comic relief as well.<br/><br/>The amount of violence is a different subject on it's own.

","**This may contain spoilers of some element, although I have no intentions of depicting scenes in my comment on the film**<br/><br/>I just arrived home from the opening night showing of HOSTEL at my local movie theater. And I must say, I am very let down. I can't apply the term disappointed to the film, because it was a enjoyable. I can however say that anyone who needed an ambulance called for them, or freaked out, or even got a little more than the willies is pretty much NOT a horror fan. And I wasn't the only one. The majority of the audience I sat in was also let down. Lots of comments like ""I didn't think it was even scary"", and ""Man, that kinda sucked- I was expecting so much more"" mirrored my own thoughts.<br/><br/>I went to see HOSTEL to have my mind bended by graphic and intense scenes of horror and violence. And instead the grossest thing in the film was a little bit of puss, and some vomiting done by characters on screen.<br/><br/>There was LOTS of female nudity in the beginning, and it was actually quite funny (While meaning to be, not on accident). So if you want a couple of cheap BOO scares, a couple of minor gross outs, and a lot of skin, Flock, Run, Hurry to see HOSTEL. However if like me, you were expecting to be so freaked out your heart raced, and your mind was twisted up thinking ""How can this even be on FILM?""- you will feel cheated.<br/><br/>Over all it was a good movie though, don't get me wrong. Just please, don't believe all they hype.<br/><br/>HOSTEL will not go down in Horror movie history as being one of the all time greats. And unless it comes out in DVD with an Unrated Directors cut version, I will remain under the impression that the Theatrical Release was indeed heavily edited.<br/><br/>I hope this information suits you in your decision to go see this film."
"pulvinar20","9","1","4","6 January 2006"," Castration Anxiety & Primal Urges
","On the surface, Hostel appears to be a glee-fest of sadism and gore, and it's clear from those leaving negative reviews that their examination did not delve deeper. Underneath the limbs and blood, one can see an interesting use of primal fears and anxieties (such as castration and sexual anxieties) that are effectively used to heighten the viewers' unease and sense of identification with the protagonists. Whether this was intentional on the directors part or an unconscious expression of his latent fears of sexual identity is up for debate. In any event, I found the movie to be effective, surprisingly multi-layered, and most importantly...enjoyable.<br/><br/>I would add that the director aptly manipulates the audience into cheering for the very torture that disgusted them 30 minutes earlier. The sadistic assault upon the senses is palpable enough to elicit the very same satisfaction in carrying out revenge that the protagonist undertakes at the end of the film. Many will not notice this phenomenon or know how to label their feelings, but those reflective enough will leave the theater with the sour taste of knowing that he/she could be capable of the very same thing.<br/><br/>Mature audiences only. I worry about those who see this film without regard or a little soul-searching."

","I wish more Horror movies were this good. Roth doesn't hold back, he's got the balls to not give in to studio pressures to tone down movies in order to increase target audiences. In other words, This is Not a date movie..no way, unless your girlfriend's like mine and she loves blood and guts, literally she works in the morgue at children's hospital. Anyway, I worked on Hostel doing post production, saw the movie at least 10x times and it was still hard for me to watch some of those scenes with the Japanese girl. I had to hold my hands up to my face to block the view. <br/><br/>When I first saw the movie, I knew that Roth had a hit with the serious horror movie buffs. He doesn't hold back. Interestingly, the movie originally had a different ending where the German guy has his little daughter kidnapped by Paxton when they enter the train station (at the end of the movie) and she goes by herself to use the little girls room. But NO Way, that wasn't going to fly, so can you say Re-Shoot, and now look what we've got for an ending. Definitely no holding back with Roth it's nice to see a movie maker turn up the gore rather than tone it down ... Fifty Cent.... . Anyway, I would hope that when the DVD comes out it will include those scenes which the editor cut short that really shows off some of the talent in this movie.. not just the acting talent either.<br/><br/>The reason I didn't give it a 10 is for precisely that reason. I've seen the movie in its longer un-cut form and loved it, but I was disappointed when they cut it and cut it and cut it and shortened many of the good scenes down to a point where they're either gone or made inconsequential."

The movie starts out as a teen flick with a lil bit of comedy(think of it as EuroTrip, in a way (so to speak)). As the movie progressed (maybe like 45 minutes into it), people started getting mutilated and so forth, and all of a sudden I felt nauseous and started having this vomiting feeling going through my body, and then SUDDENLY, I started to have palpitations (this is where I can feel my heart beating LITERALLY) and then, mai heart felt like it was being stepped on or even crushed!!! Immediately, 911 was called, thanks to my cousin (hence, the account user), I was checked out by paramedics on the spot and then taken to the local hospital where I was checked by the ER physician :) I was told that nothing dire had happened to me, but I had suffered a PANIC ATTACK. Due to the hot ass environment that I was watching the movie in and that the theatre didn't bother lowering the temperature and also what was happening in the movie, I suffered this panic attack.

While Audition was a straightforward critique of traditional Japanese attitudes toward women disguised as a stalker film, and Ichi the Killer was a brutal response to the category 3 gore-hounds need for excess, Eli Roth has taken the opportunity to question our deepest human values, ironically, in the guise of an exploitation flick.<br/><br/>Part fairy tale and part nightmare, the film asks ""What could you let yourself do if you did not have to account for your actions?"" ""What is a human life worth?""<br/><br/>Like another great festival film, ""Harsh Times"" (which I saw in the same day), the film peels back the veneer of civilization we all have, to reveal a bloody, selfish propensity for the negation of another human being.""<br/><br/><ul><li>comments from reviewer's earlier post.</li></ul><br/><br/>I haven't actually seen this movie, so this post isn't really a rating (although all of the excellent ratings so far made me give it a 9), but I read the comments of a reviewer from Toronto from which the above excerpt is from (I wasn't able to put your name is this review - IMDb wouldn't let me) and didn't know how else to get in touch with them.<br/><br/>On the off chance that they see this post I'd appreciate discussing this movie more.

","It had been a few years since I saw this film, following on from Saw and Saw II, continuing the ""torture porn"" or ""gorno"" subgenre in a way, I knew I had to watch it again for a proper opinion, directed by Eli Roth (Cabin Fever). Basically American college students Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) are backpacking across Europe with their Icelandic friend Óli (Eyþór Guðjónsson). They are in Amsterdam and get locked out of their youth hostel, they meet Alexei (Lubomír Bukový), he tells them about a hostel in Bratislava, Slovakia, filled with beautiful European women who love tourists, they are convinced to travel to this place. As soon as they get there the boys start having the time of their lives, they are indeed surrounded by hot, promiscuous and sexy girls, including Natalya (Barbara Nedeljáková) and Svetlana (Jana Kaderabkova) from Czechoslovakia, they indulge in many sessions of heavy drinking and sex. But soon after the boys learn of the hostel's dark secret, one by one they are taken to an underground surgery, run by a sadistic group who call themselves the Elite Hunting, The Dutch Businessman (Jan Vlasák), who they met earlier, is the psycho in charge. Óli is first to disappear, the boys do not think anything serious about it, but then Josh is next to vanish, Paxton knows this is out of character and is desperate to know where his friend has got to. Eventually Paxton is kidnapped and falls victim to the torture, his fingers are removed by the deranged surgeon, however he manages to break his restraints and slowly makes his way out. Before escaping Paxton finds business clothes, he is mistaken as a customer for body parts by an American client (Rick Hoffman), but he gets away, he also finds Japanese girl Kana (Jennifer Lim) along the way, but she commits suicide after seeing a reflection of her mutilated face. In the end Paxton boards a train, but then he overhears the voice of the businessman, he follows him into a toilet, grabs his hand to cut off his fingers, nearly drowns him in the toilet and finally lets the man see his reflection before his throat is slit, Paxton then leaves on another train. Also starring Takashi Miike as Japanese Client, Petr Janis as The German Surgeon and Eli Roth as American Stoner. It takes a while to get to any threatening stuff, it certainly grabs your attention when it gets there, with characters cut up, their limbs and insides removed, and the amount of blood going everywhere, but that is all that is memorable really, the story is a bit predictable and does not maintain its atmosphere, all in all a slightly disappointing horror. Okay!"

","Eli Roth is one of the worst directors in the world.

","The self-titled ""torture porn"" sub-genre is not one I particularly enjoy. I acknowledge its merits and its appeal to those who just adore mutilation and hanging eyeballs, to which I question your definition for entertainment. However there are some that are very well crafted and substantiate the very purpose for the scenes of torturous nature. This ""thriller"" somewhat does, but the lack of tension and verbosely sexually frustrated characters made this more disposable than masterful. A group of tourists are travelling across Europe where they are advised to go to Slovakia, because the girls are beautiful and desperate. Rapidly, the holiday turns into a hellish experience involving awkward dancing, 'Pulp Fiction' and the surgical removal of organs for pleasure. All elements that should be mandatory for any tourist advertisement. Obviously the film is renowned for its realistic gore that forces you to look in the other direction. Cutting off toes, chainsawing fingers and slicing heels have never looked so...ummm...appetising? Despite Roth's mediocre direction, he clearly has an eye for blood. The issue is that his focus is purely on the torture. The characters and story were an afterthought in order to justify the mutilation. The underground business aspect was intriguing, albeit sickening, but the motive for the characters to stay in that hostel was flimsy. You're telling me that they travelled from Amsterdam to Slovakia just for sex? Surely it would've been cheaper to hire an escort at the Red Light District? They didn't think it through, and because of their primitive minds they paid the price. The fact that they weren't likeable either didn't exactly help with becoming invested in them. Surprisingly the character that was most relatable met their demise. The absence of thrills in the first half does mean it takes awhile for the pace to kick in, but the toe-curling second half will have you looking back and forth in anguish. Suffice to say, I shan't be staying in a hostel in Slovakia anytime soon..."

Secondly when he gets his two fingers cut off with the chain saw they don't bleed very much and there is no attempt to bandage them up or stop the bleeding and they don't seem to bother him.

","This Eli Roth movie is pretty straight forward in terms of horror and gorefest movies go, so don't expect to be blown away by anything remotely revolutionary.<br/><br/>The storyline was predictable, but still have enough gore and gruesomeness to make it watchable.<br/><br/>Granted that the movie was predictable and generic, then it was well worth sitting through it to watch the gruesome torture scenes and the inventive ways that writer and director Eli Roth came up with ways of how to inflict bodily harm and pain upon people. With scenes such as these, then it is a make or break whether or not the scenes are believable and can make the audience cringe. Eli Roth is certainly good at making the audience cringe.<br/><br/>The characters in the movie were actually quite nicely fleshed out, pardon the pun. More than others, obviously. I will say that Jay Hernandez actually carried the movie quite nicely throughout the entire course of the movie.<br/><br/>I remember watching this movie when it was first released, and I was somewhat impressed back in the day. However, after revisiting it now some 13 years later, I am not all that impressed anymore. The movie is still entertaining, but in terms of storyline and plot it was mediocre.

","Eli Roth is a frontrunner in horror's underground. The only reason he is not as big or as admired as Wes Craven or John Carpenter is because Roth relies only on blood. The story is a last minute thing and the addition of nudity is immature fun, but his number one thing is blood. Three years before this he did the horror-comedy bloodbath 'Cabin Fever.' I used to like 'Cabin Fever' when I was a teenager, but then I grew up. 'Hostel' is not much of a step up...or down.<br/><br/>The year before 'Hostel' was released, the brilliant horror movie 'Saw' was released. 'Saw' like 'Hostel' is a torture-porn gorefest. Difference is, 'Saw' has good acting and brains. Hostel's goal was not to capitalize on the success of 'Saw,' that's just Roth's style. Capitalizing on its success is just something that happened.<br/><br/>The storyline is heavily cliched: two American friends backpack across Europe with their Icelandic friend. In Amsterdam, the trio get involved in tons of sex and drugs. The acting by everyone is bad and the orgies are not enjoyable. These people delivered their lines awfully or if there was no spark of originality or fun. Usually explicit sex and drugs amp things up. Not here!<br/><br/>Then the movie switches gears. The Icelandic one goes missing, then the movie turns to a thriller. This gear switching gives some hope. We find out there's a crew of people that snatch up tourists and torture them. The torture is what the trilogy is known for. Unfortunately, it does not work here. The question that lingers in everyone's mind is ""Why?"" What on earth in the point of these people kidnapping the tourists and dissecting them? In 'Saw' it was a game and Jigsaw was basically a monster. But there is really no point in why these people perform these grotesque acts. Providing a clear answer instantly would have made this a better-liked film. And its really too bad because Roth does not dive into the horror right away. Remember in 'Halloween' when Carpenter waited before Michael Myers was clearly seen? Roth does the same thing. But too much negatives around it diminished this good quality.<br/><br/>The final act makes this movie worth watching. Do yourselves a favour and just skip to when Jay Hernandez gets kidnapped. He tries to make an escape and its pretty exciting. Not perfect, but still much better than the rest of it.<br/><br/>In a movie with no point and really bad acting, an enjoyable final act prevents 'Hostel' from being a piece of trash.<br/><br/>2/4"

","I saw this movie a few years ago but it's one of those movies that you can hardly forget. I love horror movies, but I'm more afraid of what is cleverly suggested than with what I see explicitly. So this movie is not the kind of movie I prefer. The action revolves around a group of three North American travelers who are making the traditional backpacking trip to Europe that immense teenagers or pre-university students do. The recipe is the usual: drink, testosterone, little brain and huge desire for sex and light drugs. They go to Slovakia, where they are looking for a hostel, advertised as the ideal place to find all this, but they end up wrapping themselves in a criminal and dangerous web where they are the flies. From here, the film is basically a torture session capable of making the Spanish inquisitors want to take notes in a notepad.<br/><br/>We can then understand that the most serious problem of this film is the absence of a credible and well-constructed story behind the horror scenes. The script is built on gore, graphic violence is an end in itself. Another problem, a direct consequence of this, is the poor construction of the characters, who are just stupid teenagers who deserve to die in the film because the public does not care about them. Never mind the names of the actors. There are no sounding names, they would not risk their career in such a movie. They are meat to the slaughter. Eli Roth, the director / screenwriter, must have a distorted conception of what horror movies are but, in any case, the film has a specific audience and Roth was entirely capable of meeting their expectations. Special and visual effects are a fundamental part of the most soulless scenes and were done with great attention to detail.<br/><br/>This is a movie inappropriate for popcorn, as I say, for joke. It is sadistic and shocking, arresting public attention for explicit violence. It is not a movie that is suitable for most people. They would think it is too visual, too disgusting to bear. But fans of gore and pure and tough violence will love it."

","In Europe to party, several US backpackers and a local guide get wind a special club where they'll get more than they've ever bargained for when they realize the disturbing and terrifying secret behind the club's operation and try to find of getting away alive.<br/><br/>This was a massively disappointing effort. One of the film's main flaws is that there's way too much time spent away from its actual destination in the titular torture room, and as a result it's pacing is just way too problematic in the first half. It's at least twenty minutes before they even get wind of the idea of going to the country, there's a big search through the city to find the place and takes another half-hour after that before any sort of on-screen torture occurs, leaving it's torture scenes, which are the main body of the film, until almost an hour in. That's way too long for the film to get to it's big spot, and it's beginning is just boring and really hard to sit through. The few attempts at suspense with the disappearing members don't have much in them as nothing is played up there, and that there's way too much wandering around with obviously shady characters is just eating up time that could be better spent on the real reason to see the film. There's even several problems with the torture scenes in this one is that there's hardly any of them in the film. There's three that amount to a total of five minutes of screen-time, which is really infuriating, and with the exception of one sequence none of the violence is done on-screen and there's just after-effects which really narrows the violence down significantly. The last huge flaw in the torture scenes is that there's more kills and violence away from them than there are in the scenes. The three torture scenes amount to one death and two escapes, yet there's a half-dozen away from them, and that really devalues the mystique and aura this has when one sequence easily tops anything done in the titular hostel. These here are what really holds this one back, though there's a really great sequence from time-to-time. That here is mainly due to the final half in the torture buildings as the main torture scene does have a really chilling quality to it due to the unexpected in a dark, unknown location, and the sight of watching them get tortured with being prodded, poked and sliced up or even showing fingers getting sliced off with a chainsaw isn't that bad. What happens to the third torture victim is easily the best, which looks great and doesn't feel fake at all, which is a great scene in itself which helps to really make it quite the gruesome moment. Likewise, the last part of the film is it's best, as it's where there's a couple of big action scenes in some fine chases to get out of the facility and generates some more bloody deaths. The last big plus is that there's a nice helping of nudity from the cast, which is never a bad thing to behold. This, though, is a massively disappointing and boring film.<br/><br/>Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Extreme Graphic Violence, Full Nudity, several sex scenes and heavy drug use."

I'll try to recollect the best I can since I don't want to see Hostel again.<br/><br/>Hostel in fact deals with a pretty serious and hard subject - selling human organs on black market. A story goes something like this: three friends go to Slovakia only to have fun. Along that way they meet some hot girls who seem to only want to have some fun. Of course, they have another goal in mind. And there goes the horror...<br/><br/>Hostel is not a frightful movie. It's more disturbing than actually scary. If someone is not a fond of gory movies, they can drop Hostel off their watch list. Hostel is not a gore fest movie, but scenes where people are tortured are made pretty convincing. Hostel depicts a sick world, underworld, where people are brutally tortured and killed for their organs. Few people will enjoy watching this one since it deals with the most important topic in a very brutal fashion. Those looking for some nonsensical violence and cleverly put scary ideas won't find any of those here. The closest movie to Hostel I can remember is SAW, but far less original.<br/><br/>To conclude: There's not much left to analyze. If you asked me ten years ago if I would recommend this movie, I'd surely respond with ""yes"". Today, I really don't see why would someone watch Hostel or any of this kind of movies. Hostel is not enjoyable, scary, nor it creates tension. It uses serious topic only to disturb you; and I don't see why would anyone want to make themselves feel that way."

"chribren","8","0","1","25 September 2013"," Great Torture-flick which got the unusual 20-rating in Norway...
","""Hostel"" is a 2005 horror movie directed by Eli Roth, who also directed the film's sequel. This film is also said to be the first one to get labeled with the infamous sub-genre Torture-Porn.<br/><br/>Basic plot: The film centers around several boys who travels to Slovakia in order to visit a hostel filled with a bunch of beautiful women. But what they don't know, is the fact they are soon to get lured into the world of torture and death...<br/><br/>Being a horror film, this film has lots of nudity during the hostel scenes. It is when the gore comes into the screen it gets somewhat intense, and might not be recommended for squeamish people. Great use of gore anyway, even gore-hounds might get to enjoy this flick.<br/><br/>The IMDb site says this film is rated 18, basically the highest rating in Norway. However, on the DVD box, the film is actually rated 20, which is a very unusual rating to be put into a Norwegian DVD box. Even the sequel ""Hostel: Part II"" got the ultra rare 20-rating, and my 2-disc box set which contains the two ""Hostel"" films says the same. In my opinion, these movies should rather have gotten the 18-rating, because there are lots of worse movies having been made in the world when it comes to gore and intense scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this one and part 2 to be pretty enjoyable, well to be honest some of the better modern horror films having been made in the US in the mid-2000's. This film is also not so clichéd as most horror films made in the US tend to be way many times. If you like watching topless women and ESPECIALLY scenes of intense gore which is one of the big points here, and haven't seen this yet, I can recommend you to watch this at least once. My rating is 8/10.<br/><br/>A few other movies which got the infamous genre torture-porn include: ""Martyrs (2005)"", ""Wolf Creek (2005)"", ""Antichrist (2009)"" and the ""Saw""-movies."

","This is the first review I have written for IMDb. Honestly, I find it strange that it's for this film. I felt compelled to do so since I feel it deserves a higher rating. Enough people have committed their time writing about the works of Lynch, Jodorowsky, Spielberg, Haneke etc. <br/><br/>Eli Roth wrote and directed this 2006 horror film and it will probably go on to be one of the few American horror films people remember from that period. So, why is it worth remembering? Compared to the wave/crop of remakes/rehashes pouring out of Hollywood, or the clinical ultragore (impressively) imported from Asia, this film stands apart. <br/><br/>With a well structured story and strong character development, Hostel is a great horror film. The characters are better thought out than in many other recent examples from this genre. It takes its time rather building up tension and it pays off in well thought doses throughout the runtime. <br/><br/>We follow three young men traveling through Europe having a care-free summer (two Americans who just graduated from high school and a slightly older Icelandic guy they've met on the road and has tagged along). Opening on their time in Amsterdam, they catch wind that they can have a better & cheaper time in Slovakia. From there, the vacation turns into a nightmare. <br/><br/>Roth has put this film together perfectly. It is filmed beautifully (apart from the faux- Amsterdam scenes), he not only captures the settings well but the entire cast do their job and carry every scene. I have to note Jay Hernandez's performance throughout the second half. His character's anecdote about a girl drowning is integrated/recalled in a great and somewhat-subtle manner later on. <br/><br/>What is highly commendable is how reserved the film is. It is not 100% gore. Apart from what might account for 3 instances of torture scenes, the majority of the film is set on character development and stringing the three main characters along in a ""The Wicker Man"" style demise.<br/><br/>Also, the soundtrack. Finally, a director that did not employ a roster of rock bands to create a soundtrack, or rely on studio musicians to crank out a half-assed set of music. Roth instead chose traditional instruments (symphony, orchestra, what-have-you etc.) as music to set the mood (except ""How Do"" by Sneaker Pimps, coincidentally recalling it is their rendition of a song from The Wicker Man (check out Isobel Campbell's rendition ""Willow's Song"", it's quite good as well.))<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a been a long day, I should have written this with more energy/focus/sobriety but I thought I'd do my part and post something. If you liked this, Hostel 2 is a spectacular follow-up!"

","If you thought 2004's Saw was a massive step into cinematic gore, Hostel does a triple long jump and a pole vault into it. Hostel is sadistic in parts but is a very intriguing film. It is covered in blood, but sometimes there's so much blood, the story is washed away. The Dutch Businessman (played by Jan Vlasák) isn't an iconic horror villain but is one of the cleverest and deceiving villains from recent memory. There are a lot of stereotypical traits (smoking pot in Amsterdam; beautiful girls entrancing the backpackers) but these play out well. OVERALL: A gore fest that can get a bit too carried away at times but can hold itself together."

","Director-writer Eli Roth should return to his old job guarding Howard Stern's trailer while the king of all media slept during breaks while making the film private parts.

They meet two beautiful women who invite them out to dance. One of the kids disappears and a photo of his severed head appears on a cell phone.

"StevePulaski","5","0","1","7 January 2012"," It's amazing what you'll find in that old basement
","Eli Roth's Cabin Fever was a fun, yet flawed journey through the formula of the horror genre, but still kept an even pacing with a few well-done sequences. Here comes Hostel, a film that would continue the ""torture porn"" sub-genre of the horror world, like the never-ending Saw franchise. It's clear that Roth's intentions and expectations for this were high, but it becomes tiresome and drab very quickly.<br/><br/>To begin with we are presented with uninspired, yet somewhat interesting characters. They are backpackers named semi-smart Paxton (Hernandez), the intelligent leader Josh (Richardson), and the womanizer Óli (Guðjónsson). The men are touring Europe and hitting every strip club or party house within radius. They are informed there are more adventures in Bratislava. So it's off to Bratislava they go.<br/><br/>There they drink and party it up, fall asleep, and realize their friend Óli is missing. We, the viewer, find out that he was taken to a dungeon-like prison where people are beaten, tortured, and killed in gruesome and unforgivable ways.<br/><br/>My first problem is the pacing. It's incredibly slow and not in the good way. Horror directors have become less aware that pacing is the key to a great kill or attack. Jump scares, solely, can not sustain a movie. Well, a good movie. For the first fifty minutes of Hostel, we have to watch some of the lamest, most redundant scenes of nudity and sex. It is common for horror films to contain both of those, but Hostel presents them gratuitously, without rhyme or reason.<br/><br/>When the torture comes, it's gory and harsh, yet uninspired. This might not be Roth's fault as much as it is the Saw franchise's. We've seen so much stronger scenes of torture is makes Hostel have a moot presence. But that's not to say the Saw films are masterpieces in any way, shape, or form. They are just more violent, gruesome, and unapologetic. Hostel pails in comparison.<br/><br/>Still, it's a very mean-spirited film. It's bleak, grisly, ugly, and dark in its appearance. It's a film of little positives and many negatives. Scary it is not, but cringe-inducing it is. Hostel is the kind of horror film that comes out of the blue and gains notoriety from the depraved gorehounds. That pretty much assures we're in for some unimpressive sequels.<br/><br/>Starring: Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eyþór Guðjónsson, Barbara Nedeljáková, and Rick Hoffman. Directed by: Eli Roth."

","I remember when this movie first came out and i went to see it in thetres and i remember it creeping the hell out of me. Though this movie is somewhat low budget the acting is good and the special effects are awesome. Contrary to everybodys beliefs this movie is really not that gory. It is brutal though but not anywhere as gory as people say I have definitely seen worse.<br/><br/>This movie is about two American backpackers who plan on travelling across Europe. First they start off in Amsterdam but one night while locked out of their hotel they meet a guy who tells them that slovakia has the best and most beautiful girls in the world. So they catch the next train out to Slovakia. While there they stay at a youth hostel that has a sinister plan for all backpackers passing through.<br/><br/>I found this movie really good. I really don't know why everyone hates these kinda of movies and quotes them ""toture porn"" there is not much toture even in this. The scares are mostly set up through the creepy atmosphere. Of course there is some (very few like maybe 15 mins of the movie) brutal toture in the movie so if you have a weak stomach probably best stay away from this.<br/><br/>Overall I think it was a good horror movie. The acting was fair and it was very creepy it wasn't all just about the toture. If you are a true horror fan you will like this. If you cant stand gore or brutal scenes Don't WATCH THIS."

","** out of (****)<br/><br/>""Hostel"" isn't a historical landmark in cinema, nor does it have the slightest chance of snagging an Academy Award. Instead, it's a film with an interesting concept, but with incompetent directing and shoddy performances, it's middle-of-the-road at best. Roth can show the most disgusting, vile death that makes the hairs trickle on someone's back, but we'll still be left in the cold. Gore, T&A, I think we know where this is going...<br/><br/>Hostel revolves around a group of backpackers that meet up some voluptuous, twenty- somethings and drink, have sex, and crash a night. However, their idea of fun turns into a living hell when they are succumbed to torture and misery.<br/><br/>First of all, with a premise such as that of ""Hostel"", I don't think you'll hook your audience in with forty five minutes of pure filler. There's no character development. No purpose. It's not even entertaining. Booze, sex, boobs, nightclubs, all nighters. It's just not exciting or fascinating, especially with characters as flat as these. Thanks to the direction, which is very cheap. You can tell the film was made for less than 5 million. <br/><br/>However, all snarky comments aside, I did enjoy the film to some extent. I thought the last twenty minutes were exactly what this film should've been like. Gritty, suspense, and keeping you guessing on all accounts. All the chaos and mayhem just seep through the cracks. <br/><br/>All in all, Roth can throw as much skin and red fluids as he wants at the audience, but if you have an absence of character development and a non-existent story, the direction becomes corrupt. Roth, I appreciate the effort because I know somewhere along the way, a good film was made. Unfortunately, Roth didn't find that film."

","Hostel is a film that appealed to me for two reasons. Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino. Roth make a big hit with Cabin Fever, and I was really interested to see what he would do next. Also, I am a huge Tarantino fan, so if when I saw his name on the poster as the producer, I knew I had to see it. I expected there to be strong gore, which there was. The problem is thats all there was.<br/><br/>The first half of Hostel feels a bit like American Pie abroad. We have a group of male Americans who are travelling across Europe hoping to strike it lucky with the ladies along the way. However, one by one they disappear and end up in an abandoned warehouse where they end up being horrifically tortured.<br/><br/>Eli Roth is a fantastic director and whilst watching the film, you can tell that he has put time and effort into the film. He is a better director then a script writer, as the script and story let the film down. It is hard not to compare Hostel to the first Saw film as that set the standard for the so called ""torture porn genre"". What made Saw so great was the involvement with the characters. We didn't know who the killer was, we learnt more about the characters as the film continued, the gore and horror was more suggestive then in your face and most importantly the twist all worked. Hostel is all style and no substance which is a big disappointment.<br/><br/>The gore is very graphic and disgusting which is great, but a good horror film needs more then just terrible images. A good horror film needs to take the audience and put them through the struggles of the characters and feel the tension and suspense in the film. In Hostel, I found my self left out of the film and just a spectator to torture and gore. Eli Roth, you have a great talent as a horror film maker, so please make a great horror film thats not just all style, but some depth as well. Tarantino said in an interview that he thought Roth was ""The future of horror"". Well Quenten, I am not seeing any signs of that yet."
"dudedazzreviews","6","0","1","7 October 2010"," More gross than scary...
","The common mistake that horror movies usually make today is using too much blood and guts and relying on grossing out people instead of scaring them, Hostel is one of them. The story was decent and the thought of the story alone is quite a scary one. The acting was mediocre, there wasn't really anyone who stood out. The main three characters are the stereotypical teenagers you normally see in horror movies: the weed-smoking, sex-obsessed teenagers who don't care for nothing as long as they get laid, they hardly had any personality throughout the entire movie which brought the movie down a little. The scenes, however, were well executed and the violent torture scenes were scarily realistic. The direction from Eli Roth is great and it makes you think what went on in the twisted minds of the creators while making Hostel.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is quite a good movie, I felt like it relied too much on grossing people out with the torturous scenes in the movie. I didn't get scared throughout watching the movie but the idea and the thought of it is quite frightening. I think it could have been a very memorable movie for the story but, because it focused more on grossing out, it will remain memorable for the blood and gore which is a shame. However, if you like being grossed out, then there's no doubt you'll probably like this too but if you want a movie that focuses entirely on the story and gives you a good scare, don't see it.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

","Apparently, Director Eli Roth has a fetish for ""snuff."" If fact, in a documentary I watched on the subject recently, Roth is interviewed and becomes visibly ""giddy"" when he comments on the realism of ""Cannibal Holocaust."" It is no small wonder that he developed the idea for, and directed the two Hostel films. I don't see that as an admirable quality, but then... I am old school and still believe the best horror isn't in-your-face-gore. I realize I am in the minority these days.<br/><br/>I once staid in a Hostel in Franfkurt www.stay-frankfurt.com and I could not resist to be remembered. The first ""Hostel"" was not a great film. It was, in fact, not very good, but what it did have was an intriguing premise: a club whose wealthy members pay to torture and murder abducted people. What worked was that such an idea was not entirely inconceivable. I would argue that such clubs, just like ""snuff"" films, currently exist, and that was what made the film interestingly creepy for me."

","After Cabin Fever Roth became a so called member of the splatter pack. So it was time for him to make a splatter movie. He did it and is was called Hostel. The storyline is very simple, but what makes the movie is the torturing scene's. They are all done in a gory old fashion way and the blood flows frequently. Were SAW delivered a lot of torturing but in a bit of fantasy this story could happen. the only problem was that some people said that the gore was overdone here to but the SAW franchise down. But SAW had some good storyline that became a franchise. Again Roth made use of real babes and let them suffer in many ways. What we never thought was the fact that it had an open end. Hostel 2 came surprisingly quick after this one. Be sure to watch this first if you would like to catch up with part 2. Be aware of the 'burning eye' and the 'station scene'."

"Red_Identity","Null","0","4","26 May 2009"," A throwback to comedic and gory classic Horror!
","I have to say, the only reason I wanted to see Hostel was because it, along with Saw, is what started the trend of 'torture porn'. I was anticipating something along the lines of Saw, but got something way different. Whereas Saw was very much a drama/crime thriller with clever plot twists all around, and had more disturbing scenes, Hostel is the opposite. From the get-go, it knows it is a horror film, it bombards the audience with all the sex and nudity it can, it acts stupid and moral-less, but the film actually starts off slow. It introduces these characters, that although we know they are unlikeable, Eli Roth knows how to make us care for them. I do not think that would matter if they had not been very well developed, but it is a plus side. Hostel is more gory than Saw, Saw actually never had much gore (which is a very under-hidden fact). Hostel has a lot of gore, but not very realistic, which I thought made it even better. It reminded me of classic horror films that had loud dramatic music, cheesy actions and dialogue, but still managed to not be a joke. Saw was way more intense, but that is because it took itself a lot more seriously. Hostel actually does not have a lot of horror parts, but when it does, it does not disappoint in gore. I was a big fan of Roth's earlier horror film, Cabin Fever. I thought it was fun and funny, and Hostel is too, but is also more likable in a way. The performances, while in a way look cheesy, are still very good, and in acting, Hostel beats Saw.<br/><br/>I very much started to like the film, and by the end, I loved it. There are not this many gory, fun, and cleverly comedic horror films these days. They try to be, but not in this way. Thumbs up for Hostel,a nd it holds it's own."
"Was-it-All-a-Dream","6","0","2","3 May 2009"," Hostel (2005)
","Some films of the horror genre defy explanation. Just about everything Eli Roth has made fits that bill. After making 2002's remarkably well-paced and watchable, yet sloppy and ridiculous Cabin Fever, which like all other Lions Gate films wasn't released until years after it was finished, Roth decided he wanted to make a horror film as shocking as his new idol- Takashi Miike's films Audition and Ichi the Killer were over in Asia. What Roth ends up doing is making a suspenseful but shockingly anti-human film that was seen by the world as just more torture film fodder. Any great message Roth had was lost on the general public, which either avoided Hostel because they felt it was only gratuitous graphic violence, or flocked to it because they just wanted to see people being tortured. The film was hugely controversial, therefore it raked in mountains of dough for everyone involved (controversy had previously made huge box office hits out of 2004's The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9/11) and made Eli Roth a pop culture icon, where previously he'd just been a beefy punk with his infectious fanboy attitude all over Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments special. Following Hostel's success, he even took his starry-eyed defiance on Fox News, challenging business correspondent Neil Cavuto. Which only made him look more callous and gave Fox another Jewish face on young Hollywood and what is widely considered their snotty sense of superiority.<br/><br/>Which is what makes Hostel's anti-humanity all the more shocking. Eli Roth is not a bad guy. Rather, he's a surprisingly intelligent writer and director who understands a lot. But when it comes to his own films, he's always more thoughtful about how to market a movie than what actually goes into it. Cabin Fever was marketed as a disturbing, extreme gorefest, and it's not. If anything it was a forgettably pedestrian film made from a story with potential that turned into a David Lynch-ian series of tableaux that all failed to hit that much-desired nerve. Roth is so concerned with the appearances of his films before people see them, the films suffer incredibly. He also hangs elements on his films, like ornaments on a Christmas tree, that are supposed to make people think they are deeper than they really are. In Cabin Fever, it was the perception by backwoods America of anything the 'city folk' did as being ""not Christian,"" and therefore the locals can just shoot anyone they want to and not get in trouble for it. I think Larry Fessenden's Wendigo was trying to make a similar point years before Cabin Fever was released - though in all fairness, Roth had finished writing Fever in the mid-1990's. The point being, Fessenden did it with much more grace and intelligence than the well-meaning but bumbling Roth.<br/><br/>And that brings us back to Hostel. Which, by all signs, is nothing more than traditional teen horror or teen sex comedy taken to the modern equivalent of a concentration camp. Or, a cruder version of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp. Now, when I say that- please don't imagine the American Pie crew or Harold and Kumar hanging out there, cracking jokes, and having kooky misadventures before finally being sprung and learning a valuable lesson about friendship and common, everyday morality. Believe it or not, Hostel does have a serious side. It's just hard to see it through the haze of plastic, sexy teen / early 20's characters with their trendy one-liners and dated slang, shallow pursuits of casual sex with nameless foreign women, selfish drinking and drug binges, brainless usage of homophobic slurs, and unnatural attachments to their cellphones- which should just be grafted onto their hands to save the time of having to whip them out of their pockets, as well as less chance of having them be stolen by impoverished punk gangs of local street children.<br/><br/>It's hard to see any point to Hostel at all. Especially when the director then makes a sequel a year later which is virtually the same thing, only with women and more obvious misogynistic elements. In the first film, with men being the target of most of the film's pretty graphic violence and murder, people saw the film as being a portrait of the effects of the shameful behavior of America's military under command of George W. Bush on international attitudes of American men. Knowing Roth, the film was probably nothing more than a style exercise in gritty exploitation, just to have people mindlessly being tortured in the name of Roth's favorite cinematic past-time, watching ""f***ed up s**t."" With that kind of ambition, it's no wonder people find Hostel a brainless experience. I initially bought into the film as a hard-hitting piece of horror, for my own personal reasons.<br/><br/>In fact, I still do see the film as a simple morality tale. Featuring young Americans who could easily be any of the random numbs on the E! Channel's Wild On television series, or the background drunkards in the Girls Gone Wild videos, doing whatever they want to, showing an apathetic streak toward everyone but themselves and a hateful attitude toward anything considered ""gay."" Take these fools and drop them in the middle of a country they know nothing about, where people are being murdered and pleasure-seeking tourists disappear into thin air. It's like young Americans are being bred like pigs for the slaughter. If it isn't overseas, it's right in our own country. Though not as extreme an example, America is overpopulated, people are breeding too much, our resources are drying up very slowly, with fears of terrorist attacks and disease pandemics flying fast and furious- it's truly like there is no hope for a real future. Tobe Hooper's first season Masters of Horror's entry, Dance of the Dead, glides over similar terrain. And would probably have been more effective that Hostel, all things considered, had that piece not been as afraid of the graphic violence Hostel bathed in."

","Hostel is a basic Horror Gore film. I really am not a fan of films like this and after seeing this film I still am not a fan of films like this.<br/><br/>Basically the story involves three guys who back pack across Europe. Soon they are each taken to a dungeon where they are tortured to death by people who pay to torture people to death.<br/><br/>The idea is pretty scary. I mean people who pay to torture people to death is disturbing. I have heard that stuff like this really goes on but I do not even want to think about that. If this film intended on disturbing people by making them think that it could really happen then it worked on me.<br/><br/>The gore is bad at parts and not bad at others. For example they do not really show people as they get tortured, they just show what they look like after they have been tortured. However seeing what they look like basically gets the job done as you do not really have to see the process they go through to see the end result. The weak stomached should stay away from this one. THere is one really really really bad part involving a blow torch and an Asian girl. I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>Basically another problem this film had was transitions. They would go from guys getting high to guys finding out about a place where they could get laid to guys getting hit on by older guys. It just was poorly transitioned. At one part they showed a girl about to have her toe cut off and as it was about to be cut off they cut to a scene of a girl cutting her toe nails. The flow is pretty bad as well. The acting was actually well done though, but sometimes a good script is just as important as good acting.<br/><br/>I know that there are people out there who like films like this but I really did not like this film. Bad transitions, disturbing plot, and a little too much gore for me. I do not really recommend it unless you are a fan of horror films."

"Harley66","6","0","1","28 September 2008"," HOSTEL: a diamond in the (very) rough
","I must admit, what truly attracted me to Eli Roth's second film, Hostel, was the rarely-granted Quentin Tarantino presentation. As any die-hard Tarantino fan will say, whatever The Man presents, the viewer must watch. His stamp of approval means more - much, much more - than any Ebert review. I am also a hardcore genre fan: my ears become flushed with anticipation at the sound of anything even remotely associated with the exhilarating genre that is horror. It is therefore understandable that I was quite excited about finally watching Hostel in all of its bloody, violent, bits-of-brain-and-skull-splattered-on-the-wall glory. After all, I had mostly heard that it was a step forward in the world of horror films, continuing a tradition of unprecedented on-screen violence set off by Japanese filmmakers long before American directors dared to risk receiving that naughty (and now highly coveted) NC17 rating. So, without further ado, here are my post-viewing good and (unfortunately) bad news. For the good news: the setting of the film (mostly parts of Slovakia) is quite original, particularly for audiences of previous American horror. It does not have that generic and infuriating Hollywood feel either - it looks, sounds, and feels like a real place. Now, if this isn't the most crucial aspect of a successful horror film (think Audition, think original Texas Chainsaw Massacre), I don't know what is. Roth scores more points in his cast selection. Jay Hernandez truly takes the Most Realistically Scared award in this film - he was so friggin' terrified when he got to the Elite Hunting headquarters that I wanted to forgive his immmature and sexist behavior during the first 40 minutes of Hostel. Roth then scores some more points with his courageous and excessively gory scenes (which I will not give away for those who haven't watched the movie yet). They were certainly enough to satisfy even the darkest cravings of decades-old horror fans. Finally, Roth scores bonus points by playing a dubbed version of Pulp Fiction at the actual hostel in the movie, and the Miike Takashi cameo was as gratifying as any cameo can ever be. Now, for the bad news: for the first 45 minutes of the film, I felt as though I had mistakenly stumbled upon an unusually long porno with a poorly constructed storyline. The naked chicks by the dozen, the unnecessary sex, the talking about sex, the incessant search for sex, and the overall ignorant sexism of the 3 main characters were unbearably annoying - and, did I mention, unnecessary? I wanted to somehow remind Roth that I am addicted to horror, not sex, and that wasting 40 minutes of perfectly good screen time on boobs and asses instead of chainsaws and kitchen knives just won't cut it. I think any true horror fan will agree with me on this - unless, of course, Roth was trying to make a connection between excessive sex and excessive violence, which become sort of tangled in Hostel. At any rate, I would've been much happier if Roth had spent those first 40 minutes setting a more frightening mood and teasing me about the cinematic gorefest that was to come. I will say this, however: once the gore begins, there is no turning back - and the villains are remarkably and terrifyingly realistic. Hostel is, perhaps, a diamond in the very rough - with some refreshingly strong peaks and quite a few flaws that need to be polished. I still admire Roth for his daring nature and his obvious passion for horror - these two things, at least, came through loud and clear in the puzzling and controversial film that is Hostel."

","This movie isn't so much horrifying as sickening. I'd been warned that it was of the 'slasher' genre, but these days that can mean anything.<br/><br/>It begins, quite frankly, as utter tripe. Three boring young men engage in one sex-n-drugs session after another. They are seriously hedonistic - I think I get the message. This preamble goes on for so long that I only persevered with it to find out how the slashing started. It is slow and contrived, to say the least. The director just doesn't seem to have a clear idea as to how he is going to disclose the plot.<br/><br/>When the slashing does start it is of such a graphic nature that I was moved to mute the volume and look away. You can call me squeamish if you like, but I think anybody who finds movies entailing torture and cruelty of this kind the least entertaining would very likely be the sort who - given the opportunity - would pay to participate. I suspect they would be masturbating as they watched.<br/><br/>After two of these young man are taken and butchered, eventually, the third gets his come-uppance. But he manages to effect an escape at the cost of a couple of fingers. And it is here that the plot finally begins to reveal itself and things start to gel.<br/><br/>I like a chase movie. And after a few executions of his own, our victim now has an opportunity to escape. I rather thought that when he went back to spring the oriental girl, he was pushing his luck and would be taken again, but no. The bit with her eye is too gross to describe. With the bad guys on his case, he and the girl head for the station. Her suicide in front of an oncoming train is almost inevitable. You can see them both coming a long way off. Such is vanity.<br/><br/>Naturally, I had expected a twist. These cheap shockers almost always have 'em. But here it is one of revenge rather than recapture.<br/><br/>Somewhere in this crude, voyeuristic mess there was the basis of an extremely tense and exciting movie. If the director had just got on with his story instead of obsessing over the orgasm, he would have saved celluloid and plenty of money whilst delivering a far more coherent plot, and three-dimensional characters we could care about instead of so much giblet-fodder. By the same token; had he toned-down the snuff-like brutality and emphasised the tension and the chase, this might have been a thoroughly gripping suspense drama.<br/><br/>How many times have modern film-makers got to be reminded that its not necessarily what you show that matters so much as what you don't show. Imagination will fill the gaps. Clearly; these people assume we have as little of that stuff as themselves. They should be compelled to stop-over at the Bates' motel and study the shower sequence. <br/><br/>There's not much point in commenting upon the technical aspects of production; there's just so much wrong with it up-front.<br/><br/>Finally, rather than locating it in peaceful Slovakia, perhaps the hostel should have been more aptly set in Serbia. Recent events demonstrate that there is no shortage of mass-murdering psychopaths in that merry little land. You could almost say it was the national pastime. One suspects that their tourist board would have helped fund the enterprise.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone for any reason. Only the last 15 minutes or so begin to measure-up, and its hardly worth being put off your dinner for that."

","For all of you out there who saw Hostel and thought it was a bad movie; STOP, and think for a second. was it really the movie that was bad, or was it just that you didn't like the subject matter? i bet its the latter or the two. i am a huge horror enthusiast (my collection consists of more than 1000 horror films from various countries)and i went into Hostel expecting just another piece of crap like Cabin Fever. i was wrong. DEAD wrong. not only is Hostel very well directed, but it it hearkens back to the old 70s and 80s Italian horror and Giallo films. it shares much in common with the works of such directors as Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi, early Wes Craven, and even the Japanese mad-genius that is Takashi Miike. this film also transcends genres. it is not purely horror, but a sinister look into the human mind. a lot of people comment on how the movie is very unbalanced and gory. THAT has got to be the biggest lie of them all. this film flows perfectly. it starts you off by letting you get to know the characters. you will feel for these characters when they die. they feel like friends; especially Paxton. his character is the definition of a dynamic character; as he completely changes throughout the course of this film. even in the beginning he shows signs of high intelligence. How any Americans who travel to Europe know ANY European languages? and for the gore. i have seen MANY MANY a film gorier than hostel. and most of those films were made in the 70s and 80s. <br/><br/>to sum it up, Hostel is a good film, that succeeds on many levels. its major downfall is attracting an audience that doesn't know GOOD CINEMA, even when it hits them in the face and tortures them to death!"

","Hostel has taken either heavy criticism or high praise from people. I'm just neutral on this though. It's nothing to get to excited about, but you shouldn't HATE it by any means. The gore is disgusting in this movie, but that's also not a reason to hate it. What I didn't like about this movie was the beginning, and the highly comedic/pornographic atmosphere. There's a time and place for both those things, and when I'm going to watch a horror movie, I wanna see HORROR. The material itself wasn't bad. Some jokes were hilarious, and the hookers were extremely HOT! But I wanted to see 90 minutes of torture rather than just one hour. Once the good stuff gets underway I think Eli Roth (the director) has a fine horror flick here, but it definitely could've been better. Some positive things, first of all is the acting. Most everyone did a great job, the fact that they're all pretty unknown caused me some concern before seeing the movie, but they were all good. Jay Hernandez (Paxton) was the one I particularly noticed for the acting. And I think this has one of the best endings of any recent horror movie. I liked Hostel a lot, although it's definitely not for everyone. Some may vomit numerous times throughout this movie. But if it's your cup of tea then I say see it for sure. Eli Roth is a very talented director who has a lot to add to the horror/torture genre. Expect more good things from him in the future."

","A predictable Eli Roth movie. Which basically means you're better off watching something else. After being boasted as ""the sickest thing you will ever see"" by blabber mouth director. I wasn't looking forward to this after the disappointment which was cabin fever but me and some friends decided to go and see it anyway. Maybe we should of thought twice. The story is that while backpacking through Europe, college students Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) seek the ultimate vacation through sex, drugs and unforgettable experiences. <br/><br/>When a friendly stranger informs the two of a hostel in Bratislava that offers the most beautiful and promiscuous women in all of Europe, Paxton and Derek trek with their new Icelandic friend Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson) to find the hostel that sounds too good to be true. When arriving to Bratislava, the trio found that the hostel was everything and more of what they expected. <br/><br/>The events that follow are sure to deliver the unforgettable vacation that the two were looking for. Mystery, suspense and fear direct this film to its bloody ending. Hostel has a great idea, sick but great it's just too bad it was brought to the screen in with such a shoddy attempt.<br/><br/>I was expecting cheap thrills and I got cheap thrills, but those cheap thrills came along with one of the most cheesy, tacky and stupid movie I have seen. This film is not once sophisticated. And not even that gory. <br/><br/>His movie is completely charmless and probably more of a disappointment than Cabin Fever. The actors aren't terrible but they aren't anything special, the constant boobs! Are unnecessary and is just a time waster. The characters were annoying and you truly didn't give a damn what happened to any of them! Please just avoid this film.<br/><br/>Its Eli Roth's exercise in car crash cinema and boy does it crash and burn. The only real thing Hostel manages to get right is the shameless promotional attempt by putting master director Quentin Tarentino (Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction) on the front cover which is sure to make movie goers part with their money. Please I urge you this is no more than a rental and even that's pushing its luck. Blabbermouth Director Roth has done it again.<br/><br/>Cabin Fever still remains one of the dullest duds ever made. He promised us blood we got humour. Now it has a friend to join it. Hostel is equally (Unintentionally Funny) as a run of the mill horror film ""Hostel"" does no wrong. But for reel spills and chills your best off watching something masterfully crafted and even mildly gripping. Two things Hostel lacks.<br/><br/>It's interesting premise aside I can't really say anything productive about Hostel. This really isn't anything that you haven't seen a hundred times this year. What's even scarier is the sequel prepped for 20-07 meaning Roth gets to splash some more blood around. It's a good money maker so I wouldn't be surprised if this series keeps going much like the highly worn Saw series."

This film barely gets by as a bad softcore porn for the first hour or so, but then, ""oh wait, look, it is horror,"" as the viewer is ""held in suspense"" over the fate of characters we don't give a crap about anyway. Poor gross out effects then pass off as thrills, carrying us through to the end of a film whose target audience is most likely operating with a lowered attention span. Go see ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" old or new, or any of the ""Saw"" films, as titles from either of these series exponentially outclass the miserable attempt ""Hostel"" makes at sadistic terror and gore."

I guess serial killers who aren't all that imaginative can really brush up on their techniques and skills. These movies are like training videos for the depraved and insane. Way to go Hollywood. How about on Oscar night when you stand up there and announce to the world how ""Movies have the power to change the world"", maybe you should take responsibility for the movies that corrupt it too. Oh no you'd never do that. There is no way Hollywood would admit that a lot of the crap they produce changes the world for the worst.

"ThreeSadTigers","Null","0","1","12 February 2008"," Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but nonetheless, an inventive and original idea.
","The central concept of Hostel (2005) is a familiar one, with the stranger in a strange-land motif having been used in a number of great, similarly-minded horror films of the last thirty-years, most notably in John Landis's classic black comedy, An American Werewolf in London (1981), and again, more recently, in films such as Wolf Creek (2005) and Them (2006), The concept is one that lends itself to ideas of paranoia, unease, uncertainty and helplessness, as we realise that there is no one to turn to and no one to trust.<br/><br/>The film isn't entirely successful, with the usual drawbacks of director Eli Roth's particular style resulting in the usual attempts at crude frat-boy type humour, wanton aggression, vicious violence, and knowing nods towards sexism, misogyny and perhaps even xenophobia; all getting in the way of the more important factors like tension, terror and real, believable characters. Like his mentor Quentin Tarantino, you get the sense that Roth has clearly seen a lot of films and can borrow, reference and pastiche with the best of them, but unlike Tarantino, you also get the sense that he doesn't really love films, but rather, is in awe of the violence that they present to him. His first film, Cabin Fever (2003) attempted to revive the splatter film genre with a combination of Romero's zombie horror and Raimi's kids in a cabin theatrics, with knowing references to films such as Sleepaway Camp, Dawn of the Dead, The Crazies, Deliverance, Sothern Comfort, Evil Dead and The Last House on the Left. Sadly, for all the clever references, buckets of gore and sporadic bursts of T&A, the film was completely devoid of all sense of character or empathy; giving us a film that failed to create any kind of emotional resonance with the audience or anything that made an impression after the final credits had rolled.<br/><br/>However, Roth has certainly rectified some of these problems with Hostel; which overcomes the complete lack of anything approaching real character and his shallow attempts to pay lip service to more talented filmmakers, such as Tarantino and Takashi Miike (who's work Roth seems to completely misinterpret on almost every level), by at least having an interesting concept, an air of dramatic mystery and some truly imaginative death sequences. The most successful scenes are obviously those closer to the end of the film, in which we have an attempt to escape; resulting in a pretty fraught chase sequence, and finally we actually start to feel something for the characters. Some would say that it's too little too late, but I feel it ends the film on a high note and proves that Roth just might be able to reign in his more adolescent tendencies to one day produce a truly great film.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked about it was the scenes that hinted at a central mystery or conspiracy, in particular when two of the central characters search the small Eastern European village for their missing friend; which for me, conjured images of Dario Argento's early works such as The Bird with the Crystal Plumage (1970), The Cat O' Nine Tails (1971) and Deep Red (1975), as well as that kind of uncertain, mysterious, slightly menacing atmosphere from Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now (1973). It also goes back to the idea presented in the aforementioned An American Werewolf in London, and its less successful Parisian set sequel (1997), with the travelling companions straying off the beaten track and being punished for it; again, bringing to mind films like Deliverance and Sothern Comfort as well.<br/><br/>I suppose you could argue that some of Roth's more immature touches make it impossible to feel anything for these characters, mostly as a result of them being somewhat under-written and underdeveloped. It's never quite as bad as Hostel Part II, which is really about nothing, other than upping the ante on gratuitous gore; with the deaths and the suffering of that particular film used only as a means of titillating the blood lust of teenage boys. Not that I have anything against violence in cinema you understand, but certainly the old adage that a little goes a long way is undoubtedly true. For me, the most memorable scenes of violence are the ones that hold the most dramatic weight; the ones that feel real and very much believable, where we can feel for the characters in that situation and apply our own various psychological fears and anxieties alongside it; something that Hostel manages to pull off with those frantic final moments.<br/><br/>Admittedly, there is plenty here that audiences might find disgusting, or maybe even offensive, but there is also a decent story that manages to pull you in, despite the overall lack of style and the childishness of some of Roth's lurid scenarios. Unlike its shallow, unimaginative sequel, Hostel offers more than mindless entertainment for a post-pub Friday night in, with some genuinely inventive moments of violence and that great 20 minutes towards the end, which points the way forward to the kind of high tension Roth should be going for. Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but regardless, an inventive and original idea that holds our attention for the duration of the film."

They have nothing to do with the production of the movie, so I assume it's just a promotional thing, for both the movie and the sponsor. But if it gives a minor, good movie a bigger profile then fine. As long as it's a good movie.<br/><br/>This is, speaking broadly, an amalgam of American WEREWOLF IN London and SAW. Two young male American backpackers are travelling around Europe, Amsterdam in fact, and are given the opportunity to stay at a particular hostel where, well let's say, fun and women are abundant. There is of course a catch.<br/><br/>The movie then, after a slow start I must say, moves into the realms of what am I talking about? 'The realms of'? It degenerates rapidly and graphically into butchery. The guys are lured by gorgeous gals into basically what is a slaughter/torture house where sick people with lots of money can live out their macabre fantasies on the bodies of terrified individuals, making use of bolt cutters, chainsaws, blow torches and, well, you name it. There's dismemberment, screams, tendon cutting and gore galore which I'm sure is more than satisfying for those who like this kind of thing.<br/><br/>I did squirm a little at some of the 'renditions', but in retrospect, it wasn't the visual depiction that shocked me, more the idea of it which unsettled me, and for which I give due respect. It's nice to know that the power of suggestion is still being employed in this age where anything that can be imagined can be visually presented. That little thing that creeps in behind your mind and lurks there and keeps you unsettled for days afterward is far more powerful and memorable, and is what keeps you thinking and talking about it.<br/><br/>So, like I said, apart from the slow start, I can recommend this, but with the warning that it will claw at the back of brain for a while after viewing.<br/><br/>You certainly won't look at an electric drill the same way again"

I did not jump, scream or feel at all scared at any time... the only thing that I felt was severe nausea and a massive cringing sensation.<br/><br/>I'm glad to say that I managed not to throw up all over the place, but I heard reports of people having to be helped out of cinemas when this film was released because they were passing out and throwing up... I can't really admit that this could have been on any level a successful reaction to this movie, because at the cinema people just want to either: laugh, cry or be really really scared... what they don't want, is a day of bed rest with regular aspirin and stomach cramps.<br/><br/>All this put together makes a hideous formula that somehow produced this travesty of cinema...

Unfortunately, they weren't given much to work with, and the actual plot is like something a very disturbed 6 year old would come up with. Linear and very contrived. If this is how bad it is after Tarantino's re-write, then I really don't want to know how bad it was originally.<br/><br/>This film seems to be a vehicle for Roth's private visions of fetid gore, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br/><br/>I'm going to go re-watch Pulp Fiction now, just to blank this from my mind.

","I remember just getting done eating dinner one night and I came upstairs to watch some TV. I noticed ""Hostel"" was coming on that night so I got excited. Why? Because I heard some good hype about this one. I figured I was going to be in for a good horror flick. Man I have never been so wrong in my life.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie sucks. It's no scares and a lot of nudity and sex. If I wanted that I could easily go out a buy a porn, or just pop in one I already own. How can any true horror fan enjoy this movie?? It's pathetic and it's a perfect example of how bad the horror genre has got, where such a ridiculous movie would get such hype.<br/><br/>If you are a 12 year old child, this one might give you the chills.

I caught maybe one chapter that looked to pass over. Folks, I'm telling you, I skipped what....all of but one chapter, just to actually see even a little gore. The chapters I skipped had sex scenes, or sex references in them. Ridiculous! I was hoping for an over-the-top horror film, and all I got was a cheap sex movie. The last chapter had 15 minutes of pathetic gore in it...and it could've been carried out to what....maybe the REST of the movie!?. What was the director thinking when he made this? oh wait...guess he was too focused on the whole sex idea and not enough gore to satisfy. It's not just the sex and little gore in here that makes this a 2/10 for me, but the acting was downright stupid.<br/><br/>So folks, if you want to rent a ""horror"" movie with um..sex in it and like 10% gore, then go right ahead :).<br/><br/>Pathetic, 2/10."

","Hostel (2005) <br/><br/>Here's a director, Eli Roth, a new kid on the horror block wanting to make a big name out of himself by making Hostel: a linear film that is sick and sadistic, both elements which do not deserve praise because that's all there is in this pitiful film.<br/><br/>This is a morally repugnant film, an 'american tragedy' in an attempt to create a horror film for a 21st Century audience that seems to be fuelled only by empty, shallow films with violence and gore, because Hostel is really just that; it doesn't possess any qualities a film could be cherished for. Alright this is a horror film and it exploits violence and sadistic elements to a high level, but come on now this is in no way a good or even average film.<br/><br/>This 'hedonistic mess of a film', is a failure in terms of cinema and in my opinion horror, just an excuse for soft porn, violence and gore with no meaning, aim or point (although a lot of horror movies don't) is a waste of time, except if you are the kind of person that is attracted to garbage film-making.<br/><br/>This is by far one of the worse films of 2005 and a useless addition to the horror genre. All this film can inspire is more films like this and possible worse pointless infiltrations of violence on screen and it is not even entertaining. At least, films like Saw (which at best is an average film) do provide an element of entertainment with their violence and gore. Hostel fails to even entertain.<br/><br/>1/10"

","Having had it on good authority that Hostel was worth watching and having seen and quite liked Cabin Fever, I decided to stay up til 3AM to watch ""Hostel""...<br/><br/>Admittedly it isn't particularly awful. All in all it is well acted, there are some interesting torture scenes and whatnot. Bearing the target audience in mind, there is plenty of graphic violence, hot, naked girls and moronic, drunken antics. To all intents and purposes ""Hostel"" should have been a winner.<br/><br/>It's just that there's no real point to it.<br/><br/>The way I see it, it should have gone either one of two ways - a blacker than black comedy, or a truly horrifying trip of sickening, wind-warped mutilation and torture. What we actually have is somewhere in the middle. A bit like ""Eurotrip"" with chainsaws.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes, mainly due to the reactions of the people involved, are pretty harrowing, but then when fingers start going missing and eyeballs popping out it all starts to become cheesy and almost parodic of the ""Evil Dead"" and such like. There's nothing implied - it's all there for you to see. Nothing is left to your imagination.<br/><br/>The idea that such a place as is featured in ""Hostel"" could exist is terrifying. In the same way that, because of ""Deliverance"", the number of good ol' boys going for a canoe vacation down Georgian rivers has been in steep decline since the late 70's, so could ""Hostel"" have made backpackers the world over want to stay the hell away from Bratislava. ""Hostel"" could have been a truly scary film, which I would have liked. It isn't.<br/><br/>All in all, Hostel is no better than your average horror flick. Neither is it original. I'd recommend ""Severance"" instead."

","I watched this film about half an hour ago and I have been having an urge to warn everyone; you can still walk away even if you have already started watching it, even after half an hour! Do not take Tarantino's name as a warranty that it is a good movie. And it was shot in the Czech Republic.(well, at least the train station scenes)<br/><br/>I expected some excitement from Hostel just like from every horror-like movies I watch. It tried to be scary with a kind of mixture of Texas Chainsaw Messacre (the psychopath who was impressed by the survivor guy's German), House of Wax (the second guy who was captured) and a tiny bit of Hills Have Eyes (with the Japanese girl's deformed right eye) and also a bit from Eurotrip (the ""s'cuse"" Italian guy on the train). This is not a horror or even a mystery, but the trashiest crap I have seen in the last few years. I was wondering how a great director like Quentin Tarantino could give his name to promote this whatchamacallit, Hostel?! The storyline, acting, venues are absolutely absurd and unreal. Even the psychopaths are ridiculous, not frightening at all.<br/><br/>Personally, I hate when Hollywood movies are trying to show the 21th century Central-Eastern Europe as it was 60 years ago, during communism. There are newly-built houses, modern cars, not like Ladas and Volgas, not every second men wears wellingtons, and people are friendly. Disappointing cinematography, very bad editing, such a stupid conversations that you crave the first two guys to die. At least they did.<br/><br/>My favourite part was when a group of kids killed all three of the Russian mafia guys towards the end of the film... I think the second part will make a good base for the next Scary Movie sequel.<br/><br/>3 out of 10 is my final judgement.(2 points for the girls)"
"WaxBellaAmours","3","0","2","11 July 2007"," More misanthropic endeavors in this brutal, relentlessly dull gore-fest
","With the current stock of the torture-horror genre skyrocketing, it's brazen rise has given room for plenty of gleeful youth hipsters to stage their own relentless battle of who can shock you more. This week's so-called bad boy is the well-educated director Eli Roth, equal part frat-boy and film-geek, who follows up his clever if messy (in every sense of the word) ""Cabin Fever"" with the far more polished and grisly ""Hostel"", the latest excuse for mixing grim, one-dimensional scorn for the human race and tasteless violence to the most lurid degree possible.<br/><br/>This unfortunate outing focuses on tourists in Europe, two college-age Americans, Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and Josh (Derek Richardson) and one party-hungry Icelander Ollie (Eythor Gordsoon), as they look for ways to quench their typically hedonistic and lecherous appetites across the continent. While the somewhat timid, nerdy Josh would clearly like to be somewhere else, Paxton lets his bad manners roam free as he seems to enjoy causing endless raucous and spout juvenile bits of casual bigotry at the locals; he plays the Ugly American stereotype in capital letters. After missing curfew at their hotel after a fruitless venture into the Amsterdam nightlife, they are lured into the pad of a mysterious young man who promotes a Bratislava hostel he ensures (with a digital camera of naked photographs to prove it) that will undoubtedly give everything their lustful hearts desire.<br/><br/>And like all idiots in a horror movie, they head to this eastern-Europe slum (where apparently the dingy haunted houses and a group of bubble-gum hoodlums who seem like the Slovakian Children of the Corn apparently do nothing to warn them of the hell to come) and find exactly what they came for. Unfortunately, it comes with a fatal price, and if they do improbably escape, it surely won't be in one piece.<br/><br/>Plenty of the requisite gory violence involving various mutilations and ankle-splicing ensues, but that becomes far less shocking than the film's deplorable misanthropism that pervasively roams across the screen. One point Roth wants to justify the torture the main characters go through (apparently being a chauvinistic brat means you should get hacked to pieces), and then we're supposed to care about one of them in the final act as the film switches tones to an ""Escape from Alcatraz""-style action movie. While also parading endless Xenaphobia (practically every European with more than one line is a strange sadist who wants to torture a tourist or assist in setting up a tourist to get tortured) and disturbingly puerile misogyny (with endlessly raunchy depictions of female carnality as well as taking glee in watching two evil prostitutes and a disfigured female tourist become village roadkill), ""Hostel"" presents just another snidely bleak view of human nature without any logic or texture to justify it's already dubious argument. And when looking at it squarely as a horror movie, it's just dull and repetitive in following it's rather formulaic routine.<br/><br/>With ""Cabin Fever"", Eli Roth did show some strong intuition to the horror genre with it's cleverly derivative teen-slasher-flick/zombie-paranoia storyline and it's vividly icky-sticky visual effects, even if it was completely unoriginal. As is ""Hostel"", which borrows the look and basic plot structure of a 70's exploitation gore-fest while lifting many of it's most violent scenes from the current, equally bloody Asian new wave (it's no surprise Takashii Miike, one of that genre's poster-boy, makes a cameo midway through). Even though those films also existed mostly for staging violence from every possible angle, they knew exactly what they wanted to achieve and never tried to over-reach their boundaries, creating lean and remarkably effective scarefests. Sadistic, sure, but they cut right to the bone whereas ""Hostel"" has many rusty tools that it has no idea how to use. Elaborate gore and torture certainly has usurped the boogeyman-in-the-closet theme as the chief scare tactic in film, but the latter would have shown a more effective path that the cold, confused and entirely unsuccessful ""Hostel"" doesn't have the common sense to follow."

","This movie is about a couple of dudes who go to some European place (I think it was Sweden or Kazahkstan) to bang some hot chicks and sight see. The movie is kinda boring at first because no one gets killed but there are boobs so it's okay anyway because boobs rule. Then it gets really really boring because it's just lots of talking and stuff, and no boobs. But then the fun really begins because some dude gets his heels sliced up and another guy gets power drilled in the leg and it's totally gory and gruesome and stuff. Then there's this one guy (I think he was the main character 'cause he was played by that guy from Torque) who is about to be killed by a chainsaw but the chainsaw dude slips on Torque guy's fingers and the chainsaw lands on him (the chainsaw dude). That was hilarious.<br/><br/>The movie is deep and very thought provoking because it made me think about what would happen if I went to a hostel and was tortured by some crazy Dutch bastards (yes I know they weren't really Dutch but Goldmember rules so go f**k yourself). The torture scenes are really gross and totally awesome and the acting is very good. Especially Torque guy. I like when the Asian chick's eye just sorta hangs out of her socket, that was totally awesome. Although I didn't really understand the ending. I heard from a buddy that Eli Roth made a sequel but I can't see how it could live up to the standards of this film.

Have lived in a few countries over here for 10 years and know the realities of the former occupied countries, better then many of the native western European counter parts as I have been living and working, and not just popping over for sex trips.<br/><br/>So the point is this, one is left, particularly the American audience with a feel that Slovakia is a near lawless society with gangs of rouge children waiting in the shadows to take their next victim if the person doesn't kick up some coin or gum. Roth is being arrogant if not racist in his little in sites to the society. That said I find most American film that makes some attempt to put itself into a European back drop often missing the nuances.

The first half is basically softcore pornography, and not very good at that. Watching the male American protagonists is about as enjoyable as shotgunning a can of Dran-O or consuming a three-month old sandwich topped with a liberal helping of oven cleaner. It's rather dull, and the more amorous scenes are only cool if the viewer has just started puberty, either physically or psychologically. The second half is basically a different movie, except this one is a snuff film. Eli Roth shows off how ""creative"" he can be, and by creative, I mean derivative. Everything is a rip-off, and it's terribly long and drawn out. The ending is garbage, too.

"thomas196x2000","3","0","3","7 June 2007"," Pretty much a waste
","I will tell you up front...I don't like torture movies. The very concept of films like Saw and Devils Rejects make me think that these films are really made for fan-boys and closet nut cases, and for the most point, they probably are.<br/><br/>Talked into watching this by friends who indicated that this was something more, and as some writers here seem to feel, the gore is not that bad. Oh well.<br/><br/>A lot could be said about this movie, but in short, it is a bit less on suspense and what there is of it is pretty much drowned out by lapses in logic. I liked the whole concept of Elite Hunting--not that it's original mind you, but an interesting thought in a place so far away. But the direction wavers and seems amateurish. The camera-work shifts between well done and rather boring--failing to sometimes pull you into the story. There is plenty of gore, and anyone that seems to say there isn't enough in here--I really wonder about them. Seriously, cut off fingers, toes, eyes gouged out, throats cut--but that's not enough. Geez, some people are pretty weird.<br/><br/>Key problems: <br/><br/>* The city is at once very pretty, then suddenly it's dark, scaffoldings, very young hoodlums (like 8 years old). You can argue that they went into the bad part of the town, but the seemed to be there in a moment. Is the whole town in on what it going on at the factory which appears a few hundred yards away, or do they wonder why the smokestack goes off in an abandoned plant....<br/><br/>* The girl gets highly paid to get the last guy into the torture factory. She even laughs that she got so much money for him. However, her meeting him to take him there was pure happenstance and luck--he wandered into the bar. Further, he had to drag out of her and twist her arm to take him there. Makes no sense, again, lazy screen writing.<br/><br/>* Some makeup is well done, some is really amateurish. Did the guy cut out the girl's eye with a torch?! Then, when she escapes, you can clearly see her eyelid with just a bunch of bad red makeup globbed on top of her eye. Sure, I might sound nitpicking, but man that jumped out at me.<br/><br/>* Some of the camera work was really questionable, and looked like really low grade film or video. And I don't mean the gritty torture scenes, but scenes outside. Many of the camera shots are basic setups with little tracking, movement or fluidity of any kind. Much could have been done by using the architecture to create tension and claustrophobia, but this is never used.<br/><br/>* The stunts were terrible. I especially liked the scene where our ""hero"" guns down the girls and the guy that set the thing up. First of all, how much speed could he possibly have gotten up to in 20 feet to be able to run them all over, AFTER they saw him? When they get hit it's like they had the actors/stunt people just roll off a car. When the surviving girl gets hit by the bad guys' car, they just stuck a dummy in front of the car and dragged it away. I wasn't looking, again, for blood and guts, but that was student film quality shots.<br/><br/>Most effort seems to have been put in the torture scenes, such as they were, and that is telling. I did like the look of the bald guards, the setup, and the completely insane American who gave you insight into what the whole deal was. And there was some satisfaction in the bad guys getting their due for the most part.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this movie. Too dull, too depressing, and more gross than scary.<br/><br/>What REALLY disturbed me was the laughing and enjoyment people were getting in the torture sequences in this film. Not the hollers you get during a gross segment in a zombie movie mind you, where people are basically letting off steam. No, people seemed to actually be happy that people were getting tortured.<br/><br/>That was the only horrifying thing about this movie. I felt disturbed being in a room with such losers, and wondered what has happened to audiences for them to act this way.<br/><br/>Lastly, I figured out why this film had an amateurish edge to it, and that is after I saw a few interviews with Eli Roth, particularly one on Fox.<br/><br/>This guy has the depth of cardboard and is full of himself. Torture movies do well now, according to Roth, because of the torture at Gitmo and what the US has done to people around the world and its our collective outrage against that which makes these movies popular. Then more Bush bashing. He's a putz.<br/><br/>So we are not talking about a particularly bright bulb to begin with, and if you make the mistake I did and see this film, you will see what I mean."

","The first time you see Hostel, you're in for a shock. Not the shock that sends you scuttling for the door, more the kind of shock that gets you scratching your head puzzled. Sure, European babes with ridiculously hot bodies, no taste and ample generosity sounds good (Perhaps it was an promo ad for Tourisim Board of Amsterdam ) . . . for a road-trip movie. Perhaps this was director's Eli Roth's method of settling the audience in a certain mood and then turning the tables on them instead of the usual ""whendoigottagripmychair"" wait. If so, it was carried way,way too far.<br/><br/>It's when the horror starts that a hint of what all those awesome posters promised begins. I'm not revealing anything, but the idea and setting really taps well into those subtle, unconscious fears. The xenophobic fear of the unfathomable visage of East Europeans, the desolate industrial culture,white slavery and the alienation of a tourist who realizes who perhaps stayed a bit too long and starts to see the postcard picture slip. That and the core of the plot -the frightening possibility of the ""hobby"" practiced being a contemporary reality when that thrill of power can't be sated enough. It's not that big a stretch of imagination. To give the director his due, the moral horror is slightly explored further in the scene with the gung-ho American.<br/><br/>But that aside, for reasons unknown, when it comes to the actual crunch, the director pulls short. Perhaps it was the studio's time limit - but there was a heck of a possibility of exploiting the idea further. The character development was sketchy and Ollie's euro ""openess"" was ridiculous. The only truly funny touch was the cameo by director Takeshi Miike (The oriental dude in the shades outside the art-house) and man was that apt! <br/><br/>It's worth giving a shot only if you don't know the plot and don't mind the money spent. To really get the goods which this movie promised, I'd recommend you watch Takeshi Miike's ""Audition"" and ""Ichi The Killer"". A fair bit of warning - you won't be the same ever again :)"

Show enough gore, torture and thin women with no clothes on and you will have an audience and thus, an income. There is no other reason for watching this. It certainly doesn't qualify as 'entertainment'.<br/><br/>The plot is basic, if at times annoying. Three backpackers fresh out of college and two from America journey to Europe (or rather Eastern Europe) and hope to get very drunk, very stoned and have lots of guilt free sex with young, thin Eastern European women who seem to think all American men are great in bed (I'm serious). After a series of sexual, drug and clubbing adventures they venture into former Soviet union territory (something unthinkable in the eighties) and are lured into an underground movement of Europeans who provide foreigners (all kinds) for rich people (mostly men) to torture, mutilate and possibly kill in the most messy way possible. Said men pay a lot of money for this 'privilege'. What ensues is a lot of nightmarish rubbish involving all the usual equipment of torture: chainsaws (how obvious), cutting Achilles' tendons with scalpels, guns and various other torture gear.

He is really just a great fan of the horror genre and feels like he can deliver a pop horror that everyone will love by using the formula he knows and loves. He has now proved that he doesn't have the film vocabulary to express his views. There is a gross lack of anything that resembles character developmentbut there are boobieswhich is really no consolation at all. If you love soft-core porn then you will love Hostel. However you better finish up quick or else you'll lose whatever erection you have to the completely unnecessary sh#t that the second half of the film is comprised of.<br/><br/>While the violence is ""new"" and ""stylized"", that really doesn't amount to much in the end. You feel no other connection to the character during their prolonged deaths save that you feel their emotional pain. But you are generally complacent about the deaths otherwise. It makes me sad that movies like these are regarded as art now a days. I feel sorry for Roth in that I think he is really destroying a genre of film that he truly devoted to.<br/><br/>I hope that Roth will look at the movies that he loved when horror was great and maybe channel a little more ""Evil Dead"" or the first ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" into his movies. I want to be scared by a combination of great story (maybe even some good dialog if it's not too much to ask) and brutal visuals, but the last without the first is what we're dealing with here.<br/><br/>A less then o.k. 3/10"

","Now I understand the idea. Young people away from home and responsibilities (after all tourists have been going away with this idea for eons). And this movie could have been good. I was not 'into' the sex. I liked Josh's observation that there seemed to be no Dutch in Amsterdam. As someone said earlier, this would have worked much better as a thriller, rather than a gross out fest. The scenery was great and loved the locations. Strangers in a strange land. Although the plot relied 50/50 on sex and dismemberment I think the story would have been better, with more story. I wondered too if those tourists might not have been missed, as all roads seemed to lead to Rome, or that Slavic country they where in. Is life that cheap where no-one cares, where young women can sell people and find it amusing, far more scary than some might realise. Are we at an age where these things are possible. Have we created these animal children, who will kill for bubble-gum? Now for me it is these that frighten. The gore bits although gross-out did not scare me as much as 'Seven' and some other horror flicks, which gave me a sorta General Exhibition feel. Whilst still cringing behind splayed fingers. Nah! this movie could have been a lot more, the end not as short and the beginning shorter. Too much for Effect whether it be the sex, drugs or total disintegration of society and moral ethics. I think they should make it again, reduce the above, write a better script, keep the locations, and if one was to be involved with a thing about hunters then do some serious hunting for the cash. Even though obviously the thing with those with too much cash, is that time is money That was like shooting fish in a barrel. Poor fishes."

"mike-3052","3","0","3","27 January 2007"," Extreme disappointment
","I have a select group of friends who's opinions on horror/gore films i value highly. this group of friends found this movie to be very entertaining and very brutal. so naturally, when i BOUGHT this film, i had high expectations going into watching it. and i must say, i was not impressed.<br/><br/>For starters, the acting is god awful. Like, these actors aren't even trying. The only credible acting scene in the entire movie is when Josh wakes up chained to the chair in the torture room, and starts freaking out because he has absolutely no idea what is going on. i felt he did a terrific job in that scene showing true fear when you are trapped and unaware of what is happening around you. However, other than that, everyone's acting is sub-par, even by horror movie standards.<br/><br/>The movie also has no plot. i remember reading somewhere that Eli Roth was trying to display through this movie America's ignorance of the outside world. So what, are you telling me that everywhere i go outside of America i should watch out or else i'll be drugged, kidnapped, and brought to a warehouse where someone will pay money to torture and kill me? it makes no sense. i wouldn't doubt that something like this actually does exist in the world. there are some truly sick people walking this planet. but this ""business"" seemed a little too high profile (complete with business cards, a ticket booth, and tattoos for all their customers) for the general public in the surrounding towns to not know about it. Nothing is really explained, nor does it get tied together.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure if I would say this movie was brutal. Maybe my standards are getting too high when it comes to gore in movies nowadays, but i did not cringe or jump once in this film. sure it had it's moments (like Kana getting burned), but so much more could have been done with the tortures that it left much to my imagination.<br/><br/>And that may have been the downfall of this movie for me. I don't mind a horror film if it has minimal violence, so long as there is a gripping and suspenseful storyline. and vice-versa, if you make a film that's strictly supposed to be disturbing and grotesque, by all means as long as it's done well. HOSTEL had too little of both. there practically was no plot to this movie, i wasn't given a reason to care about the victims, and there wasn't enough brutality to make up for it. The only positives of this movie was, like i said, that one scene where Josh first wakes up and discovers he's been kidnapped, and also the movie had more than it's needed share of hot naked women prancing around. totally not worth buying."
"johnnyboyz","5","0","1","17 January 2007"," A Disappointing 'horror' film that has its moments and its gore but nothing much else.
","The general feeling I got after seeing this film was that it was split into three different segments, or thirds. The first third was something out of a teen comedy film; resembling something such as 'American Pie' or 'Eurotrip'. The second third was the gory part; with the film relying on violence and shocking images to see it through with the final third solely guilty of resembling a gritty, criminal revenge film. Although these things were done correctly and the director made the most of the material he had in mind, 'Hostel' was a disappointment overall.<br/><br/>Some things that went well early on included how the film represented women. Going into it in a first viewing, you might feel a little disgusted at the way they are represented as loose and as absolute tramps in comparison to anybody else. Each female character seems to come onto the other male characters very easily and none of them have any problems with any of them seeing them naked despite the fact they don't even know each others names. Although this actually fools you as later on in the film, when a twist involving two of the girls at the hostel in revealed, the general feeling throughout this opening segment is that girls are mere objects whom don't care who they pull or how they do so. Even if the representation is accurate in Amsterdam, you have to doubt whether or not a lot of the happenings in this film actually occurs on holidays or wheather it's just a screenwriter's wild imagination at an attempt to shock a film-going audience.<br/><br/>Another clever piece of film-making was the sole character of Josh. Although relatively unsure throughout the film, nervous even; I feel the audience maps onto him the most. The character is not sure of his surroundings, weary and rather tentative. I feel that any member of the film's target audience watching the film, whom have not been to Amsterdam, might be represented through this character as the surroundings seem new and intimidating for him. Evidence of this can be seen when he is unsure about paying for sex at the brothel whilst his friends jump at the chance and even earlier on in the film when he tries to convince his two accomplices that maybe they should visit a museum or something, instead. This was quite clever and since the first proper death/torture scene is him as the victim, it made it all the more disturbing since the audience may have mapped onto him the most.<br/><br/>Where Hostel goes wrong, apart from its three thirds structure flaw, is suspense and horror. Yes, the second third is 'horrible' but is this really a 'horror film'? There are no jumps, there is no real 'bad guy' monster/villain character and there is nothing uncanny in the film at all; just a bunch of European Patrick Bateman's whom want to let off some steam on young adults. In fact, because of its realism, it's more of a comedy at first, tragedy in the middle and then it ends with revenge, action and drama. We are shown the house of pain too early on when we learn what has happened to Ollie, spoiling the surprise/suspense and to be honest, the film feels like a documentary for most of the opening thirty minutes as we follow these kids around as they smoke drugs and get laid; it's really quite disappointing as the film goes absolutely nowhere. I realise that this was supposed to build up sympathy as we begin to relate to the characters but how can we relate to them (the other two, at least) if we dislike them more and more due to their antics? This is what happens when people think with their balls instead of their brains. In fact, an example of a better build up would be 'Wolf Creek' which is a similar type of film.<br/><br/>Even if the final third is a gripping revenge tale with a good mix of suspense as they try to escape, disturbance as our hero has his conversation with an American torturer and gore as a girl's eye falls out; Hostel in the long run is a very disappointing and poorly structured film with too many incidences of content taking precedence over style."
"scianscythe","4","0","2","15 January 2007"," Unless you're fond of overt gore, don't bother.
","I've had Hostel recommended to me by a number of people for a variety of reasons. Having just finished watching it, I find myself wondering why.<br/><br/>The movie itself, if you like slasher flicks, is not bad; it's more intelligently done than others of the genre (such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre). However, when the movie ended, I found myself thinking 'What's the point?'; even the rather anticlimactic ending fails to wrap the story up properly.<br/><br/>There were also a number of -glaring- errors. Some, for the sake of those who still wish to see it, I will simply say fall under the heading of 'physical reaction to bodily damage'. Others include language and location discrepancies, though these -may- be deliberate; Eli Roth claims that it was done deliberately, but I believe this may have come to his attention after the film was finalized and unable to be edited.<br/><br/>I feel very sorry for the Slovakian people, as I'm sure their tourist industry took a nasty hit over this. (Despite comparisons I've heard to the aforementioned Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it is important to note that Texas is located prominently in the US, which -always- has a booming tourism industry, where Slovakia is a very little-known country in comparison.) If you're looking for a horror movie with both a visceral thrill and a serious psychological point, I would recommend you see the Saw movies instead. If, however, you prefer mostly nude women mixed with torture for torture's sake, then this may very well be up your alley.<br/><br/>Final rating: C-"

","OK, the film was rubbish but that's merely my opinion. However, it was shot mostly in Cesky Krumlov (CZ) which is NOT near Praha (Prague) at all. Try walking from one city to the other. Neither is it sited in Slovakia. Mr. T. seems to have used the worst of city slums and mixed in a little beauty to create a film worth forgetting. RAPIDLY. I accept that there is poetic license and that the film is merely entertainment, but mobs of vicious kids beating up on folks just DOESN'T happen over there in the Czech Republic. The film comes across as a Gothic version of American Pie with a dab of Texas Chain Saw, pathetic! Perhaps Mr. T has a typical USA mentality and thinks ALL Europeans are backward primitive morons. The contrary feeling is prevalent over here. And with all due respect, Mr T. should stay home. PLEASE<br/><br/>Sorry Tarrantino your film stinks!"

","Eli Roth's send up to sleaze ain't bad. It isn't just terribly good in its own right, but I love the fact that he's making hard-R-rated horror. For an ""exploitation"" film it's tame. You're not gonna get your frills here if you cut your teeth on stuff by Deodato or even early Peter Jackson, but you can still appreciate the fact that Roth is making an effort to put the umph back into mainstream genre pictures. Is Roth the wunderkind savior of horror? No. But, he's trying.<br/><br/>And, you know what, it is a decent little picture. Odes to Suicide Club, Takashi Miike's cameo, etc. aside, you can dig the film as an okay addition from Roth.

So last night i go and rent it and after watching it i don't know how this can be considered a horror movie.<br/><br/>This movie starts out (mostly contains) as teen sex porn fest and through this movie that is pretty much it. There is only 2-3 cool torture scenes which was good but obviously we wanted more. 98% of this film was porn and the other 2% was not. The plot was also very thin and the acting wasn't that great either. If there was more characters and a lot less porn crap and more torture scenes. Then i may have liked this film. This movie makes Cabin Fever look good. So it will be a while before i look into a another film made by Eli Roth again."
"marianne-jansen","1","0","2","2 January 2007"," A waste of time.
","To put it bluntly this director should have been stopped after Cabin Fever and Kill Bill 2. Although Kill Bill 2 does have its credits and a fantastic story line continued from Kill Bill. Hostel did it. I've never seen such mechanical and monotonous rubbish. What was the point? Where was the story line? <br/><br/>Take the first half of the movie. A couple of really perverted young men womanizing, seeking prostitutes and using women at there will. So did the director. The start of the film shared the resemblance of a really bad porno, and pointlessly. Maybe the director could have made it necessary. I understand that they were seeking the thrill of girls, but never have I seen women being portrayed so relentlessly as a tool for some weak willed and obviously poor natured young characters. The sexual content of this film should not be likened to American Psycho, American Psycho had a story line, a plot and a reason. Although still it was poor. If I want to watch porn, and not something with substance I'll get some but when I want to watch a movie- I want to watch a movie that has some sense to its contents. I think this really paints a revolting picture of young America. <br/><br/>The second half of the film is blood and guts and really it's a horror, but there is nothing as displeasing as watching effects that are really quite good, but knowing that it's all for nothing. Pointless and meaningless. Completely unmoving. There is no reason for it. Needless slaughter, and without a single reason but these people like killing people. It doesn't even broach the topics of life and death, or living, freedom, of cause, of morality, of heroism, of need. It was not thought provoking in the slightest. It was complete nonsense. It's a wonder there is anyone watching it at all. The 18+ restriction baffles me as it is not worth an adult audiences' time. It is aimed at 15 year olds and that's giving credit. <br/><br/>So if you can tell me what the point of the film was, how it made you tick and think, I seriously believe that it might be time for you to find meaning in something worthwhile and where there actually is some. If the point of the movie was to be pointless, then there shouldn't have been a movie at all, and it really did succeed. <br/><br/>Quite frankly if I had rented this movie, I would have stormed back into the video store and demanded my two bucks back. It was that bad. Instead it was loaned from a friend and I almost think less of him for owning it. It was absolutely fruitless I should have spent my evening reading a book with no words."

","Two Americans, and an Icelander they meet en route, are on a tour of Europe. They're simultaneously taking the best drugs, looking for the hottest women to shag and generally acting like complete jerks all the while. In Amsterdam a friend recommends they head to Slovakia to check out all the smouldering single chicks there left behind by the war but as soon as they arrive on the train they get more than they bargained for. What seems like Paradise with unisex saunas and nightly sex games with two local sluts quickly turns into a nightmare when DUM DUM DUM one of their number goes missing. The only clue to his whereabouts is a mysterious phone message and picture from an Asian girl guest. In trying to track down their buddy, our two remaining heroes get themselves embroiled in a bizarre slaughter house caper. But the killing is not of animals but of humans, and bloodthirsty rich folk pay thousands to get their kicks out of DIY amputation and torture...<br/><br/>The narrative arc of this movie can be split roughly down the middle: Part 1: T&A Part 2: Gore. What an accomplishment! Something for everyone. As long as you're a teenage boy, of course. Everybody else will probably quickly tire of the various irritating flaws that are sprinkled throughout. Take our three main characters, for example. If their sexist, xenophobic, coke-snorting behaviour doesn't make you feel intense hatred for them after 15 minutes, than that tells me more about you than I care to know. I hope the director didn't expect us to root for these losers, because I for one couldn't wait for them to have their limbs severed and eyes gouged out. Fortunately my wishes were granted, for the most part...<br/><br/>The plot is simplistic to the point of Once Upon A Time, the acting is barely more than adequate, but there is something strangely fascinating about it all which makes you watch till the end. Maybe you've heard a lot about from your friends about how 'shocking' the violence is. Well sorry sunshine... there isn't anything so graphic here you haven't seen in the likes of Saw and The Hills Have Eyes. A few nasty bits maybe, but nothing to make cower behind your sofa. Just approach it for what it is: A mediocre slasher, with about 5 minutes of decent sex, 20 minutes of decent bloodletting and the rest aimless filler that could easily be fast forwarded through at 100x the speed on your handy DVD controller. Sounds tempting? Then go for it!! 5/10"
"pichu904","3","0","2","24 December 2006"," Excellent potential, but all in all: a flop.
","To be honest, I was expecting something really excellent about Hostel. A friend and I rented three DVDs to watch, and he specifically wanted to see one movie, while I kept bugging at him to watch Hostel. Eventually he gave in, and we started to watch the movie. I'm a big fan of horror movies; not directors, not actors, and so none of that influences me. None of what I'm saying is influenced by whoever wrote, directed, or acted in this movie. I don't give a damn who wrote the thing, or who he was, or who the actors were. All I know is: it was just not well composed. He left about half an hour into the movie. That's rounded up. More or less he stuck around for about twenty-twenty five minutes, then was just so bored with it that he went off to play a video game instead. That's always a bad sign, for one. If a horror movie doesn't GRIP you right at the start, then it's not going to turn out very well.<br/><br/>It took way too long to get anywhere. To be honest I was just confused during most of it, and I didn't understand why anything was going on until Paxton found the business card. Then FINALLY, after a good hour into the movie, I somewhat get what is going on. By the way, I didn't even catch this guy's name at first. I had to check it out on wikipedia. They may have used it one or two times for this guy, and he suddenly becomes the main character? Where the hell did that happen? Another bad move; these three American jerk-offs, whom we don't care anything about and don't know anything about, are the protagonists here? In order for the horror film to actually frighten you, you've got to feel like you know the characters. If you just feel like your seeing strangers killed, you may think: ""Hmm, that's awful."" and move on with your life. I admit, I'm very intrigued with the possibility of people actually paying someone to kidnap tourists, and torture them to death. That both frightens, disturbs, and fascinates me. This movie could've really gone in a better direction. Last minute revenge: Horrible. I was actually amused and laughing at the so-called revenges. Said friend came back in just when Natalia noticed that Paxton was the one driving the car, and as he began to run them over, he started laughing. By the time the BubbleGum Gang started attacking the idiots who were chasing after Paxton, we were both just laughing hard at the absurdity of it. I especially loved that revenge scene involving crazy-guy-who-killed-Josh, (Oh, I'm sorry, did we never hear his name either?) because it was again, so absurd. And why exactly did Kana commit suicide, conveniently creating a distraction so that Paxton could get a ride on the train unnoticed? It's tragic she no longer has an eye. At least she's alive and not still being tortured. She looks deeply into her reflection in the mirror (How often are there full-body mirrors set up around train stations, exactly?), decides she's ugly without an eyeball, and leaps in front of a train? Just as convenient as running into the three main antagonists while driving a car, no? Or finding the man who killed your friend who just-so-happens to also be on the same train as you? <br/><br/>That kind of suicide just sounds like a touch of vanity to me. Or if one might argue that it's because she was in such pain she couldn't take it and she figured suicide was the best option: I wonder why, if she was in such pain, she was capable of calmly walking around without any indication she was in pain and throwing herself in front of the train. How did Paxton manage to walk around so calmly and without any major bleeding problems? When he killed nameless-dude-who-killed-Josh, there was blood everywhere in the bathroom. Big dripping obscenely gory puddles of blood, just from cutting the same two fingers that Paxton lost, yet he just walks around with gloves and doesn't seem to have any problems with blood, not to mention manages to think clearly enough to come up with a semi-brilliant plan of escape for himself and Kana while only flinching slightly to put on his gloves, even after being struck in the chest with an extremely sharp something-or-other twice. (Though these puncture wounds seem to be absent or forgotten afterward?)<br/><br/>Another thing, there were no subtitles. Some people actually would like to know exactly what these people are saying in German, thank you. It's a fabulous touch to have these people speaking in a foreign language, but subtitles would be nice.<br/><br/>I'm definitely going to go watch Hostel 2 when it comes out. Most likely I'll be going to laugh at it and see what poor excuse for a plot they strung together THIS time. Most likely a lesbian orgy scene. Ooh, more sex and drugs, let's give this film a high rating."

I guess the nudity is appealing for those who have yet to actually see a woman naked in person, but otherwise the early scenes (i.e. in bars, bedrooms) add nothing to the story or character development. As for the horror itself, this movie provides about 1/10 of the scares of Saw I, II, or III, with none of the tension.

","OH dear, Eli Roth, what do your parents think of your new graphic imagery torture film? Perhaps some Jewish holocaust organization might like to shed some light on exactly what they think of a foul mouthed poo and scalpel jester Jewish boy like you (see Hostel's 'making of' DVD section) actually choosing to write and then film torture imagery that degrades the actors, film industry creatives and lastly the cinemas and audiences? What is the point of HOSTEL apart from wanting to show screaming 20somethings slashed and drilled and being physically destroyed? What does it say about YOU, Eli? Not anything good I suspect. Like Australia's similar abomination WOLF CREEK directed by first time movie business vandal Greg MacLean this is the tourists getting hacked to death imagery. Maybe Roth Maclean and Tarantino are actually the axis of evil. HOSTEL exists for no other reason that to celebrate Tarantino and Roth's delight in human mutilation imagery. Like the cruel businessmen depicted in the film they perform the same act on the audience (giggling hi-fives all round). Yes it makes money, but so does war. To be so young and to have already sold your soul to Tarantino is the greatest horror about HOSTEL. The fact that good young actors like Jay Hernandez (and Heather Mattazzaro in HOSTEL 2) are reduced to appearing in this ugliness is an equal disappointment. Maybe to fill in his time better, some Jewish holocaust organization might educate Roth and pals in the value of human life, that it is not, as the Nazis gleefully enjoyed, a thing to be degraded and mutilated as entertainment. Apparently, according to industry paper Variety, Roth is 'thrilled at how gore audiences have embraced his new horror film..."" and that ""HOSTEL 2 will contain more graphic torture, especially on the new torture train..."" . Gee isn't that just great for the impressionable teens of tomorrow. Go feed your Grandmother Eli, do something useful. Clean your street. Take some disabled children to see a real movie. One that is creative, not destructive.<br/><br/>... actually I just had a thought: wouldn't it be funny if Tarantino and Roth were both crippled in a car crash and had to spend the rest of their lives being fed by old Jewish people in a nursing home.."

They are, in short, pretty obnoxious, intensely dislikeable for their blinkered hedonism, overall stupidity and Neanderthal attitude to women.<br/><br/>Thus, when they are told of a mysterious, near-mythical hostel in deep Slovenia by a fellow day-tripper, they can't resist finding out about it. Early signs bode well: buffed, nubile women deck the halls and are liberal with their bodies, and the alcohol and drugs appear to on tap. However, they also start to missing, one by one Becoming increasingly desperate in his search for his errant mates, Paxton's worst fears are met when he wakes up handcuffed to a chair in a veritable charnel house, an unwilling subject for some wealthier tourist to slash up.<br/><br/>Born out of a mixture of hard-core horror, a seemingly intelligent philosophy on the spectacle of pain, the current climate of global fear, memories of frat-boy ramblings and some dubious European post-war climates, Hostel certainly stirred up the press a bit, and also the box-office, out-running King Kong and The Chronicles of Narnia  no mean feat for a low-budget sicko horror flick with racy material and no major stars. So kudos to Eli Roth for pulling off a minor coup; he directs with gusto throughout, clearing enjoying this opportunity to make a film that it is once commercial (it clearly aims to take advantage in the post-Saw thirst for sadism) and also smart. The film raises themes about Americans abroad, the nature of tourism and also the reason why we feel drawn to watching violence on screen. Note: it raise these themes, does not examine. Hostel is a failure.<br/><br/>Technically its put together with some punch, and if not very distinguished, it's still a slick, competent package. Roth also wisely places some confidence in an intelligent narrative device: the first forty minutes of the film are larkish and funny, despite the obviously sinister undertones. Having put the audience on the back foot, Roth lets rip with carnage and guts. Sadly, the film never rises above its initial success. For one, the scenes of torture are purely visual and not psychological: they're nasty to look at but not horrible to think about, because Roth and Tarantino never offer intelligent discourse on WHY people pay to hurt others. We certainly come away thinking they're sick mothers, but we knew that already  and they fail to develop a potentially promising allegory on the similarity of real life and cinematic spectacles of violence. Also, the last quarter of the film fails to be very atmospheric, with Roth, his cinematographer and design team failing deliver a compelling environment; predictably, the bloodshed all takes place within a dank, rotting former factory, and one that has no character. There are hints at some sensitivity for the fallout from wars and the USSR, but again, these are never developed. Worse still, the final third of the film turns in a run-of-the-mill escape-and-heroism story, which trivialises everything that has preceded it and might leave some viewers yawning.<br/><br/>There's been some interesting debate about whether or not the film is an extension of fear or xenophobia on the part of American filmmakers, and though Roth has said that he made the film partly to demonstrate American's ignorance of the world around, but what are they ignorant of? Is it that they're wealthy tourists who blunder into dangerous situations after failing to research properly, in which case they're no different from anyone else, or that they just didn't know that Slovakia has a profitable torture industry, and they should avoid it? Is it a parody of American attitudes, or a warning? I can't make up my mind, and that ambiguity is a flaw. The film becomes disgustingly self-righteous in the closing scenes and indulges in stupid bit of revenge violence, and while the survivors appear to have changed, there's no hint that that they've become wiser to the ills of the world, and they're place in it. They'll be just be more afraid when they travel.<br/><br/>That said, there are a number of moments that do work very well: one character killing themselves when they realise they'll be scarred for life; another mocking the hero as he's dragged off (""that makes you MY b**ch""); a torturer gagging his victim when they realise he can speak his language; or a pack of marauding street urchins, who'll bash heads in for sweets. But those are the only moments that really made me flinch or sit up, and amount to about five minutes out of an hour-and-a-half film."

","I was expecting to watch a dark disturbing horror. I had even delayed watching this film because I thought it would leave me with a nasty aftertaste like all well crafted horrors do. Even though I hated Cabin Fever I was prepared to give Eli Roth's follow up a chance - afterall, The Devil's Rejects was such a vast improvement over Rob Zombies debut - maybe this could do the same. What a let down. Its not scary, disturbing, funny, clever or even action packed. We get about ten minutes in the torture chambers and none of this is psychologically interesting. The eye cutting scene (which I had heard so much about - maybe that was the problem) looked like an effect from the 40s. This was an interesting idea but it stops at about that. Soft porn and sadism - thats what I read in one review. How wrong. A few breasts and an MTV style torture scene. I wanted to see something that conjured up the visceral thrill of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the forbidden pleasures of Italian splatter movies. But this was glossy, unfocused and without any memorable scenes or iconic moments. But what does Mr Roth care? The cash tills are ringing. Here comes the sequel."

I mean yeah the blood and guts were alright, but it was slow getting into the story and the beginning of the movie (at least the first 30-45 mins) was like watching a mild porn movie. The torture scenes were awesome.. they did awesome in those scenes. But, as for the rest of the movie it just felt like they left a lot out. They didn't really explain anything before jumping on to the next scene. I went to the theaters to see this movie.. myself and everyone else walked out of the theaters wondering what we had just paid to see. Not to mention the theater ended up giving everyone either refunds or rain checks cause no one was satisfied with it. It was so not worth the money, and the commerical's for the movie was nothing like the movie itself. At least in the commerical's the movie looked good."

","I've come to terms that grizzly violence can be entertaining. I admit I'm a fan of the Saw films. Hostel, however, lacks a certain quality I deem necessary in any film worth my time: intelligence. The only redeeming quality of the DVD is the ""making of"" documentary where the audience is introduced to the brains behind the scenes where we discover how such a waste of a movie was produced. Let me break the film down for you. It could be considered a double feature, the first feature being a lame porno. Shallow characters hiking though Europe to fulfill their sexual fantasies. whoop dee doo. They get stoned, get a little frisky, there's a club fight and then the film climaxes with a co-ed fantasy. Then begins the second feature. People slowly disappear. There's some blood, some gore, people scream because apparently it's pretty flippin' scary. I sit amused, but sort of nostalgic for the co-ed fantasy. There's more blood, an then oozing eye socket, a revenge bit... By this time I begin to wonder when it's going to get good.. then... the credits begin to roll. And I begin to feel betrayed by that video rental store associate who recommended it... that and Benchwarmers... I should have known... phshwah. One may argue that I have misjudged the quality of this movie. That it was actually a very well done comedy. I must admit, I love an optimist when it comes to the occasional outlook on life, but urine doesn't taste good, no matter how thirsty I am and there was no humor in this film. One may defend the acting.. but I'm sure acting like you're ""making sweet sugar"" with very attractive gals isn't that difficult. And almost any Joe schmo can act hysterical. You scream, yell, whimper a little, drop the eff bomb and wala! you're a star. Okay, so maybe it's not that easy... but come on... it ain't that difficult. Try it. Go ahead. And in fact take a camera crew, get a little naughty, add a little blood, get all hysterical... then send your tape/DVD to Hollywood. If films like Hostel can make it I'm sure you have a flying chance."

","I put off seeing this movie for some time, not because I thought it would be poor (which it is), but because it seems that 8000 horror movies come out every month these days, and hardly any of them are worth mentioning. I finally rented it it earlier this evening with the hopes that Tarantino's connection and Roth's humorous touch would make it at least a half-decent viewing. Unfortunately neither proved to be true. On the plus side the picture does have the ""hard R"" gore that has been lacking in horror movies for quite some time, but it all feels utterly inconsequential because the writing is so thin that it is hard to give a damn about what happens to the characters. None of the bizarre, yet entertaining humor of Cabin Fever is present, instead we get a good deal of nudity and sex, followed by a dragging center, concluding with some fairly gory violence, none of which has any real impact due to the slipshod writing. In all honesty I found Saw to be a better film, and that wasn't exactly a mind-blowing movie either. It seems no one is interested in putting out good horror movies anymore, there seems to be only two good types of horror movies; those with elaborate death sequences and campy humor, or that rare breed of psychological thriller whose fear inducement lies not in bloody scenery, but sharp writing which creates tension. Hostel is neither. Save your money and watch The Descent."

","There's not much about this film that hasn't been adequately ripped to shreds by other posts (and deservedly so).<br/><br/>However I would like to take issue with one comment that suggested this film would only be enjoyed by stoners. I'm a stoner (and proud of it) and I thought the film was appalling. For one, the opening scenes in Amsterdam are so uncharacteristic of the place it's frankly offensive. In fact its portrayal of European culture in general is so ridiculous and inaccurate it makes me wonder if Roth has ever set foot outside his own country, or ever read a book about it for that matter.<br/><br/>The film is divided into two halves, and they may as well have been separate productions for all the connections they share. The first half parades as a titty-fest with the occasional chuckle, the second half is an aimless gore-fest without much gore. Admittedly the second half's psychological impact is somewhat effective, by using suggestion instead of in-your-face splatter the sense of suffering and depravity is enhanced. Still, the whole thing still comes off as much tamer than any of the previews suggested, though I think my gf may disagree with me on this one! Clues to the plot, if you can call it one, are thrown at you constantly, while actually believing it's being subtle. I was expecting some sort of twist at the end - when it didn't happen I had to wonder what the point of it all was. Unreasonable coincidences abound, usually as a method for the remaining character (I struggle to call him the 'lead') to exact his revenge. He becomes what he was running from, you see. Oh yes how clever and ironic.<br/><br/>The characters are uninvolving, deserving neither support nor pity. You just don't care what happens to them. Only one character (who was still so vacuous I can't be bothered to remember his name) promised any depth, and he was killed off quickly once the 'horror' started, leaving nothing in his place.<br/><br/>Even the score is badly done, with crescendos of ominous music suffocating scenes of little importance. Ooh sounds like something big is going to happen... no wait, it didn't. In fact that's the impression of the film as a whole - promising lots and ultimately failing to deliver.<br/><br/>The 4 stars is given for the premise of the film, and because the acting wasn't dreadful. It could have been a great thriller but in the end it looks to have been made for shock value alone. Pity it couldn't even do that."

I don't know if I am the only one that feels this way but it just seemed to be low budget, dull and boring.

The ending is only kind of satisfying, what with Paxton (our protagonist, played by Jay Hernandez) killing our psychotic antagonist, known only as The Dutch Businessman (played by Jan Vlasák). But, I was still too confused as to why Yuki (a torture victim played by Keiko Seiko) threw herself in front of a train to really be glad.

Maybe one could have had had the protagonists kidnapped in Slovakia, then a train ride taking days, followed by truck (""lorry""), then barge, etc., until they arrive at an abandoned factory in the Ural Mountains, where all the ultra-rich are constantly ferried in and out via helicopter. That may have added some extra dimensions of fear and anxiety, including what would have been derived from the difficulty of escape.<br/><br/>I suppose what I am getting at is that there were some good ideas here that could have been better developed.

The main characters are broad, unengaging, stereotypes that the audience may find it hard to believe in and root for. The main idea, that there is a place where the rich and jaded can go to inflict suffering on their fellow man, is an interesting one, but themes about the nature of man and his place in society are not developed. Instead you are left watching someone you don't know very well, and don't care about, in a nasty, one-dimensional, situation. The inventiveness and grittiness of the torture scenes is to be applauded but it almost seems like a waste of effort. The final nail in the coffin is a forced, contrived and deeply unlikely finale that leaves you wishing a better writer had been given the task of fleshing out the genuinely interesting premise."

The cast is fine & mostly convincing, the editing is brilliant & when the story comes around, it's better than mediocre. The story, however, is my main beef (though not my only one). shocking, brutalitarian films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre work because after a brief introduction, the movie gets to work shocking & grossing out the audience for the next hour or so. Hostel gets bogged down showing the main character's obnoxious European sex adventure, without the requisite atmosphere - it's just a drunken European adventure. Eventually we're given hints that something is wrong and then - whoop! - someone goes missing, then all hell breaks loose for a bit, but without much gravity. Even worse, we aren't given the right clues as to what we're supposed to be thinking or guessing about the plot: our group agreed that we all hated the bulk of the movie because the evident story was about a wealthy, crazy man who has paid a war-torn village to get boys for him to torture. It's not until the 3rd act that we find out the far more clever & shocking facts. Is this on purpose? A good twist ties up fascinating & perplexing elements in a film (i.e. Sixth Sense), but this movie is just stupid until you are told, bluntly, what is going on. It's not a twist as much as a clarification, and I don't really think it was meant as either. We're supposed to know that it's somewhat random chance that Josh is tortured by the same man as they meet on the train (rather than, as we assumed, the man had intended Josh all along). So the movie succeeds, sort of, eventually. But even then, there are still major flaws. Makeup effects were nearly on the level of old Troma films, where I think the film industry is currently capable of convincing effects, either in make up, or in digital post production. The corpses that Paxton hides under appear to weigh a few pounds & bounce in a silly way. The Japanese girl appears to wear a taffy eye-patch (and why in hell DOES Paxton cut off her eye?!?). The plot holes (undxerstandable in any corny horror flick) are so completely stupid, you have to wonder if there might have been a less-lame hole that could have been written in. The most annoying element is the supposed ""payoff"" of the main torture scene: it's just too much. It's not entertainment. There is minimal build up, it's hard to watch, and then it's over. The director has used his strongest scene up, and the movie dosn't benefit much. Tarantino's involvement brings up an obvious comparison to the similar scene in Reservoir Dogs, when the ear gets cut off. Arguably not as shocking, yet dramatically stronger. Josh's fear is plausible, his agony nauseating. Yet once I knew what was going on (the business end of the situation, the Slovakina mafia apparently running the scam, the local involvement) there is an air to the film that is satisfyingly odd & unsettling. Unfortunately, it is an unsalvageable mess by then. There is a good movie here, but the writer/director just can't quite get it out."

","The main problem with this film is the fact that the so-called ""heroes"" are extremely unlikeable homophobic morons. You hear them use the word ""f@gg#t"" so many times in the first few minutes of the film that I was rooting for the ""villains"" before we even meet them.<br/><br/>Director Eli Roth's ""excuse"" for his frequent use of homophobic characters is that ""people talk like that"". Well, if that is true how about making a couple of racists the main characters in his next movie? They are out there as well unfortunately and also use insulting language. But I doubt that would be acceptable to a film studio. Homophobic morons on the other hand don't seem to be a problem. It's a strange world...<br/><br/>But if you can look past the fact that the main characters are insulting and alienating 10 to 15 percent of the audience of this film (and I'm sure there are quite a number of people who are glad about the homophobic insults and praise Roth for being ""non-pc"". I wonder how they'd feel if those characters were racists and not homophobes.) you still won't get what the commercials promised. While the film is very brutal and gory at times there are MUCH less scenes of torture then you might expect. And considering how much I disliked the characters I wanted to see them suffer much more. The most unlikeable character even survives, leading to a very unsatisfactory ending.<br/><br/>There is a very undeveloped plot about Josh, one of the annoying backpackers, possibly being gay but that doesn't lead to anything. Is this maybe Roth's way of trying to make up for all the homophobia? Did he get scared how his target audience would react to this and abandoned this plot, therefore making it pretty redundant? It won't come as a surprise that one of the main villains of this films is gay and gets a very bloody death scene at the end. I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it but considering the prejudiced attitude of this film it makes you wonder what Roth's fascination with homosexuality and homophobia is all about. I'm not really sure I wanna know..."

","""Hostel"" is Eli Roth's follow-up after the uber-creepy ""Cabin Fever."" It even follows the same theme: when people make incredibly bad choices.<br/><br/>In this case, we follow the exploits of Paxton (Jay Hernandez),Oli (Eythor Gudjonsson)and Josh (Derek Richardson), 3 college grads that are determined to have sex with every woman in Europe. It is during one of their barhopping tours that they meet Alex (Lubomir Bukovy),who recommends a hostel in Slovakia where all of their sexual fantasies will be fulfilled.<br/><br/>As the saying goes, ""Beware of Greeks bearing gifts."" It seems that the guys soon become nothing more than an experiment in sadism: people are kidnapped and brought to this hostel in order to fulfill the twisted desires of their incredibly rich clients, who can kill another human being in which ever way that they want. And it can get incredibly nasty and bloody.<br/><br/>The film starts off slowly. It doesn't get bloody until about the second half of the film. And many of the scenes of torture are suggestive in nature (One unfortunate soul is about to get their toes clipped, but the viewer never sees this). Incredibly unsettling and will make you hide behind your hands an awful lot (I freely admit that I had to do this several times). What makes it unsettling is that there may be a real possibility that situations like this exist.<br/><br/>This will creep you out."

","Stay in your good old motherland, it is safer. The outside world wants your skin (try to avoid cabins too, if you want my advise).<br/><br/>The movie depicts a European machination (from Amsterdam to Belgrad, via Praha) against visiting backpackers. <br/><br/>It's not particularly exciting, full of clichés, and the constant question of nationality (how American victims are more valuable than their foreigner counterparts) makes it a bit pompous, a bit irritating.<br/><br/>Overall visually softer than expected, Hostel is still able to deliver some cheap gore from time to time (hahaha, remember the eye scene). Definitely not a must."

","I started watching this movie without knowing anything about it, the only thing I've heard about this was that it had hard torture scenes in it. I never saw any other Eli Roth movie either before.<br/><br/>Well, the story starts in Amsterdam, where 3 friends are trying to get laid with European woman. Right at the beginning we start noticing that this isn't probably the best movie to was one and a half hour in it.<br/><br/>As the story continues, the picture keeps showing us hot chicks constantly during probably half an hour, with pratically no substance in it ... but I must admit that the girls are really really hot.<br/><br/>But everything else really sucks. The plot is stupid, the acting is dumb at certain points, and the music is even worse, it never fits to the scene. And the torture scenes aren't that disgusting as I've already seen written around here a few minutes ago. Sometimes (thanks specially to the music) I was almost laughing due to the stupidity of it. Still, I must congratulate the special effects for some scenes that they managed to make it here (At the moment I can only think of the scene where the 2nd of the 3 friends is tortured (probably because it's the very first torture scene that we watch).<br/><br/>Other than that, this movie sucks in every way.

","I've been looking for an excuse so I didn't have to write about this film, but I couldn't find it yet. So if this doesn't say much if because there is not much to say about ""Hostel"", Eli Roth's last cinematographic project. Frankly, the movie is awful. You know when they say you should get a lot with little? Eli Roth got it, but he got a lot of the wrong elements and little of the good ones.<br/><br/>Part of this horror ""renaissance"", ""Hostel"" presents a small amount of characters in a maximum of two important environments. It's a matter of short time before the characters arrive to this so called hostel and they live the most terrifying experiences of their lives.<br/><br/>Unlike Neil Marshall and his ""The Descent"", characters here are not developed or even detailed; Roth doesn't seem to need that for the development of the picture. Josh and Paxton are two friends who just want some good pot and some good sex with some beautiful girls, nothing else, and they are portrayed by Derek Richardson and Jay Hernandez with more conviction than the bad movie deserves (mostly by Hernandez).<br/><br/>So we also find the enigmatic and weird characters that are not just common people in a film like this one. We find the receptionist in the hotel who doesn't even speak or answer questions. Then what we find is just what has to happen so we can at least see something of content in the picture.<br/><br/>What happens, I could say, is not plenty but it's enough. You get to a point, sometimes when you're watching a movie, where you don't know how you got to watch it until that point; because you know that you're not watching anything. ""Hostel"" may be appealing for the horror fans because it respects horror and gives horror what it needs. And I understand that.<br/><br/>The part I couldn't understand has to do with the plot, and I don't know if the fans care about that. Let's just say that Eli Roth has an amazing eye for the genre but a regular eye for storytelling. His camera moves expertly and explores without limits, but his scripts doesn't make a move. When the main explanation arrives to our eyes and ears, it's so pointless that it becomes funny.<br/><br/>We accept it as it comes, but the explanation is followed by a last scene that is actually terrific and a minimum reason to watch the piece. However, the power of this scene and the impression it generates, comes too late to compensate the other stuff.<br/><br/>What else can I say? Well, just don't bother."

I thought this was just an introduction with some irony and parody and the movie will get more serious and perhaps even ambitious later. Well, later the movie is about violence and sex. Senseless violence. Absolutely stupid. But it remains a teen movie, just a little more brutal. The actors are awful except a few and the self-proclaimed ""humor"" is absolutely shallow.<br/><br/>Besides the movie makes the impression of Slovakia being a barbarian and corrupt country where every town makes what they want to.<br/><br/>So, what remains?

The rest is a boring, sick movie not even recommendable for fans of movies like ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" or ""The Devil's Rejects"" (which I REALLY enjoyed).

Its pretty much just scene after scene of torture, trying to be really dark but there's no substance to the movie. I guess the move could be trying to reveal the horribleness of torture, or to make a political comment on how republicans want torture to be legalized for terrorist suspects. The plot is this: Torture in a hostel. Guy tries to escape. No character development. No changes. No plot. Death and torture should be the name of the movie. Or just ""Don't see this movie."" That one would work too. Overall, the only reason to see this movie is to desensitize ourselves to violence.

","I'd heard numerous things about this film before I watched it mainly focusing on the violence and gore, but the other being Quentin Tarentinos involvement. So I watched this film expecting a slick, well produced and fast moving film. However! What I saw was a slow bogged down movie with very poor representation of any kind of truth - i.e. Amsterdam - I lived there for a few years and know it extremely well and I've never seen such a Red Light area and more to the point since when have the Dutch spoken German!?! This turning it into a typical Hollywood 'we don't care if it's accurate depiction or not film'. The first hour of this film is supposed to be trying to build a story however the quick cutting between leaving the 'Hostel' (Hostels in Amsterdam normally have a name!) to Coffeeshop to Disco to appearing another room with the Alex character is very disjointed. Oh on another note no hostel in Amsterdam ever have Curfews they fully well understand why people go Amsterdam ('the party capital of Europe') - just another point that makes the film so unbelievable.<br/><br/>That said the general arrogance of the American in Europe is capture well enough! Something if you live in Amsterdam and see day in day out you'd understand that comment.<br/><br/>Back to the film. So once the 'action' has moved from 'Amsterdam' to the train on it way to Slovakia - couldn't they be bothered to stop in Germany or the Czech Republic which they would have had to cross before reach Slovakia? The scene in the train carriage was toe curling cringe worthy - who told these 'actors' they could act I don't know! <br/><br/>They then appear at the 'Hostel' and more wooden acting and poor direction we suffer the embarrassment of the sex scenes . . at this point I was ready reach for the stop button on the DVD player . . but I suffered on. <br/><br/>So the last 30 minutes the movies actually picks up and bit and story regarding an organisation which people pay to torture and kill people. Plot idea - good but very badly executed! The gore isn't as bad as people have made out and why people don't pass out from pain and stop bleeding (even after having two fingers cut off) is something else. The finale is pretty poor also you left not really knowing anything about what actually happened or any background.<br/><br/>So in short save yourself an hour and just watch the last 30 minutes that's the interesting part of this film (and you wouldn't miss anything). It isn't a thriller, it's not a horror film, it's just a mess! It's the kind of film I'd expect from an American who has never left America in there life."
"s_cadzow","1","0","1","5 May 2006"," Failure in All Apects.
","After viewing Hostel it was clear that the film serves only two purposes: to act as a template for how a film should never, ever ever be made, and as a confirmation that Cabin Fever was not just a fluke, Eli Roth is indeed THAT bad of a writer and THAT bad of a director. For a man who uses the words ""Bad"" and ""Ghettoized"" to describe the condition of the horror genre today, Roth seems to be doing overtime to make sure it stays that way.<br/><br/>Hostel follows two American backpackers (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) and their drifter friend, as they waste the first hour of the film, which is only 1:35, stumbling across Europe doing drugs, trying to get laid, cracking jokes your little brother would think were funny and more or else making it impossible for us as an audience to care anything for them as characters. After the ""plot"" decides to get moving we see that the travelers of Slovakia are starting to go missing, and we find out that the girls our American protagonists have been busy ogling over are in fact dealers of sorts to sadistic businessmen. And wouldn't you know it, they happen to pay top dollar for American subjects.<br/><br/>Hostel makes me wonder what Eli Roth is really trying to accomplish. There is not a single moments worth of innovation in the films entirety. Is Roth trying to become synonymous with awfulness? Is he trying to give Uwe Boll a fight for the worst director in cinema history? If you take each aspect of Hostel and compare it to the worst movie you can think of, I'm almost certain you will find Hostel is just as bad, if not worse.<br/><br/>First, the acting. This is the only true horrifying part of the film. You may not end up seeing the whole film if you're anything like me, because I spent most of its duration hanging my head in pure disbelief that any director would send his actors to the silver screen in such disgrace. Hernandez, who may not be an A-List actor but surely not a bad one, is sent to a sadly stupefied level. It is impossible for Hostel to work as a film because of the characters. From the very first few minutes I couldn't care at all what happened to these stoners, hell, I was actually waiting to see them tortured. We are not given any developing or background information on our protagonists, especially our ""hero"" Hernandez. Point being, there's no point of relation between us and them and certainly no reason for us to care at all what happens to them.<br/><br/>And then we have the dialogue. Oh good God the dialogue. If this were a silent picture or even if the dialogue consisted of only ""Fagg*t, Drugs, F*ck, Sex"" then the film would have gotten itself across all the same, because there isn't a single line of important exposition in the entire barrage of triteness. That coupled with countless scenes that are entirely null and void, and you have not a single plausible aspect of Hostel. Well, I'll actually give Roth credit that the idea of Hostel itself is intriguing, but as I've stated above, he made sure we forgot about that.<br/><br/>As far as the torture scenes are concerned, which I can only imagine are the reason people decided to venture to the theatres to see Hostel; they are too little too late. What is hyped up to be one of the most disturbing films of our time adds up to nothing more than some quick cuts and a dangling eyeball. I must admit I was extremely let down, for I was hoping to be satisfied with at least once part of the film. The scenes were not long enough to create tension and edited so poorly that what we did end up seeing, we actually didn't really get to see. <br/><br/>With this being the second monumental disappointment coming from Eli Roth, it is beyond safe to say that this man is incapable of delivering the goods. On par with the horrendous efforts of Cabin Fever, I cannot recommend Hostel to anyone. It does not work as a horror piece, it does not work as an entertainment piece and it certainly does not work as anything that we should remember. Few films are less desirable than Hostel."

The main characters are demeaning to women and an embarrassment for Americans. I expected a psychological thriller. This movie held no suspense. The so-called horror scenes were medically unrealistic and were not even scary, just disgusting like the rest of the movie.

"j_s_calvert","6","0","1","26 April 2006"," Roth succumbs to the pressures of the mainstream audience
","It's not a bad film. It's just not a particularly good one either. Wehenever I examine 'new horror' objectionably I like to view it from the standpoint of an both ardent fan and a mainstream viewer. I found that Hostel failed to deliver on both levels, simultaneously trying to satisfy one then the other. As a true horror fan I found much to admire - the sets/lighting/sounds of the torture chambers were handled impeccably and offer a real sense of dread. The characters 'natural' reactions to their impending deaths are eerily portrayed and do ask some rather cathartic questions of the viewer. The effects work, while standard stuff are heightened by their application and in true 'Texas Chainsaw' fashion, the implication is often more appalling than the grue on display. <br/><br/>However, whilst I enjoyed the first half of the film as a piece of characterisation, it IS still a little dull. The set-up, a little too set up, and the hostel unnaturally accommodating. I'm not suggesting that the owners take notes from Lord Summerisle or Tubbs and Edward, but I have stayed in many hostels and never once have been offered a sauna with two naked Slovakians. I've tried... <br/><br/>Set-up aside, the natural progression is to reward our patience with a second half that delivers on all counts. Which it does... for ten minutes and the results are truly horrifying. Not because we are being offered anything new in the way of gore and suspense (which are both competently handled) but because, and not wanting to put too fine a point on it - this sh1t is probably happening somewhere as we speak and that in itself is enough to give the most ardent fas a shudder down their spine. <br/><br/>If only this level of energy could have been maintained for the following 30 minutes, but alas. After the initial escape from the chambers (and the improbable and ill-conceived re-entry) the film simply gives up. As a film in its basic sense it's a polar opposite to cabin fever, Roths earlier effort. The contrast is phenomenal and I'm fairly certain it's self imposed. I can't imagine there were many, if any studio pressures on the production as that would be like asking Shakespeare to write a play, only using a handful of words. It seems to me as though there may have been fears as to the films release or content if it didn't offer retribution and moreover 'closure'. However the very nature of the film should have dictated its conclusion, which is this: if these 'underground killings' are taking place, it is likely we will never find out about them. A true end to a film of this nature would have seen the second victim never leaving his chair. I understand that this would repel many audience members, and it should. One should not leave the auditorium with a sense of 'hope' or 'closure' after viewing a film of this nature. If anything it should promote unclean feelings of dread fear. The film did promote a fresh ideal - not every horror film has to be some self-referentially post-modern Craven-imitation to garner box office success (see 'wolf creek' also). Along with a few other touches it WAS refreshing to see the weaker of the travellers die as such and not continue this ridiculous trend of creating hero's from victims by the end of the final reel (see Alexandre Aja's Hills have eyes - then rent out his vastly superior Haute Tension to see another director with a clash of purpose and apparently talent). In addition, whilst the stronger of the 2 characters does survive, we don't not envy his success in any way, and although the murder/revenge he commits is there to satisfy a mainstream audience it is carried out with enough 'ill will' that it almost convinces the rest of us -when you accept their rather coincident train journey and the vocal repetition which brings the two protagonists together. <br/><br/>In conclusion, a great premise, handled competently where required but ultimately falling short of its own hype and unwillingness to see the events through to the bitter end. <br/><br/>Best scene - The shot of our third 'victim's' hands as he grasps the chair he's chained to when the chainsaw starts from behind him. Pure gold."

It's hard enough to suspend one's disbelief when watching a horror flick but when the non-horror aspects of the movie are equally as ridiculous it's just laughable. Furthermore, you have to watch half the movie before you get anything violent or shocking. Shock-effect is the main reason for watching a horror movie or a Quentin Tarantino movie.

The film is shot pretty good, with scenic views and good lighting. Three young men traveling a long way to visit a chicky hostel they have been told, that's like Stephen King's ""Stand By Me"", with a different goal. Boobs are necessary, after all those are what the characters really hunger for, right? Torture things are necessary too, I mean that's the whole idea of the film, a creepy torture house for captive tourists.

","This time it's not an SUV breaking down in the middle of the Ozarks (or the Australian outback in a little-known place called Wolfe Creek) but the siren call of sex, drugs, and partying all night. Of course -- the premise is again, as new as the latest category romance novel you will see in your local drugstore, but stories have to come out of somewhere, and this genre only has a one-way lane with little room for variation and the knowledge that it will not produce greatness but popcorn products aimed at violence queens and eager teens.<br/><br/>Anyway, Eli Roth and Quentin Tarantino, two guys who have a special, loving bond with violence taken to extremes, have teamed up to produce HOSTEL. No, it's not a travelogue depicting the breathless landscapes of Europe (where it's based), but more or less a straightforward template of young people getting caught in a situation where they have practically no control and in which they will have to resort to the same grotesque inhumanity in order to escape and never mind the missing bodyparts.<br/><br/>The set-up sequence is slow. It is a little unsettling to see a faceless man humming tunelessly as he mops a blood-soaked floor, but this short prologue is over soon enough. Not so soon as to make you wonder what has taken place in this unknown place... but that comes later. In the meantime, Eli Roth sustains a good hand in building up his story, in which the moronic playfulness of the three twenty-somethings -- Paxton, Josh, and Oli -- in quest for sex with available women is on full display. I don't think Roth was looking for sympathy from the audience as much as just showing, in his own way, the mentality of ""boys who want to have fun"". So anyone looking for a character to hold on to may need to look elsewhere because it's not here.<br/><br/>Now, there are some elements that stick out as unnecessary or at least, plot-questionable. In CABIN FEVER, there was this one boy who was insane and had a thing for karate moves. HOSTEL now supplies an entire gang of them, and they're pretty mean even though all they want is bubble gum. I don't know if this was meant to be comic relief but it stops the story dead in its tracks. Also unnecessary: the requisite anti-gay jokes, but that's probably not as relevant, even when it was a little off putting. There's also the misogynistic element in HOSTEL, which to me is all but invisible -- unless some women were offended at seeing so much female nudity and decided that women were being shown as bait -- which they are, and later we learn, quite willing to be so.<br/><br/>HOSTEL is an okay film -- good, but not particularly memorable for me. It continues to help the genre survive now that the haunted house and monster movie are all but rotting cadavers. It's much more disturbing to me to see the evil within Man, and one of the most nightmarish sequences involve the man we hear at the start of the movie: the German surgeon, who seems to be in a sort of ecstatic frenzy as he gets ready to torment Paxton (Jay Hernandez). It was reminiscent of Dennis Hopper's extreme moment of sadism in BLUE VELVET, and that scene has more homoeroticism than the lame scene between the Dutch businessman (Jan Vlasak) and Josh (Derek Richardson). There is also a cute in-joke with director Takashi Miike as a customer: the man who brought ODISHON, a classic of this genre, it made me wonder what his character might have been up to within the torture chamber that he felt he needed to tell Hernandez to be careful or he might spend all his money in there. Considering the fee these ""clients"" pay for their extreme entertainment, that would have been an interesting movie in its own right."
"silbaughkj","2","0","1","19 April 2006"," ""Best horror film of the decade""... Yeah right
","This looks like a pretty promising movie. I'm looking at the promotions with Tarintino's brand, reviews for being terrifying, and people be taken out of the theaters. The idea of being able to pay to kill someone however you want was interesting and could've made a fantastic movie... sadly this isn't it. When we popped the DVD in, I knew it was going to be bad in the first 5min. 3 guys, in Europe, looking for the almighty sex. How many poor horror films in the last decade have started with this premise!? I thought it'd get better, but for the first half, I was just watching a really poor porno film, with music to boot. When the gore finally came, I found myself laughing uncontrollably rather than even beginning to be scared or creeped out. The ONLY part of this movie I remotely enjoyed were the group of kids straight out of Oliver Twist romping the life out of the pursuers. I got a kick out of that.<br/><br/>Unless you're a huge fan of Fangoria, B-Film, Blood, and Gore movies please please skip this. Even for those people that get kicks out of seeing boobs and sex, get a porn and watch that instead while waiting for a better horror film to come out. Chances are, the story and action will be a lot better in the porn..."
"mario_c","6","0","1","17 April 2006"," There's always an American hero!
","The idea I had about Hostel (from what I had heard and from all the marketing that was made around the film) was that it would be an extremely gore movie, one of those we just watch blood flowing everywhere and mutilated bodies on the floor. Ah! I also heard it had lots of sex (some people even call it pornographic I wouldn't go so far!).<br/><br/>Well, Hostel has actually all those ""nice things"" (for a gore movie, of course!), but it also have three features that are not so good! <br/><br/>The first one is the nationalist crap, which I really didn't expect for a movie like this! The ""pride of being American"" thing is so deep at some moments of the movie, that I felt even sicker seeing those scenes than the gory ones! <br/><br/>The second, a good American movie must always have a hero A guy who does the divine justice and revenges all his dead friends It's so typical! <br/><br/>The third, the portrait of Slovakia! Man, if I was Slovakian I would be insulted with this film! All that is showed is filthy buildings, old cars, abandoned kids on the street (in one word: misery!) and free sex! I know Slovakia isn't a rich country, that's for sure! It's a new democracy and they are reforming many important issues of their society, but I think the portrait done in this movie is the typical description of ""the civilized guy who's coming from an occidental industrialized country"". He's there (in the eastern country) just to search beautiful women and have some cheap sex!... It's so typical too! It would be a fantastic tourism advertisement: ""Slovakia, land of misery, wild sex and butchery!"" <br/><br/>But there was one detail I really appreciated in Hostel, in spite of being truly sick! It was something that I had never seen before: when the ""hero guy"" was escaping from the cell where he was arrested he gets into a room that seemed more like a bath-house and, suddenly, enters a guy who asks him if it was goodif he did it slowly or fast if he liked to kill his victim! Then he realized he was in a kind of a ""Butcher's Club""! Those guys were paying to calmly torture and kill their victims, as they were going to a gym to do some relaxing exercises It's so sick, weird and cruel that I wouldn't even imagine that someone could create a thing like that! Sick, sick, sick! <br/><br/>Globally I think Hostel is fine, but it could have been much better if the three ""issues"" I mentioned before didn't exist. I would give it 7 out of 10, but,because of those reasons, it will be just 6 out of 10."

","Hey, i just saw this movie 2 hours ago in a cinema, and it was nice. Some people left in the middle, i can see why, and some went to the end. (and all the tickets were free...) So, this is not the typical teen movie, but it's also a little bit predictable. I can't blame the all nudity screams in the posts, but what do you care anyway? At first glance it even looked a playboy movie, but i believe it was made so people would relax, with some kind of soft music that looked a lot like a kid show music. After that the movie gets really violent with lots of gore that showed the brutality of mankind. What do you care if the actor were 20ish? just for that is a teen movie? and deserves a 1 star? I don't recommend it for the sensitive people, actually i only recommend it for who really know what is going to see, that is... a lot of blood and human pieces...

"tbyrne4","7","0","1","11 April 2006"," Very good (not great, alas)
","I think I built this one up too much in my mind. I LOVED Cabin Fever so I was expecting big things from Roth for his second film on a heavier budget. I missed Hostel when it zipped in and out of the theatres and finally got a chance to check it out tonight.<br/><br/>BASIC STORYLINE: Trio of frat guy-ish twenty something's carousing through Amsterdam get wind of a little Eastern European area where the babes flock to Americans like nobody's business. One hostel in particular is a veritable treasure-trove of pu**y, so they're told. Off they go and. Everything about this little country seems great at first. But all is not as it seems.<br/><br/>GREAT premise. GREAT great GREAT. Love it! Any guy who has ever been to college knows about these little European backpacking tours (nudge, nudge) which are basically excuses for dudes to get away from girlfriends/responsibility/real life, etc, so they can party and pick up hot euro chicks chicks and live it up before settling into an actual life. It's a frat guy tradition. For someone to make a horror film that preys upon such hallowed ground is like watching someone spit on your grandmother's grave.<br/><br/>Starts out awesome. The two ugly Americans are accompanied by an equally ugly Icelandic. They smoke hash, insult people, act like rude idiots, have sex with hookers. All that good stuff. The only minor problem in the early part is that these guys may be TOO ugly. But its a minor quibble cause the beginning is great. A creepy, twitchy (which can adequately describe many people in this film) local directs them to the Eastern European hostel. Off they go. Things are still rolling along nicely.<br/><br/>I think the problem starts to set in when they actually get to the hostel. Things there are just like the guy told them. Lots of conveniently available, easy women and so forth. But for me this is where Roth kind of got into trouble. For some reason the air of dread never surfaced. I don't know why, but I actually felt it more when they were still in Amsterdam. Nothing in the town radiated any sense of danger. The roving bands of kids didn't look scary. The girls just looked like a bunch of models. I never felt any palpable menace. The buckets of blood and the gore were fine, but by the end I felt it was just a distraction. I wanted more scares. Gore is great if used well (like in Cabin Fever!) but not when it actually detracts from the sense of menace. I guess I wanted the film to disturb me more than it did. I wanted something that would make me REALLY not want to go to Bratislava.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I should say that I did enjoy this movie. Quite a lot. I think Roth is an awesome director. I was expecting a great deal from Hostel. Too much, probably. And when you're anticipating a film so much sometimes it just can't live up to your expectations. Some great scares. Definitely a lot of blood and guts. What I actually liked the best was when Roth was more reserved and let the creepy characters take center stage, like the weird Alexi and the freako American near the end. Then the film really came alive for me."

The plot is very poor and the film has little or no point until the last half an hour and even then it is silly. The violence is to a level where it is just not believable and at the same time pointless really. As you can gather i'm not a fan of this movie, and yet i loved Roth's 'Cabin Fever' which to me is a great spoof horror, although i'm led to believe it was supposed to be a straight horror!! oops!!

Sat in my local cinema I wondered why the hell I had offended my senses by watching this rubbish. It was poorly directed, abysmally written and the acting was below par to say the least. The film is like some kind of porn-horror that tortures you almost as graphically as the victims in it from start to finish. It is so bad. Really it is tasteless and cheap. The gore is over-the-top and at times very cheesy. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IT IS UTTER RUBBISH.

Problem is, I'm STILL waiting for it to come along.<br/><br/>It's OK. The opening is bland, fairly inane. You don't give a stuff about any of the lads, but I personally don't see that as too much of a negative. When the intenser stuff starts, all I can say is that you US of A boys who were fainting, hurling and running out of screenings, well you're a whole load of tarts.

","Listening to interviews with Roth among others, it seemed like this film would blow you away!

OK OK .. i'll start again.<br/><br/>1) The film was slightly disjointed, for example when Paxton is brought to the ""art show"" and is about to walk down the tunnel to see what's inside, he is suddenly half was down the tunnel, there are 10+ rooms that are proceeding in torture yet we hear no screaming. He then sees his friend being chopped up and is captured himself. As he is being captured he is dragged past some torture rooms, suddenly there is a mass of screaming ... did it suddenly start when he was captured? Unlikely.<br/><br/>2) Same scene as number one, my complaint this time is that as he is being dragged past each room we can't see what is happening in the room, it just looks like more blood and guts, a slower drag would have done the trick.<br/><br/>3) Paxton running around outside with the Japanese girl as they attempt to escape, i don't know whether it's the camera angle its shot at, but how the hell could the Slovakian armed men not see them running about towards the car? Same at the train station ...<br/><br/>4) Why did they have to kill Zvetlana? The best ending would have been Paxton boarding the train with her, them going off to live happily ever after and setting up their own hostel. :-) Eamonn."

But this film had few redeeming features about it. Yeah it was shot and edited competently but take out the pointless gore and the Tarantino badge slapped across it and what is left? Not a lot. If this is what is left of Tarantino's creativity then please Tarantino,cash your millions in and retire.

","Two friends, Paxton and Josh are backpacking across the European country. In Paris they join with Icelandic traveler Oli, now the trio are resting in Amsterdam. These three have one focus; drugs and sex, with T & A filling every scene possible. You could call them misogynistic, but they are just acting out what basically every backpacker does. While at the Hostel in Amsterdam, they receive a tip on a hostel in the town Bratislava in Slovakia. Beautiful women and drugs await them in this place of paradise. Hitting with the local women at the hostel, the three can't believe their luck. The following day Oli disappears, no indication of his whereabouts. Soon Josh disappears, with Paxton revealing a dark spot in this town. Held in a dilapidated factory, people can pay to fill their wildest, more to the point disturbing fantasy, to torture and kill people; preying on the tourist that flow through.<br/><br/>Unashamedly, we are thrown into this dark, disturbingly sick world by Eli Roth. The torture unleashed upon the victims are slow and painful, through such emotional, primal screams that fill the halls of the factory. Violence and disturbing images have always been apart of horror, with directors pushing the limits as time has moved forward. Though it has been moving slowly into the main stream market. While the violence is raised, the film loses that psychological edge, where subliminal violence greatly enhanced that psychological mind set. Eli Roth's previous film, Cabin Fever, worked on the psychological tension, using subtlety and unknown elements that never reveal themselves, which worked much better than just being served everything up front; it takes the mystery away.<br/><br/>Hostel lacks a lot of suspension and builds no real tension. The town Bratislava has so many small streets, and tightly close together builds, yet it doesn't feel suffocating, nor any ominous mood. The tension only rises during the torture scenes, perfectly joined by the dark and grungy rooms, with endless tool of pain.<br/><br/>While the suspension does lack, there is an element that Eli Roth does tap into with Hostel. There is a reason why these people spend so much money on the pain of their unwilling victims, the primal entity that resides in all people. That adrenalin that shows through the tortures eyes, showing the pure ecstasy. What made this element hard hitting is the one conversation that procured it, from a man about to take part of this 'fetish'. While this does say Hostel is based on actual event, though it isn't, it does provide much food for thought, constantly thinking that this may actually happen.<br/><br/>Eli Roth has craftily created this disturbing place. While his script does fall in a lot of the dialog, the situation is made disturbingly. The acting doesn't give us much empathy. Jay Hernandez gives an average performance, though shows great arrogance in Paxton in the early scenes. Derek Richardson shows the best of all the actors, though by no means great. Eythor Gudjonsson is wonderfully irritating as Oli, giving much relief when he's picked off early.<br/><br/>Hostel does has its disturbing moments, and takes a disturbing look at humanities darker side; snuffing people off for an adrenalin rush like no other, Hostel relies to heavily on the confronting violence and lacks a lot of suspension, cutting itself short for a great horror film."

","If you couldn't hold your lunch after watching Saw, Hostel will be far worse. But it's also far worse than Saw from a plot and horror perspective.<br/><br/>Hostel tells the story of two Americans and one European (Paxton, Josh, and Oli) who are traveling through Europe drinking, partying, and sleeping with as many girls as they can. They are the stereotypical characters: Paxton is the Alpha male leader, Josh is the shy sensitive one, Oli is the big honest fella. In Amsterdam, tired of all the ""tourists"" and the sex for sale, they meet young Alex who tells them of a country that's full of young women without any virile young men, and they're all beautiful and looking for Americans.<br/><br/>Off they go to what looks like paradise: a posh hotel with young peers, and they're even forced to room with two gorgeous and sexy women (Natalyz, Svetlana).<br/><br/>Of course, this is when heaven turns to tell, and their hostel goes from bondage to torture.<br/><br/>If we had more empathy for the main characters, we'd care for them during their struggles, but instead, it's only the gore that we care for, and enjoy."

","One of my favorite horror films of 2003 was 'Cabin Fever', so no doubt I was a little psyched for Eli Roth's return to film 'Hostel'. I also found it the unmatchable cinematic god Quentin Tarantino was producing, so I was all the more psyched. When I finally saw it, I was a little let-down, but not by much. It isn't as genius as 'Cabin Fever', but it does garner some hilarious yet sick quips and some bloody awesome sequences of carnage. It isn't as violent as they say, and I suspect they had to cut a sh*t load of the violence out to escape the dreaded kiss-of-death NC-17 rating. 'Hostel' is nothing brilliant, but it is one of the better horror/slasher flicks in recent years. I recommend it. Grade: B- (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, 1/13/05)"

In a sentence: Not entirely good and not entirely bad.<br/><br/>It was nothing like I expected it to be, mostly because the preview didn't show anything other than scenes of people being tortured. Basically I expected to sit through a movie entirely composed of disturbing events. The first scene of the movie however was in Amsterdam and involved lots of drugs and sex. I was puzzled, but found it all amusing so I didn't care. That's how the movie continued for about 45 minutes. Lots of drugs and as many tits as one sees in a porn.<br/><br/>Still, I found the movie funny so I didn't mind. Then of course people FINALLY start getting tortured. You don't see a lot of it though, and the only thing that really disturbed me I've actually seen in other movies before. So nothing new, nothing special. I didn't really care about any of the characters until Pax (Jay Hernandez) put a suit on. Suddenly I was invested! It's strange how a nice black suit can make the most boring of people suddenly attractive and bad-ass.<br/><br/>The movie was also really short! I couldn't believe how fast it went by, but being that there were only three main characters and a plot that really only belongs in a short story, I can forgive that. The movie would have really reeked something awful if they'd tried to carry it any longer.<br/><br/>All in all, good movie.

They pretty much blunder drunkenly into the web of torture awaiting them without ever having revealed much in the way of a redeeming trait.<br/><br/>Still, they don't deserve what they get, do they? Well, maybe not, but at any rate, the cinematography is very good, the acting gets better as the film moves along, and there's plenty of gore for the splatterhound.

He seems to show promise, and the fact that Takashi Miike is in the film, well if you don't know who Miike is or what type of films he makes, check some out, I highly recommend them, then you may see why Roth's film has a certain vibe to it.

The characters are so unlikeable and arrogant its no wonder half the world hates us Americans. They were such a bunch of loudmouthed jerks, I was hopping they would all get cut up. However, watching the film to the end, I can see why the director choose to depict the characters that way. The horror in this film really sets off in the second half when they end up at the torture chamber in that hell hole of a village in Slovakia. Really the only jerk in the movie was the Paxton character. However, one develops respect for him by the end of the film and are actually glad that he survives. When his friends start to disappear, Oli being the first, we can see that he truly does care for his friends. When he finally escapes from that dreadful place of torture, he is able to find a car that by chance has the keys still in the ignition! He could easily have left but he risks his life and getting tortured again by those sadistic freaks to save that Japanese girl when he hears her screaming knowing she is getting tortured.<br/><br/>By having this film start out as a typical teen sex movie and gradually regress into extreme horror, these people are not so arrogant anymore but fearful beyond anyones imagination. It is probably well known by now that Eli Roth was inspired to make this film based on a Thai web site that advertised the torture of humans for a price that was shown to him by Quentin Tarantino. The web site was probably a hoax but who knows, maybe their is such a place in this world. Their is certainly enough sick f**ks in this world to support such a place! Roth did a very outstanding job of making the events in this film seem real. I must admit that I felt rather unsettled after leaving the cinema. This is without a doubt a more intense horror than is normally shown in theaters. When this comes out in its uncut form on DVD it might be an NC-17. I thought the theatrical version was close. The character of Natalya was quite the evil bitch! Barbara Nedeljakova did a great job portraying her. I agree with another commenter that described her as the ultimate femme fatal!

","This movie is visually jarring and in many ways disturbing. At the same time it probably points to a truth that similar ""hunting operations"" do exist in some odd pockets of this world for the ultra-wealthy, So, I don't consider this horror story pure fiction. It has a share of nudity (mainly women, why not also some of the men?) but the nudity is not really gratuitous because it adds to the plot line. That is the main problem with this movie though--there is a very thin plot here. Basically you know the plot from the advertising and there is no character development, no strange twists or turns (relatively speaking), no revelations, epiphanies--not even the seeds of a sequel. I think Amsterdam gets a slap in the face as only a place for sex and soft drugs--Amsterdam is a lovely city to visit, has a great deal of culture and is a place to experience just for the free attitude of its inhabitants. I thought it interesting that this movie was set in Slovakia--kind of hearkens back to the Frankenstein, Dracula horror movies--perhaps the movie is stereotyping that part of the world too? The guts and gore are not as bad as I heard, but they are still not for the faint of heart. This movie would most appeal to teenage boys I think. This movie is not a ""Salo"" (which had a plot and some artistry to it despite it being as disturbing as ""Hostel"") more on the order of a ""Caligula"". I went to see it out of curiosity, wouldn't see it again."

Usually most of movies about Europe are made in or around Prague. They say it's like many other places in Europe. They decided to capture it in some Czech city as say's speaking Czech voice at the train station or Czech titles on the walls. As for me it would be difficult to set such a story in real Bratislava because it would not match to the script because of the size and I think it would be hard to make of it such a terrifying place. Today everybody knows that name which is a picture of entertaining, violent and intellectual work, Mr. Tarantino and his movie led me to a particular question. Where is the story set? Those who have seen the film will more likely uncover the background of the location after seeing some website containing panorama views from the city."

I would never have guessed he had a thing to do with it's production, had his name not been in the credits and advertising for this film.<br/><br/>On the plus side.. the locations for this movie are spectacular.. and eerie.

","I knew I shouldn't have gone to see this movie. I saw it a week ago, and still have a hard time getting some images and sounds out of my head. It was the mention of Tarantino that was advertised on commercials that made me decide to go. I really didn't research the movie much, as it was a ""date"" movie, and I wasn't paying for the ticket.<br/><br/>If you want a good, old fashioned *very freaky and gory* horror movie, this is for you! Hostel has a vaguely interesting story-line, although I can't say that I'd put too much deep meaning into it. Also, the setting is intriguing. But, as one other review said; This is a *very* common general formula for a thriller/horror movie. <br/><br/>I did see quite a few holes in the plot which seemed very obvious to me, but my date didn't notice at all. To say the least, I don't think this is a meticulously made movie. <br/><br/>I prefer movies that are actually *directed by* Tarantino. I find that they have a sense of humor, even in their violence, and they are put together seamlessly. In contrast, I feel that Hostel is humorless, and has gaping holes in the plot.<br/><br/>To me, this was certainly not a great movie. At best, it's just another horror movie, and possibly this is even a film that somehow wakes our all-too-human tendencies toward sociopathic violence. <br/><br/>Although Hostel had my adrenaline flowing heavy, I think in the future, I will just take a good trail-run to get my adrenaline flowing in a pleasant, peaceful, and productive way. And I'll just wait for the next *real* Tarantino flick."

","I don't get why everyone made such a big fuss over this movie. From reading all the posts on here I expected the worst movie ever made. It's NOT a porno, the nudity is no worse than your average Road Trip or American Pie. The violence is nothing new (and mainly offscreen), although it is gorier than Saw, although that's not saying much. There is vomiting, for those of you that don't like that kind of stuff, but even that isn't too bad. If you've seen High Tension Unrated than this is a walk in the park. It's not as bad a movie as people make it seem. I think they were just expecting something great because QT's name was on it (although I'm not a fan of QT). People should just enjoy it as a horror flick. It could've been scarier, more intense, and had a better story. The trailer is much, much better.<br/><br/>*spoiler* I didn't really care much for the main character getting revenge. Yes, if I was in his situation, I'd feel the same way, but the movie didn't make me feel his anger. Although it is satisfying to see the torturer's put in the victim's place, Breakdown does this much better.<br/><br/>*end spoiler* There are many MUCH worse horror films out there. There are lots of better ones, too. I can see how one would be disturbed and horrified by the subject matter, for it's obviously not very light. The scenery of the basement is darkly reminiscent of Session 9. Some images could haunt some viewer's dreams if dwelled upon at night, particularly a shot where Paxton walks past several doors with people getting tortured. Really, though, you'll probably forget about this movie after you watch it but it's not a waste of time. Torture barely takes up much screen time at all, maybe less than 2 minutes. If it wanted to be more disturbing it should've placed the viewer in the torture chair and should've been relentless instead of a quick 1 minute clip and then the torture is over, with most of it not shown. Real life is much worse than this."

"jonathankui","6","0","1","20 January 2006"," Another example of a great premise unfulfilled due to poor writing
","Wearing the chevron of Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth has created one of the first gore-filled horror films to hit mainstream theatres in recent memory. HOSTEL, the latest film from the writer/director of CABIN FEVER (2002), has an advertising campaign that makes it come across as a filmed abattoir on steroids.<br/><br/>For those who have asked, I've summarized HOSTEL as follows: 1) Take the most gore-filled, pain-filled, dismemberment-filled scene you can remember that makes you flinch just by thinking about it. (I, for instance, use that 5 minute scene from the end of the disappointing AUDITION (1995).) Now, repeat that for about 40 minutes.<br/><br/>2) Now take an hour of American PIE (1999) and drop it in the front. In hindsight, I probably should have told everyone to take EUROTRIP (2004) instead.<br/><br/>HOSTEL was an intensely gory film, which was poorly written, very very poorly acted, and ultimately only moderately executed.<br/><br/>In fairness, the premise was actually superb. I don't want to give too much away, but the premise was reasonably believable, and while not an entirely novel concept, it was given a fresh spin.<br/><br/>However, the story was structured in the worst possible way. The first hour was nothing more than pointless nudity (and I don't even mean entertaining, I just mean utterly boring) and cheap humor. Sitting through the first half was tedious and had us wondering, ""are we in the right film? THIS is the great horror film that's been hyped?"" The film then takes a drastic right turn and delves headfirst into gore. Explicit gore. And lots of it. For about 40 minutes.<br/><br/>I can only assume that when writing the film, Roth tried to go for maximum contrast: really funny and lighthearted, and then, WHAM, what the Hell is happening?! The failure lies in both the pacing of the first half (insufferably long, light on suspense, total lack of atmostphere), and the horribly written characters. In many horror films, the ""protagonists"" are annoying, and you're just waiting for the Big Bad to kill them. Here, they're so annoying, that you just get bored waiting for it to happen.<br/><br/>The gore, however, is delightfully extreme, if you're into that sort of thing. Lots of puncturing, slicing, laceration, dismemberment. Good times, for those who enjoy. But that make it a good horror film? No. No, it doesn't.<br/><br/>A good gore scene will make the average person wince. 20 gore scenes in succession just kind of dulls the senses. If not used tastefully (see SAW 2 (2005)), gore for gore's sake just becomes another load of special effects.<br/><br/>On the bright side, the gore miraculously managed to escape an NC-17 for reasons that I'll never understand. With the more liberal R rating, and a limited release, HOSTEL will likely be considered a commercial success. This is good, for two reasons: 1) Maybe HOSTEL 2 will be to HOSTEL what SAW 2 was to SAW: a dramatic improvement in writing and ambiance that greatly enhances the rewatching of the original.<br/><br/>2) A commercial success for HOSTEL could conceivably drive the industry away from these atrocious PG-13 teeny slasher flicks, and back towards some more serious, disturbing, dark material. Look: I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and quite frankly I likely never will.<br/><br/>Do I recommend HOSTEL? Not really. If gore really does it for you, have at it. Otherwise, just watch American PIE and the first 20 minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998)."

","Another torturous gratuity of some of the most repulsive hacking Jeffrey Dahmer could conceive, ""Hostel"" plays calculatingly and chillingly well as a gore fest cum revenge flick, with an anarchic signature Tarantino twist to boot. Cautionaries like ""not for the squeamish"" and ""seduction kills"" are splattered all over the wall of this malodorous, if irresistible, concept of a film like the mutilated body parts and bloody carnage which inevitably ensue, yet ""Hostel"", unlike countless other slasher flicks that are impetuous in presenting shock and awe, builds its terror casually and methodically. Allowing plenty of exposure to the clichÃ©d ""to-be-mutilated party animal teenagers who unknowingly become seduced by a fatal excursion"", and offering up plenty of gorgeous European scenery and babes galore, the film's anticipation of horror is consequentially profound. You anxiously hang around and wonder, ""How is this going to play out?"". And once the neon ecstasy of the ""hostel"" becomes the darkest and most blood-curdling dungeons of despair imaginable, if you don't find yourself gagging and shying away from the punishing grotesqueness that eventually blackens the screen, you might want to ask yourself if you're a sadist at heart. And you thank your lucky stars that your life isn't under the knife of one of these trigger- or should I say, ""blow-torch, chainsaw, drill""- happy maniacs. At times, it's a bit too excruciating and mind-numbing to absorb, and the pace is a bit drawn-out in places. In the end, there's a sore lack of empathy for any of the so-called characters, the bludgeoned or the bludgeoners, because as usual, the victims play right into their killers' machinations, and the killers are strictly capricious madmen. Just when you think one of them has the heart not to ""finish the job"" (or the privilege, however you want to put it), it's simply a convulsion of their manic nature, and they turn out to be the ghouls we figured them to be after all. These elements would usually make for tripe horror, and ""Hostel"" would fall into the category of yet another recycled morass of a gore fest. Yet one has to keep in mind that at the helm of this production is the ever-industrious Quentin Tarantino, and you had better believe that everyone's going to get what's coming to them. This is not so much a chilling and horrifying film as it is a cold and unflinching trip into the darkest places imaginable. For the price of admission, you're going to get gore, gore, and babes galore, and if that isn't enough, the last drop of blood will be shed until the credits roll. ""Hostel"" is blood-soaked, soberly crafted horror featuring the most gruesome images you won't be soon to forget. Could you expect anything less? *** out of ****"

","Eli Roth is back, this time with Hostel, endorsed by Quentin Tarentino, although I have no idea why he would want to be involved with this project. Roth has improved on his first movie, Cabin Fever, albeit, not by much.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie does not seem to relate to the second act. The introduction consists of gratuitous T & A, while the conclusion shifts to over the top gore. I have heard people saying that the violence was so realistic, but I think that sometimes less is more, especially when it comes to horror films. I actually found the ""violence"" to be so over the top it was comical. Also the makeup was terrible, you will know what I'm talking about when you see it. I found the movie to be mildly entertaining, but I was fairly bored by the slow pace of the opening act."

Even though the plot is not the best, I think the acting is good based on the fact that there really are no huge names in this movie. I really enjoyed the concept behind the film because even though it was disgusting at times, only people like Roth and Tarantino would explore such areas and consider to bring it to the big screen.

Roth is yet another Hitchcock wannabe but knows how to tell a story.

I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie since most other reviews seem to only focus on the obvious things like gore and torture. Yes, the movies does have these uncomfortable gruesome moments in it but it is done in a way that I don't believe glorifies the violence but shows how sick and depraved people can really be. I mean the idea that people would pay to torture and kill innocent people makes you sick to your stomach. The fact that it's a club where you get a tattoo once you join is so gross. The moments that truly made me sick and nothing to do with the actual moments of violence. It's the moments where the guy says to be careful you could spend all your money in there, gross. The moment when the nut job is asking him if he should do it fast or slow, awful. Those were the moments that will leave a knot in your stomach. The joy that these monsters get in torturing people is just awful. I would recommend this film but not for the weak. It really has some gross moments in it and it leaves you feeling very uncomfortable but I still recommend it."

","Hostel has such a brilliant concept for a horror movie. Sadly though, I found the execution to be lacking. It was like sex romp comedy and horror thriller film shoved into one film, with the first part of the film being Porky's, and the second part of the film being Hostel.<br/><br/>I have to say as a woman that I found the constant references to the ""P"" word (a female body part) to be tiring. I felt that the filmmaker was portraying female sexuality in a degrading and sensationalistic manner. Let's face it, the girls in the film were all sluts, but apparently the filmmaker thinks all women are sluts anyway, since they all run around nude in front of strange men and offer their bodies out freely like Halloween candy.<br/><br/>I think Eli Roth is a very cool guy from what I have read about him. I just think he needs to quit making films on the junior high level.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Jay Hernandez really blew me away. He truly carried the film.<br/><br/>Some of the horror scenes were good, but I thought he could have pushed them further. The ending was terrible and anti-climactic. There were too many convenient coincidences used to resolve the story in the 3rd act."

The plot was good enough enough to keep me involved and even applaud the ""hero"" when he dispatches the person responsible for bring him and his friends upon the whole mess, but it still wasn't anything new to me. The ending made we raise my shoulders in a kind of ""what the f*ck"" motion, but overall, it was a good experience for anyone that can stomach the actually small amount of gore and the more common swearing, then I'd totally recommend it.

"siriusanderson","5","0","1","13 January 2006"," A good start, but not enough narrative flesh
","Hostel is filled with a lot of great gore and some OK violence, but it lacks the awesome narrative character building that movies like Evil Dead II, Texas Chainsaw and Halloween have. Yes, the director has a great eye for creating gut wrenching sequences when he finally gets to them, but like other modern horror directors Mr. Roth seems to pay too much attention to effects and fails to create truly horrifying story. Without giving too much of the movie away, I will attempt to explain what I mean. For starters the opening before the gore was much too drawn out. Mr. Roth could have summed most of the opening up in back-story learned when they reach the hostel. The intro might have been more effective and moving if Mr. Roth had focused on the the main characters childhood experience with death and failure. Anyway, with the length of the intro decreased there would have been more time for the meat of the movie to commence. I would have liked to see more character development in the main character, i.e. something more dramatic than what actually occurred in the movie-- wouldn't't it have been more fun if he had started to lose control and go psycho a little sooner than in the last set of scenes in the bathroom! Take for example Ash's character transforming from college lover to insane villain and finally to the 'most' awesome evil butt kicker of horror movie history (except for maybe the father in Exorcist). Hostel has great bloody messes but they are smashed at the end of a narrative that could have been much more terrifying. Gore is great but give me a movie that scares the ever living crap out of me so that I can't sleep at night and I am afraid to look into dark corners a man with no emotions crashing through my closet door bent on killing for no reason is much more horrific than the best special effects gore with a weak and slow plot. Hostel seemed more like a second draft to me rather than a polished final print."

","This is a film that kept me watching, but I never really identified with the protagonists or their dilemma. Although I found myself squirming a number of times, I didn't find myself racked with tension or fear; and, unfortunately, the visual displays of torture were a bit overdone. Suggestion works the imagination much more than graphic-ness. I can't put my finger on it, but I just wasn't put in the characters' place, as a good horror movie will do. The feel of the film is ""nice,"" in the good, gruesome way of good horror films--dark and foreboding. But there is something too familiar about the movie's plot: It tends toward the formulaic and never goes beyond the Puritan shadow cast by Hollywood, which makes it, I'm afraid, unmemorable."

"miraiwhatever","4","0","1","11 January 2006"," Another horror movie that was horrific in quality alone..
","As usual in horror movies, people are really stupid. Roth's characters walked into a situation that was very obviously a set-up, and even when people started disappearing didn't get out of it. They were exceptionally gullible, even for horror movie fodder -- I mean to say characters.<br/><br/>The concept for the film is that three friends are backpacking across Europe, and catch wind of a hostel where exceptionally desperate but hot women will, for free, have sex with anything with a penis. One of them gets hit on by someone that reminded me of a gay Hannibal Lecter, but that's not really important yet.<br/><br/>The first weird situation occurs when, the morning after this fantastic night, one of the three goes missing. They get a text message from him that says ""I go home"". Another guest, a ""Japanese"" girl (generic Asian actress) notices her friend has mysteriously disappeared as well. She then receives a picture message from her friend that has both MissingAsianGirl and MissingStonerGuy in it with a caption of ""We go out"". Both people in the picture have exceptionally lifeless stares, but we'll ignore that.<br/><br/>So there're now two missing people, and what do the token American kids decide to do? Go take more drugs and get completely wasted in a place where there are most definitely people going missing. One guy is abducted and killed, another guy (in his drunken, drugged stupor) accidentally locks himself in a closet. He lives for the evening, but returns to the hostel to find that MissingAsianGirl's friend has vanished and so has his remaining American buddy. Around this time, he's mugged by children and loses his cellphone. Yep, a bunch of kids steal his cellphone from him.<br/><br/>The movie continues to reveal that the guy who let them know about this hostel and the women that seduced them on the first night that they arrived are actually making thousands of dollars by selling tourists to a business that allows people to kill other people. SurvivingAmericanGuy (or SAG, as I'll call him now since I can't remember his actual name) learns this as he follows an obvious trap in order to find his missing friends. After the trap is sprung, SAG is handcuffed to a chair and proceeds to beg for mercy in not one but two languages to the man who begins assaulting the helpless frat boy with scissors and a metal stick. This proceeds to have the man gag SAG, who is now much more tolerable to have in the movie.<br/><br/>SAG has two of his fingers cut off by chainsaw, and that somehow allows him to escape his handcuffs. His assailant slips on a pool of blood and injures himself with the chainsaw, which gives SAG the necessary time to grab a gun and kill the man. Long story short, SAG escapes and finds a change of clothes, where he meets another deranged man who unknowingly explains to him the situation. SAG almost escapes when he starts hearing random outbursts of Japanese. He decides to go back for the girl and try to help her, and ends up killing the maniac he spoke to earlier.<br/><br/>The face of the Japanese girl is quite possibly the most graphic scene gore-wise of the movie. The man had pried one of her eyeballs from its socket, and had used a blowtorch on her face (possibly a reference to Pulp Fiction, since Tarantino produced this work). Here's where I was confused. SAG obviously didn't understand Japanese. My elementary knowledge picked up ""It hurts"" and ""help me"", but somewhere along the lines she must have asked him to cut the dangling eye off. Or not, since she screamed like hell after he did it. Anyway, they escape in a car from the complex with another vehicle in chase.<br/><br/>The movie gets slightly more satisfying at this point. The guy that told them about the hostel and the two girls that seduced the friends are standing in the middle of the road closely together and don't notice the car slowly pull closer to them. SAG notices them though, and he hits them dead on. The chase car (which didn't catch up, despite how fast it was going and how slow SAG was driving before he hit them) runs over the survivors. Later, the kids that stole SAG's phone earlier in the film attempt to block his car's passage through an alleyway. Rather than running them down like he did the other people who wronged him, he bribes them with a bag of candy. A few seconds later, when the chase car comes through slows down and stops as this candy checkpoint when the kids get in their way. However, the kids proceed to bludgeon to death these men (yes, trained killers WITH guns were easily defeated by a group of not more than 10 children).<br/><br/>The end of the movie shows CurrentlySurvivingAsianGirl jumping in front of a train after she sees her horrific reflection in the mirror. This distraction allows SAG to catch a train that gayHannibalLecter (who happened to be the one that killed SAG's friend) happens to be on. SAG takes revenge on him at the next stop, and the movie is over. Hooray.<br/><br/>I really really hated this movie. It was boring as hell and attempted to placate me with topless women, which really only worked but so long. The characters fell for continually more and more obvious traps, to the point that I was sad to see that any of them survived. It attempted to shock and disgust me with images such as people being stabbed or having fingers/toes cut off, but all horror movies nowadays do that and it isn't innovative OR scary. It's kinda sickening, but most horror movie goers won't even be slightly shocked by it.<br/><br/>Avoid this movie like the plague. Don't go to see movies Tarantino produced if he's not writing/directing them himself."
"perdcj1","6","0","1","11 January 2006"," not scary, just really really messed up
","After all the hype and reading Harry Knowles' pretty rave review of this movie, I was relatively excited for it. Not giddy excited like I cant wait, but in anticipation of ""i wonder what this movie has that makes everyone talk about it so much."" Honestly the clincher for me going to see it was an ad I saw that said ""scariest movie in a decade. -AintItCoolNews"". I trust Harry Knowles and his reviews, so I decided, Hey, it must be incredibly worthwhile.<br/><br/>Now I was expecting something absolutely horrifyingly scary. I am NOT a huge horror movie fan, but I've seen quite a few in my day. There have been many movies that have shaken me in my seat, Event Horizon being the one that sticks out most in my mind (only on the big screen though). Even Texas Chainsaw Massacre had moments where you got freaked out and you could feel the tension in your chest.<br/><br/>Let me just say that I was not impressed with this movie. I knew it would be really really messed up, but I thought that would be combined with EXTREMELY tense moments, moments that rip your from your seat and make you look away because you don't want to see what happens next. Hostel had none of that. It was just really, really messed up. The beginning was too cheesy with no drama, then once the drama started, there weren't any ""teeth clenching"" moments. Just moments where you said to yourself ""wow, thats just not right."" I just felt such a strong absence of the marriage of gore and tension. The two go hand in hand, and while you can have extreme tension with no gore, gore does improve it in a horror movie. A movie with no tension but lots of gore just leaves you a little white in the face, not wanting to eat BBQ sandwiches for a week, and emotionally you're disturbed.<br/><br/>Let me clarify what I mean by tension. I Don't mean tension between characters, or emotional tension of an individual. I mean the tension between your psyche and the action on the screen. Those moments when you feel a knot in your chest, and there is a 10 second pause in the movie, where you're left waiting to see when someone will jump out. Those moments where the camera slowly zooms in on someone, and you know something is about to happen. THAT is the tension I am talking about, and the tension that I feel REALLY makes a horror movie what it is; where movies can scare you worse than you've ever been scared in real life.<br/><br/>In summation, this movie was made to 'gross you out' with really really f'ed up scenes. Don't expect a great plot or character dynamics, or even a great ending. If you want to see people die in graphic ways, without clenching your teeth, you can either go to a torture museum, or watch this movie. This is a Gore-or movie, not a Horror movie."

When people were being hurt in this movie, I didn't have a reason to feel bad that they were being tortured. It obviously sucks and is not comfortable, but I didn't have a connection to them to make me hope they got out.<br/><br/>The music choice also bugged me. As they are arriving at their destination to find the hot girls, this music is playing as if it's an adventure. It was something I would have expected in Lord of the Rings or some other great adventure movie as they come up on a beautiful landscape.<br/><br/>I feel that I built this movie up to be something really great and it fell short.

I like a good horror flick, but this film seemed like it didn't really know where to go most of the time and ended up leaving me laughing at the bloodiest scenes that squirming in my seat: Like when Josh was all tied to the chair and was screaming like the bitch he was as he got drilled by the Dutch Businessman all over his body, or the way Paxton ran over the three betrayers in the road (how convenient that they were all standing right there at the time) on his way to the train station. I thought it was outright hilarious that once the Asian chick saw what that dude did to her face with a blowtorch in her reflection at the station that she decided that there was no alternative but to throw herself in front of the train resulting in a very unrealistic, yet very funny blood shower of the people on the platform.

","Hostel is one of the more gruesome movies you will ever see, but it is one of the most effective at displaying a sickening and horrifying desire (fetish? need?) that is more than likely buried deep within a LOT of people. Being 43 myself, these young guys kind of ticked me off at their behavior near the beginning of the movie - backpacking across Europe with only one purpose: hooking up with women. There is a lot of nudity in the movie, but it never felt gratuitous to me. And with all the naked women traipsing around the hostels and spas, it makes this Slovakian city seem like a GREAT place to visit ... until you find out what some of these women are up to. Near the end I was a little bothered that there seemed to be no point to what was happened, but when the shoe dropped I was shocked and horrified. The ending to the film is brutal and shocking. Cabin Fever was a decent movie, but Hostel - I think - vaults director Eli Roth in the category of directors to watch out for. I can't wait to see how his prospective movies The Box, The Bad Seed and Scavenger Hunt turn out."

"neon47","6","0","1","9 January 2006"," Give me gory or give me death (how bout both?).
","As 2006 opens up so does Hostel. I'll say this: what I got was what I expected and at the same time not what I expected. After seeing the preview for it in Saw 2 I figured I had to see it. I also immediately figured that there was going to be a lot of comparisons of Hostel to Saw 2, and that's perfectly understandable. To those who haven't seen this yet: Hostel, in my humble opinion, makes the gore in Saw 2 look like a Walt Diseny movie. This movie is absolutely brutal. The movie in the first half hour however, leads you to believe you're going to be watching another Girls Gone Wild video instead of seeing brutal scenes of torture. The nudity portion of the movie is consistent with the gore portion. Three friends are traveling around Europe looking to get stoned and get laid. After taken in by a guy in Amsterdam they're told about another country where they're going to get laid pretty much for free. They take a train over there and get exactly what they came for. Soon one of their friends disappears, and then another, until we're left with one character (sorry I'm bad with names). Desperate to find out what happened to his friends he goes on a search into a run down building to find that for a price you can do anything you want to anyone. That's the basic summery. Overall the movie is 45min of smoking pot and naked girls, and 55min of torture. The story isn't that strong but keeps the movie going. The scary thing is, is the fact that this is based upon true events. I'd recommend this to horror movie fans, Saw fans, and gore fans (which normally all run in the same category)."

It starts off with three friends that go on a eurotrip to get some chicks and end up being seduced and tricked into being tortured for a local underground exhibit. Its sick. Jay Hernandez's character is the main character who goes in search for his friend (who's already dead) and gets tricked by this prostitute into following her to a human slaughter house where he is kidnapped and literally dragged into a dark torture chamber where he is tied up to a chair and has a gag-ball roughly shoved in his mouth as he is being tortured by having his two fingers chopped off with a chainsaw, as his hands are handcuffed behind the chair.

","Eli Roth's Hostel managed to lull the crowded theater I saw it in asleep before anything of interest took place in the film. Once the movie got going, the characters were so uninteresting, the feeling of conspiracy was so obvious, and the demand for violence and gore was so high that perhaps Roth could never have met those expectations which he himself created. This movie really needed some energy where the filmmakers opted for suspense and failed to deliver. I imagine the people that got the most out of this movie were the ones squeamishly covering their eyes through the torture scenes. At least they were able to fill in the creative gaps in Roth's Hostel with what they thought was happening as opposed to what really was, which, wasn't worth opening your eyes to see in the first place."

Gore, mildly attractive women looking stoned being naked constantly, and the gratuitous use of blood.<br/><br/>I was a fan of the movie, but what got me were two scenes. In one, a character has his Achilles Heels cut, and tries to stand up. (Complete with sound effects.) The other thing that bothered me immensely was another scene in which a young Japanese woman had a blow-torch on her face, and her eye was dislodged from its socket. The main character then proceeded to use surgical scissors to cut her eye from her face.<br/><br/>I wasn't too big on how the movie ended so abruptly, but I did like the way the main character was seeking his revenge on the villain.<br/><br/>In my opinion, wait until the movie moves to a smaller theatre, and bring someone to cling to, because you'll need it."

I give hostel credit for attempting to develop the characters a bit before killing them and I did feel compelled to root for the likable Jay Hernandez but the set up was more lengthy than the goods. The only real strong aspect of this film was the 20,000 tits in the beginning and the jokes in that section but honestly if I wanted to see guys bang foreign chicks I'd see Eurotrip again or rent a porno. And being the most OBSESSIVE Tarantino fan I've encountered, I must say that if i could, I'd take the chainsaw used in this movie and use it to cut his name off of the credits. Oh there was another good part, the car chase scene and I started getting excited during it that the movie was picking up but that was actually the climax."

","Generally speaking, I was disappointed by Hostel because of the lack of connectedness to any of the characters. In order to have a context for the violence, the film would have benefited from some sort of an understanding as to how the victims or aggressors end up in the dark underground world that provides the tension in the film. Of course, too much of an emotional connectedness to the characters may have made the film a little too intense, yet some sense of humanity beyond simple statements of future plans would have provided a context beyond the shock of violence and torture. That being said, the scenes of violence were well crafted and seemed to evoke the desired response in the audience. If movie violence is your thing you may not be disappointed. Do not take these comments as a statement against films with violence as a theme or backdrop, as a fan of Natural Born Killers I get how violence can play a role in a film. As far as Roth's films are concerned, I enjoyed Cabin Fever, but felt like this movie didn't evolve past the violent surface and would recommend it as a rental or matinÃ©e."

","this movie was so weak. It did have some torture, but all of it was shown in the preview. Quintin Tarentino definitely disappointed me. HELLRAISER had a lot more violence and torture. THis movie had more boobs than blood. it was more like a violent porno than a horror movie. What is wrong with Hollywood. EVery movie has to have nudity. what the hell is wrong with us. The internet has enough porno. and the torture was good, but it needed a lot more. the ending seemed more like an action movie than a horror movie. Please make another good movie with violence like KILL BILL volume 1 and 2, Resivor Dogs, etc. Thank you for reading this<br/><br/>a"
"mjbmets730","7","0","1","7 January 2006"," OK movie but a little disappointed
","I was going into this movie to see some blood and guts, but instead i saw a lot of nudity. Don't get me wrong the nudity was good but i wanted to see torture and blood. The movie took a while to heat up and towards the end there were some overdone gory scenes. I found this movie humorous and in the theater i heard more laughs than screams. You can not go into this movie thinking it is going to be be scary, it is a ""horror"" comedy, and by horror i mean gory not scary. Overall i enjoyed the movie but was disappointed because the movie could have been a lot better. There were many unnecessary scenes that just dragged out the movie. You will be disappointed if your expecting a good scare. There are some cool brutal scenes but you have to be patient to see them. The trailer does not do a good job of previewing the movie."
"suspiria10","7","0","2","7 January 2006"," S10 Reviews: Hostel (2005)
","Two American friends and an Icelandic buddy take a backpack tour of Europe before settling down to the rigors of grad school. Their constant pursuit of booze, babes and dope in Amsterdam cross their paths with a local who tells them of a hostel in Slovakia where the women are amazing and do it all. When they get to Slovakia it is everything they had wished for. But when the group starts disappearing it becomes clear that something devious is going on and their little slice of heaven becomes hell.<br/><br/>'Hostel' is a very decent follow-up to the director's debut 'Cabin Fever'. It does take a bit of time before the action really kicks in but one may be distracted by the ample flesh to not take too much notice to it. The ending is nice and sick with a nice amount of gore. There's even a tense bit or two. Solid 'R' rating stuff, thank da man.<br/><br/>S10 Says: Acting: 7 / 10 Direction: 7 / 10 Writing: 6 / 10 Photography: 7 / 10 Production Design: 8 / 10 The Sound: 8 / 10 Music: 7 / 10 Scares / Thrills / the Gore Zone: 8 / 10 Fun Value: 7 / 10 Overall: 7 / 10 Score: 72 / 100"
"kendrickhc03","4","0","4","6 January 2006"," I think I've seen this movie before
","I THINK I'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE!!!!!.... I saw previews for this movie like 5 months ago, and I couldn't wait to see it. I went to go see it tonight and I wish I saved my money to go bowling, cause a 7-10 split is far more suspenseful than anything I saw in this movie. I really want to meet Eli Roth and slap him with an open hand and say Cabin Fever was better. So, seriously if you don't mind wasting money go for it. But, if you like to save your money for something worth while then don't see this movie......!!!!!!!!.. I mean seriously ""Horror"" movies now a days have way to many naked girls and way to many nude men ( I love men but lets all admit, a man's butt is not a beautiful thing). Don't get me wrong there are many funny parts.. but, it's suppose to be a horror. So, good luck."
"squeegyman","7","0","9","5 January 2006"," can a movie make someone ill?
","Rumors are going around, where I come from, that people are literally getting sick and puking IN the theaters because they can't handle the gory scenes in the movie. <br/><br/>I haven't seen it yet, but I'm debating whether I should wait until it comes to video/DVD because I don't want to be there when someone decides to empty their stomachs on my lap.<br/><br/>With a vicious rumor like that going around, I trust people with weaker stomachs will reconsider their plans to see this movie. Sorry if I scared any of you away from the movie, but remember it IS just a rumor. Enjoy!"
