"FlickJunkie-2","8","74","84","7 December 2000"," Unoriginal but hilarious
","Despite the fact that this film is a totally unoriginal and predictable retread of a dozen `losers to winners' sports stories, it is so hysterically funny that I didn't even care.  The story is thin at best.  The NFL is having a players strike and scabs are called in to finish the season.  Our heroes are low on ability but high on desire and peculiarity.  The quarterback, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), once had a promising career, but he fell apart psychologically when his team was pummelled in a college bowl game and he was labelled a player that folds in the big game.  Of course, while visiting the NFL, Shane falls in love with the head cheerleader (Brooke Langton) who never dates players (except of course this once).<br/><br/>All this is merely a mundane excuse for a raucous and silly comedy that has some sidesplitting moments.  To enjoy this film you really need two things. You need to love football and you need to enjoy slapstick, banana peel comedy.  I realize that this limits the audience considerably, but for those who qualify (and I am one), this movie is a scream.<br/><br/>Director Howard Deutch (Pretty in Pink, Grumpier Old Men) did a great job on the football sequences.  He hired 45 professional football players (Former NFL players, Canadian Football League, etc.) to do the football scenes and sent the actors to a three-week football camp.  The action looked real because it was real.  The players were told to play and hit the way they normally would.  Of course, the plays were choreographed, but they were real football plays.<br/><br/>The comedy was lowbrow, outrageous and crass, with a great deal of physical comedy.  The cheerleader scenes were a riot, especially the cheerleader tryouts.  The scene where they started pantomiming sex acts to distract the opposing team was priceless.  There was also sharp-witted football humor that required more than just a passing knowledge of the game.<br/><br/>There isn't much serious that can be said about the acting.  Keanu Reeves tried to play an earnest comeback and romantic role amidst all the foolishness and it really didn't fit with the rest of the film.  However, he was an excellent athlete.  He did most of his own on-field shots and looked very believable as the quarterback.  Gene Hackman was good when he was making snappy wisecracks, but his inspirational `Hoosiers' imitation was misplaced.<br/><br/>This film really belonged to the supporting actors like Orlando Jones (Clifford Franklin), Michael Taliferro and Faizon Love (The Jackson Twins), Ace Yonamine (Jumbo Fumiko), Rhys Ifans (Nigel `The Leg' Gruff) and all the cheerleaders who made the comedy work.  Jon Favreau gets a special mention as the crazy S.W.A.T. officer turned linebacker who took the wild man role to the next level.<br/><br/>This film won't be fun for everyone, but it will have certain people falling off their chairs.  I rated it an 8/10.  Subtract two points if you aren't amused by slapstick and boorish behavior, and another two if you aren't a football fan.  For the rest of you, be prepared to split a gut."
"TxMike","Null","36","43","30 June 2001"," ""There is no tomorrow for you, and that makes you very dangerous people.""
","Those are the words of coach (Hackman) before the final regular season game for the ""replacement"" players, filling in for the striking regulars.  The ""never-been"" QB (Keanu Reeves) must try to lead them to victory.<br/><br/>""The Replacements"" is primarily a good screwball comedy, in the vein of, but significantly better than, ""Best of Show"" and ""The Waterboy."" Some may even take a ""message"" away, about the importance of teamwork, belief in oneself, true love (QB and the head cheerleader). But that is all secondary.<br/><br/>I rate this one highly for pure escapism entertainment, but also with good acting by Reeves and Hackman, and some almost-believable football action, heavily interlaced with goofiness.  The lap-dancers turned cheerleaders, who totally distract the opposing team. The tag-team vomiting during the huddle, after the Japanese sumo wrestler eats too many eggs before the game (""I gotta beef up!"") The cop who, like in the ""Waterboy"", can get enraged (Coach says, ""I want you to get me the ball,"" and he does.) The Welsh kicker who is ""wirr-rrry strong"" and smokes a cigarette while kicking. The ""I will survive"" dance in jail, after the barroom brawl with the 'regulars.'<br/><br/>To make a good screwball comedy, the writer and director have to walk a fine line and here they do it well.  John Madden and Pat Summerall, playing announcers, are genuinely funny. The DVD picture, and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound, are up to standards."
"wrygrass","10","45","55","30 July 2000"," Expected storyline, but completely unexpected hilarity
","To work, comedy has to be unexpected. And that is just what makes ""The Replacements"" work so well. Oh, not that the storyline is unexpected, for from it. But the actual comedy embedded in that plot is often delightfully quirky and quite unusual in this extremely good-natured and entertaining film. The very first scene, for example, takes place in a completely unexpected setting and proceeds in a really odd-ball way.<br/><br/>As it is most times, Keanu Reeves acting is subtle.  In this film you have to watch those eyes that are so eloquent when he's discouraged and listen to those little expelled breaths that convey so well (and so humorously) his state of mind when he's near the girl he's finds attractive.  It's all there, and more, if you watch closely.  Reeves is completely believable as a man who needs a second chance to do something he loves--play football. It's like he's a different person on and off the field--and that's exactly what the movie was trying to convey.  The development (redemption is only too slightly strong a word) of Reeves' character is excellently portrayed. That struggle to overcome provides a good solid center around which all the hilarity revolves and becomes funnier in contrast.<br/><br/>Gene Hackman and the rest of this ensemble cast did a great job--everyone has his or her moments.  If the movie has a weakness, it's the romance. Not that Brook Langton and Reeves aren't good in the clinches--they have a definite chemistry. But it seems like there should have just been one scene between them with some real substance.<br/><br/>""The Replacements"" also succeeds well as a football movie.  The great photography and sound; the inventiveness of the script in dreaming up unusual and funny, yet still plausible, game events; and the evident attention to training for and depicting the physical moves, all add up to a movie which sports fans will relish. And yet, the football plays, are presented so clearly that even someone who's not a knowledgeable football fan can understand everything that's happening, even the first time.<br/><br/>Comedy is tough--it's quite an achievement to have folks in the theater laughing for most of two hours. And that's certainly what the audience did when I saw ""The Replacements."" As well as cheering out loud for the ""home team,"" clapping at the end, and coming out feeling like dancing to ""I Will Survive"" like they did in the movie.  As well as feeling like we can survive and be ourselves--just like those scrappy, eccentric replacements."
"Tynne","8","46","57","21 January 2001"," Entertainment for the fun of it
","This movie was made purely for entertainment.  What a breath of fresh air. With all the extremely dramatic, be it important, films being made lately (Life is Beautiful,etc), it's nice to watch a film that is just entertaining.  The supporting cast was amazing, as an ensemble they worked together as a team should.  And Keanu Reeves gave a wonderful performance - he is often under appreciated as an actor because he is attractive - but he gave a solid performance.  Gene Hackman was good - that goes without saying, but I think this is the first time I've ever seen him portray a character I actually liked.<br/><br/>If you enjoy a good laugh, this a movie you would likely enjoy."
"IslesLaz","8","32","40","11 August 2000"," Take it for what it is
","It's a sportsmovie. It's got every sports cliche in the book: ""I look at you and see two men. The man you are and the man you ought to be."" But, hell, who cares? It's the Major League of football movies. Sure, it's not gonna win an Oscar, but it's entertaining. A good movie to kill 2 hours. You want drama in a football movie, check out Any Given Sunday. You want fun, mindless entertainment, check this out. Props to Keanu Reeves for learning to throw like a genuine quarterback."
"Pinky-7","10","34","43","14 August 2000"," Great movie!
","I have to admit, my boyfriend had to drag me to this movie, and I went along with it, telling myself that at the very least I could spend the next couple of hours admiring Keanu's cuteness, even if he isn't the best actor. BOY was I suprised! This was a really funny, really sweet movie that made me laugh and laugh. Keanu's acting was better than I've ever seen, the supporting cast did a GREAT job. I go to a LOT of movies, and it has been a long while since I've seen a movie that i enjoyed this much, so I really encourage you to give it a try."
"Theoriginaltruebrit","Null","32","41","13 July 2002"," Brilliant, fuzzy, feel good movie.
","I haven't bothered watching professional football since Joe Montana retired but this movie got me interested again.  While I can appreciate the comments of other reviewers that it is a formula movie and has many inaccuracies when it comes to the football action it is pure and unadulterated fun.  The bottom line is this movie is downright funny, from start to finish.  The cast are absolutely wonderful and the casting director did a brilliant job of bringing this gang together.  Gene Hackman of course is perfect as the coach.... ""I'll pull you off the field you spoiled son of a bitch"".... Rhys Ifans absolute perfection as Gruff (after a **** you remark from Jimbo) ""You'll have to find your dick first Shamu"", to the shoot em up bros from the hood, to ""get me the ball, get me the ball""  The acting was absolutely wonderful in this movie.  I have to admit I didn't like the guy that played Martell but perhaps that's because I wasn't supposed to like him, perhaps it shows what a good job he did.  And Keanu, dear, sweet, so maligned Keanu, I read a reviewer once who said of Keanu's acting that it is ""almost transparent"" and in this movie it is, he doesn't eat scenery he just does his job, low key, perfectly in character, and for those who know anything at all about acting all you have to do is watch his eyes.  He has a Harrison Ford like quality of being able to express a wealth of emotions with his eyes and in this movie he pulls it off perfectly.  I also read somewhere that during the making of this movie it was discovered that Keanu really did have ""an arm"" and at one point threw a 69 yard pass.  I have seen this movie in excess of 20 times and will no doubt see it 20 more times, it is the best feel-good movie I have ever seen.  When I want drama and suspense I will watch ""The Green Mile"" when I want simple, comedy that just leaves me with a huge grin I will watch the replacements.  Oh yeah and I just want to kiss the person who put Keanu in a No. 16 uniform *S*"
"lizettemejia98","10","42","57","27 July 2000"," A must see laugh a minute movie, that make you feel good!!
","This is one of those movies that you'll pick to go see for a few reasons. Gene Hackman, Keanu Reeves (Wow), football, babes,& yada yada. I went to see a sneak preview, so it didn't really matter to me if it was going to be good, because I didn't have to pay for it. Well, I would pay to see it again!! Not only is this movie beyond funny, real funny, the story is terrific, acting wonderfully strong , the dialogue so real, and it leaves you wanting more. Gene Hackman can do anything, so him playing a coach, and choosing him for the role was right on the mark. Keanu Reeves, what can I say. He's so easy on the eyes. ALL you want to do is watch him play the role as quarterback, (as if he was one), and enjoy looking at him being ""FALCO"". The chemistry between him and Annabell is so cute & mushy. It's a movie for anyone who wants to laugh, is rooting for the under dog, likes football or not, or who just wants to go to a movie and be completely entertained!! W.B. has truly captured what it is we all go to the movie for. I can guarantee you, when you see this movie, not only will you walk out wanting to see it again, but you'll tell anyone you know, to go see it and have a BLAST!! This movie is a winner!"

"stevie7","9","30","40","10 August 2000"," Replacements ROCKS
","""The Replacements"" is more than an ""it does for football what ""Major League"" did for baseball"" kind of movie.  ""Replacements"" is funnier than that film, for one thing. It's more in the league of ""Slapshot"" with Gene Hackman providing the weight that Paul Newman brought to that film. Also, like the hockey scenes in ""Slapshot,"" the actual football sequences are really bone crunching. While there is a lot to look at in ""Replacements,"" like Keanu Reeves (who is also really good in this role, playing it for drama amid all the wackiness) getting the hell beat out of him, or like the replacement cheerleaders carted in from local strip clubs to really get the fans pumped for the game (is this what the XFL is going to be like?), this movie works as more than all that stuff.  More than the sum of it's parts, as they say. ""Replacements"" has a good heart. Bottom line, I'm going to see it again."

","It is about time they put out a movie that you can watch just to feel good about something and have a good laugh. The last movie that was close to this was ""Major League"" which this was very similar to, but there were some aspects that made this better. It was the most unique roll I have ever seen Gene Hackman in and it was a very refreshing one at that. Even the music set the tone perfectly. You will love the closing, naturally I do not want to give it away but the music in the closing scene of the movie was just perfect in setting the mood and emotion. I could watch it over and over.<br/><br/>Thumbs up on this one guys!!!!!!"
"grace_bunch","Null","13","17","13 September 2003"," Pain heals, Chicks dig scars, Glory last forever
","The Replacements works good as a Comedy and as a good drama fight for the underdog.  The humor really made me chuckle a few times.  It's not knee-slapping, but there might be some fanny-smacking clowning around. Orlando Jones contributes to a large portion of this humor.  Brooke Langton really knows how to make a guy smile, and feel good about himself, and does an excellent job as the female attraction.<br/><br/>Gene Hackman and Keanu Reeves really work well together, and you get a feeling that they could really be pals.  I like Reeves in almost every movie he's made.  He comes cross quiet, and very cool, but a force to be reckoned with, and this is one of those times like the Matrix's, ""Point Break"", ""Hardball"", ""Speed"" or even ""A Walk in the Clouds"".  And on top of that, Keanu is also Ted the goof in the Bill & Ted's Adventures.  This shows what a versatile actor Keanu is, and that he has a good sense of comic timing.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that no matter how many times I've seen it, if I come by the TV and find it on, I just must sit down and watch it one more time.  You'll just have to watch for yourself.  I'll bet you come away with a feeling like this movie has ""heart"".<br/><br/>The most quoted line in any movie is probably when Shane Falco tells his ""Win one for the Gipper"" speeches and says ""Pain heals, Chicks dig scars, but Glory last forever""."
"acedj","8","4","4","12 February 2020"," Do you hear footsteps Falco?
","Based on the NFL strike in the 80s, the Replacements is a movie of a bunch of people that missed their chance to play in the NFL getting to do that as replacement players or scabs. Keanu Reeves stars as quaterback Shane ""footsteps"" Falco, Gene Hackman is a master in his role of the coahc Jimmy McGinty. The rest of the cast is very well done as well from Jon Favreau as the over excited defensive player to Rhys Ifans as Nigel ""the leg"" Gruff the kicker. Almost every actor seems born to play the role they have. The team, led by Falco starts off rough but soon finds their groove and become a force. It all comes down to the last regular season game and the announcement that the players and the NFL have come to a deal. Will Falco finish the season with the team he built, or will he bow out?<br/><br/>Really nothing new here for plot devices, but this movie is hilarious. It gets both thematic elements correct though. The drama is good when it needs to be and the comedy is well above par when needed."
"jasminn_tan","8","4","4","12 December 2019"," Hilarious Team Of Replacements!
","I thought this would be another one of those serious and dramatic sports movies but I'm so glad that it isn't. I laughed out loud so much that my sibling had to ask me if I was alright. The replacements were a mixed bag of people who only had 4 games to play and they weren't funny individually but together, they were a riot. The dynamics between the team members were so varied, which made this into such a fun movie. Plus, they were united by 2 things in common: they played football and Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves) was an incredible leader. It was so fun to watch these strangers grow close to each other as they gained respect for one another, so they could win the game. And of course the underdogs won!"
"Shiva-11","7","9","12","9 August 2000"," The best football movie of the summer...
","The Replacements: Professional football takes a turn for the bizarre when the players go out on strike - rather than suspend the season, the owner of the Washington Sentinels asks his coach to cobble together a team of replacement players to carry on.<br/><br/>Football on the big screen has been approached from almost every conceivable angle: humorous (""The Longest Yard""), love story (""All the Right Moves""), sport as metaphor for life (""Any Given Sunday"") and pathos (""North Dallas Forty"") are but a few examples.   Essentially a composite of all the above, ""The Replacements"", is loosely based on facts - the fictional Sentinels represent the Washington Redskins whose replacement players did quite well - the NFL however would not allow the film to use the name of any real teams).<br/><br/>If I remember correctly, (keep in mind that I'm not a sports fan and it was a long time ago) the NFL strike of 1987 was due to player dissatisfaction with the salary cap and the subject of free agents.   The utter ludicrousness of multimillionaire sports figures pleading poverty is summed up in an interview with the striking quarterback for the Sentinels who says ""Well $5 million might sound like a lot of money, but I have to give 10% to my agent."" Just then a colleague pipes up ""And do you know how much it costs to ensure a Ferrari?!?""   The frightening thing is that some players actually believe this stuff.<br/><br/>Reeves, not known for his dramatic flair, is believable as Shane Falco (it is after all Reeves' third outing as a gridiron grappler), a forgotten quarterback who blew a promising career with one bad game .   Brook Langton, Reeves' love interest, is gutsy, subdued, and cute, but not obnoxiously so and. reminded me of a young Lauren Holly (before she became bitter.).  The supporting cast does an excellent job, but I particularly enjoyed the casting of John Madden and Pat Summerall whose officiating lends an air of realism to the proceedings.<br/><br/>I do however have two misgivings about the movie: the trailer I saw this evening gives away some of the best parts of the movie (a trend that I've noticed is getting worse) and what is the preoccupation with football players vomiting (it played a role in ""Any Given Sunday"")- I don't find it particularly amusing.<br/><br/>That said, , ""The  Replacements"" is uncomplicated, funny, and takes a few well aimed shots at professional sports.  I recommend it to anyone in search of some light entertainment - just don't pay full price."
"ijonesiii","8","6","8","24 November 2005"," Hackman's Presence Again Raises the Bar
","In the tradition of SLAPSHOT and THE LONGEST YARD, THE REPLACEMENTS was a charming and laugh-out loud sports film about a group of scabs for an on strike, fictional pro football team brought together by a long out of work coach (Gene Hackman) and long ago disgraced quarterback (Keanu Reeves) coaxed into a comeback. There's nothing new or original here and the film is, for the most part, pretty predictable, but what makes the film special is the presence of Gene Hackman and the stylish professionalism he brings to the role of Jimmy McGinty. Hackman underplays the role so beautifully and allows the over the top performances by Jon Favreau and Orlando Jones among others, to shine in the appropriate moments without ever allowing himself to be pushed in the background. Hackman is so adept at doing this that you don't even see him doing it. The casting of Hackman as Jimmy McGinty was a stroke of genius because it brought an element of class and charm that would have otherwise have been missing and made this just another slapstick sports comedy, but Hackman's presence and charisma takes the film to a more quality level."

","...then why do I keep on returning to it ? I've seen it on TV a couple of years ago. Then one month ago , looking through Reeves' filmography, I remembered it. Bought the DVD, and just can't stop re-watching it rather often. and I wonder why...it's not only the soundtrack. not only the clichés. not only the oh-so-predictable plot. actually, if one has seen a few sports movies , already knows the whole plot/action/scenes in advance... maybe it's the simple and enjoyable fun... OK, not the most intelligent type of humor, but at least it's got its moments... and the whole cast is just too fit for the movie. <br/><br/>a good antidote against the everyday problems of life. at least in this movie somebody gets a second chance. <br/><br/>it's not intelligent, but sure is entertaining."

","I had never heard of this movie before I saw it. Maybe something to do with the fact that Movies about American Football hardly ever reach UK cinemas. I bought an American DVD copy and think it's the most entertaining comedy I have seen in years. The usual story of the underdogs who must defeat the best team.(You can guess the rest.)The fast flowing humour as well as plenty of action makes this a must see for anyone. Not being  biased in anyway, I think rising Welsh star Rhys Ifans puts in an excellent performance as Gruff and I loved the humour about the character he plays being Welsh. It's about time the U.S adknowledged the fact that the U.K makes up 4 countries and is not just England!!! The rest of the cast is excellent too, the performance of the movie has to go to John Favreau who totally steals the show as the crazy SWAT team leader who floors anyone that's in his way. Orlando Jones makes an impressive and very funny performance. Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman are the credited as the main stars, however the supporting cast in my opinion provided all of the laughs.<br/><br/>You have to see this film, If I haven't convinced you yet, try this, I think American Football is the most boring, stupid, and idiotic game ever invented.(They only kick it occasionally, so why is it called Football?)

Filled with misfits, mavericks and rejects, this team is led by Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman). No points for guessing how this story unfolds.<br/><br/>Though formulaic, ""The Replacements"" is fast, funny and never pretends to be anything other than popcorn.

","The Replacements has been criticized for not being entirely accurate when it comes to football. That's not the point of this film though. It wasn't made to be an Oscar contender. It was made for sports fans who want to see a fun story and laugh while watching it. The Replacements delivers on both these aspects. <br/><br/>The story's backdrop is a strike among the professional football players with four games left in the season. Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) is brought in to coach the Washington Sentinels and bring in a group of replacement players to finish out the season. The unconventional McGinty picks players that others might not have deemed NFL worthy. The list includes: wide receiver Clifford Franklin (Orlando Jones), linebacker Daniel Bateman (Jon Favreau), kicker Nigel Gruff (Rhys Ifans), and quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves). <br/><br/>Most of the players McGinty picks haven't played football in awhile, but he believes that they have something the spoiled professionals don't, which is heart. The film goes on to tell the story of these replacement players and their fight to get into the playoffs. The players have to come to terms with their fears and learn to trust each other in order to do this. And they have their cheerleading squad, led by Falco's love interest Annabelle Farrell (Brooke Langton), to help them do this. <br/><br/>Shane Falco leads the squad in a way that isn't classy or inspirational, because that just wouldn't be their style. And that is the style of the film. It doesn't go out with the aim to be a story that will move you to tears, except maybe through laughter. The film is one to watch when looking for a light hearted story that offers some laughs."
"HelenMary","7","4","6","10 July 2013"," Fun, feel good and predictable, with miles and miles of heart
","I don't know much about American Football, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of this film. Whilst it is primarily a sporting comedy - and there's a lot of laughs - it also has some serious point and Gene Hackman's presence adds gravitas. Apparently Reeves took a substantial play cut to get Hackman in the film and there's good chemistry (father/son) between the two. Reeves plays the film for drama and character and does a good job, bringing his famed physicality and dedication to character with incredibly dry humour (lovely comedy timing when he gets grass in his grill). The majority of the laughs come from the antics of the rest of the team, especially Rhys Ifans as the ""wiry"" Welsh chain smoking kicker, and Jon Favreau the SWAT team psychopath! Great physical comedy and for an adult film with a high-school peer pressure feel, it's suitable for young adults with not too much bad language and the love interest doesn't resort to explicit bedroom antics despite having a Hollywood leading man. Reeves was well cast - quiet, a commanding presence and perfectly happy throwing himself around. Gene Hackman of course was brilliant, dry and witty and the perfect coach to a bunch of wannabe, has been, washed up ""scab"" football players called in during a players strike. Brooke Langton (head cheerleader Annabelle Farrell) was really convincing and sweet. All great performances and despite it being predictable and a little cheesy it's great feel-good watching. Hey where else do you see Keanu singing Gloria Gaynor's I will survive and doing the electric slide??"

The funny and goofy Washington Teams of Replacement players are funny yet deep inside the movie Gene Hackman (the coach)and Kuene Reeves(Falco) go very deep into their characters and provide us a glimpse of what a 2nd chance can do to a man. Together the quick humor and the deep inner story of a coach and the player he gave another chance to will make u laugh and think at the same time. To anyone who does not want to watch this movie because it appears to be a goofy comedy, actually it is a great sports movie about 2nd chances."
"hcalderon1","10","2","3","17 April 2005"," The best football comedy around
","My head was up and down with laughter while watching this movie. This movie was inspired off real events. It begins when famous football players go on strike, and it is up to Jimmy McGinty(Gene Hackman) to put together a new team of players to continue the football season. He gets Shane Falco(Keanu Reeves) a washed up quarterback in hopes to lead the team to victory. But the problem is there are a bunch of misfits, and putting them together as a team is not going to be easy. I like this movie next to Wildcats. It has awesome football scenes, as well as great laughs. The movie is a good classic in its own wright. If you are a big football fan I suggest watching this movie."

","Shane ""Footsteps"" Falco is a disillusioned football player who believes his dreams have all but dissipated. Once a red-hot All American prospect, Shane now regrets ever believing that the NFL would draft him. However, fate takes a strange twist for Shane when during the 1997 NFL season, a player's strike leaves the fields (and stadiums) empty, leaving team owners scrambling to fill uniforms as fast as possible. When the Washington Sentinels bring back the contentious and self-retired head coach Jimmy McGinty to seek out players who will play with their hearts rather than their wallets, he picks Shane to lead his mismatched crew of outsiders through the strike. To everyone's surprise, the ragtag team goes on an unprecedented winning streak as they discover in themselves the ability to hope for more than they ever thought possible...maybe even the playoffs, which has been denied to the Sentinels for seven years.

Langton is fetching as Keanu's sometimes girlfriend. Credibility of film survives despite usual hokey Hollywood on-field action. Can't the ""technical advisers"" for football movies EVER say ""Gee, that wouldn't happen in a real game""? Apparently not, but forgiven here because of the charm of the cast.

","Actually trying to write a review of this movie would be pointless -- we've all seen this exact same movie made dozens of times before. The underdog team of misfits, rallies together, plays with heart, overcomes the odds, bonds etc. etc. etc. Its a giant cliché.<br/><br/>But you know what? Its a cliché done well this time. There's nothing original here, but this is one of those times, as in The Longest Yard or Major League, where it actually works. Maybe its the superior cast. Maybe its the great chemistry between the male and female leads. But for whatever reason, this movie grows on you. Even after predictable element after predictable element comes wandering on by, its just hard not to like the film and get sucked in. Its just a light feel good film with its heart in the right place -- I felt stupid for being manipulated by the oldest tricks in the book, but when I let go of the cynicism for a moment, The Replacements brought a smile to my face."
"tributarystu","4","2","3","30 April 2003"," Conventional
","I usually have a bad predisposition to movies which have as a central point American football. Let me be straight forward: I don't like it and the movies about it usually suck big time. ""The Replacements"" did get a chance just for the interesting actors...and because of one more fact. This whole sport can't be serious. At least I don't want to see it being serious if serious means Any Given Sunday-eyes flying on the field. To present a pretty serious problem in a comedy seems all right in this case. If it only weren't so conventional and unspectacular.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>The story is a total miss. Everything so predictable, everything so obvious and...simple. Not only the story but the characters too. There's nothing more to them than one sees in their introductory scenes. A convict here, a cop there, a sumo wrestler next to them and you've got the whole picture. All there is to them are their ""professions"". Everything is like a big window: you can see very clearly through it. <br/><br/>Actually all there is to this movie is ""the soul"". Something which Any Given Sunday most certainly didn't have. Something which can support a whole movie filled with boring and forseeable things. This movie most certainly isn't great but it's ok. Unlike AGS. Sorry, I just have to keep comparing it with that movie, because it's the most recent one I've seen which regards the same subject. <br/><br/>The actors are...well, actors. Nothing very special too them and nobody impresses. It keeps being nice though to see funny faces. So, as a final conclusion: watch this if you really don't have anything much better to do...or if you want to hear some smart things and maybe learn what stands before what. As in heart before money...but hey, that's something we all know. Right? Probably a 6.5/10 Take it as you want."

","This movie was hilarious. It had drama, romance, comedy, and a little action thrown in. I saw it twice in the movie theater, and both times I found myself laughing uncontrollably. The whole audience was laughing. One guy in the audience was laughing so hard that I thought he would pee in his pants! My stomach hurt after the movie because I was laughing so much. It may not have the deepest message in the world, but it did have a good message. No matter how many disadvantages you have, you can still succeed. And like Gene Hackman said, ""You know what separates the winner from the losers? Getting back on that horse after you've been kicked off."" I also love the romance and Brooke and Keanu's relationship in the movie. It didn't show them in bed or anything. Instead, Keanu was a bit shy around her at first. I thought the whole love story thing was really romantic. The whole cast was great and the music rocked also.=)"

The film treads with minimal success into romance, can't quite conjure up the goose bumps the climax aims for, and doesn't work in the philosophical with it's clichés about winners and losers.

It is a simple movie, but don't be `off-guard' by that because the movie is very entertaining. It stars Keanu Reeves as the scab quarterback and Gene Hackman as the motivating coach. However, what `sweeped' me to my feet was the comedic performances of some of the supporting players such as Jon Favreau and Rhys Ifans.  Their performances were of `first-string' caliber.

"jhclues","9","2","3","11 September 2000"," Keanu Scores Big Time
","When professional football players go on strike, the owners decide to continue on with the season by putting together teams made up of the best players they can find.  The owner of the Seattle franchise, O'Neil (Jack Warden), hires former coach McGinty (Gene Hackman) to take charge and field a team that can take them to the playoffs which, with four games left, is within their grasp.  `The Replacements,' directed by Howard Deutch, are guys whose careers had been cut short or sidelined for one reason or another, and now because of the strike are given a rare opportunity in the life of an athlete:  A second chance.  But it's more than just a shot at the brass ring; it's a chance to heal, to shed the stigma of loss, failure and disappointment they've all carried with them, in one way or another, since their playing days abruptly and prematurely ended.  For quarterback Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), it's being able to shake the memory of a grueling forty-five point defeat in the Sugar Bowl, which has seemingly defined him since, plaguing him even during his very brief pro career.<br/><br/>	Reeves does a great job with Falco, convincingly conveying the discontent lying buried beneath the surface of this man who has had to move on with his life, though unable to tie up the loose ends with which he obviously has yet to come to terms.  And it's that lack of closure, that intangible feeling clinging on to his soul that makes Falco such a strong character; there's something in his situation that most people have experienced, to one degree or another, whether it's a sense of failure or alienation one may have suffered, that makes him someone with whom you can readily identify.  It's what lies at the core of the story, and through Reeves' performance and Deutch's direction it becomes easily accessible, and it's one of the strengths of the film.  This movie, after all, is about so much more than football; it's about character and spirit and, as McGinty says at one point, heart.  And that's what makes these guys play like there is no tomorrow. Because for them there is no tomorrow; once the strike is over, who knows what will happen?  For now they have today, and for many of them just being shuck of `yesterday' is enough to give them new life. <br/><br/>	Especially memorable in supporting roles are Jon Favreau (Bateman), Rhys Ifans (Gruff), Orlando Jones (Franklin) and Brooke Langton (Annabelle). Rounding out the cast are Brett Cullen (Martel), Faizon Love (J. Jackson), Michael Taliferro (A. Jackson) and Ace Yonamine (Fumiko).  While the movie fails to avoid stereotypes altogether (O'Neil), Hackman, as McGinty, is the absolute epitome of the `coach,' and `The Replacements' is entertaining and uplifting while putting the game into perspective and making a statement about greed and human nature.  There are moments in this film that are not so much predictable as inevitable, but the climactic game will have you on the edge of your seat; it ain't over till it's over.  In the end, you realize that it doesn't really matter who wins or loses, because you'll come away feeling maybe a little bit better about yourself and life in general; and call it what you will, that seems like a pretty good deal to me.  I rate this one 9/10."

","This film is actually quite amazing in two ways.  First, there is the use of the cliche.  I wracked my brain trying to think of some sports movie cliche that they missed using, but could not think of a one.  The ""team of misfits"", the evil professionals who refuse to accept them, the ""hidden talents"", the ""soccer kicker who would be a great football player"", the love interest that has nothing to do with the story, the fickle fans, and even the classic bar fight.  They are all here.  In fact they are the entire story.  Just take every sports movie cliche you can think of, toss them in a hat, and dump them on the ground.  Instant script.<br/><br/>The other amazing thing about this movie is it's predictability.  It's common that you'll be watching a movie and have a good idea of what is going to happen next.  In this movie, you always know everything that is going to happen.  The script telegraphs every move.  Don't expect to be surprised, it won't happen.<br/><br/>What's really strange is that you will enjoy watching this movie.  The antics are funny, the cast is wacky, and the cheerleaders are fun.  Don't expect to be surprised by anything other than this fact and you'll walk away happy you saw The Replacements."

","I just watched the Replacements and I have to say that I was disappointed because there really was nothing new here. If you have seen 'Necessary Roughness' with Scott Bakula, then you know what the quarterback is basically all about and the head coach. If you have seen 'Major League' (I know, baseball, but conceptually the plot is similar) then you understand the bringing together of varying personalities and working through those relationships. Also, if you have seen 'Hoosiers', you may be very disappointed in Gene Hackman. The entire time I was waiting for Norman Dale to come out and start driving the players with toughness. Instead, he was near a smile almost the entire time and appeared to be more ready to give someone a hug than to raise his voice meaningfully. I enjoyed all three of those movies but they were all their own movies. 'The Replacements' seems to want to take the best of all three, combine them, and make something. It didn't work for me."

","The Replacements is the kind of movie they should be showing in film school. We can all look at Chinatown, Don't Look Now, Witness, Bringing Up Baby, Tokyo Monogatari, ET, Tootsie or Crimson Tide and see why they work well. It would be more of a challenge to take a heap of dung like The Replacements and say, ""Right, fix that."" They ticked off all the boxes; a reluctant hero steps up for one final chance at glory and redemption. Mentored by a grizzly old coach, supported by a wacky but loyal group of peers, he battles adversity, wins the game, and gets the girl. It could be Major League with more heart, or Bull Durham with more laughs.<br/><br/>Except it doesn't work. It isn't funny (I felt for Gene Hackman trying to wring a laugh out of mis-pronouncing 'wiry', I just wanted to go up and pat him on the back, say 'never mind, mate', buy him a beer...), and there is zero drama. The prison dance routine to 'I Will Survive' probably takes the prize for worst scene of all. I think they tried for a pastiche, aiming at camp, but it is just... so bad. It is like watching one of those cabaret circuit stand-up comics dying slowly on stage, determined to make it through his routine despite the rising indifference of the audience. This is an absolute train-crash, bombed out horror of a movie, a real lesson in 'How Not To.' It does for the sports genre what Wing Commander did for sci-fi. I hope someone one day gets to record Hackman answering the question ""Why?"". The other actors can at least say, ""I wanted to work with Gene Hackman."" What on earth is his excuse?"

","I'll be honest and say that until I read some reviews on here, I didn't realise that this was supposed to be a comedy. I will also qualify this review by admitting that I have no interest in American football and am not familiar with the game, rules, history or teams.<br/><br/>I am, however, familiar with the formulaic story of a bunch of sporting misfits come good under the guidance of an inspirational coach (Hackman) - having seen it repeated seemingly a dozen times. The truly talented player who missed out on the big-time (Reeves) is able to clarify what is really needed to the other meatheads in the team. I'm sure you can see where this is leading.<br/><br/>This 'comedy' brings nothing new to the table and makes the support cast even more irritating and unlikeable than usual vehicles of this type. The cheerleaders are gruesome and (obviously) too stupid to spell out the name of team they're cheerleading (is that a verb?) for.<br/><br/>The head cheerleader (and waitress/bartender) loves footbaall but doesn't date players (unless it's Keanu Reeves) in the same way that the waitress never dates pilots/soldiers/political advisors blah blah. The prolonged gaze they share across the bar is as close as the movie gets to comedy - and I suspect that that was unintentional.<br/><br/>And a special word for John Favreau, who as everyone knows, has gone on to excel in all fields of movie-making. This is one of the most stupid and annoying characters ever to have inhabited a sporting movie. Ifans comes a close second.<br/><br/>All in all, its all been done before - and a lot better. There's a lot of shouting, a lot of pointing, a lot of shouting 'let's go' and commentators amazed at the things they are witnessing on the field.

Nothing inspired ever happens, even the football scenes aren't very exciting, and then the film ends up with a finale about professionals and their love of money over the game that is so out of place and oh-so-self-righteous in a bad way that I wanted to slap the writer.

","Once in a while a little film comes along that gets panned by critics and instantly disappears into the dust. Then it pops up on TV and becomes a favorite with a lot of viewers.<br/><br/>I managed to not even notice the 2000 release of The Replacements - it came and went that quickly. But I did catch it on cable recently and found that while it does follow the usual clichés of sports/comedy movies - inspirational coach, washed up player becomes the hero, romantic sub-plot - it has some very very funny moments, and overall, is an extremely enjoyable film. I've talked to other people who have all said, ""Oh yeah, I loved that movie, really funny."" I won't rehash plot and details - there's too many other reviews that have done that already. What makes this movie fun to watch are the truly goofy, off the wall scenes that you don't find in other sports movies - loved the jailhouse line dancing scene - the memorable characters and their interaction with each other, and the bone crunching game sequences. The comic characters don't seem cartooney, like they did in Major League. They play off each other and seem like slightly broader versions of real people. The out-of-shape chain-smoking Scotsman with the kicking leg of steel, the sumo wrestler, the ex-con, the cop with anger issues, the butterfingered comedian - they are goofy and hilarious, but at the same time completely believable.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves' stoic face and delivery works to great effect here - he is a guy who has repressed a lot of fear and humiliation, but responds to the looseness and friendship of his teammates. Gene Hackman, who of course is always great, plays it perfectly. He has the clichéd role of the inspirational coach, but he always has a twinkle in his eye, like he appreciates both the absurdity of his job and the issues that have kept all his players from achieving success in the past.<br/><br/>This is a very fun film that - surprisingly - actually delves into some deeper issues. What keeps us from becoming successful if we have all the tools? How do we regain will to succeed, inner drive and belief in ourselves once we have lost it? What makes a team a team? It is to this film's credit that these underlying themes don't keep it from being entertaining and laugh out loud funny at times.<br/><br/>If you know and love football, you will enjoy this movie."

","I think it's pretty obvious you don't have to choose The Replacements if you're interested in seeing a unique and/or innovating cinema experience. The Replacements perfectly delivers what you expect...A good hour and a half of pure fun and laughs. It's a delightful little comedy with decent acting performances, hilarious situations and terrific quote material. The film uses all the typical clichés and about every character is stereotypical, but maybe that's the charm of it all. We get to see a textbook Sumo-wrestler, a blond cheerleader who can't even spell right and even the vulgar Welsh guy who smokes and curses on the field. The script is so utterly predictable and the feel-good message is shoved down your throat shamelessly, but still you can't resist to keep watching. There's a terrific light-hearted atmosphere hanging around the entire movie and sometimes, that's just all it takes to be satisfied with a movie. Keanu Reeves is a heck of lot more watchable in these type of comedies than he is as an action hero and Gene Hackman is great as usual. Even though he's clearly directing on automatic pilot, he never fails to impress. There are also good side roles by Jon Favreau, Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans and even Art LaFleur ( it's been a while since I last saw him ).Naturally, the good guys win from the arrogant bullies, the development of the love-story was unavoidable as well and the use of typical Football-songs - like Rock 'N Roll part 2 - bring a smile to your face.

","The Replacements (2000): Dir: Howard Deutch / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Orlando Jones, Brooke Langton, Jon Favreau: Same old junk with a different paint job. It suggests ignorance on behalf of those whom the team will eventually prove wrong. Gene Hackman plays a football coach who decides to assemble a team of players who have dropped out of sight. There is a football strike and he views this as an opportunity for others to shed their light. Among these are a maniac cop, a convict, a gambler who can kick, two big black bar bouncers, a sumo wrestler, etc. Keanu Reeves is sought after as a quarterback. He served a nasty defeat but Hackman still sees potential. Recycled and dreary with director Howard Deutch doing his best but after making The Odd Couple 2 he needs all the help he can muster. He also directed Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful (which doesn't describe this film). Hackman is wasted as the coach who will whip these players into shape. Orlando Jones is far too talented to be stuck in a film that requires no thought. Brooke Langton's role is obvious in that she is basically a romantic prop. While Varsity Blues made this same sort of film entertaining and funny, here is a film so deserving to be toss onto a football field so that it might be stumped on by every single player. The screenplay is in bad need of replacing. Score: 2 / 10"

","Dear sweet lord, i didn't think a movie could be so devoid of anything reedeeming.  Between the horrible acting performance turned in by Keanu ""Whoa"" Reeves and the blandest, most predictable plot line ever, the Replacements does not entertain for a single solitary second.  It is unbelievable that with such a rehashed, recycled plot, that the writer/director could still manages to leave so many flaws in the film. Rule # 1 if you are going to write a film about football, at least know some rules, at one point in this abomination of a film the Washington Sentinels need to retrieve an onside kick to stay alive, of course they in fact do this and they advance the ball forward: NFL rule the kicking team can not advance the ball if they recover it on an onside kick.  Directly after this Shane Falco, yes the quarterback is on the field on an onside kick, tackles his own man and then calls a timeout: NFL rule the clock stop after the return man is tackled.  These are just a few mistakes to harp on, but i wanted to point out that the basis for this film is football at least the director could know the rules.  The football flaws pale in comparison to the atroscious characters in this film.  Every single characater in the entire movie is a stereotype, example Orlando Jones character is the incredibly fast guy with no hands, ala Little Giants, there's the drunkard, smoking, welsh kicker who is scrawny but still a badass, there are of course some of the gansta african americans, a sumo wrestler!, the religious nice guy who only wants to catch one touchdown, and low and behold he catches it and shatter his knee on the play, it brings a tear to my eye.  I gurantee if this idea was given to a drunk, semi retarded monkey he could of in fact produced a far more original, believable, and entertaining film than the nimrods who came up with this horrendous ""comedy"".  The only thing slightly comedic in this whole film was the fact that an esteemed actor like Gene Hackman would agree to taked this role.  0/10 the worst movie ever.  If you like football don't see it, if you like Keanu Reeves don't see it, If you like sports drama don't see it, if you like comedies don't see it, if you like movies in general don't see it, if you like performing mystery science theatre over a pile of crap film, by all means see it."

The replacements have a thin story, which may have been done many times before, only this time, was done better, it is clearly, the best football movie ever. It is very fun, you will certainly laugh at it, and it's also interesting, because the characters all of them have depth, all of them have a cause to fight for.

And mind-numbingly-stereotypical might be the summary on this turkey. Take a moment and consider every possible sports cliché you can. Got 'em all? No? Well, the makers of ""The Replacements"" left no cliché stone unturned, believe you me - capped off with the most inane rah-rah speech ever put to celluloid (voiced soullessly by what-the-hell-am-I-doing-here Gene Hackman). By now you're gettin' that I didn't appreciate this thing, and maybe you're wondering ""well, what about Keanu?""<br/><br/>Yeah, what about Keanu? Here's a hint: Remember what Mark Hamill did between ""Star Wars"" movies? <br/><br/>For a film trumpeting the merits of second chances, Keanu clearly takes a colossal bite out of his at the Hollywood A-List (having secured it of course, with ""The Matrix"", he is in full ""Johnny Mnemonic"" mode here). Of course, with two more ""Matrix"" movies on the way, Keanu can quietly cash his check and move on. It makes one wonder though, that this is the same bloke in ""Little Buddha"". Maybe the guy does have some acting range after all.<br/><br/>Incidentally, the only saving grace maybe, was Jon Favreau as the bull-in-the-china-shop sack machine, even though he reminded me of what's-his-name from the ""Police Academy"" series. <br/><br/>Steer clear, men.

I kind of lost interest when the ""sumo"" player threw up in the huddle (we couldn't see it coming when he was stuffing himself with boiled eggs before the game, could we?). Keanu Reeves should be able to make a decent name for himself as soon as he takes a couple of acting lessons.

With end Jon Favreau, running back, Orlando Bloom, and head cheerleader, Brook Langdon, they are the little team that could. <br/><br/>As his team tries to develop into players, the NFL prima donna players who walked off the job over money taunt Falco for his ""never was"" status. Brett Cullen is the striking QB who taunts Falco, while his team mates accidentally sack him as well. Poor Falco can't win for trying, but the lovely cheer leader rubs his bruises with sweet potato lotion and everything is better. Comedy abounds in this film with lap dancing cheerleaders from the Pussykat Klub who can't spell the team's name during cheers, and wonderful running jokes with Favreau (Bateman) and Hackman (McGinty) as the coach who needs him to get the ball. Whether line dancing to ""I Will Survive"" or smooching during the final play, this is a great family and Saturday afternoon film for anyone who finds the ritual and riot of professional football simply beyond comprehension."

(Dir: Howard Deutch) Sports comedies have always been a staple in the genre:<br/><br/>Baseball both professional (`Major League') and pee-wee (`The Bad News Bears'), ice hockey both professional (`Slap Shot') and pee-wee (`The Mighty Ducks') and the one sport that seems to stand apart, football, both professional (`The Longest Yard', `North Dallas Forty', `Necessary Roughness' and the climactic game in `M*A*S*H') and pee-wee (`Wildcats').  In the latest, familiar yet pleasantly amusing, neither are on display.<br/><br/>The eponymous characters are scab football players assembled in the wake of  professional football players strike and centering on the fictitious team of The Washington Sentinels where its team owner (Warden) re-hires an old crony of his, Jimmy McGinty (erstwhile actor Hackman having a ball here), who assembles a ragtag assortment of athletic questionability under his own terms for the remaining four games of the regular season. McGinty recruits the rawest possible motley crew including a street-wise shop clerk/ running back (Jones of tv's `MAD TV'),  a slightly demented cop/defensive tackle (Favreau in a ridiculously funny overkill with mad dog ferocity), a convicted felon/wide receiver (Jace), a deaf receiver (Denman), a sumo wrestler/noseguard (Yonamine), gangsta rapper bodyguards/defensive ends (Taliferro and Love) and Welsh soccer star/indebted gambling pub owner/kicker (Ifans, best known as Hugh Grant's scruffy roomie in `Notting Hill'). Heading the pack to glory is quarterback Shane Falco (Reeves), a former glory boy whose career to the big time was sidelined by a disastrous Sugar Bowl that everyone and his brother apparently saw witness to his debacle.  Falco has the most to lose as McGinty takes him under his wing and providing a lot of pep talk to have his one token of good luck to enlist the unlikely team to victory. Also on hand is the head cheerleader Annabelle Farrell (Langton, a hot-looking newcomer who comes across nicely in her scenes with Reeves) that catches Falco's eye and heart and proves to be his biggest supporter and self-confidence booster.  She has her hands full in auditioning her own assortment of misfits, largely exotic lap dancers showcasing their scandalous off-side and holding penalties of their own. The film is a pleasant surprise in such a hoary genre leading to The Big Game and the stock villain, this time the real football team on strike and causing trouble for the regular guys taking their places.  But Reeves comes across as an amiable leader, often taking pause before going into action which is what all quarterbacks should have in spades : confidence and durability to get the job done.  His teammates may lack in presentation but definitely have what Hackman calls `heart' that rings across the hi-jinks ensuing. Ifans steals the show as the chain-smoking (even on the field) place kicker Nigel Gruff and Jones has a stand-out scene incorporating Gloria Gaynor's girls-only (until now) anthem `I Will Survive' in a prison's holding cell after a bar brawl that becomes the team's signature. Written by Vince McKewin with great characters intermingling and some nice rock music choices by director Howard Deutch (including The Rolling Stones and Bachman Turner Overdrive to name two) for the bone-crunching high adrenalized game sequences, the comedy mirrors its protagonists dilemma: making you forget their predecessors by sitting back and enjoying the show."

The movie is quite cute, and very well done.  I am generally not that big on Gene Hackman (he's a good actor I just don't always care for his films) but was pleased by the light air of amusement he brought to the role.  Keanu Reeves may not be the world's most expressive actor (and being a guy I don't worry about whether he's ""cute"" or not) but he just seems to fit the bill a lot of the time.  Anthony Hopkins is a tremendous actor, but that doesn't mean he'd make a good quarterback (well, you never know with him), but Keanu Reeves just plays it quite naturally, athletes can often be a little stiff, especially one who is slightly alienated.  The supporting cast was great, and each brought that little bit of zeal to their role instead of resting on the laurels of being famous.  Think of this, how many successful movies made stars instead of used them (In a word Star Wars).  This has light comedy, an undertone about the snobbish attitudes of modern athletes, without worrying about any kind of specific finger (all the teams are fictional).  It had classy humour (no fart gags and other crass things meant to be humour) and not-so-classy humor for those who need that sort of thing (in a word, Cheerleaders).  So overall you didn't come away a greater person for the effort but really, all that matters is did it entertain and did you come out a HAPPIER person."
"HulkVader","8","1","2","15 September 2000"," Pleasantly surprised
","I'm skeptical of most sports movies, most are clichÃ©d and unoriginal. But The Replacements soon had me laughing, and it kept me laughing throughout the entire movie. Keanu Reeves is normally a terrible actor, but this was, by far, his best performance (though that's no great feat). Brooke Langton was simply radiant; beautiful, smart, and sexy. The supporting cast was very good, especially the fellow who plays the Welsh kicker, he provides the best comic moments. I also like the fact that there was no reference to any existing NFL teams. All the team names were generic. A nice touch. All in all, this one should have you laughing a lot."

","OK, normally I'm the person who complains about too many cliches or lack of originality in movies, but I really enjoyed this one. Maybe it was because absolutely everyone else in the theater was laughing. Maybe it was because my friend was almost in tears laughing. Whatever it was, I was almost rolling on the floor during some scenes. Keanu Reeves' performance wasn't groundbreaking or anything; in fact, it was kind of dull. Gene Hackman was the typical ""I love you guys but I'm ready to kick your butts if I need to"" coach. All the supporting people were typical sports movie cliches. But it all just worked!! I especially loved Orlando Jones as the fumbling receiver. I never knew that a movie about football, one of my least favorite sports, could be this good!"

","Okay, enough has been said about how this is a typical sports movie.  For someone looking for a feel-good flick in a multiplex full of blood, gore, psychotics, cheerleaders and geriatric adventures, this movie was a winner. As the wife in a married couple who doesn't normally enjoy spectator sports, I can honestly say that you don't have to be an NFL fan to enjoy this movie. Keanu and Gene's performances seemed effortless and I think I caught them actually enjoying their jobs. The addition of some new faces was a good move, and the chemistry, like the story, felt as though it was building naturally until the very end.<br/><br/>

Or that pale prisoner in Bram Stoker's Dracula making it big in a sci-fi movie about something called The Matrix.  Believe it when you see it, because Keanu makes one great football hero.<br/><br/>After a humiliating loss at a past Sugar Bowl game, Shane Falco is a retired quarterback recruited by coach McGintey (Gene Hackman)to finish out the season for the Washington Sentinels, whose ""real"" players have gone on strike.  Shane winds up leading a ragtag team, which includes Jon Favreau, of Swingers and Orlando Jones, of ""Make Seven, Up Yours.""  Shane also falls for the bartender/head cheerleader (Brooke Langton).  <br/><br/>What strikes me about this movie is how sweet it is.  It is genuine filmmaking that's entertaining and romantic.  Reeves has a great rapport with Hackman and his teammates and a good chemistry with Langton.

There is not a streak of realism, the jokes are lame, and the characters are simply caricatures of old sports stereotypes.<br/><br/>The premise is so flawed. Does anyone really believe the on-strike multimillionaire players would hang out in the parking lot like high school thugs on the playground? And the director couldn't even get the basics correct (the team starts its first drive ever on the twenty yard line, gets two delay of game penalties, and we then see the ball marked on the EIGHT yard line). Picky, I know.<br/><br/>Bull Durham and Caddyshack are funny sports movies. Varsity Blues at least had realistic football imagery. The Replacements, on the other hand, is for the brain dead masses.

Sure, the plot and motifs were predictable, some of the jokes were overdone, and Keanu Reeves as quarterback Shane Falco was as wooden as Pinocchio's stunt double, but the key word here is ""entertaining.""  Much of the enjoyable parts of the movie came from the replacement players and their antics.  For instance, Jon Favreau was hysterical as an ex-cop who charged at everything red...a far cry from his role as Eric the Clown on ""Seinfeld.""  Gene Hackman and Jack Warden played their roles well as the respective owner and coach of the Washington Sentinels, but both their roles left you asking ""Where have I seen this before?""  The same could be said about Brooke Langton, but I'm sure most men watching the movie would have no qualms about seeing her on a repeated basis."

But there were a few highlights - notably a very funny dance sequence (you'll know what i mean).

I love this versatile young actor Keanu Reeves, and looking very closely at him I see a lot of wonderful and promising newness. He has a flair that I find very refreshing and in this movie it show the shyness and humbleness that is just not seen in the movie industry any longer.

Not since Nutty Professor II, American Pie, and even South Park (big screen version), have I laughed so hard, numerous scenes were very well written and the timing was dead center, making them down right hysterical!; Not to mention classic elements of sorrow, love, regret, and triumph all were intertwined into one great story that the whole family will love.

A standard Hollywood story of a pack of underdogs, packed with locker room humor and cute, strippers-turned-cheerleaders girls - perfect recipe for a rainy summer evening. Well, come to think of it the story isn't that standard (don't worry, you'll still have the girls and the jokes). The underdogs - they stay underdogs, they don't get litesabers or turn out to be some crack team of Australian football players. So you don't get one of these hard-to-believe Hollywood plots, as in dozens of other sport movies. It's ain't your dad's Dirty Dozen, not even Madden's Dirty Dozen. As it saz in the movie, the guys really have no tomorrow - they are there just as the replacement players, so they might as well just have some fun. Did they? I dunno. I did.

Keanu Reeves is, of all things, believable too, and even drops his usual Valley Girl accent. I never thought I'd see him actually tone down his presence for a role - maybe he spent some time watching Hackman perform. Anyhow, the two play off each other beautifully. And as for one critic's sour ""you won't need to take the blue pill to forget you've seen this"" remark, I don't think I will ever forget the sight of the entire replacement team, including three members built like sumo wrestlers, do a not-quite-synchronised electric boogaloo while singing ""I Will Survive"" in a police lock-up following a brawl with the striking ""real"" players.

This guy is so dedicated to his craft and really makes a realistic 'Quarterback Hunk' in my opinion.  He's FALCOTASTIC!!<br/><br/>According to the DVD special features it really was him out there making the plays and getting 'hit' as well.  GO FALCO!!<br/><br/>I also love the ensemble cast and they are really great characters and you can tell they had fun making this movie.  I especially love ORLANDO JONES as 'Clifford Franklin'.  He has a great talent for comedy and mostly improvised.<br/><br/>The DVD of this movie is first rate and highly recommended.  The soundtrack is excellent too, so go and buy...<br/><br/>GOOD WORK MR DEUTCH!"
"barnyard","Null","1","2","17 December 2000"," A Movie with Heart
","I've seen this film now three times. I am not a football fan, but if any film would ever make into one, this would be it. I've read most of the other comments on ""The Replacements"" on IMDb, and the prevelant theme is ""unoriginal"". OK, I agree somewhat- the plot of ""losers to winners"" has been done before ad nauseum. It's a sports movie, not a documentry, and given it is a comedy, with a ""feel good"" theme, the plot has to be generic.<br/><br/>
So what?<br/><br/>The plot merely exists to allow a series of gags to be set up. They are made that much more hilarious by the absolute charm of all the characters. Keanu Reeves is perfect, and I came away from this film with new respect for the skill with which he brings off his role. Shane Falco is a leader with heart, and to make the audience beleive that, the actor has to have heart too.<br/><br/>
When I saw ""The Replacements"" for the first time in August (in a real theatre), I was struck by two things: first, how it delivers on every level on the same turf that ""Any Given Sunday"" failed, and second, why this film did not do well at the box office.<br/><br/>Professional sports should not be taken too seriously. It is, after all, a form of paid entertainment. ""The Replacements"" reminds us that if the players are not having fun, how can the fans? ""Any Given Sunday"" took itself as seriously as a Viet Nam War film. I wonder why?<br/><br/>I don't know why ""The Replacements"" failed at the box office. Keanu Reeves still, aparently, does not have the box office clout to carry a film. ""The Matrix"" succeeded because it was a classic and people recognised that. It was not a star vehicle. ""The Replacements"" is an ensemble film that, I think, should appeal to a more mature audience. Unfortunately, most film goers in the summer are kids. I suspect that marketing is the major reason why this film did not make the $200 million plus it richly deserved.<br/><br/>
It is a very special film indeed that conveys the feeling that the actors had an absolute ball making it. I'd like to say ""thank you"" to Howard Deutch and his Gridiron Dirty Dozen. What a blast!"
"wodandieus","10","1","2","16 December 2000"," There are great movies and then there are Great movies.
","There are great movies and then there are Great movies. Some movies are really good, at the end you say to yourself, That was a great movie.  And then there are those movies, maybe one in a thousand, that at the end you think, man I want to watch that again, and not in a month or even tomorrow, but right now.  Keanu sure does pick winners these days. I havent smiled so much in a long time, and not ""boy that was funny"" smiling, though there was a lot of that, but true feel good smiles, It's been a while since I've seen Gene Hackman play a good guy role, good to see him in an role that lets him show that the Everyman can be inspired to greatness. Director Howard Deutch, who brought us Some kind of wonderful, and Pretty in Pink, truely knows how to touch that place inside us that makes us human, something that can care for more than ""what do I get out of this"".  I am surprised that this movie has not done far better in the ratings, but I suppose the fact that it is a ""sports movie"" somewhat limits it.   Also it is nice to see a soundtrack that fits perfectly, as David Bowie's song say's, We all can be heroes, if just for one day."
"jennifer-99","7","1","2","15 December 2000"," Cheesy and Predictable.....but fun
","So what if I had the entire plot of the movie figured out before I even had the box at the checkout counter at the local video store.  Who cares if every line of dialogue was as cliche as it gets.  This movie is still fun, enjoyable and worth a few laughs even though it won't win any awards for originality.  <br/><br/>In an age filled with unnecessarily crude and often violent comedies, this relatively wholesome football movie is a welcome and refreshing change.  I have no problem admitting that I enjoyed this movie and found myself submitting to laughter on several occasions. <br/><br/>This is not to say that the movie is without faults.  I have never been a big fan of Keanu Reeves' work, and here he did nothing to gain my approval. This actor has to be the most wooden and uninspired performer of my generation.  He injected such little emotion into his character that it appeared someone was holing a gun to his head to make this film.  The rest of the cast worked well together with the characters played by Jon Favreau and Rhys Ifans turning in quite amusing performances. <br/><br/>
And let's not even get started on all the glaring football errors.  I watched the film with a devout football follower and every 2 minutes he was yelling something at the screen about 5 yard penalties and players removing their helmets in the huddle.  Even I, a novice fan, know that the pro season doesn't finish on Thanksgiving Thursday.  And what kind of football fans cheer the replacement players and boo their returning star quarterback....I don't think so!  Not even Hollywood can make that one fly.  The film would have fell together more effectively if screenwriter McKewin had more than just a passing knowledge of the game.  <br/><br/>In spite of its' faults, and the large serving of cheese, this film is surprisingly watchable and worthy of a rental on a night when there's nothing good on the tube."
"czhower","3","2","7","17 August 2000"," Copy of Necessary Roughness

"bronty","1","2","7","14 August 2000"," The sound of one hand clapping
","How's THIS for originality: a down-on-his-luck team owner recruits a bunch of 'wacky' and 'lovable' losers and misfits (are there any other kind?) who 'miraculously' band together and not only make a team...they make (sniff) a family. But since this a ""man's"" movie, full of p**s-n-vinegar (yeah, they wish!), they're not supposed to be so much of a family as a bunch o' buddies, lest anyone accuse them of being weak (hell, no!) or pansies (god forbid!) In the annals (for the illiterate, that has nothing to do with anyone's butt) of cinema, there have been a good number of sports-themed comedies: ""Bull Durham"", ""Slap Shot"", ""The Bad News Bears"", just to name a few, and while they, too, may hardly have been original, they at least WERE what comedies are SUPPOSED TO BE: funny. In the course of nearly two hours, there wasn't a single honest-to-goodness laugh. Hell, there wasn't even a moment that brought a grin! The hard part (other than why this was made in the first place) is where to lay the blame; the possibilities are endless. Let's start with Keanu Reeves: there's a reason why he's in not featured in too many comedies and that reason is the guy just ain't funny. And let's face facts: he can't act. Here, he is comatose, expressionless, with line readings that can only be called robotic. And do YOU see HIM as a quarterback? Talk about miscast! Next is the writing - no cliche is left unturned: will the former quarterback (Reeves) join the team? will he fall in love with the token female in the movie? will there a be a character who is hard-drinkin' and a wise-ass? will there be a sensitive moment when the coach tells the quarterback that he's the only one who really loves the game? I could spend hours telling of every overworked theme that's made its way into the movie; the sad part is that that would still be more entertaining than this dreck. And how 'bout those supproting players...not only do you get THREE - count 'em: THREE! - blubbery fat guys (numerous shots of their bulging bellies - isn't that funny?), but two are black and the other's Japanese, which provides countless laffs as they bounce racial slurs back and forth. Boy, there hasn't been THIS level of hilarity since the OJ trial! And, fresh from his annoying 7-Up commercials, Orlando Jones is featured in a role that is, essentially, ""the girly-boy"": not only does he hide during the inevitable barroom fight scene, but he's also pretty fond of ""I Will Survive""; still, to prove he's ""all man"", the filmmakers provide a few shots of him dancing suggestively with some blonde floozy. (Minus the dirty dancing, it could easily be Stepin Fetchit.) Jon Favreau portrays a the kind of character usually given a name like Killer or Meat: the snarling - but wacky-n-lovable! - he-beast. He is, in one word, an embarrassment. Not for a single moment is he believable. The worst fate is reserved for Gene Hackman, who is slumming here; he performs every scene lackadaisically, as if his heart just ain't in it. I certainly hope he was paid handsomely. I certainly hope it was worth it. Continuing to put the blame where it belongs, special mention must be made of the director, Howard Deutch, a man who hasn't helmed a worthwhile film other than ""Grumpier Old Men""; as with his other attempts at directing, this film is jumbled and at times incoherent - often, it's downright confusing as to just where this film is going (answer: nowhere) and what he's trying to say (the only clear message we get is this: rich=bad, poor=good, exemplified by the cartoonish pro players who go on strike to earn more millions and the even-more-cartoonish scabs who make up this motley crew whom we're supposed to be rooting for). Whole scenes go absolutely nowhere, a problem not exactly helped by editing that appears to have been handled by someone blind wielding a garden shears; numerous, useless shots seem thrown in blindly to pad an already-too-long movie. And then there's the photography: this is one UGLY looking film! I think there was an attempt to give the film a somewhat 'gritty' look but it serves only to make all involved seem vaguely unwashed. No, they look - well - skanky. (Which I suppose is only fitting for a story about a bunch of losers.) Keanu comes off the worst: either he's gettin' a little long-in-the-tooth or it just looks that way; throughout the entire affair, it appears he's just come off a long, long bender. Which might be a pretty good idea, now that I think about it; maybe if I had a few stiff drinks I could forget I wasted my energy on this c**p."
"sddavis63","2","2","7","2 June 2001"," Too Bad The Actors Didn't Go On Strike
","I think that Gene Hackman is a fine actor. How anyone convinced him to get involved with this turkey is beyond me.<br/><br/>When I heard about this movie I actually thought that a movie based - even loosely, as this one definitely is - on the NFL players strike of a few years ago might be interesting. I still do. It's just that this one wasn't. The thing played out like a comic book, full of characters who I'm sure insulted the integrity of those who were the real replacement players a few years back - and I haven't even mentioned the strippers who took over as cheerleaders? (This was a part of the strike I must have missed!). There were a handful of humourous moments, but nothing really uproarious (except perhaps the ""we're the guards"" shoot-up outside the stadium, as replacement players and strikers confronted each other.) The movie was marred even more by a boringly predictable plot, with an ending that was telegraphed at least an hour before the movie came to an end.<br/><br/>The best I can come up with for this one is a 2/10."
"Movie-12","1","2","8","29 July 2001"," Absolutely awful--what are these big stars doing in this trash heap. 1/2* (out of four)
","THE REPLACEMENTS / (2000) 1/2* (out of four)<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>I have always thought professional sports players make way too much money for what they do.  I hoped ""The Replacements"" would make a strong statement about their greed and selfishness. ""You're being paid to play,"" a coach explains to his replacement team, ""and I want you to remember that, because the men whose places you've taken forgot that a long time ago."" With dialogue like that, we can explore a funny, biting satire about a social issue. <br/><br/>""The Replacements"" isn't the movie I was hoping for and it does not make a stand on greed or anything else. It's a poorly constructed, shamelessly contrived sports comedy/drama/romance about how a football team can win a big game. It's also about love. The main star, Keanu Reeves, who has done much better than this, falls for a less than charming cheerleader/bar owner. We learn this in one of the film's first sequences, where the two love birds stare into each other's eyes as boastful romantic music explodes on the soundtrack. This is the kind of movie where the music sets the tone for the scene instead of the scene setting the tone for the music. Without the music, this movie would not have any tone. Not that the music makes much difference. It still has no tone. <br/><br/>It's difficult making a decent sports movie because it must involve the audiences in the story both on and off the field. Oliver Stone could not even do it successfully in ""Any Given Sunday,"" but he did a lot better than this. Howard Deutch (""The Odd Couple II"") does not stand a chance with this sheepish, cheap screenplay by Vince McKewin. The movie does not even know about the technical aspects of football. Although I would not know a football from a bowling ball, here are a few factual errors the fine folks at the Internet Movie Database discovered:<br/><br/>路 The team has to hire new cheerleaders when the players go on strike, presumably because the cheerleaders are unionized as well. However, we never see any cheerleaders on the players' picket lines.<br/><br/>路 Falco leaves the team when Martel crosses the picket-line, but most NFL teams carry at least two but usually three quarterbacks in case of injury--Falco would only move to second string, and it would be the second or third string quarterback cut.<br/><br/>路 According to NFL regulations, a quarterback (or any other player) is not permitted to remove their helmet in the huddle. Falco does this several times throughout the movie.<br/><br/>路 During an extra point attempt, the clock is running. In real football, the clock is stopped during extra point attempts.<br/><br/>Gene Hackman gives the movie it's only light as veteran coach Jimmy McGinty. His team, the Washington Sentinels, must win three of their last four games to make the professional football playoffs. A player's strike occurs; those greedy SOB's want more money, as if five million a year isn't quite enough to cover the cost of agents, layers, and insurance on Ferraris. McGinty agrees to hire replacement players. ""They've all played football somewhere, not all of them in the pros. But they all have something unique to bring to the game. We're gonna take those people and try to put together a winning team. If nothing else, they should be fun to watch,"" he explains.<br/><br/>
Scene after scene, ""The Replacements"" proves itself incompetent and foolish. The scenes jump between angry players, romantic struggles, and football games. The film spews much unfitting humor into the mix. In once scene, a woman recklessly drives through oncoming traffic at high speeds. This is a contrived, recycled visual joke that isn't developed or expanded upon. It didn't work in ""Speed 2: Cruise Control"" and it doesn't work here. ""The Replacements"" also attempts for laughs through the cheer leading team. This is also a shallow sight gag; it does not advance the plot nor does it cover an important niche. There's even a running joke where the football players sing and dance to a popular alternative music number. It makes you wonder what you did to deserve such painful torture. <br/><br/>I have been reviewing movies for over five years now. I write four to five film critiques per week-many negative. Even after doing this for so long, and sitting through so many terrible motion pictures, it still deeply discourages me to screen a movie as bad as ""The Replacements,"" when I know this kind of material has potential. I not only feel sorry for the unfortunate viewers who sit through this junk, but also for the filmmakers whereas it takes a lot of time and effort to make a movie, regardless of how bad. This was a waste of their time as well. <br/><br/>I question why actors like Reeves and especially Hackman would accept such roles. In one scene, a character states:  ""I've seen monkey-s**t fights at the zoo that are more organized than this."" One could also say the same thing about this movie."
"kris-124","1","2","8","1 April 2001"," Bad Beyond Belief: An artistically and morally repugnant film
","Let me preface my remarks by saying I am a huge sports fan and an aficionado of the sports film genre... therein lies the problem... I can't see ANY virtue in a film that attempts to glorify the untalented scabs who were ""replacement players"" during the 1987 National Football League players' strike, one of the sorriest chapters in the history of a sport full of sorry chapters when it comes to employee relations.<br/><br/>Do we see anything about how labour unions protect the benefits of workers who suffer debilitating injuries on the job -- certainly a reality in a brutal game like football?  No - instead we see the self-absorbed millionaire QB, all to make 'The Replacements' all the more endearing and lovable. <br/><br/>Pretty much every scene in the film betrays the director and producer's complete lack of knowledge about the sport (particularly so during the scene where the Washington Sentinels recover an onside kick - uh, you can't advance the ball after recovering it). And cheerleaders don't have unions, so the scenes of Annabelle (Brooke Langton) auditioning for replacement pom-pom girls didn't serve any interest except to laugh at people who don't conform to some Hollywood-homogenized standard of beauty.<br/><br/>Bear Bryant is probably spinning in his grave after seeing Gene Hackman imitate his coaching attire, although Hackman manages to come out of this with his dignity intact, no mean feat. Honestly, both people who enjoyed Rodney Dangerfield's ""Ladybugs"" can breathe easy, because we have new undisputed champeen for Worst Sports Film Ever."

","This story is based on Tony Robinson, a star UT Vol quarterback who's off the field exploits landed him in jail following a great college career. During the NFL strike of '87 he engineered one of the greatest sports upsets of all time by leading the Redskins to a 13-7 victory against the Cowboys, who had already returned they're star players to the field. It was a big deal at the time not only because of the upset, but because Tony Robinson was a black quarterback in the NFL at a time when you hardly ever saw black QB's. Of course, the Skins won the Super Bowl that same year with Doug Williams at QB, the first black QB to play in the big game. However, Hollywood whitewashed this story like it does with so many by casting a very white Keanu Reeves to play the role. If this was a movie about replacement surfers, Keanu would be perfect. However in this stinker, he's horrible. This could have been a great comedy with a light hearted inspirational tale. Trust me on this, it's not."

","The story is pretty much the same as many other sports comedy movies, which are about the long shot at beating the overwhelming odds and pressure while at the same time uniting a very differentiated team. The romance angle is nicely put just as the sweetener and didn't go influencing the bigger story so much, despite the usual victory kiss. What makes this movie very interesting for me is that Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, and even Brooke Langton are not necessarily comedians, though they play the lead and significant roles in this movie. The backing by the seasoned comedy actors like Orlando Jones nicely completes the comedic angle that the movie needs."

","Pretty interesting story about second handed rugby team. BUT, most interesting fact is that team wasn't professional rugby players, but people who were in jail, just a normal people who work their job, like in good old days of amateur sport. Since first team got in strike, they had to somehow continue their championship. Like always, every beginning is hard, they had to meet each others better. They were always fighting and arguing about nothing, but when they met each others better, realize that they got lots of stuff in common, they started playing better and better. But they weren't normal rugby players, they were amateurs, people who work their job and play sport for fun, that is strange in sport of 21th century, isn't it ? Nowadays sport is all about money, there's no more joy or anything more, money, money, money. Well those people didn't care for money, they played for fun and they actually reached something. They reached play-off for their team. At the end they weren't been stalking by commericalist for signing contact for some sneakers or anything else, they just celebrated it and went to their home. They all reached some experience that they will remember for whole their life, that movie should be an example of how sport should be nowadays...<br/><br/>The scene i liked the most is this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxe-5lJ6R6o&feature=endscreen.

","Jimmy (Gene Hackman) has been offered a less than stellar job. Its the late eighties and the professional football league's players are on strike. It will be Jimmy's job, if he accepts it, to coach a crew of ""scab players"" for a team called the Washingon Sentinels. Unconventional anyway, Jimmy signs on, but, only on the promise that he will be given total control from the owner (Jack Warden). It is so. From there, Jimmy starts to assemble a team, which includes a once promising quarterback, Shane (Keanu Reeves), a Welsh kicker (Rhys Ifans), a slow-witted-but-mighty tackle (Jon Favreau) and so on. Jim evens gets a lineman who resembles a sumo wrestler. Naturally, the players are pelted with eggs when there bus arrives at the stadium and doom is predicted. Even the regular cheerleaders honor the strike, so the new leader (Brooke Langton), has to recruit her own squad, picking ladies from the local strip parlor, since no one else can dance. So, it begins. Before long, the Sentinels are doing well, surprising even John Madden and Pat Somerall, who cover the games. Also, Shane has eyes for the head cheerleader but she is a tough sell. However, the lady may protest too much. Then, too, rumors abounds about the return of the official players. How will this rough-and-tumble season go? This adorable film is a champion in the realm of sports films and BEYOND. It is very, very funny, from the cheerleader who can't spell to the footballer (Favreau) who can run folks over but has to have strategies explained numerous times. If you are looking for a demeanor elevator, this one is first rate. Its also very honest in its look at the world of football, romance, and human nature in general. Kudos to all responsible. As for the cast, this is definitely one of Reeves' best movies. He is strikingly handsome, humorous and turns up the heat in the kissing scenes. Whew. Hackman, Warden, Orlando Jones, Langton, Favreau, Ifans and ALL of the others do superior work as well. In fact, they are all too comical for words. Also fine are the costumes, sets (Reeves lives on a houseboat), script and go-for-broke direction. Turn off the daily rerun offerings and replace them with a showing of this great flick.

The football moments were very entertaining in and of themselves, although Hollywood had to inject the usual amount of unreal scenarios (come on... a 65 yard field goal!). Still, the action moved well, and having Madden and Summerall was a good touch. As far as the comedy, the entire film was well paced and the ensemble was filled with great performances (Jon Favreau, Orlando Jones, even Gene Hackman showed some comic timing).

","A football team (Washington Sentinels) owned by that guy from Problem Child (the grandfather) goes on strike, so the owner must replace the coach and players with new players. The coach (Gene Hackman) picks a lineup that excels in every way, a group he's had his eye on for quite some time (which really makes no sense if you think about it and realize where he's picking people from, but ignore that).<br/><br/>I think there's nothing about the plot an the ""twists"" that aren't completely predictable. I've seen many movies like this before and probably will again in the future. The only difference here was the cast.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves delivered a less than stellar performance. He has been known to have good roles (I really enjoyed ""The Lake House""), but he is also known as a really bad actor, and this role really added to the latter. Gene Hackman is a final actor, and was fine in this role... unfortunately it didn't require him to do much besides wear a suit and hat that were forty years out of date.<br/><br/>The cheerleaders were, well, decent. Many people have said the cheerleaders are ""hot"" (and are supposed to be because of some of the questionable scenes and the fact they're playing ex-strippers). I don't know. The head cheerleader was attractive in a motherly way and one of the cheerleaders was remarkable, but overall they were bland or looked like mental patients. If you're into the ""dumb blonde"" thing, maybe they're for you. Personally, I think they could have been written out entirely.<br/><br/>The team (besides Reeves) was perfect. The Welsh kicker was interesting and made me want to rent ""Trainspotting"", the Chinese guy was hilarious in his quest to gain more weight. He also set up John Madden for his only good line in the film about a ""Fat guy dance"". (Seriously, does anyone really need to see more John Madden?) The x-con was alright. Orlando Jones had a weak backstory, but he's a goofball actor and is given too much screen time in all his films (please stop giving him roles).<br/><br/>Overall, a patterned film that was entertaining but not really one that stands out. I'd even rather watch ""Varsity Blues"" if I wanted a football film. This one has heart, but unfortunately lacks originality."

(Along with the token law breaker who has jut gotten out of prison.)  They all fall into typical movie stereotypes.  Yawn.  Add that to the token has been (played by Keanu Reeves) who blew it in a game many years ago and refuses to get back into the sport, despite Gene Hackman's convincing argument.

Now this group of merry thieves is going to band together, play football, and save the day, despite the antics of the striking 'real' football players.  Yawn again.  This movie might've been better off a Movie of the Week.<br/><br/>This movie is mildly humorous at times, but the problem is that there isn't anything new here.  Keanu is a shrewd businessman, getting 12 million to make this middle of the road comedy.  Why Gene Hackman and Jon Favreau decided to sign up is beyond me.

"backrow-2","2","1","3","14 August 2000"," Replacement Parts
","This film reminded me of Frankenstein's monster.  It's made up of discarded jokes from dead movies with a defective brain thrown in.  Except for possibly the hero, Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), the characters are cringe-producing stereotypes. There are hulking gansta-rap body guards who play offensive guards on the field (get it?).  There is a Japanese sumo wrestler with a goofy Asian accent, a barmaid with a heart of gold, a blonde airhead cheerleader, and a deaf guy.  The players on strike are all spoiled millionaires, toward whom, it seems, one is supposed to the feel the kind of populist resentment you hear on sports radio call-in shows.  Many of the gags are familiar.  There is barfing in the huddle that gets replayed on Sportscenter and a man who celebrates football glory by tweaking his nipples (remember Nipple Ring Man from ""The Waterboy""?).<br/><br/>Although the film is loosely patterned after the NFL's strike-interrupted 1987 season, the less you know about football the happier you'll be.  In the world of ""The Replacements,"" the final game of the season takes place on Thanksgiving night.  Just before this big game, with the playoffs on the line, the team fires its most valuable player to make room for a single former striker who mysteriously decides to join the scabs he has spent the whole movie harassing.  Getting rid of the best players for no reason happens only in baseball, remember?   The weather presents another riddle. The film is set in the Northeast in late November, but I could swear that every day was the middle of August.  Al Gore must have been right about that global warming thing after all, and maybe The Replacements is a prequel to Waterworld.<br/><br/>One of the most puzzling scenes takes place near the end of the film. Sipping beer on his houseboat, the dejected Shane Falco watches on television as his coach gives an inspiring interview while trotting off the field at halftime.  Somehow Shane covers the distance from his boat to the locker room in the time it takes the coach and the players to get there themselves.  They either did some very slow trotting or Keanu reverted to his Matrix alter ego, Neo, and made time stand still.<br/><br/>All this could be forgiven if The Replacements was either funny or original. But in time-tested Hollywood fashion, the film merely combines the elements of other money-makers.  The pitch could easily have been ""It's the Bad New Bears meets Major League, with Gene Hackman reprising his coach-who-gets-a-second-chance role from Hoosiers.""  The practice of repackaging the leftovers from earlier films hints at timid studio executives who prefer stale but bankable ideas to original but untested ones.  Good comedy demands either brains or originality, even if it's just gross-out body fluid humor.  This reanimated corpse of a film delivers neither."
"brvhrt-4","3","1","3","26 July 2000"," Incomplete pass
","I feel bad for ripping apart a movie whose heart is in the right place. But cliche is cliche, and this movie's full of them.  I know that deep down, there was a heartwarming story there about heart and guts and love of the game, but it never really came out the way it should have.  Most characters were little more than two-dimensional stereotypes.  Substorylines picked up out of nowhere and were dropped just as suddenly.  Almost every popular song from the last decade is thrown in somewhere as a way to move the plot along, but it's an obvious attempt to disguise the lack of story.  The funniest moments are blown in the trailer, and the climatic will-they-or-won't-they scenes are all too often interrupted by needless shots of cheerleaders, well after their subplot has played out.  Keanu's big motivational huddle speech is a slogan I read on a T-shirt 10 years ago.  Even John Madden and Pat Summerall are reduced to cariacatures of themselves; Madden is allowed- make that forced- to rattle off all of his trademark lines, but only for the sake of the schtick.  The football strike is a story perfectly suited for an underdog movie, even a funny one.  All of the elements were there.  But instead of landing in the same category as BULL DURHAM or CADDYSHACK, this one ends up being as forgettable as BASEKETBALL."

","It's got plenty legitimately funny moments and lines and the cast turns in a fairly credible performance even though they have some awful material to work with. The biggest problems with this movie is the god awful directing and editing along with a blatant disregard for even a semi-realistic story about replacement players taking over when the primary players go on strike.<br/><br/>1. Why are there replacement cheerleaders? Cheerleaders don't have a union and have no bargaining power. Players go on strike, cheerleaders don't.<br/><br/>2. In the game against San Diego, Washington lines up for an onside kick. Before the kick, John Madden explains in the background that they need to recover the kick and call for a timeout. Bateman recovers the kick for Washington and runs around trying to score before he is tackled by Falco. Falco then calls a timeout. In no world would a QB ever be on the field for a kickoff. There's also no need to call a timeout after a kickoff is blown dead, as the clock stops anyway. I'm sure John Madden made mention of this to the director or someone.<br/><br/>3. Leading up the game against Dallas, (striking) Washington star QB Martel makes it known that he is crossing the picket line to return to the team. Ownership happily welcomes him back and Falco is released. Apparently in this world there are also no backup QBs .<br/><br/>4. During the Dallas game, Falco returns during halftime and is told to suit up. Eventhough he is no longer under contract and not on the official game day roster, he is allowed to return to the field with no objection from the refs or the opposing team.<br/><br/>5. During the Dallas game, Bateman and Smith (both of whom play on defense) are in the offensive huddle and promptly execute a 20 yd run play eventhough they had never worked with the offense before.<br/><br/>6. The production values of this movie are soooooooo effing awful, especially the music. At times it seemed more like a broken record rather than professional grade music editing.<br/><br/>But in spite of its glaring flaws and poor execution, I can't not watch this movie whenever I come across it on TV. There's just something about this horribly made movie that gets me. Nearly 20 years later and I still get a kick out of it."

The professional players are all greedy jerks while the owners are in it for the ""love of the game"". Here's the reality:<br/><br/>--Forbes estimates that a team purchased for $180 million would be worth $2.4 billion 20 years later (based upon Jeff Laurie's purchase of the Eagles in 1996), and that is not counting income generated over those 20 years, just purchase and sale price. That translates to about a 13 percent annual capital growth.<br/><br/>-- On average, Forbes calculates that NFL teams earn $89 million in annual operating income before debt service and taxes.<br/><br/>-- The average NFL player income is $1.9 million/year, but this is highly misleading because a relatively small number of players make larger incomes while most make a lot less for a much shorter time. According to Business Insider, 70 percent of players in the NFL are between 22 and 27, and their average salary is closer to $1.4 million/year.<br/><br/>-- The average career length in the NFL is about 6 years according to the NFL and 3.3 years according to the player's association. Less than 10 percent play past 30.<br/><br/>-- 96 percent of former player's brains studied post mortem showed evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy; basically, severe brain damage that leads to horrific conditions later in life. This doesn't mean 96 percent of players have this, but it does mean these guys are putting themselves at serious risk for their careers.<br/><br/>-- According to the book ""League of Denial: The NFL, Concussions and the Battle for Truth"", the league (i.e. the owners and administrators) probably knew about the long-term health complications of playing NFL football for years and worked hard to keep it out of the news and undercut studies about it.<br/><br/>Yes, NFL players still make a lot more than most of us ever will, but I have trouble thinking the owners are the good guys and the players are all greedy tools.

But Reeves sees this as a shot to show what he could have done. As the most professional of this group Reeves is essential and he lets neither the team or the audience down. He also has head cheerleader Brooke Langton in his corner giving his morale a needed boost.<br/><br/>This replacement Washington team develops a style of gonzo football like the Charleston Chiefs gonzo hockey in Slap Shot. It's what makes The Replacements the fine entertainment it is.<br/><br/>I do have to say that I remember when baseball had a lock out and tried to negotiate with their players under a threat and did hire replacements in spring training. I still have memories of watching those spring training games with that set of replacements for the Mets in this case. I'll not forget Ralph Kiner and the rest of the Mets announcers just sounding in agony describing the game.<br/><br/>Those replacement Mets just never got into the spirit of The Replacements."

Keanu Reeves plays ""Footsteps Falco"".. gotta love that nickname,, he is a QB that had an awful game at the Sugar Bowl lost 45-0 and has since went into hiding,,, Gene Hackman is wonderful as coach Joe McGinty,, together the two just give such a wonderful performance,, the cheerleaders in this movie,, are like the best iv'e ever seen,, pretty, sexy,, and seductive,, catch some of their moves during the game. what I like best about the movie is the more than accurate portrayal of the game itself,, the play calling,, the locker room stuff.. in the real NFL Washington did have a player on work furlough from prison,, this is a must see movie,, especially for a football guru or you re casual fan,, and even if you're not a football fan you will be after seeing this movie,, thumbs up ."

","Although this movie is about scabs, and the people who enable them, the movie is surprisingly upbeat, although not necessarily amusing. The movie is about people being given a second chance, although in this case at other people's expense. The movie also is about how a good coach can turn losers into winners and how it is often impossible to differentiate the two. Keanu Reeves is wonderful in the principal role of Shane Falco, a washed up quarterback, who is brought back from oblivion to enjoy a moment of glory. Brooke Langton is positively charming as the cheer leader who literally cheers on Falco. However, the strongest performance is by Gene Hackman who plays Falco's coach and who has to make a decision which puts his moral courage to the test."

","Keanu Reeves, Gene Hackman, Orlando Jones, Rhys Ifans - and what would an NFL movie be without Pat Summerall and John Madden? This is a US pro football movie made for fun and profit.

Also you're drowned in standard NFL muzak. It's totally brain dead, but then again they say US football is supposed to be totally brain dead, so it's no big loss, is it?<br/><br/>Langton plays the head cheerleader who rounds up her crew from a unique place. Naturally she will have nothing to do with players, even quarterbacks (Keanu). You hear it but you don't believe it. How will this one turn out? Gee, that's a difficult one. Wait for Gordon Sumner to sing and you'll find out.<br/><br/>Directed adequately by Molly Ringwald's Howard Deutch and written by Vince McKewin who hasn't made as much of an impression as a writer as he has as a guest star on TJ Hooker, V, A-Team, and Knight Rider, the movie in a word is 'OK'.<br/><br/>It's not great; it's not Gone with the Wind; but it's not the worst sports film you've ever seen either.

","First off, I hate most sports, and for the most part strongly dislike movies that are, in one way or another, for one reason or the other, based in sports. So maybe I shouldn't really be rating this movie... let alone reviewing it. But here it goes, anyway. The plot is decent, as is the pacing. The story is the usual losers-turned-into-winners, and the film sticks so much to the formula that it holds absolutely no surprises. The film is based on - and revolves around - a bunch of clichés and stereotypes. The humor is mostly overdone and lame, but there are exceptions. Not many, but they exist. The acting is decent; Jon Favreau and Keanu Reeves(and, of course, Gene Hackman) give pretty good performances. The characters are all paper-thin, walking, talking clichés and stereotypes. I have seen few other movies that have managed to fit in all of the major stereotypes; featured is the black guy who's a 'gangsta', the weak black guy who pretends to be 'gangsta', the Asian guy, the annoying British(oh, sorry, Welsh) guy, etc. You name it, this film's got it. What it doesn't have, however, is very much to offer, though a little humor that's doesn't entirely suck is included. But apart from that, the film is pretty much a dud. Even die-hard fans of the sub-genre(crude sports comedy) and/or the actors in it should probably find another film to spend time on. This has very little to offer(and nothing new at all) and isn't particularly memorable. I recommend only to huge fans of the sub-genre and the actors. 6/10"

","Good movie.  It is an obvious knock-off of Scott Bakula's ""Necessary Roughness"" but it has some original elements to distinguish itself.  If you are a football fan that is waiting between the Pro Bowl and the Draft, this is good entertainment to fill the time.<br/><br/>The premise to the movie:  The NFL is on strike, and replacement players are brought in to finish the season.  The names of the real life football franchises were changed to, what I suspect, avoid litigation from the NFL. The Washington Sentinels hire one of their former head coaches (Gene Hackman) to field a team of replacement players and make them winners. Interestingly enough, John Madden and Pat Summerall play the commentators, and they do a pretty good job.  The writers had a flair for coming up with their lines to be consistent with how these two usually banter with each other during a game.<br/><br/>Hackman puts together a roster of either NFL has-beens or never was's.  His crown jewel is a QB by the name of Shane Falco, played by Keanu Reeves. <br/><br/>
Some of these lines are directly ripped off from ""Unnecessary Roughness"", yet they find their places just the same.<br/><br/>I liked how Falco gained his following during the span over a few games. And gained the respect of his teammates.  Definitely a feel-good movie.

","In this film, Keanu Reeves reprises his role as an anthropomorphic park bench, a role he's made famous in such films as 'Point Break', 'The Devil's Advocate', and 'The Matrix'.  This time, that loveable bench straps on a football uniform, and gives his woodiest performance yet.<br/><br/>
It's not hard to believe that women would want to see the hot stupid popular actor play the role of the stereotypical hot stupid popular guy on film, and I'll admit that seeing stripper/cheerleaders had to be a huge draw for the guys as well.  What's confusing about this phenomenally bad film is that people not only could stomach the entirety of it, but that they've actually praised it in public without fear of retribution.<br/><br/>Once the true horror of this film's inevitable, clichemobile plot became obvious to me, I could only manage to occupy myself by guessing successfully what the next scene would bring.  It was like a choose your own adventure book on the silver screen, only I kept making all the wrong choices, and the movie kept going along with them anyway.  Imagine being a NFL cheerleader and saying this to motivate your colleagues:  ""Hey girls, those football players are striking.  I say we go with them!  Sure they make millions, and we make $10 an hour, and there are hundreds of thousands of high school seniors who would be glad to take our place, but if we strike, it'll make for much more interesting professional stripper replacements when the owners of the team find it strangely impossible to find any new cheerleaders!"" I'll note that the run-on quote I wrote up there delineates basically what happened in the movie, and, you got it, it makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>
Speaking of choices, should actors be given BAC tests before they're allowed to sign up for a movie?  Gene Hackman must have been near comatose when he signed his career away with this masterpiece.  He may have gone for a rip as a copy of the great Bear Bryant in his role as the motivational speaker/football coach, but this wasn't the movie to do it in.  Gene Hackman is a good actor.  He knows character, he knows expression, and he knows a good film when he sees one.  I'm guessing somebody did this to him for revenge or something.<br/><br/>Lets go back to Keanu ""Benchy"" Reeves for a second because he's so disturbing.  Did anybody else notice that despite playing a character who was down in the dumps, gets the shot of his life, finds love, rallies his team to the championship, and learns to have confidence in himself, his face has the same expression during the entirety of the film?  Holy line-reading mannequins, Batman! I've got it!  He really died after Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey and was embalmed and allowed to posthumously continue horrifying us on film!<br/><br/>What this basically all means is, if you really like movies which skillfully tread that tightrope between being funny or being meaningful in any way, then you're going to likely refer to this as the greatest movie you've ever seen.  Were such attributes actually seen as positive in the film business, then this might actually be the greatest movie we've ever seen.<br/><br/>
The fact is, football players dancing and singing, Keanu Reeves accidentally playing his most serious role ever (ironically during a comedy film), a guy repeatedly dropping a football, and a hot cheerleader making out with a park bench that's draped in a football jersey aren't funny at all.  Just because a movie has a motivational soundtrack doesn't mean you're supposed to feel for this group of cops, felons, and eccentrics.  I liked Rudy.  I liked Major League.  This movie was just atrocious.<br/><br/>Oh BTW if you said ""This movie was great!"" I highly recommend 'Down Periscope'.  It'll knock your socks off."

"Anonymous_Maxine","6","0","1","8 September 2000"," Not original in the slightest sense of the word, but good acting and entertaining comedy make this weak story at least a little bit better.
","The Replacements, as I am sure hundreds of people have noted already, is yet another football movie. There have been only a few football movies which were very well made and resulted in quality films (Unnecessary Roughness was fairly well-done, and especially The Program, probably one of the best), but it seemed that The Replacements was an effort to either revive that genre (which is pretty much worn out) or to cash in on its past success. The story is loosely based on and an updated version of the 1987 pro-football strike (I doubt that the bullet riddled Porsche was a 1987 model), but the majority of the film is made up of an unimaginative story about ""replacement players."" <br/><br/>Almost the entire movie was put together using scenes that were disturbingly familiar to scenes from other films. For example, the actual replacement players were introduced exactly the same way that the 'replacement astronauts' were introduced in Armageddon. The actual football scenes require no imagination at all, and could have come from anywhere, and the cheerleaders were a tasteless element of the film in the tradition of BASEketball. Besides that, how about the ending? (spoilers) The team needs ""heart"" in order to win the big game, coach McGinty (Gene Hackman) says to the television reporter. He is obviously sending out a message specifically to Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), the team's 'star' replacement quarterback. How touching. Needless to say, Falco decides to head down to the stadium to save the day, and boot the pro quarterback who had recently re-joined the team. Falco walks into the locker room at half time, everyone cheers, they go on to win the game. Does that sound familiar at all (""Remember when B-Bobby Boucher showed up and the M-M-Mud Dogs won the Bourbon Bowl, do ya?"")? Yeah, so Falco saved the day in true Waterboy form, and the movie ends just like every other football film ever made has ended.<br/><br/>
Despite the lacking story and the many unlikely events that take place (""Is that your ride?"" ""Yeah."" BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!!!), The Replacements was barely saved by some surprisingly good acting. I was sick and tired of Keanu Reeves (until I saw The Matrix, where he delivered an excellent performance), and I expected a disappointing turn from The Matrix to a routine football film, but he was very convincing as the disillusioned quarterback who is suddenly faced with the chance to reverse his shabby reputation. Even Brooke Langton provides a good depiction of the only original cheerleader who is suddenly surrounded by strip club airheads and has some pretty good on-screen chemistry with the monotonous Keanu. The Replacements is a fairly good football film which doesn't really do anything that hasn't been done before, but at least it wasn't as terrible as Varsity Blues. It is worth watching to see the underdogs beat the odds and come out on top (yet again), but don't expect any plot twists. If you've ever seen a sports movie, you know the basic structure that they follow, and you'll know what's going to happen from the very beginning."

Well you know where it goes from here, the team has to win that almost impossible amount of games to make it to the playoffs to prove their talent isn't a fluke.<br/><br/>Though it sounds like I am tearing ""The Replacements"" a new one, I actually had a lot of fun watching it.  It's a hilarious sports comedy with those zany characters and one incredibly attractive cheerleader, Falco's love interest Annabelle, played by Brooke Langton.  <br/><br/>Thanks Keanu for tapping those infamous comedy roots, dude.<br/><br/>All in all, everything ""The Waterboy"" should be and claims to be but way more.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","""The Replacemts"" turned out to be one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. Although most of it is stuff we've seen a million times before, it still makes you howl and there is alos a little bit of a serious overtone to it. Although it is a good cast, the acting isnt great. Gene Hackman was good in his role as the coach, but they didn't need him or Al Pacino for that role. Same with keanu Reeves as the quarterback. However, there was some good chemistry between the charecters. One other good thing about this movie is it is an example of a true PG-13 rated film, meaning it's not objectional enough to be an R but kids under 13 shouldn't see it unless they are very mature. There are some pretty racy jokes in it. Although a predictible and unoriginal movie, it was still a lot funnier and a lot better than I expected. *** stars(out of 4)"

This didn't make it any less enjoyable, as it held my attention for the full length of the film. Since all the other reviews detail the plot, I'll dispense with a plot synopsis and tell you that it was a good film, even with the excessive language. I took my 12 year old son with me to see it (PG-13) and it's every bit a PG-13 film. The Puke scene in the huddle had us laughing as only a kid watching a puke scene could laugh! If you take ""The Longest Yard"", ""The Bad News Bears"", and a couple of other good sports flicks, you have ""The Replacments"". The comedy kept us laughing, and you find yourself rooting for these wannabe professional football players. I found myself tapping my foot with the soundtrack music (BTO - ""Takin' Care of Business"" appropriately came blasting out when the team finally started clicking as a team). It is entertaining, and I found myself wincing at some of the hits on the field. ""Scary Movie""? FORGET IT. This film is a much, much better way to spend a couple of hours.

Keanu Reeves was fine, but the real stars of the movie were Gene Hackman, Rhys Ifans, Brooke Langton and Brett Cullen.  Hackman was very comfortable and familiar in this role, and Ifans was hilarious.  I hadn't seen Langton since her Chicago Hope days but she worked well with Reeves and gave some depth to a scarcely-written character.  Brett Cullen played against type as the arrogant quarterback who goes on strike, and really steals the movie. He's much better known for playing the good guy, as he did in SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT and APOLLO 13, and seems to relish the chance to get nasty here. His ""interview"" in the opening moments of the film is hilarious, and he just gets better from there.  His performance alone is worth the price of admission.

","This is one of the better sports movies I have seen.  It has a great cast of seeming misfits, losers, usetobes, and wannabees.<br/><br/>This movie is a fictional account about football players going on strike and the owner brings in a new (used to be) coach, Gene Hackman.  Hackman then sets out to bring together a bunch of players whom, for several reasons, he would like to see playing football.  Of course, these guys come from all walks of life and have little if anything in common.  The task at hand is to mold them into a football team and get them into the playoffs in four games.<br/><br/>Keanu Reeves is the one selected to be the quarterback for the team and, with the help of Hackman, establishes himself as the leader of this group of misfits.  He does an excellent job and for someone who never played football I think he did great.<br/><br/>Hackman, as usual, is great.  He had established himself as a great basketball coach in ""Hoosiers"".  This time he gets to coach football.  I think it establishes that leadership can be great no matter what the circumstances if the man is a true leader.  Hackman definitely is.<br/><br/>Everyone will love this movie.  It is humorous and it will bring a tear to your eye.  It is inspirational and points a finger at what professional sports has become, the quest for fame and money.  These guys, the replacements, are playing for the love of the game, the desire for combat, and the desire to win.  It also points out that we have lost true leaders and established in their place, managers.<br/><br/>There are plenty of beautiful women and the girl who is Reeves' romantic interest in this film is a real beauty inside and out.<br/><br/>One of the more humorous scenes is when Hackman tries to get the replacements to deal with any fears they have.  Instead bringing up the fear of being hurt or the fear of losing, the guys start talking about their fear of spiders, as if the other fears had not entered into their small brains."

"jhaggardjr","9","0","1","12 August 2000"," Hysterical football comedy
","""The Replacements"" is a very funny, very entertaining comedy which is loosely based on the real-life NFL strike during the 1987 season where the real players went on strike and replacement players were brought in to take their place. Keanu Reeves took a break from action movies to do comedy here and in ""The Replacements"" he stars as Shane Falco, the replacement quarterback for the fictional Washington Sentinels. Oscar winner Gene Hackman also gets to show off some of his comic side as the Sentinels coach Jimmy McGinty who recruits these mostly off-the-wall players, and it's great to see long-time veteran character actor Jack Warden still around as he portrays the Sentinels owner Edward O'Neil. The other replacements players are an assorted bunch of oddball characters: a store security guard who's very fast but has butterfingers for hands; a Japanese sumo wrestler; a soccer player from Wales who becomes the field goal kicker and who's usually smoking (even on the field); a cop who's turns into a absolute tackling nut on the field; a wide-receiver who's deaf; and a rapper bodyguard duo. There's also focus on the cheerleaders, where two of them are exotic dancers. Not to mention the head cheerleader takes an interest in Falco. ""The Replacements"" is a silly and predictable movie, but I didn't mind because it did make me laugh and I laughed alot while watching it. Plus, the entire cast does a pretty good job. It's nice to see Reeves and Hackman get a chance to do comedy again (Reeves starred in the two ""Bill & Ted"" comedies; Hackman did the nutty 1996 film ""The Birdcage""). Old pro Warden has a few good moments as the team owner, and the actors who play the other replacement players are a riot. I didn't find ""The Replacements"" all that original but since it's so funny most of the time I didn't care. It's the funniest football comedy since ""The Waterboy"". <br/><br/>***1/2 (out of four)"
"Rhino Rover","8","0","1","12 August 2000"," Entertaining
","I've seen a few football movies over the years and most of them don't really entertain me that much. The last one was `Any Given Sunday' and that one turned out to annoy me more than entertain me. `The Replacements' I liked.<br/><br/>The story is simple. Professional football players go on strike and the team brings in replacement players to finish the season. That's it. There's no subplot or tricky twists that try to make the movie more than it's out to be. Mind you the replacement players turn out to be either misfits or just guys who never made it to the pros but then, that's the charm of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on the characters and the situation they're placed in but it's not entirely testosterone filled (although there's quite a bit of it). There's humor laced throughout that I really enjoyed and it wasn't a two hour movie filled with swears every second word. In fact, I don't even recall hearing any now that I think about it. <br/><br/>Keanu Reeves plays the replacement quarter back and it seems that as he gets older his acting becomes better. I still occasionally find it hard to not associate him with `Bill and Ted' but I do respect the fact that he's always gone after different roles. I've rarely seen Gene Hackman give a poor performance and he doesn't disappoint in this movie. He's done a few other `coach' type roles so this shouldn't be anything difficult. There were a couple peripheral actors that really did grab the spotlight when they had it. Rhys Ifans plays the Welsh kicker and he definitely draws a lot of laughs. I first saw him in `Nottinghill' as `Spike' and he definitely is one of the character actors that's hard not to like. Orlando Jones plays Franklin and plays him well. He's very hard to ignore when he's on screen.<br/><br/>
Overall, I liked this movie and would recommend it to anyone wanting a good laugh but don't come to me and say that it was predictablewhat else were you expecting from a football movie?"
"dover","5","0","1","11 August 2000"," A decent sports comedy
","""The Replacements"" is a strange mix of reality, slapstick comedy, and plot lines you've seen a hundred times before that mix to form an engaging, though not spectacular comedy. Their is some decent football action, and some big laughs.<br/><br/>Aside from the fact that 80% of this script seems to be lifted more or less directly from the 1991 Scott Bakula vehicle ""Necessary Roughness"" (whose script wasn't that original itself), this movie at least had a kind of glitzed up feel that most football movies like to avoid. It didn't get down and dirty in the trenches, like so many movies before it. You'll have seen many of the gags before, but they're well-done, and there is the added bonus of Pat Sumerall and John Madden doing what I assume to be a satire of themselves (how else to explain such Madden quotes as, ""He caught the ball! He doesn't usually catch the ball, but he caught the ball!""<br/><br/>Only two things really irked me about this movie: #1 - why the need for replacement cheerleaders? I understand they wanted to take a slightly racier angle (something lifted from ""Baseketball, but used to much greater effect here), but it isn't as if cheerleaders belong to the NFL Players Association. Also, the movie has the strike occur with 4 games left to go in the season. The strike on which this is based (in 1987), happened at the beginning of the year, as do all labor disputes but baseball's. This is presumably to add the dramatic effect brought on by the hunt for a playoff birth, but that's never really present, so it I think it just would've seemed a little less silly if this was all occurs at the start of the season.<br/><br/>Decent acting, good football scenes, the occasional big laugh, and nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before. But still worth a watch."

","The Replacements is a fun and funny football comedy that will leave you in stitches. During a NFL players strike each team hires replacements players to finish out the season. The Washington Sentinels are the main focus team of this film. They need to win three out of the next four games to reach the playoffs, so they hire a retired coach (Gene Hackman) and a rag tag bunch of players (which features Keanu Reeves,Jon Favreau,Rhys Ifans,Orlando Jones,and Faizon Love) to try and reach their goal. Keanu Reeves leads this bunch as Shane Falco, an all-American quarterback in college, who ruined his career in the '96 Sugar Bowl when he lost the game by 45 points. Gene Hackman goes back to his Hoosiers days as the coach that's street smart and been through it all. He's good and he does respect to his Hoosiers performance. Keanu first film after The Matrix has him playing a gifted quarterback who can't get it done. He pulls off the football star well and his humble guy approach comes off well in this film. But the man that everyone will be talking about is Orlando Jones. The people who didn't get see him shine on Fox's Mad TV will get to see what he can do in this. If you were to put Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, and Chris Rock together you would get Orlando Jones. He is naturally funny and steals the show here. This film is very racy for a PG-13 film. There are lot of crude humor, swearing and gross jokes. I saw this at the first sneak peak in late July so I'm not sure if they edited it or not but that version I saw had a lot I didn't think they could get away with in a PG-13 film.

Despite the fact that the real Redskins were the only NFL team that did not have a single player who crossed the picket line during the strike, their replacements won all three of their games and helped the Redskins make the playoffs where they ultimately won the Superbowl.

","THE REPLACEMENTS is the funniest football film that I have seen since THE LONGEST YARD with Burt Reynolds.  I have always enjoyed movies about sports, in fact I find them more entertaining than the real thing.  Yes, they are predictable, but at least I know who the people are.  You can sort of call this a football version of the baseball classic, THE BAD NEWS BEARS. The professional players of the Washington Sentinels decide to go on strike during the season.  The team owner, O' Neil (Jack Warden) doesn't want the team to quit during mid-season, so he relies on coach McGinty (Gene Hackman) to help find the team some replacement players.  McGinty can find the replacement players, trouble is that each of these players has a excellent quality and a negative quality.  There's Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a excellent quarterback who is still living in the shadow of his horrible defeat of the Sugar Bowl game some years ago.  Bateman (Jon Favreau) is a tackle happy defense player, the only problem is that he will also tackle his own teammates.  Gruff (Rhys Ifans) is a excellent kicker, but he has a attitude, drinking, and gambling problem.  And there's Franklin (Orlando Jones) a superior runner, one of the fastest, it's just that he can't catch anything.  McGinty has a few weeks to get this team into the finals, while the strike goes on. I enjoyed the humor of this film, since that is what is important for this film.  It does have some new jokes for the sport, and like I said it's the funniest football film since THE LONGEST YARD and the climax of M*A*S*H*.  And speaking of M*A*S*H*, the cheerleaders led by Falco's love intrest Annabelle (a very pretty Brooke Langton), is the most dinginess and funniest cheerleaders since then. The acting is also fine, I got past the Keanu Reeves slow talking character.  It's not one of his best like PARENTHOOD and MATRIX. But it's far better than MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and JOHNNY MEMONIC.  Gene Hackman gives a wonderful performance as the football veteran who enjoys his replacements more than his regulars since the replacements play the game for the love of it, not the money.  And I also enjoyed Jon Favreau as the energetic tackle guard who is always excited.  Rhys Ifans is also funny as the ""slobbish"" Gruff, if you enjoyed him in NOTTING HILL, you'll enjoy him in this film.  And Faizon Love and Michael Taliferro who play the Jackson brothers are also very enjoyable. This is a decent sports film, director Howard Deutch (of PRETTY IN PINK and GREAT OUTDOORS fame) did a much better job with this film than his previous effort, the dreadful ODD COUPLE II.  And for lightweight summer entertainment, this film does give that to the audience.  This in no INSIDER or AMERICAN BEAUTY, it's just a enjoyable film.  So for those comedy and sport lovers out there, this is a nice treat. **** (out of five)"

Of course, there is a love story involved, but by making the woman not just a cheerleader but actually very knowledgeable about football, it allows her to interact in the story and not just be the token babe.  Keanu Reeves, who I normally ridicule relentlessly, is at his dunderheaded best in a role that seems to suit him almost as well as his character in ""The Matrix"" did.  I was surprised/delighted to see Gene Hackman in this film; he gives it a center of gravity around which all the other characters revolve.  Overall, not taking itself too seriously is the greatest asset to this movie.  Just having this quality, from which many other films could benefit, gives it a light-hearted feel that's just plain fun to watch."

","This movie was soo funny!! I laughed my ass off espcially when the Sumo guy was on, I know how that Sumo(Jumbo) guy feels when people see asian their first intent is if their Chinese but noo, there are a bunch of kinds of asians! Next time you see an asian atleast for once ask them if their JAPANESE and not Chinese man! Hahaha, anyways back to the movie... The best thing about this movie is the cast which makes you actually want them to win unlike other sports movie with teams that just fights all the time and no fun. This movie is hilarious and even a great story! It has everything... Drama, Romance, Comedy (especially)... You have to see this movie if you haven't!<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9/10"
"Mare-16","Null","0","1","1 August 2000"," Very entertaining, well written, well acted
","This is a very funny movie. Gene Hackman is perfect for the role of the coach and Keanu does a good job of making you want to root for the underdogs. The camera loves Hackman in this film and you will enjoy the football scenes and the hard hitting. The dialogue is hysterical and the actors that play the scabs are hilarious...Rhys Ifans, Jon Favreau, Orlando Jones; you will be laughing the enire movie. The theater I saw the sneak preview in was packed and everyone was cracking up the entire movie.<br/><br/>
Course, the reason I went to see it was for Brett Cullen, who played the spoiled rotten jerk, Eddie Martel, the team's All-Pro Quarterback that goes on strike. Brett is awesome in this movie and you will love to hate him. This movie is worth the money!"
"brigittemueller","Null","0","1","10 August 2001"," A perfect mixture of comedy, action and lovestory.
","Love, action, comedy. This movie contains all this and I like such kind of movies. The characters were well plaid from Gene Hackman to Keanu Reeves and all other actors/actresses. The soundtrack is great too. Especially the scene in the prison when the Sentinals dance with the song ""I will survive"" is a real nice moment of this movie. I'm glad to have bought the VHS and I will buy the CD-Soundtrack too."

"John K.-2","9","0","1","3 July 2001"," Much better than you'd think for a straight-to-video film about American football
","I think it was a mistake to make this a straight-to-video film in the UK. It was probably done that way because films about U.S. sports often bomb over here. But Channel 4 have been showing the NFL on UK TV for many years, and besides, this film is as much about team spirit and getting a second chance at life as it is about football. It's a good light-hearted comedy -- and by ""good"", I mean it doesn't go all out for gags in the ""Naked Gun"" fashion, it's more that the comedy arises from a bunch of very different guys (and gals) trying to work together.<br/><br/>I watched the ""Director's Commentary"" on the DVD, and it became clear that the film was chopped to smithereens in the cutting room -- among scenes that were lost were (POSSIBLE SPOILERS START HERE) large parts of the first meeting between Keanu Reeves and Gene Hackman, a locker room scene with Rhys Ifans where he tries to encourage the guys with a Welsh song which is all about getting killed (sounds like some Scottish songs I know :-(), the fact that Martell placed the tripwire in the tunnel before the opening game, and even an entire character - a striking player who crossed the picket line and became a ""replacement"" - who never made it into production. (SPOILERS END HERE) As a result, one or two minor plot lines in the film go nowhere, and some of the characters are more stereotyped than I'd like. However, the commentary also makes clear some production successes, notably Gene Hackman's ad-libbing, and the second unit who shot 17 football plays in 9.5 minutes at half-time in a Baltimore Ravens game! All credit to these guys for producing a film that isn't an all-time great, but is well worth picking up for a lighthearted evening's entertainment."
"vpa21133","10","0","1","1 July 2001"," Very entertaining feel-good comedy
","""The Replacements"" is everything ""Any Given Sunday"" could have been, but wasn't.  The casting is excellent -- Gene Hackman gives his best performance in years, and the Keanu Reaves role is one that he can do, the ever-popular ""loser with a heart of gold.""  <br/><br/>Even my wife, who hates football, loves this movie.  'Nuff said."

","Wife agreed to watch this one with me, just because she is a good wife.  She doesn't really enjoy football, doesn't like Keanu Reeves, and is not a real Gene Hackman fan.  She enjoyed the movie.  She said that it was funny. Hard for me to praise it anymore than that.  I, on the other hand, am a big football fan, a fan of Gene Hackman, and enjoy watching Keanu Reeves. I really enjoyed the film.   Would recommend this one to anyone that asks."

","Saw a preview screening of ""The Replacements"" Saturday night and thought it was a funny, lighthearted movie that leaves you feeling good after it's over. The cast of characters were great together and the story, although somewhat predictable, was heart warming.  The audience that I was in laughed quite a bit and applauded at the end.  If you are looking for laughs and a movie full of heart - this is the one to see."
"cwoodberry","Null","0","1","24 June 2001"," Excellent
","Yes, I know it's all been done to death before, in all sorts of ways.  The losers get together to win something.  To start with their fighting amongst themselves, and then through something they become a team, and at the end, of course, they win!  Well, I have to admit to being something of a fan of happy endings and feel good movies, but The Replacements was a lot of fun to watch.  It's not only a happy ending feel good movie, it's very funny, and the soundtrack rocks!  The characters are great, and I quite like Keanu Reeves, he does the 'babe' character very well. :)  Way to go guys!"
"dlmiley","6","0","1","26 June 2001"," Silly, Predictable but Fun
","My summary says it all.  This movie is a pleasant time killer for when you just want to relax and turn your mind off.  Not a Oscar winner by any means, but not a dog either; and Brooke Langton is certainly not a dog.  Finally, Gene Hackman's acting always adds a few points.  Enjoy!"
"ParadoxC","8","0","1","26 June 2001"," Maybe you have to be British to like this.
","I found it odd upon reading other comments that a lot of people don't like this film. For some reason they call it simple, cliched and obvious. Well I hate to break it to you, but it's a sports film... and a comedy, and didn't really need any depth. I don't really care if the acting was bad, or if the characters had no depth, i never noticed as i was too busy laughing.<br/><br/>Since i'm in the UK, i only saw this film on video. And it was the funniest thing i'd seen in ages. I even went straight out and bought the dvd. Me and my girlfriend absolutely loved it. Of course humor is pretty personal, so i guess some people maybe don't find it funny. We did - mainly down to Rhys Ifans (who is welsh...as am I), but the rest of the cast were funny to.<br/><br/>So don't expect a clever film, 'cos it aint, but it is funny. Very, very funny. But maybe you have to be british to fully appreciate some of it. Especially references to being 'world champions', now that is funny."
"JamieF","7","0","1","25 June 2001"," Very funny, if not terribly original.
","Boy, there are a lot of good actors in this movie. Obviously Keanu isn't one of them but he's in the movie anyway. He does a good job of being opaque (wooden?), and it's OK because his character calls for him to be a washed-up jock and to play football, so it's not important that he can't convey subtle emotions. As usual Orlando Jones is very funny, as is Rhys Ifans (previously seen in Notting Hill as basically the same character, except this time he's an athlete instead of a couch potato). The whole replacement team is full of amusing characters, and the cheerleaders are *really* funny. Lots of individual original jokes and situations but the plot follows the typical underdog sports movie storyline. A great rental."
"gws-2","7","0","1","23 June 2001"," Wonderful Fun and a Grossly Underrated Film
","I had avoided this film until it was shown on HBO because my two favorite reviewers, Roger Ebert and Leonard Maltin savaged it (both gave it only 2 stars out of 4).  I was surprised by these ratings.  This movie has many wonderful NFL inside jokes and dramatizes beautifully the stupidity of NFL owners, the selfishness of NFL players, and the greed of both.  I suspect that those reviewers who underrated this film fell into one of two camps: (1) they could not stand the entirely unsympathetic depiction of the regular players who went on strike in 1987 because those reviewers believed that anybody who stands for ""labor solidarity"" should be treated kindly on film or, (this is more likely)(2) they know nothing, let me say that again, nothing about sports in general or the NFL in particular and they simply didn't get it.  7 out of 10.  Recommended."
"ebe28","Null","0","1","18 June 2001"," A cliche of a movie but fun to watch...
","There's not much in this movie that would be considered original, but the characters and some funny moments make this movie very fun to watch.  Though Keanu Reeves didn't do anything different, he was needed to be the straight guy for all the wild personalities around him.  The treat was seeing the gorgeous Brooke Langton and her cheerleaders.  Their scenes were some of the better and funnier ones in the movie.  Overall, I'm glad I waited until this movie came on cable.  If you want to see a funny football movie, watch ""Necessary Roughness.""  If you just want to see something silly and fun, ""The Replacements"" fits the bill."
"Bob__Loblaw","8","0","1","1 August 2000"," A two point conversion!
","Just like in football,  you know when they are going to do the two point conversion, and as with this movie,  you know what the basic plot outline is.  But when the two point conversion works in Football, as in this movie, its exciting and fun to watch.  You don't expect it to work, but it does.<br/><br/>I saw the premier on the 27th and wanted to wait till a few days later before I write a review. I wanted to let my thoughts on the film settle a little.   I loved this movie,  it was a lot funnier than I thought it would be.  While some of the acting was a little over the top,  it usually worked. The acting by Hackman was great.  Then again,  when is Hackman not great.<br/><br/>The attitude towards the striking players was a little shocking,  but I felt it was right on target. The romance was a little lame,  but it was kept a little light by some clever comments. Is this the funniest or best sports movie I have ever seen?  No!  But it is  a very entertaining and fun movie that I would pay to see again.  I gave this movie an 8 out of a possible 10."
"Flora-9","8","0","1","12 June 2001"," It's good - honest!
","The Replacements came straight onto video here in the UK so I was expecting a mediocre movie at the most. What I got was a surprisingly good and funny movie with a catchy soundtrack. I'm mystified why the film did not do better at the box office although I can understand it being relegated to video here in the UK where American football movies never do well.<br/><br/>If you don't expect too much then you will probably enjoy The Replacements. So switch off your brain, sit back and let Keanu et al entertain you."
"rox731","10","0","1","31 July 2000"," I Agree!
","Totally a ""go see it movie"". I know not one thing about football, but found it very easy to follow. This PG-13 movie was a real delight. Script was good and funny, direction was excellent. In love with Keanu? Enough close ups to make it worth your while. A huge football fan? You will find it very entertaining and funny. I saw this also at a sneak preview and awaiting opening day to see it again. This movie will be a DVD keeper when it comes out. It's a relief to see something that can relax you in the theater for a change."

"rj-27","5","0","1","25 January 2001"," Where's the movie?
","Extremely formulaic schlock about has beens and never wases rising to the occasion to win enough remaining games as replacements to get their fictitious football team to the playoffs.  Gene Hackman and Keanu Reeves, in particular, seem to go through the motions.  Romantic subplot extremely juvenile as are the lockeroom and bar room antics displayed by both the replacment players and the overpaid athletes they scab. A couple of genuine funny moments, but you've seen it all before.  Compare this to Unecessary Roughness or the Longest Yard, which are both far superior, and you'll see what I mean."
"Dolf","Null","0","1","22 January 2001"," Replace the bad plot and bad acting and you might have yourself a movie...
","I love football. I love Gene Hackman. I love to look at Brooke Langdon. Yet somehow even all of that wasn't enough to save this piece of drek.<br/><br/>They may have hired real football players to appear in some of the game scenes and used real plays, but that didn't help offending anyone who knows anything about football. They make some terrible football errors, like when they call a time-out to keep time from running out, but they had just thrown an incomplete pass. Ugh.<br/><br/>I don't like Keanu Reeves much at all, but he honestly wasn't that bad in this film. He did a much better job that several reviewers here gave him credit for, and he did look fairly believable as the replacement QB. (The actual starting QB, played by Troy Winbush, didn't even remotely resemble anyone who could ever play a touch-football QB, let alone be the #1 QB in the NFL...)<br/><br/>Gene Hackman, who I think has done some great films, was barely passable in this film. He just didn't seem to even really want to be in this film. (Which was a good call, considering the finished product...)<br/><br/>Brooke Langdon is a super-attractive lady, and doesn't disappoint in her cheerleading outfit. But even that can't save this movie.<br/><br/>About the only scenes that were funny at all were the cheerleading ""sex imitation"" cheers to throw the other team off its game. However, since in the real world cheerleaders wouldn't go on strike with the players (who the hell came up with that plot hole?), it wouldn't have happened in any replacement season.<br/><br/>In summary, 'The Replacements' is a football movie that is so far out of bounds, you shouldn't even try to catch it at the video store. (Sorry about that.) :-)"

","This is a surprisingly good movie, with lots of laughs and lots of heart. The ads make this seem like a very dumb jock movie, but there is actually lots of humor, and the core of the story is about these replacement players trying to redeem themselves, gain respect, and attain personal glory. The story is of course predictable, but it's a very enjoyable ride nonetheless."
