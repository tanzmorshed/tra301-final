","In this journey through the struggles and trials that single father, Chris Gardner, has to take, you see the real side of hardwork and integrity. Chris Gardner, played by Will Smith, Is just trying to give his son a good home as he's on the pursuit of happiness. This movie doesn't only show the hard work of a single parent, but it shows that no matter how hard you get pushed down, you should always get up and keep going. I love the strong connection that the father and son roles have in this movie, it seems so real, and that's because it is! The father (Will smith) and son (Jaden Smith) are father and son outside the movie realm too. Actor, Will Smith, shows his true emotional side during this film, as if he was actually going through the situations occurring in the movie. There couldn't have been a better cast picked for this movie, the pain, struggle, love, and hope seem so real as if you're watching a documentary on someone's life. Smith, usually looked at as a comedic actor, shows what he can really do by jerking the tears from the audience's eyes."
"roachG-1","9","554","657","15 December 2006"," Will Smith is Oscar-worthy, no doubt about it.
","Here's the deal: It's real, it's heavy, and it's inspirational, but NOT AT ALL cheesy. Don't like that? Don't see it. I won't say much else. I will say that Will Smith was shockingly good now that he's paid his dues with ""Men in Black"" and ""Bad Boys.""<br/><br/>I was very happy that this film never got political and blamed Reagan for the number of ""down on their luck"" people that were shown, nor was the race card ever pulled out. It was also refreshing that Smith's character never blamed anybody for his troubles.<br/><br/>It's very funny at parts, but be prepared for some serious drama. In no ways is it cliché or contrived or boring. Let's just say that's it not Oliver Stone dramatic. This truly is a must see. To say ""I laughed, I cried"" would be really lame. It is the truth, though. <br/><br/>We know that Scorsese's crowning achievement ""The Departed"" is going to take the cake at the Oscars, and I won't be complaining. But this movie deserves to be experienced and taken in by the masses."
"Danusha_Goska","8","306","362","18 December 2006"," If You've Ever Been Poor, This Movie May Be Hard to Watch
","If you've ever been poor, this movie may be hard to watch. It depicts poverty in America in gut wrenchingly accurate ways. I've been as poor as Chris Gardner, and, like him, I've been poor among very rich people in the Bay Area while trying to work my way up.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner is a loving father and failing businessman. He is chosen for a competitive internship at Dean Witter, a stock brokerage. The internship, which offers Chris a very long shot at a better life, doesn't pay any salary. Chris has to live without a salary for six months while risking just about everything for that long shot gamble.<br/><br/>Chris is really smart. He can solve a Rubrik's cube in minutes. But, he's poor. Poverty, like an octopus, keeps trying to suck him down to the bottom, and make him stay there.<br/><br/>His car is towed. His wife walks out on him, leaving him with a five year old son. He is arrested for unpaid traffic tickets. He becomes homeless. He has to rely on a homeless shelter.<br/><br/>All this while, he must appear for work in the morning in a suit and tie, and be ready to charm some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the Bay Area. These people take wealth so much for granted that two of them stiff him for cab fare.<br/><br/>Having lived through similar experiences, I cringed throughout this movie. My stomach hurt. I winced. I cried. I hugged my knees to my chest.<br/><br/>The movie is very accurate, but painful to watch. I hope a lot of rich people, who think that they understand poverty, see it.<br/><br/>This movie will be politically controversial. First of all, it doesn't touch the race issue with a ten foot pole. For example, when Chris appears to stiff a taxi driver for fare (it was really the rich white guy who failed to pay), the taxi driver never uses the ""n"" word. In real life, I think he probably would have.<br/><br/>Is the movie afraid to talk about race, or does it not want to? I don't know, but I know that some will protest the movie's not shoving race in the movie goer's face. I'm not one of those people. The movie's approach to race -- treating it as almost incidental -- worked for me. As a poor white person, I can tell you that poor white people face the same obstacles Chris did.<br/><br/>Second, does the movie sell the message that if you work hard, you will succeed, no matter what, and does that message tell the truth about success in America? I think that the movie is open to interpretation. Some will see it as an indictment of poverty in America. The scene of carefree rich people driving past the line to get into a homeless shelter is pretty devastating. Other people will become angry because they believe that the movie's depiction of hard work leading to rewards, in some cases, is too facile. I disagree, but that's what you'll hear.<br/><br/>Third, is this movie meant to chastise black men who abandon their children? Chris is a role model exactly because he moves heaven and earth to be a good father to his son. This will be debated back and forth.<br/><br/>The movie has a big philosophical statement to make, that has been lost on many reviewers, for example, Richard Schickel in TIME.<br/><br/>Chris is shown running throughout the movie. Remember the title of the movie: ""The PURSUIT of Happiness."" Chris places emphasis on ""pursuit."" Jefferson, when he penned the Declaration of Independence, did not promise Americans happiness, but only the right to pursue it. Chris says, at one point in the movie, paraphrase, ""I am happy right now. It is a fleeting moment."" We experience happiness in eyeblinks. The rest of the time we, like Chris, are chasing after it."

","I was fortunate to see this movie in a screening. I really enjoyed it, and felt that it lived up to the teary and heartwarming trailer. While the movie has an uplifting ""go for your dreams"" message, the deepest theme is that of family.<br/><br/>Will Smith did a great job as the father trying to protect his son from their circumstances of becoming homeless as much as he can, while at the same time trying to work in the competitive world of stocks as an un-paid intern. Jaden Smith was outstanding as the preschool-aged kid who knows things are going wrong and tries to have a stiff upper lip, but just can't do it all the time.<br/><br/>The story is very touching and was close to home for me. My family has been through some tough times, and this movie just reminded me of how much my parents struggled to provide for our family and yet kept life fun as much as they could. I am excited to go see this with my parents as a way to say thank you."

"jellienellie818","10","206","268","16 December 2006"," Amazing!
","I have been a fan of Will Smith for years and I have to say this may be his best film yet! ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is just a wonderful (based on a true) story, full of adventure, hope, and pain. I saw the movie last night in a packed theater. Big Willie Weekend has returned, and for good reason! It's a great movie to see during the holidays and definitely a tear-jerker! Perfect for a date, a night out with friends, or even with family. If you ever thought Will Smith really couldn't act (and shame on you!), you'll think otherwise once you see this movie. You can really feel what he's going through just by looking in his eyes. And Jaden Smith is too adorable! Their on screen chemistry is almost unbearable to watch! Go see this movie! Great acting, great directing, great writing...you won't regret it!"
"lisa_ann_sanders","10","225","294","14 December 2006"," Meaningful and Uplifting
","My husband and I had an opportunity to attend a screener of this movie last night. We had seen several commercials and a trailer for the film and we had high hopes, we were not disappointed. Many times ""inspired by"" films feel like hard sells or bids for Oscar glory. ""Pursuit of Happiness"" is none of that. This is an honest, meaningful film that will stay with you long after you leave the theatre. The viewer becomes fully invested in the struggles of Chris Gardner and his son. Will and Jadyn Smith deserve huge kudos. The real-life father and son dynamic enriched the film and don't know if other actors could have been as powerful. Be warned, there are several tissue inducing moments. This movie is well worth a ticket!"
"nwsurfrider","9","175","234","7 December 2006"," Great performances, inspiring story
","I was involved with one of the first test audiences almost a year ago, and came away quite impressed with the acting performances and heartfelt punch of Pursuit of Happiness. This is easily one of Smith's best films, as he pours his heart and soul into the main character. While the plot may remain a bit transparent, it leaves you asking the question of yourself - how long would you keep battling to get what you really want out of life? I plan on seeing the film again when it releases to the general public, and am very interested to see what changes were made after running it through the test screenings. As I saw it then, it needed very few, if any, changes."

","If you ever wanted to see a movie that portrayed what really makes a man, then you must see this movie.<br/><br/>Forget Stalone. Forget Arnold. Forget Bond. Forget all those romantic comedy whimps. Bruce Willis never had to make this many life threatening decisions in Die Hard.<br/><br/>Will Smith gives a better performance of toughness here than he did portraying Muhammed Ali. <br/><br/>This movie is raw. This movie will force you to examine your manhood. See if you can look in the mirror after watching this film.<br/><br/>Fathers, don't let the PG-13 rating fool you. This movie is not for kids. If you let your child see this movie you may regret it. Your child may never be able to look at you the same way again. Your child will wonder why you are not more like Chris Gardner."
"Godsmack04","10","180","245","19 December 2006"," Amazing
","This is one of the best films of this year. For a year that was fueled by controversy and crap, it was nice to finally see a film that had a true heart to it. From the opening scene to the end, I was so moved by the love that Will Smith has for his son. Basically, if you see this movie and walk out of it feeling nothing, there is something that is very wrong with you. Loved this movie, it's the perfect movie to end the year with. The best part was after the movie, my friends and I all got up and realized that this movie had actually made the four of us tear up! It's an amazing film and if Will Smith doesn't get at least an Oscar Nom, then the Oscars will just suck. In fact Will Smith should actually just win an Oscar for this role.!!! I loved this movie!!!! Everybody needs to see especially the people in this world that take everything for granted, watch this movie, it will change you!"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","52","73","3 January 2007"," I'm still wiping the tears from my eyes
","I was so hesitant to see The Pursuit of Happiness for one reason, this movie looked like an incredible tear jerker, just from the trailer I was nearly crying. But my friend and I had been hearing incredible reviews about this movie, so we decided to suck it up and see the movie today and we were just blown away by how amazing Will Smith's performance was. He and his son were just so incredibly heart warming and really reminded you of the important things in life. I was so touched by Chris's story, he was so determined, this movie makes you wanna go out and achieve your dreams and to never let anyone tell you what is right and what is wrong, what you can and cannot do.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner is a struggling salesmen trying just to make the rent, buy food, and take the best care of his son that he possibly can. When his wife leaves him and his son to go get a better life, Chris is left on his own, but he wins an internship at a stocks broker company that is very competitive. Against incredible odds, he just pulls through the ultimate lows of life and keeps his head up with his son by his side. They become homeless, living in hotels, homeless shelters, and even a cruddy subway bathroom! But Chris holds on to his ultimate dream of being happy and giving him and his son the life they truly deserve.<br/><br/>This movie in every way possible is perfect, it was so brilliantly made and just so inspiring. Will Smith better be nominated for an Oscar next month! This was an incredible performance and his son was just so cute, I guess talent really does run in his family. :) I would highly recommend The Pursuit of Happiness this year! It was a beautiful film that makes you feel like you can achieve anything you truly put you heart too, I just wish I brought more tissues! <br/><br/>10/10"
"AgentDice","9","27","36","21 October 2013"," You got a dream... You gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it.
","No one would make a movie about a guy struggling to succeed who doesn't ultimately succeed. Certainly, no one would make a Will Smith movie about a guy who breaks under the strain of his difficult life, abandons his child and dies. That's just not going to happen. And because we know that -- because we've seen more than one movie in our lives -- ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" has a particular challenge: To take the real-life rags-to-riches story of stockbroker Chris Gardner, a story with a preordained happy ending, and imbue it with tension and suspense.<br/><br/>The great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny. It may have seemed that way from the trailer: Will Smith tells his son, ""Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me."" But in context, even that moment isn't cloying. The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life -- it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real.<br/><br/>Gabriele Muccino (""L'Ultimo Bacio"") directed it, and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerra's score, with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality, and in Muccino's very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981, in this case, but some things don't change -- and he films them in a way that we're always aware: Our hero works hard. He's doing everything he can, and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part, just an extra push of bad luck, he might land on those streets, and with such a thud he might never rise.<br/><br/>As in all rags-to-riches tales, we find the protagonist, Chris, unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him they're not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually, the treatment of the wife is the first hint that ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie, with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around: Chris has it bad.<br/><br/>In fact, he is an extraordinary man, but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and, realizing that his resume looks weak, he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film, had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence, he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient, never indulging in anger, never letting anyone else's mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then, things don't improve right away.<br/><br/>Having proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy, ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smith's own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship, while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it weren't for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial, he and his son often wouldn't eat.<br/><br/>Will Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need. Frankly, I don't know where he found it; Smith was touched by luck at a very young age. Yet he does find it. In the taxicab scene, in which he tries to impress a prospective employer by solving the Rubik's Cube, and in every other scene in which Chris has to sit or stand there smiling while another man pronounces on his fate, Smith is right there with the right emotions: absolute hope and total terror.<br/><br/>This film is an amazing heartfelt performance certain to influence and motivate its audience to reach new heights. This film is based on a true gripping and dramatic story about a man who has nothing and his struggle toward success. The plot development can be slow but offers a lot of insight towards character development and explore these themes about patience and success and especially what motivates us and keeps us going. I recommend for everyone to watch this, whether rich businessman, student, or teacher for this will change everyone's perspective on life.<br/><br/>In short - Amazing movie. Very poignant, relevant and uplifting. Leaves you thinking about it for days!!"
"Chris_Kirk","Null","29","44","21 March 2007"," The Pursuit of Capitalysm
","""Happiness"" is equated with being a successful capitalist. The film is as narrow-minded as its protagonist. Why is life so extraordinarily difficult? This is is not explored. Are there other alternatives to the life he has chosen? Not at all. Will Smith's performance is the only thing holding this tacky film together. He is a two-dimensional man in a one-dimensional world. Remove the cohesion of his performance and the film becomes a series of set-pieces on overcoming adversity. The film is called The Pursuit of Happiness when what he is actually pursuing is a job, which in the film brings him nothing but misery and difficulty. The misspelling of ""happyness"" comes from a mural on his son's kindergarten wall. Ironically, the only thing resembling ""happyness"" in the film is the man's relationship with his son, which is strong and intimate throughout, not something he really needs to pursue. Are the filmmakers aware of this irony? It seems unlikely, considering the film's thesis is: work incomprehensibly hard and maybe you will get a job in which you have to work equally hard for the rest of your life. The perfect anti-capitalist weapon for those able to stand outside of the film's emotional manipulation. For those who buy the emotion wholesale, they are given no reason to do other than continue their pursuit of happiness without actually being able to enjoy it. Because life doesn't have a ""happily ever after""."

"alicante22","10","22","36","8 January 2007"," best acting performances of the year so far
","This year is but 9 days old, and I already know I have seen the best movie of the year. The history books will show that this film was released in 2006, but nothing from that year can compare to this either, so it is in my opinion the best movie of two years! Will Smith plays a struggling single father trying to make the best life that he can for his family and for himself. The part is played to perfection, and shows a true master of the craft. His comic timing is still evident in the lighter moments, but it is his sincerity in playing a man with no options, no family, no help and little hope that shows him shining.<br/><br/>Special praise should also be reserved for Will's own son Jaden, who plays Christopher Gardner Jnr. Some people hate child actors, but its perhaps that they are not good child actors... Jaden is a great one. I challenge anyone to point to a scene where he even gives the slightest of hints that he is acting... perhaps it was perfect casting to put a real father and son together here, as they are an outstanding double act playing themselves in different, more downtrodden circumstances.<br/><br/>I rarely give movies a full 10, but this throughly deserved it, and should be an example to us all on how movies should be made, and even how we look at our own lives and wonder if we are living up to our own potential in our own ""pursuit of happiness"" Outstanding."
"clonazepampwnage","1","84","164","28 August 2009"," Libertarian propaganda.
","In this movie you see a poverty stricken man make it to the top by kissing rich mens butts and working for free in competition with others who have nothing to lose (literally, they are all rich/high class and just in it for the sake of finding a career to make daddy proud). The moral of the story is typical of the Libertarians who produced this film. Serve your wall street masters well enough and perhaps they'll bring you in for a piece of the pie someday, but don't expect anything until you've already given them everything you've got. This movie is horribly unrealistic despite being loosely based on some elements of a true story. If you believed in the message displayed in this movie then you would work 60 hours a week for little to no pay and then find a pot of gold so to speak when you needed it the most. This movie tries to make the claim that there are no failures in a capitalist society except for losers who are unwilling to go the extra mile everyday in their work and that those bust their butts and routinely bend over are greatly rewarded and when they are not it's because they didn't sacrifice enough of themselves, thus they are just losers but the system of having wall street yuppies rule the masses is perfect. This movie is so often misunderstood as a triumph story that it is ridiculous. This movie is a Libertarian attack on fair markets and mixed economy politics. It blatantly shoves the idea down your throat that to make it in America you're supposed to slave away for people who have it way better off than you do and if you do it long enough and well enough than you will be rewarded with the trickle down effect and if you're not so rewarded then you were a loser and any society would be better off without you anyway. That truly is the point and message of this whole movie. If you don't get it then read about Libertarianism and watch the movie again."
"magiuly","5","26","45","9 February 2007"," The pursuit of money
","I didn't like the movie because is expected and plays on good sentiments. It talks about the American dream. It is so too much American, that is banal. They say that it is based on a true story but in my opinion that takes things to extremes. Really during all the film I was wondering why he wouldn't find an easier job, since he had a son! Then it sounds like if you don't try to pursuit the dream you are either stupid or doesn't really have one. Life is a little bit more complicated. How responsible is a father who lets his son sleeping in tube's bathroom or not sleeping at all? More than the pursuit of happiness it seems the pursuit of money at any cost."
"dfranzen70","4","31","55","22 May 2007"," Sad, in the unfortunate, crappy way
","There are undoubtedly two camps of people who watched this film: those who start to tear up at the very hint of a Very Special Movie, and those who rely a little on logic and, I dunno, sense; those who, that is, want the movie to work a little to earn tears, not the other way around.<br/><br/>Guess which group I'm in.<br/><br/>Chis Gardner (Will Smith) is a salesman of sorts - he sells scanners to medical professionals that are supposed to be more detailed than x-ray machines, and much more expensive. He bought a whole bunch of them years ago and has been selling them to doctors and hospitals ever since, only sales have stagnated somewhat, and he's struggling big time. Now, me, in this situation, might, perhaps, get another job, one that paid something, anything to keep food on the table for my wife (Thandie Newton) and son (Jaden Smith).<br/><br/>But Chris isn't like me. Instead, after bumping into a rich-looking white dude, he decides he wants to be a stockbroker and applies (after many contrivances) for an internship at Dean Witter. Only, oops! It's not a paying internship! But Chris doesn't know that, and neither does wife Linda, who works double shifts at a hospital. Are you seeing the picture here? The mother works her hands to the bone, the dad is a shiftless loser who can't sell crappy scanners that no one needs, and what's the wise papa do? Why, chases a dream. Because if there's any time that's just made for chasing dreams, it's when you have a wife and kids and are a couple months behind in your rent and haven't paid your taxes yet for the year.<br/><br/>Naturally, after Chris makes this decision and when the scanner sales slow down even more, Linda has enough and bolts for some nebulous waitressing job on the other side of the country. Up until this point, she was easily the stronger, more viable, and more responsible of the parents. But then we wouldn't get this touching plot of a father bonding with his son, so out goes Linda. (Yes, I know this is based on a true story, but I imagine some of these plot devices are fictions from the screenwriter.) Speaking of plot devices, as Chris blows off landlord after landlord, he and young Christopher are kicked out of their home, and then a motel, and they sleep on buses, in bathrooms, anywhere. This is supposed to show how Chris will suffer for his son, that he loves him so much and is trying so hard to make his life better. The trouble is, nearly all of Chris's problems were caused by... you guessed it, Chris himself. We can all relate, I'm sure, to The Man keeping us down; we struggle and make a little progress, only to be pushed back down by creditors, Johnny Law, our bosses, and so on. Sometimes fate does conspire against us. But it didn't feel like that was wholly the case here. Chris is outraged to get a notice from the IRS placing a lien on his bank account. Why is he outraged? Linda even reminded him to take care of the taxes, and Chris actively said he'd just keep filing extensions. This is no one's fault but Chris Gardner's.<br/><br/>The trouble is, you really want to feel for Chris. He knows that if he works hard and is fortunate, he can emerge from the unpaid internship with a paid job as a broker at Dean Witter. A great goal to have, of course. It just seems strange that he felt that the most viable option to him was to work as a stockbroker. He couldn't take a menial job or two to scrape up enough money to pay taxes or, heck, rent a room? God forbid. In a telling scene, Chris explodes outside a mission that had just announced it had no more room. I'm paraphrasing, but as Chris argued with a man who'd cut in front of him in line (thus denying him entrance to the mission), he mentions that he had to run from his job to get to the line in time. Whoa, wait, hold up a sec there, Chris. You're in a line of homeless people. You might not wanna mention that you have a JOB. Most of the rest of these folks, you see, don't have a job. That is why they are homeless. You came off as a major jerk. Again, not someone worthy of our pity.<br/><br/>So who is? Christopher, the young'un, surely is. What's he done to deserve this crappy parenting? His mom basically abandons him with no fight at all, and his dad chooses a tenuous unpaid job over a paycheck. Jaden Smith was critically lauded for his wonderful work here, and he was much more deserving of an Oscar nomination than his old man, who seemed to be praised merely for not playing Will Smith. At least we didn't get yet another rendition of Smith's ""Oh, HELL no!"" exclamations. But the kid was very good, and adorable to boot.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast isn't on screen enough to make much of an impression; they're all just window dressing to the relationship between father and son. James Karen is unintentionally amusing as the Great White Father to Smith's broker, needlessly upping the smarm factor. Because, you know, brokerage firms never seem to have enough smarm.<br/><br/>All in all, a disappointment unless you just treat it as a low-grade TV movie about someone persevering against long odds, cheerfully ignoring the fact that those odd were made long by that same person. Bear in mind, though, that the movie is merely based on a true story, that many liberties were taken to accentuate the supposed struggles of Chris and Christopher."
"Ultimatelistguy","10","49","92","15 December 2006"," Best Movie of the Year
","This has to be the best movie of 2006. It is without a doubt the performance of Will Smith's career, and anyone who says that that isn't saying much is crazy. I have just finished seeing the movie in the theater and was moved more than any movie since Titanic. I am a very hard critic, I'll admit, but this was a gem among all the dull stones this year. It is not just the movie of the holiday season, it is a spectacular story. The parts of the movie that have been criticized, mainly by those that have yet to see the film, are easily negated by watching the movie. The story wasn't about Mr. Gardner and his wife/girlfriend-it was about him, his son, diligence, hope, happiness, and so much more. It is so refreshing to be inspired by a film again. There was plenty of chemistry between Gardner and his son. Will Smith can act. Like he says in the movie, and I'm paraphrasing, ""People will tell you that you can't do it because they can't."" That's what I say to anyone who questions the writing or directing of this film. You mock what you cannot do yourself. This is utter brilliance, ten stars."
"marion-j-wilson","2","54","103","29 January 2007"," Well made film, hated it
","Am I the only person who saw this film and hated it? The main problem for me was that Will Smith's character irritated me to death. All his problems seemed to me to be of his own making. We see him buying up his stock of scanners before his child is born. This means he has at least 5 years to realise that he isn't making enough money to survive and to get a proper job.<br/><br/>What's admirable about a guy who is still running round trying to sell a product he knows is unpopular (and probably out of date by this stage) when he knows he is not paying his rent, not paying his child care, running a car he doesn't need (why not take the bus?) and ducking out of all his responsibilities? His wife is working two jobs and is exhausted and he is still constantly leaving her to pick up the pieces while he runs around town chasing sales. He's supposed to be intelligent but he doesn't even appear to have a rudimentary grasp of how to manage his finances. Why can't he get another job? Why not work two jobs? Somehow we're supposed to feel sorry for him. All I felt was intense irritation and an overwhelming urge to tell him to pull himself together.<br/><br/>This film seems to be pushing the message that if you have a dream and go for it you will succeed. All I can say is, it's a pity he didn't try a bit harder before he got into this mess.<br/><br/>Unbelievable."

","The plot of this movie is about the pursuit of money, not happiness - unless you think that money equals happiness. The film itself isn't too bad, although a lot of the time you feel very frustrated. The endless running around while lugging that machine is like a nightmare. The metaphor of the burden isn't lost on me but I wish they'd fixed it sooner to save my throat from yelling at the screen for him to throw it away. The acting too is pretty good on the whole and maybe an American audience does equate money with happiness; the honesty of the plot and premise would seem to suggest so as there's no hint of irony in the use of the word and the goal of cash. It wasn't like he even wanted to be a stockbroker, it was just a way of making money. The plot device of having him see all the smiling stockbrokers (in possession of happiness) doesn't help, in fact it makes it worse as here too the movie is equating simple wealth with happiness. Maybe it is the American dream and I just don't get it. For the record, I've got nothing against wealth and money, I'm all for it, but I wouldn't create a story called 'The Pursuit of Happiness' (sic), then make the whole thing about the pursuit of money. Just my million cents worth..."
"jhuni_x","1","66","131","3 May 2009"," Pursuit of Money
","This movie is propaganda just like seven pounds! Even though people say it is a true story I am sure it has many distortions to support the message of greed. This movie is basically saying from the beginning that money equates to happiness. I mean Will Smith walks by and he sees a bourgeoisie stock broker and he says that person is so happy I want to be like him and then they show how it is apparently so sad to live in poverty in America. Well this movie is not true because money does not equate to happiness people are happy in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal even when they are really poor. People in America have more suicides then in any other place.<br/><br/>It is obvious if you watch this movie closely that it has the message of equating wealth with happiness. Well why didn't Chris Gardner just get a real job instead? There are plenty of jobs out there other then stock broker that he could of got six months earlier or that he could of gotten instead of trying to sell those scanners he invested himself in.<br/><br/>A stock broker is not a real job - a stock broker is somebody who professes in ""buying and selling shares through the stock market"" which is basically another way of saying I steal money from the people who do real work well I sit back and live off of their efforts. When I say real work I mean the people who are mining ores out of the mountains, doing construction, farming, engineering products, etc. Stock brokers steal money from those workers who are treated poorly. Do you how many homeless people would be off the streets right now if Chris Gardner would give up just a small portion of his 165 million dollars? I mean there is no reason he needs more then one million dollars to support himself and a large family.<br/><br/>One thing someone is seriously going to have to explain to me though is why the heck did he keep selling people those scanners if he knew he was ripping people off and it wasn't working very well? He should have put his sales work aside and get a real job I mean there are thousands of them available. I am sorry but I have no reason to give this more then a 1/10."
"dgreatgnazzini","3","11","17","2 January 2007"," Good Acting - But Is happiness equated with posterity?
","I was generally pleased with the acting by Will Smith and supporting cast in the movie. His character was fairly realistic. However, I was expecting more in the way of a story. Several things in the movie really bothered me. <br/><br/>**** SPOILERS APLENTY FOLLOW **** I went to the movie expecting a depiction of a man who overcame homelessness and sadness and worked hard to become successful. (Maybe as a doctor or social worker or Teacher) Having watched ""Blood Diamond"" last week where death, torture and greed and mayhem ran rampant, I could not bring myself to feel sad for Chris and his son's homelessness / plight. However, I was really saddened that the man found success as a stockbroker in a boiler room. Does this make people happy in the US? Are we capitalistic Americans expected to fall prey to the capitalistic ideology where money = happiness? Did becoming a stockbroker make him happy because he became rich? A few acquaintances of mine are brokers and I know this is a high pressure job with long hours that tends to fully consume people. Does he really need a Lamborghini / Ferrari to feel happy. The movie shows Chris's bio after he got the job when the movie was over. However several key questions were unanswered. What happened to Chris's son? What happened to his Wife? The movie stopped when he got the job. Also Based upon his lifestyle, Chris Gardner and his wife could have made rent / food working part time at a 7-11. Many immigrants start out making ends meet doing menial jobs and are quite happy. Chris mentioned that he was the man with the ""Ten Gallon Head"" growing up (i.e. a brainiac) but what let him to skip college, hook up with his chain smoking wife and sell bone scanners? I think the audience is owed more information. I would really like to know how much of the story is real?"
"Chris_Docker","5","24","43","25 January 2007"," A two hour pursuit where we know the ending
","The relaxing opening music and reassuring title suggest this will be a warm fuzzy feelgood movie with a nice star turn from Will Smith. The switch to grainy film and self-consciously natural performances start to eat away at such assumptions. Will Smith plays the rags-to-riches father, but wades through heartbreaking poverty before he can climb the ladder to apprentice stockbroker, all the time bonding and maintaining good spirits with his son whom he loves dearly.<br/><br/>The title, from the Declaration of Independence, affirms the American Dream. We might wish that Will Smith, for all his acting skill (his performance is the best thing about the film) could expedite it a little more - two hours, when the end is a foregone conclusion, feels like labouring the point. The clunky story comes to rely overmuch on the undoubted chemistry between father and son (played by Will Smith's real life son) and one of the best performances of Smith's career. Its main achievement is its heartfelt depiction of fatherhood.<br/><br/>It might well be 'inspired by a real story', as the credits claim, but the broken-marriage, salesman-down-on-his-luck, yet fighting-through-to-a-better-day, is formulaic in the extreme. Smith sells bone density scanners - an item he has bought many of in the hope of making a profit. Although he has the ability to solve a Rubik cube in a short taxi ride, he still manages to lose his scanners repeatedly, providing repetitious sub-plots as he struggles to retrieve them.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes is when father and son, homeless, are stranded in a subway station. Dad pretends that the bone density scanner is a time machine as a game to distract the young lad from the seriousness of their situation. They sleep in a disused latrine, perfectly dressed - Smith has to attend broker induction classes in the morning.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness holds a nice idea, but one that could be told in a half hour TV slot. Its suggestion that happiness is equivalent to money grates somewhat on the non-American ear, especially considering the film's relentlessly didactic tone. A great vehicle for Smith to show his talents as a serious actor, but not a movie that in any other way comes up to the standards he admirably sets."

","Having seen I Am Legend, I've become an instant Will Smith fan, and ran out to rent his older works.<br/><br/>Though Will does a commendable, classy acting job in the role, the film itself just did not work. On the most basic level, the pacing was off...halfway through the film it just started to drag (you begin to wish they'd just get on with it...we know he's going to get the job, let's at least see him at Dean Witter a little more, watch him go through the training and the frustrations there as well.) And as for the problems Will's character faces along the way: 1) They started to get a little ridiculous after awhile. The scanners are stolen twice, he gets hit by a car (and no, these particular crisis didn't happen in the real life story, from what I understand. So it's just Hollywood embellishment.) 2) I couldn't help thinking - along with some other readers - that some of the problems were his own fault. He *should* have given his son to his wife...a man with no income should *not* be trying to raise a son. And--as pointed out in another post--he had known for some time that the scanner business wasn't panning out...yet he persists, forcing his wife to work double shifts, letting both rent and taxes fall dangerously behind. Dude, that's when you get ANY job that pays the bills and put the sales work aside. It never should have gotten to that point at all.<br/><br/>That's my five cents. Loved Will Smith, thought the movie just didn't work. Thank God there's I Am Legend..."

I got no inspiration from a film.... showing a father... too stubborn and prideful to do what was best for his kids comfort and safety! Inpirational films feature sympathetic characters, who have run out of options, yet overcome adversity anyway! Chris Gardner, as portrayed in the film, had many options that he didn't bother to explore, because of his foolish pride, his stubbornness, and his quest for the fat buck! He could have allowed his son to go to NY with his ex-wife, but chose to use his child as a pawn, to punish his wife, for bailing on the marriage! He had the opportunity to let his son stay at a shelter for abused wives and children, ensuring his son'e safety, but again...his foolish pride wouldn't permit it, and Gardner thought it was better for his son to sleep on a public restroom floor, than for them to ""be apart""! Maybe someday, someone will come forward, to tell the real story of how Gardner got into such a financial hole in the first place. His lack of sales success, and his wife working double shifts as a waitress, isn't a justifiable reason for the kind of money woes they were in, as the movie began! My father had to retire in 1969 due to a heart condition, and my mother managed to take care of a mortgage and bills, a sick husband, and raise 4 kids, on a full time waitress' salary.....so I don't know what Chris Gardner and his wife were doing with their money!

"DJMrB","8","18","31","14 January 2007"," Possibly the most important movie you will ever see if you've ever felt that life can be cruel
","In preparation for writing this comment, which I am compelled to write for reasons which will become clear, I read a fair few of the major critics to see, if on this occasion, they had seen and felt what I had.<br/><br/>James Bernadelli suggests this film should be known as the ""Pursuit of Richness""; another column I have read suggests that the money-will-solve-your-problems resolution is depressing and not the message Hollywood (or art in general) should be trying to put across.<br/><br/>I ask myself when the last occasion might have been that any of these critics genuinely had to :spoiler: run, under painful, embarrassing duress, from a cab - because they didn't have the money; or when the forces of life seemed to conspire against them so unfairly that they broke down in tears. Spoiler: when your wealthy boss, who you CANNOT disappoint, asks you to borrow the last five dollars in your wallet, and you know that that money is all you have in the world - to feed your family, to pay your gas.<br/><br/>You go through times in life when you feel that things couldn't possibly get worse - and then they do - and then they do again. Sometimes, (like Chris and son at the beach towards the end of the film) you just want to get away from it all, other times you cry. Sometimes, and this is rare, you laugh - because if you don't you'll cry. You know that if you let it all become too much, you will sink to the bottom of the sea.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner (not the real one perhaps, but the one in this movie) is my personal hero; my shining example; my inspiration - the guy that never allows himself to sink - even when he can feel his shoelaces trailing on the seabed.<br/><br/>I realised as I was watching this film that I was watching another me, so I never once stopped rooting for Chris. When he :spoiler: fixes the scanner in the shelter, I felt like I had fixed it.<br/><br/>I'm still working on getting the job that earns me enough to have a less painful life - when Chris finally achieves it, I want it for him so badly that I feel it in the very fibre of my being.<br/><br/>I suppose that it doesn't matter that much that Chris wants to succeed as much for his son as for himself. In a way, the fact that Chris has a son makes this movie emotionally frightening and if (and only if) our basest fears are being toyed with by the director, it is only in exactly the same way that we sometimes look up in to the sky and say - like Jim Carrey in ""Bruce Almighty"" - is there anything else you could possibly do to me today? In my life, God doesn't appear and explain why he keeps toying with me. The truest belief is in oneself and one must never lose it.<br/><br/>I adore this movie and I couldn't be more grateful for its existence. It comes at a time when I need it most. Its message: Keep going - never, ever give up.<br/><br/>And so I come back to those reviewers. Money certainly doesn't mean happiness in this existence, but no money, in this cruel capitalist world, can cost you your life. Do not be judgmental of those who want more, it might just be enough to pay for their son to eat, to keep a roof over his head, to keep their dignity. This film is not about rags-to-riches as some reviewers have said. It's not about the American dream either. It is about dignity and integrity and how money (or lack thereof) could easily strip you of both.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner never loses either and for this, he is an inspiration to us all.<br/><br/>See this film TODAY."

In fact, you could have written the entire script on the back of a napkin during your lunch break. Only you would have been hard pressed to come up with a story quite so bland and unimaginative.<br/><br/>What is worse is that this is a film that effectively praises the central character for dragging his child onto the street to satisfy his own pursuit, not of ""happyness"", but of money in his pure greed to get a job with a big money finance company.<br/><br/>Will Smith simply plays himself, to the point of falling back on his Prince of Bel Air vocabulary on more than one occasion and Thandie Newton does her best to portray a character with no depth.<br/><br/>The occasional 80's reference scores nostalgia points and Jaden Smith delivers what little is asked of him but overall this is 145 mins of my life that would have been better spent doing the ironing, and probably more enjoyably spent at that."

I kept watching this movie thinking 'ah this must be where he gets his big break' but unfortunately he seems to bumble along, somehow attracting the kind of misfortune that seems as unlikely as someone actually winning a lottery. <br/><br/>Half way through the film I'm thinking 'ah this must be the turning point, he's bound to get that big piece of luck now...' No it's more of the same, the odds are stacked against him like an force 10 hurricane, oh and the kid's brought along for the ride too. <br/><br/>The Gardner character comes across as hapless - I don't think I've ever witnessed one character running so much! (usually because he's late/held up) He sprints to catch a bus, he sprints retrieve a device, he sprints for the train, he sprints to make an interview, he sprints to get to work, he sprints out of work, he sprints to make an appointment, he sprints pretty much everywhere. Will Smith must have been one very fit actor after this film. Maybe it's what the director thought represented desperation - 'hey how about we have someone running a lot, like they're always late?' <br/><br/>Oh and Gardner keeps losing his medical device/machine, the one he needs to sell, was the real life character really that inept? I hoped the film would end quickly just so he could find whatever this happiness was. The only happy thing about the film was when it ended - it meant I didn't have watch it any more."

Nothing was mentioned about social services investigations, reports of bruises and filth covering his son from the living conditions, the fact the internship was awarded by default due to requirements of public companies to hire minorities. Without affirmative action, I personally would have not had the opportunities I have had since the 80s. The movie would have been lovely had I not read about the real story. The real story should be shown to parents on how not to raise your children and the compromises that must be made professionally in order to provide safety and security to children. Two jobs working blue collar would have kept a roof over the child and food on the table. Chasing dreams can come later when your Child's needs are first secure. Also, the minimum internship hours in the 80s for a stockbroker were 80 to 100 hours a week. If he was leaving before 5:00 PM each day without explanation, it should be clear skin shade and the scare of stiff penalties for not hiring a % minority was the most likely scenario."

Both movies have the same rating on IMDb.com and this is frankly not the case. ""The pursuit of happiness"" is a remix of the ""one in a million"" idea: one guy against all odds, facing the worst situation, makes it. I know this is a true story, but the story of *just one* who ""makes it"" (which can be compared to a lottery win - because how *many* people are out there trying?) may lead to the illusion that - as long as you ""want"" - you *can* make it. Sort of ""hang on"" movie. ""Los lunes al sol"" instead shows you what happens to the rest - to the non - Chris Gardeners of this world and is much more realistic.

I know that this was based on a true story, and it is always interesting to see how much creative license is taken. I actually think that the movie made Chris Gardner's journey look much easier than it probably was. For example, IMDb says that his son was actually only 18 months old, which adds diapers to the situation. And with the exception of the scene where they spend the night locked in a subway bathroom, Will Smith keeps himself a bit more cool and collected than you'd expect from even an extraordinary character like Gardner.

","The Pursuit of Happiness is this year's Academy Awards entry for ""Cloying, Sappy, Feel-Good Film of the Year"". Ostensibly, it tries to show us the trials and tribulations one might have to face to pursue a simple thing such as happiness. The point is achieved, QED and all, by its tenth minute as the film heaps plague upon plague on the hapless protagonist. Remember The Passion of the Christ with its spiked whips, betraying best friends, and sadistic guards? A more modern setting for it might have been the ""cruel"" world in which our hero struggles to make ends meet. By the end of its two-hour running time, even the most naive and maudlin members of the audience will have long lost any signs of compassion and empathy.<br/><br/>The film follows Christopher Gardner (based on the real-life millionaire entrepreneur) as he struggles with homelessness, fatherhood, and poverty, while trying to get his foot in the door of a brokerage firm. We see him longingly look at fancy cars, lush green lawns, and big houses, wondering when he can be in that position. The film is a two-hour chronicle of fate dealing scourges and whiplashes to this unfortunate man who only wants happiness through untold riches. One has to be a cold, heartless pessimist not to want him to win, right? Um, not so. Really, are we supposed to root for a guy whose idea of happiness is Merc convertibles and box-seats at a football game? Is someone like that really going to be happy after he gets that?<br/><br/>That the film is based on real-life events is hardly an excuse for the loads of clichés thrown in. The film almost begs to have its poetic license canceled as it tries every hackneyed trick in the book. The film takes predictable turns at each step of the way. At every step, Chris Gardner finds himself on the wrong side of Murphy's Law, being afflicted with almost every bad thing that could happen. Nauseatingly affected attempts to tug at our heart-strings fail miserably after about the hundredth time they are shown.<br/><br/>The film comes with all the trappings of a big-money production. Crisp camera-work (including the handycam-effect that seems to be all the rage these days), excellent lighting, and suitable music (although much of it is of the uninspired, feel-good kind), grace the film as well as any other output from those well-oiled machines. But none of that is enough to save this lumbering morass that begs for our pity and concern, when it almost has the opposite effect.<br/><br/>No kidding, folks. There is nothing in the film beyond what's in the seven words of the summary. I don't imagine it being too much fun for most to sit through a film to know that some guy, somewhere had a terrible time getting rich."

","I get the feeling that this was produced just because Will Smith has the clout to open up pretty much anything in Hollywood. I can see why he would be attracted to the story; it gives him a great chance to promote all the values that are right in life - Work hard, have integrity, never give up etc, and you'll make it in the end. That's a very positive message and it might even be true, plus there's the fact that it looks all the better coming from someone who's already made it, themselves. The trouble is, it forgets all those everyday people watching who are neither poor nor rich, have no direction to go on the ladder and are just stuck in a rut. What does it say to those folk? From my own experience I'd have to report that the answer really is: ""Not much"".<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. It's nice to see someone who pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and never gave up - even when they were truly at a low - it's nice to see a determined individual like that do well for themselves. Really it is. When the journey shown in getting to that goal is so relentlessly depressing and airless though, it drains a large part of the good intentions and morals from the story. If the most inspiring moment of the whole tale comes from reading the text of the coda on a black background at the end - without actually being shown evidence of this deserved success - then your film has problems. Mirroring what you're seeing in front of you, you spend all that time hoping for a good viewing experience, only to feel tripped up, over and over again."

If he really did that, he is one of them examples not to be followed. Although he succeeded and made a good life for him and his son, his reasoning is questionable. His story is one of personal luck - great great luck, mind you - but in similar cases the first thing a parent should do is to ensure the well-fare of his or her children, not chase some dream for better life. If you succeed at the first, then and only then go after the second.<br/><br/>The movie is not bad, it's actually quite good, but the aftertaste is the big problem. A movie of this kind must portray first of all responsibility towards your loved ones. This one is not.

","""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is one of the more painful to watch films I have ever seen. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film--but it's very hard watching the main character, as his life is an absolute mess and you really want to see him succeed in spite of a horrible series of downturns.<br/><br/>The film begins with Chris (Will Smith) playing a struggling father and husband. His salesman job is not working out at all--and that's a problem, as without sales he cannot get paid. At the same time, his wife is clearly not happy--and hates to have a failure for a husband--and she sees him as a failure. Beyond this, time and time again, he has many, many setbacks in life until eventually his wife leaves. Now, without a salary, he's trying to somehow work something out so he can keep his son, Christopher (Jaden Smith--Will's real life son). But, before things can get better, things get a lot worse...and it truly is painful to watch as he scrambles to somehow make it.<br/><br/>Whether or not you enjoy this film really depends on if you can stick with it. Considering how painful it becomes and how much you like the guy, it's a real chore to stick with it. No matter how many times bad things happen to Chris, it just keeps coming! But, on the other hand, the film is worth it if you stick with it. Will Smith's acting is just terrific--I was amazed how much he could convey with just his eyes. I can understand why he was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor for this film.

Your supposed to like Will Smith's character for the struggle he went through but it were merely six months of his life, and this guy was so despicable that he had no friends or family to help him out. He went through hell but he did by his own choice and he put his child through hell along with him. The kid would probably be better off with his mom, who did work and provided and cared about him. At least that's what they show in the movie.<br/><br/>And the part about the mom giving up her child, first they show us a hard working caring and loving mom and then all of a sudden she just leaves her son behind without any kind of fight, that is really hard to believe. Real people just does not act like that.<br/><br/>And then the end, his great achievement is to get the job and eventually build and sell a company for a lot of money. To be able to do that and still raise a child properly at the same time all by yourself must be really hard. That part I guess would be more interesting to watch. And see if the guy did as good job with his son as he did getting rich. Or just because he made more money and surely was able to pay for a better daycare should make it up for it.<br/><br/>All together the movie just wasn't believable, it is self promoting and absurd. And it even wasn't entertaining even my mom who did somehow liked it found it to be boring.<br/><br/>The acting is good I guess, as good as could be with those unrealistic characters except for the boy, who giving is supposed to be a five year old, seems blissfully unaware of their hardships and doesn't seems to miss his mom at all.<br/><br/>My only consolation is that I did not had to pay to see it, but I would rather spend those couple of hours doing something more productive, like trying to figure out a Rubik's Cube."
"gary-444","3","5","7","15 July 2007"," Mawkish, lumbering dross
","I viewed this film cold, knowing nothing about it, and left it cold. The tale of Chris Gardner,played by Will Smith, a down on his luck black travelling salesman, making good as a Stockbroker has narrative potential. But Director Gabriele Muccino, whose track record is hitherto with foreign language films, squanders it.<br/><br/>I didn't really like Chris Gardner.His pursuit of the stockbroker ""Dream"" is at the expense during the film, of a squalid life for his young son. His wife, played by Thandie Newton,has a horribly underwritten role. her inability to look after their son, at least in the short term, is never clear.<br/><br/>His co workers at the stockbrokers are all pretty shallow, and objectionable characters - is this really the dream that he is chasing? The narrative hinges on an ever increasing series of disasters and hurdles which impede his ""pursuit of happiness"". Yet the uplifting element required to counterbalance this in the minds of the audience never really works.<br/><br/>At 117 minutes the running time is a good 30 minutes too long. After 90 minutes I found myself saying to myself, ""look he gets the job at the end, can we just finish now?""<br/><br/>Essentially episodic in style, there are some good moments, and good characters, but Muccino fails to ""join up the dots"". For a film so dark and downbeat, racism and the cynicism of the financial world gets a super-gloss. The happiness that he finds at the end is a Stockbrokers job which subsequently earns him millions . Wow.<br/><br/>A total miss fire. This story should either have been rewritten as a straight comedy - and it could have worked as such, or as a cinema ""verite"" piece, warts and all. It wasn't, so it fails."

","I'm trying very hard to like this movie, but just can't get myself to do it. If it's supposed to be an inspirational feel-good movie, I think it fails big time. For one, it's complete torture to watch until the inevitable concluding events. Then it's just over, roll credits.<br/><br/>While Smith's characterization of the protagonist is charismatic, he is at times a considerable jerk and consistently makes poor choices for himself and his family. He takes custody of his boy, when he clearly is not the ideal choice. There is no excuse for forcing him to stay in shelters or a bathroom when the child could be living in a real home with his mother. He blows off people to whom he owes money, but is furious with his friend about the $14 that is owed him.<br/><br/>The message cannot be ""work hard and you can achieve your dreams,"" because none of the other hard-working interns were hired. And has been asked before, can happiness (or happy-ness as it were) be only achieved when one makes a great deal of money?"

","I just saw this movie, hoping to get some sincere comment about poverty. All I got was some sub par TV-movie about the American Dream. What where they thinking ? They are trying to sell us to same old nonsense again. If you just try hard enough you will succeed in everything. Well, maybe Chris Gardner succeeded in real life - and off course Will Smith does in this movie. But let's face facts : in reality 9 out of 10 people who find themselves in the situation Chris Gardner finds himself in will not succeed. They will starve, loose their child or end up in a dead end-job.<br/><br/>Okay. Will Smith was not that bad, his personality and his charm carry this film a very long way.

The main character comes out as if he were some sort of rags to riches superman. Quite stupid to say the least. The theme seems to be that the utmost happiness comes through getting a good paying job, as a stock broker in this case. In a super competitive environment, only very few can achieve such a status. What happens to the many who don't? Are they therefore condemned to unhappiness? Are stock brokers all really happy just because they have a good paying job? What is the author of this story, whether it's based on real life or not, really trying to say? That only the few privileged ones that manage to, through really hard work, get that special job are the ones whom deserve to reach happiness? I just don't get the whole thing.

"prbach","6","21","42","13 December 2006"," Will Smith's ""Happyness"" Is a Poor Black Man's Discontent
","I'm not sure what to think about Will Smith's new film, ""Pursuit of Happiness."" Of course Smith was as charismatic as usual, and the story blew me away.<br/><br/>A guy down on his luck loses his wife and apartment, but lands an unpaid internship at Dean Witter that promotes only one of twenty interns into paid stock brokers. The film is very aware of its milieu. It's 1981 in San Francisco and the streets are loaded with Chevy Novas, ads for De Niro's ""Raging Bull,"" people eating Clark bars, and big Afros (which perhaps explains my preoccupation with Soul Train).<br/><br/>Smith sells archaic-looking devices we're told are some kind of x-ray machines, bone density scanners was the term, but look like my grandma's hair dryers. He manages to sell enough of these to support him and his son in a cheap motel for over four months until they're forced onto the street.<br/><br/>On one hand the film is a testament to the spirit of Chris Gardner, the man who provides the real-life basis for the story. Somehow, in Smith's portrayal, he manages to make phone calls to brokerage clients and take classes by day, sell scanners and study by night, and smile all the time while keeping a smile on his son's face with jokes about the difference between ""probably"" and ""possibly,"" all the while seldom eating or sleeping.<br/><br/>That's the problem. Everything's a little too convenient. When bad luck strikes, such as when the IRS confiscates back taxes from Smith's character's bank account, it happens all at once, so as to coincide with other bad luck. That same day one of his scanners is inoperable during a sales call, and the motel manager bars him from his room for unpaid bills. Even more remarkable is that he and his son only blow up at each other once or twice through it all. They're complete saints. When luck finally starts working their way, it's fantastically moving (the screening audience actually cheered a couple of times). You leave the theater harrowed by Gardner's experience, but glad he got his in the end.<br/><br/>Which is disturbing. Not only because the filmmakers have so fully manipulated our emotions, but that they feel we can sympathize with a poor black man only if he's a saint against whom Circumstances (with an intentional capital ""C"") have conspired against. If he's a normally flawed human being, then he's caused his own misfortune and he's unsympathetic. Or so the filmmakers seem to reason. And probably broader society, too. The world would be much more threatening if we realized our misfortune results from fate or chance as much our conscious choices.<br/><br/>Perhaps it shouldn't be disappointing the filmmakers wanted to secure our sympathy rather than challenge our notions about the poor, especially poor minorities. But it seems like a brilliant story, whether the guy's a saint or not, and if it were told more realistically, it might've inspired a more meaningful sympathy."
"mrw8","2","8","13","24 May 2007"," Redundant as well as redundant
","I started fast forwarding about 9 minutes into this dreadful flick. OK, how many times do I have to see Will Smith chasing his bone density scanner? It wasn't funny the first time. It's called life. And anyone who has spent a day in San Francisco probably has better anecdotes to tell than this looong and redundant extended anecdote about how one guy made good. Note that I do NOT say this film demonstrates how WE ALL CAN DO GOOD. No. Maybe that was in the book since they left it out of the movie. This movie is an anecdote, a boring one, a petty one, that involves a child. Money leads to happiness: is the moral. Uh, what? Not just any money...Stock trading! Stock trading in the Reagan era '80s. Gee, why not make him invent bell bottom jeans in 1972? A monkey dressed like an astronaut could have traded stocks in the '80s.<br/><br/>If these filmmakers are ever chosen to make a movie about my life then kill me first. I was more interested in the homeless people than in Gardner's ""gotta survive"" attitude. Jeez. It was like someone said, ""How can we make a movie about Seabiscuit, except make it be a guy in the 1980's San Francisco?"" I know it was ""inspired by a true story"" but what isn't? There was not a single sentence that Smith could narrate without sounding hopelessly artificial. Narrating, chasing a bus, shaking hands, talking on phones. Useless, useless, useless. I'm sure on paper the thing smelled like an Oscar, but on the screen it was a yawn fest except maybe for some weepy single moms or depressed stock brokers. The end postlogue might as well have read ""Chris Gardner got really rich and bought all the nice stuff that he never had as a kid. He did this because he sold stocks while raising his own child after basically taking him from his mother."" Can you hear the applause? I give it one point because Smith and his kid are competent with the material. The material, however, belongs in readers digest ""Inspirational Anecdotes that are Nevertheless Forgettable"" edition."
"bburns","6","7","11","23 March 2007"," The father-son relationship is believable, but nothing else
","You almost always know you're in trouble at the movies when the opening titles say ""Inspired By a True Story"" instead of ""Based on a True Story"". This usually means that once a committee of hack screenwriters revises the story one-too-many times into slick Hollywood pabulum, there are only a few traces of a credible true story left. ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is ""inspired by"" the true story of Chris Gardner and how he went from being a failed salesman to a homeless person to a millionaire stock broker. And it is no exception to the above rule of ""inspired by"" vs. ""based on"".<br/><br/>Gardner is played by Will Smith as a charming, driven, but down-on-his-luck salesman of bone density scanners. Everyday, he goes out trying to sell his overpriced, unreliable products to doctors who don't want them. And every night he comes home to his nagging, shrewish wife (Thandie Newton--once a great beauty--whose face seems now to be fixed in a permanent grimace). Eventually, on the way to another doctor's office, he passes by the San Francisco stock exchange and notices that everyone who works there seems happy and rich. Inspired by their example, he applies for an internship at Dean Witter. When he tells his wife what he has done, she throws a fit and leaves the next day.<br/><br/>It is at this point that the script starts to diverge from any reality that I can recognize. Gardner has a son Christopher (Smith's real-life son Jaden), who is the emotional core of Gardner's life and of this movie. When the Gardners first split, there appears to be a looming fierce custody battle, with both parents acting more selfishly than in young Christopher's interest (something I recognize from my own childhood), but in the next scene they come to an amicable agreement to let his father have sole custody. I suppose this would be fine except the tone of the battle keeps swinging back and forth from mean to friendly with seemingly nothing to trigger either mood shift, which tells me that screenwriter Steve Conrad (along with probably half a dozen other uncredited writers) didn't have the guts to portray divorce and custody fights for what they really are.<br/><br/>Back to the plot summary: By sheer gumption and by sprinting wherever he goes instead of walking, Gardner manages to land the internship. In real-world job-hunting, stalking a would-be employer and showing up for an interview in ratty clothes would probably be grounds for being barred from Dean Witter's offices permanently. But in this Hollywood confection, the head of HR (Brian Howe) and the CEO (James Karen) are wowed by these things because they show just how motivated Gardner is. I imagine their actual counterparts were a great deal more skeptical of Gardner than what is portrayed in the movie. And despite being deeply impressed during that first interview, for the rest of the film they follow the lead of his trainer (Dan Castellenata wearing a toupee and acting like Homer Simpson's worst nightmare) by blocking his potential contacts and treating him like a servant.<br/><br/>The internship is unpaid, and eventually Gardner winds up homeless. This is the only part of the movie that had any real emotional resonance for me. I could care less about his marriage or his work life, but Gardner's struggle to be a good father to his son while unable to provide anything for him is what lifts this film above true awfulness to mere mediocrity.<br/><br/>The chemistry that the Smiths have with each other is undeniable. And Will Smith--like Tom Hanks--is a good enough actor that he will likely get an Oscar nomination every time he plays a role that is more serious than his usual fare. But ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" has little more than this going for it. In adapting Gardner's life to film, it seems to me that his story has been sterilized, simplified and watered down for the lowest common denominator. I would like to see Hollywood make more gritty dramas that are ""based on"" true events rather than saccharine schlock like this that is merely ""inspired by"" them. 6 out of 10."

The things that Mr. Gardener suffered all in the line of his life's duty was more than some people could bare. There's no doubt about that. Will was outstanding as the father of the small child and the husband who's wife couldn't wait another minute. Think about what she just gave up. Not only her son, a good boy, but a good man who ultimately would not quit. I understand from his interview that he is a multi-millionaire now. After all that. In the light of many circumstances that would depress the hell out of any normal man or woman. He was evicted, jailed, hit by a car and lost a shoe, while on his lunch break and on and on it went. As I watched him I was inspired greatly! As my wife said ""Look at his attitude and the way that he 'carried' himself through all of it. He didn't bring on the fell sorry for me thing.""

I know this is based on a true story and living on the streets is bleak and horrifying and the film depicts it realistically well, but it just gets crammed down your throat constantly as though you are too dumb as an audience to understand what is happening. Gardner runs after people who steal his x-ray machine, he gets some money to get by, he loses some,find a place to sleep with a bed then has to sleep on the street.

Maybe it permits to live, but there are definitely more important things, at least for me.<br/><br/>Also, the movie is just too typical, and even though I admire Mr. Smith's character's struggle to just get his son a life he wants him to give, it smells of that too well known, rancidly recycled American dream. Maybe it was a real story (what's real?) but don't you think they should have taken more care, for example, on the relationship between father and son; maybe wife too?

It really made me angry seeing what really broke him financially, to the point he and his son had no place to sleep, was due to an overdue IRS bill of only $600. I am so glad they are successful and happy today!"
"kruphi","3","10","19","16 December 2006"," a dull rag to riches story
","This part of the story is called: ""Why oh why did I buy those bone density machines."" The story behind the Pursuit of Happiness revolves around an extremely generic and hollow rag to riches story. Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a humble, headstrong and steadfast salesman who seeks a better life for his family in search of personal endeavors. However, his bitter wife Linda (Thandie Newton), plays an unconvincing role, in which she out rightly criticizes Chris for all her unhappiness. Right from the get-go this flaw detaches the audience from Chris Gardner's character. Additionally, a cute five-year-old Christopher (played by Smith's real life-life son Jaden) tries to provide humor all throughout the movie, which fails due to the film's poor chemistry and connection of father and son. Also, the overall depressing and gloomy sentiments encompassing the overall film doesn't add sympathy because matters thereof.<br/><br/>Chris decides to pursues his happiness (or should I say happiness) by applying for a six-month internship at the prestigious stock-broking firm; which does not require a college education, but could lead to a fortune and furthermore happiness for the whole family. Chris finds his lucky break by proving he can solve the over-popular Rubik's cube puzzle. This evidentially gives Chris a chance to prove his mettle and determination in order to differentiate him from his competitors. Although he encounters some hard times in-between, he proves his will and perseverance through witty and earnest comments to the some big-time stockbrokers. Then unexpectedly, an hour into the film, the plot ceases to continue, and the last half of the movie is a sappy, dull and uninspiring movie which fails to resonate with the audience.<br/><br/>In spite of Smith's sterling performance an unwavering devotion to his son, all the toil and misery he endures, seems wasted since it's coated with Hollywood's superfluous touches. I might feel some remorse and pity for Garnder, yet I cannot imagine ever finding a public bathroom as impeccable as the one in the film.<br/><br/>But what commonly packages up these unglamorous films is an overzealous and heavy-handed moral message that leaves little to the imagination. In this case, Italian director Gabriele Muccino and screenwriter Steve Conrad's culmination resounds in Gardner's simple yet profound message, stated quite clearly, to his son:""Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something."" If you are looking for something to stir and fill your heart with glee, you mustn't look too far. It's a typical film of a man's discontent longing for something better; to sum it up: a rehash of the triumph of the human spirit, shown countless times, beyond that, little else remains. This movie delivers precisely that, albeit, it also carries an exasperating number of other problems that lead to the demise of the movie."

","What a boring movie I have never been so disheartened. I really was looking forward to this movie, everyone has said good things about it and I just can't see were this movie is good. Yes it is great that Chris got the job in the end but all that was in between was really not upto much. I mean if the movie makers want to make a movie like that again they should come see me I will give them my live history it would be much more interesting. I just can't believe that they released this movie at the same time as The Last King of Scotland and before Rocky Balboa. This movie is more over rated than David Beckham. See this movie if you fancy taking a nap for a couple of hours."
"jandersonpwco","10","6","10","26 December 2007"," Brilliantly Understated Classic
","I rarely find myself in awe of an actor's ability, but Will Smith solidifies his standing as one of Hollywood's finest talents with his performance in this gem. It is especially impressive when you consider his career started when he was basically drafted for a lightweight sit-com from a teeny-bopper rap duo because he displayed charisma and humor in his MTV videos.<br/><br/>His poignant portrayal of the struggling, yet determined, Chris Gardner is one of the single most inspiring on-screen performances of the past twenty years. I initially saw this on a cross country airline flight with its inherent distractions, so I did not fully appreciate it until watching on DVD again last night. The entire performance is brilliant, but the defining moment is when he is huddled with his son in a locked restroom at the subway station when he has nowhere else to go. Without uttering a word, he had my eyes welling with tears - and I generally do not get weepy during movies. If you are not touched and inspired by this movie, check yourself for a pulse, and if Will Smith is not, at the very least, nominated for Best Actor, they should just cancel the whole Oscar ceremony.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington, step aside and make room. Will Smith has made himself more than worthy of being regarded as one of the truly elite performers."
"stephenf-8","7","6","10","16 February 2007"," Inspiring, but the film's message is flawed
","I was made to this film by my girlfriend. She didn't really have to persuade me hard, the truth be told, as I probably would have watched it on the movie channel when it came on there.<br/><br/>I thought this was a good film. Will Smith really has come a long way since his fresh prince days and is throughly watchable. The underlying message of the film is too reach for your goals, too never give up and that if you really want something and really try for it, and give it your all, then you will get it.<br/><br/>Good film, good message. It makes sense to me. Its inspiring and I hope its something that encourages people to really go for something rather than settling for second best.<br/><br/>My only problem is this. Will Smith had a son. He had a responsibility to his son and appeared to be a good father in the film that would do anything for him and so was prepared to sacrifice everything for him, including living in a homeless shelter. I cannot understand, if this story is indeed true, how any father can risk everything including his son for the sake of his dreams? Surely he could have left his son with his wife whilst doing the unpaid internship and if everything succeeded as it did then he could get his family back. I just fail to see how the message of risk everything can be a good one when you have responsibilities to your children. One should never put one's own ambitions above the need's of one's family.<br/><br/>Or did I miss something?"
"laraemeadows","9","6","10","9 January 2007"," Every scene has an emotional subtlety and expressiveness that touched me
","In Pursuit of Happiness, is directed by Gabriele Muccino, written by Steve Conrad and starring Will Smith. I was touched at the range of emotion, entirely engrossed by the story and completely drained by the end of the film.<br/><br/>Set in the 1980's in San Francisco, Will Smith portrays Chris Gardner, a father struggling to sell a loser medical machine, with dreams of giving his family a better life. On what would seem like a whim, he decides to try to be a stock broker. In order to get the job he has to take an unpaid internship that has little promise of panning out to a job at all. He is months behind on the rent, he hasn't made a sell in a long time but he decides to do the internship anyways. During the internship he and his son can no longer pay the rent and they become homeless.<br/><br/>Gardner is a conflicted character. He wants to improve his family's life but in order to do so he has to risk everything and make their lives harder for a while. There is also no promise of a job if he takes the risk. His wife eventually tires of working double shifts and perceives his aspirations as a fool hardy pipe-dream. Linda, played by Thandie Newton, is tired, frazzled and hopeless. She can no longer see the light at the end of the tunnel. Gardner's last scheme had eaten up their entire life's savings. In a fit of selfish anger she leaves for New York and abandons both Gardner and their son, Christopher.<br/><br/>The story reminds me of Erin Brockovich and is just as touching. Writer Steve Conrad quilts a story of pain, doubt and fear but lines it with a radiant hope. An actor can only be as good as his script and Conrad gives each actor an opportunity to shine.<br/><br/>My hat off to Gabriele Muccino for taking the risk of a light internal narration and making it truly work for this film.<br/><br/>Will Smith's painful scenes are exhaustively powerful. This film required a girth of emotion unrivaled by any of his previous films and Smith does not disappoint. In one scene the script requires an emotional gamut that runs from hopeful, hopeless, silly, tired, exhausted, and eventually to depression. He holds together this scene that could have easily fallen into melodrama with delicate precision. I felt the weight of his physical burdens throughout the movie. Smith's transformation to ""A"" list actor is complete.<br/><br/>Thandie Newton plays Linda, Gardner's wife. Newton portrays Linda's justifiable anger with passion and control. She makes Linda more than just a selfish wife who runs off but rather a character so exhausted by being let down that she doesn't want to take it anymore. I felt for Linda because Newton was so exhausted looking and maxed out feeling. Newton is an amazing actress who proves again that her acting is a reason to see a movie.<br/><br/>Jaden Christopher Syer Smith plays Christopher, Gardner and Linda's son.<br/><br/>Often you have to rate a child actor on the ""child actor"" scale but Jaden can be judged on the traditional actor's scale. He did an exceptional job in this roll. This movie was demanding emotionally on all the characters but Jaden captures the instability so damaging to children in these situations. He also does an incredible job of giving hope to the film. I can't wait to see how he matures as an actor. Numerous movies have been made about women who struggled to get by. I was impressed that this film could touch me and that I could relate to a father's struggle as well.<br/><br/>In Pursuit of Happiness is a powerfully written and acted film. Every scene has an emotional subtlety and expressiveness that touches the audience in a personal and intimate way. I might just see this one again.<br/><br/>LaRae Meadows laraemeadows@gmail.com http://laraemeadows.livejournal.com www.justpressplay.net"
"Hitchcoc","8","6","10","3 January 2007"," Much More Than I Expected.
","Seeing the pain in Will Smith as he jockeys for position in a dead-end world is certainly worth the price of admission. This is the tale of a man who has been dealt a bad hand by life, but has never had the courage to start over. He goes from hospital to clinic, trying to sell a bone density scanner that really offers little new to the science of diagnosis. When he ends up as sole support of his little boy, he must change his life. He has seen the happy faces of stock brokers leaving their jobs with smiles on their faces, he decides this is what he would like to do. He has an amazing mind for mathematics and feels he can parlay this gift into a career. The problem is he must continue to eat and find a place to live. There are times when things get maudlin and a bit far fetched, but it does grab at the heartstrings and does present a man who faces off against forces we've all dealt with. It's an unfair world and the haves really become obvious to the have-nots. <br/><br/>The acting is superb and overcomes the the plot's weaknesses. Smith's young son is a quite a charmer. He is at times bullheaded and immovable. At times he's a bit too good to be true. It's a very nice movie overall, with a good message. Maybe that's all it should aspire to be."

","This was an OK movie, just OK. I group of friends and I went to see it and all of us agreed, it was too long- rather the pacing was terrible- and the characters lacked any moments that allowed you to connect with them. The only character I could even identify with was the wife, who was gone after the first 1/4 of the film. I'm not saying that the actors were bad or the story idea was bad, but its execution was far from great and nowhere near worthy the Oscar buzz that people say this is going to generate. Sorry to be a downer on a movie that so many people enjoyed, I just did not think it was any good. I just couldn't feel anything for Will Smith's character or his son, and I think that this is because of the point when the movie enters their lives, it builds very little if no back story. We knew nothing of these people except that they were poor, struggling and had a son...sounds like a lot of other movies that I've seen. And while, yes, this movies was ""based"" on actual events, it was predictable with only one moving moment, which occurred 3 minutes before the end of the film."

Chris is a average Joe who's not being noticed for the person that he is. So Chris lacks one of the most important parts of his life, happiness, or Happiness as I like too call it.<br/><br/>When I saw the movie, I loved it. It had the perfect mixture of sorrow and happiness, binded together like an excellent and beautiful box of smiles.

","I have just watched ""Pursuit of Happiness"" and could not prevent tears running down my cheeks.This movie reminds me of my struggles.I am a student from Kenya who came to Middle Tennessee State University on a track scholarship.Unfortunately I did not perform to the expectation of the coach and he cut my scholarship in my freshman year leaving me with no direction or anyone to turn to.Like Will Smith in this movie,I realized how painful it is not to have anyone to turn to for help.I am alone here,ten of thousands of miles from my family.I was kicked out of the dorm,no money in my pocket,no where to go......(I learned the world is so cruel and unfair sometimes).With prayers and running up and down trying to make ends meet,God did a miracle and a good samaritan/friend helped me financially stay in school the following semester.I looked for jobs but only managed an internship because of my residency status which prohibited me from working off-campus.This internship is what makes me be in school today as I look forward to my senior year.I have to work so hard to pay for school and other bills as well as working hard in school. Chris Gardner is seen going though all this in this movie.I felt like this movie was meant for me.All I have been through is what I saw Chris Gardner go through.I once didn't have a place to sleep just like Chris Gardner and his son did and had to spent the night in some nasty unimaginable places. This movie is the most inspiring and touching movie I have ever seen.Just like Gardner's achievement,the movie tells me that nothing is impossible no matter what some people think.One lesson I learned in this movie is ""Failure isn't about falling down, it's about staying down"" ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a brilliant masterpiece of Will Smith work.Two thumps way up."

","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Will and his son did a fabulous job. I was really touched by the underlined encouragement not to give up despite any trials one faces. This movie has encouraged me to continue as a college student. I have faced my own trials and tribulations since returning back to school as a 30-year-old. I thought the director did a great job as well. Everyone should see this movie, especially those who are struggling to be happy and need the reminder that ""you are not alone"". Chris Gardener's story shows that some of the people we see that are successful have not gotten where they are because it was easy. The movie highlights the fact that we can make the choice, though difficult, not to let our negative past and present circumstances determine the outcome of our future."

","I saw the premiere for this movie the day before it came out, and I have to say, I was happy I did.<br/><br/>In The Pursuit of Happiness {sic}, Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a husband and father failing at bringing in enough money. The movie chronicles his rise from failure on the poverty line, to--simply through grit and determination--becoming the owner of a large multi-million dollar corporation.<br/><br/>Before this movie, I had never seen Will Smith in anything but a comedy. Apparently, he can do other things. The acting was the best part of the movie. Also, Jaden Smith is a rising young star. We will be seeing him in the future.<br/><br/>The directing was also pretty good as well. For a rather beginning filmmaker, Muccino managed to fit the theme well, contrasting the rich life and the poor life of LA.<br/><br/>So, it got boring in parts, and the ending tried to wrap everything up too quickly, but it was a good, sometimes funny, mostly heartbreaking movie. A great one to watch!"
"djansen24","5","3","4","23 September 2012"," The Smiths save the show...somewhat...
","This is a slight movie with some very good performances, especially by the 2 Smiths. It is somewhat a pity to see the talent of Will Smith poured into his usually very silly action flicks. This movie, while no action flick, is nevertheless one that comes across as a big budget after school special instead of the serious drama it pretends to be. But there is a greater disturbing factor to the Pursuit of Happiness: The idea that happiness is equated with money. I laughed out loud when he sees all the stock brokers walking out of work looking so happy. How stressful is their life in reality? And I suppose some would be happy with their paycheck. Pity that a lot of them get it through conning people and manipulating facts. This is only emphasized further by the very last title screen at the end where again it talks about the heroes net worth. It was frankly an offensive slap in the face to anyone who has had to deal with the complex and trying issues of poverty. Poverty is somewhat made out to be a choice rather than a condition or an oppression, and the truth is it is very complex. <br/><br/>And yet there are very moving parts of the human drama, especially through the wonderfully told bonding between the 2 Smith characters. I give it a five for these many moments. An average movie at best with some Oscar worthy performances buried within."

"christian123","5","4","6","29 July 2007"," Despite featuring a few heartwarming moments and fine performances, the film was uninteresting and forgettable
","Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is the type of guy everyone knows and most have been at one point in their life or another - the working poor. He's smart and diligent but unable to catch a break and falling further and further behind in his responsibilities to everything except his young son (Jaden Smith) whom he'd promised to always be around for, no matter the circumstances.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness is heartwarming in parts but as a whole, the film wasn't very engaging or memorable. The whole thing just felt too manipulative and I think they tried way too hard to get the audience to feel sorry for the main character. For instance, the first half of the film was mostly depressing to watch because the ""hero"" of the movie was in a bad state so it was hard to watch him suffer. We had to see all of these unlucky scenes and moments where Chris just couldn't catch a break. It got really annoying after awhile to have the film show all of this and it just proved that it was clear pity draining.<br/><br/>The direction proved to be quite lame and it was a big reason to why the movie wasn't very appealing to me. The pacing was on the slow side and it was unbearable at times. This had to do with the fact that the main character himself wasn't very likable so it got tiring to watch him for nearly two hours. We were supposed to root for him which was easy to do because of his situation but I never really viewed him as an interesting person and he was actually pretty selfish. He took on a six month internship which didn't pay any money and he was surprised that his wife wasn't happy with that decision. Even though everything worked out in the end, I don't believe he should have taken that job because his family was in a bad situation already. I admire his determination to get out of the unfortunate situation but not the way he chose to do so.<br/><br/>The most positive thing about the film was the relationship between Will Smith and Jaden Smith. I know that they are related in real life so filming these scenes was probably an easy thing to do yet they did have an appealing relationship and watching them together made you root for Chris a little more because you want the best for the kid. However, I don't believe Will Smith deserved an Oscar nomination. He was really good but there were better performances from 2006. Thandie Newton deserved a razzie for her performance. She was ridiculously over the top and very fake. She had no control of her emotions and was just generally awful. Overall, The Pursuit of Happiness features a few heartwarming moments but for the most part, it didn't really appeal to me. Rating 5/10"

Will was crying his eyes out and trying to be silent because he wanted to make sure his son could sleep through the night. There is something about a real father and his real son playing the parts.

","Thanks to the Smith Family, I was able to see the pre-screening of this movie with my partner, and we were both absolutely surprised at how good this movie was! At first, my impression was that it will be mostly comedy, because of the type of movies Will Smith was in. Then I was skeptical because the description of the movie was something that sounded serious! But then, even as a serious character, Will Smith was a great actor alongside his side Jaden, which gave the whole ""father-son"" figure all the more real.<br/><br/>As a medical equipment salesman, Chris Gardner (Will Smith) barely made enough money to pay rent and support his family. The situation just gets worse, his wife (Thandie) leaves him, he struggles to take custody of his son (Jaden), then he got kicked out of his apartment, lived in a cheap motel, living off 23 bux, kicked out of the motel, then right into sleeping in the toilets at the train station. By that moment of the film, you'd be gripping and crying for this character, pondering if it's possible to get more worse than the worst. But then the theme of fatherhood and Chris' determination to provide for his son makes this character the most admirable and self-less man ever. He believed he could find happiness, and he believe he could do it. Even with all these obstacles, he takes one look at his son and he gets back on his feet to face the cruel world once more.<br/><br/>This is a story that'll leave you in awe, and fill you with hope, that you can do it, and make it, as long as you believe you can do it."

","I was disappointed with this one, mainly due the film equating happiness with the pursuit of 'ferrari-esque' wealth and the sacrifices one could make to achieve it. Also, for the time it was set in, nothing was said about the 'black barrier' that Gardner had to break in regards to his goal of becoming a stockbroker, a predominantly white industry. His wife was pretty marginally drawn, and most others were one-dimensional at best.<br/><br/>It had that whole inside-joke feel of a wealthy man saying 'hey, i'd like to finance a movie about my life, is will smith available to play me?', but lacking in the charisma or actual humanistic challenges set out in a movie such as 'Ray', where this movie seems to have seeded from.

Why would anybody go to pray to a magical fairy when he needs time to do real things?<br/><br/>With this movie I learned that you need a big shiny red car to be happy, that the government trying to help the more disadvantaged ones is the devil, and that you have to pray a lot if you want to accomplish things.<br/><br/>Really bad movie."

","When I heard about this movie I was a bit confused about the name whether it is ""Happyness"" or ""Happiness"". But when I saw this movie, I forgot these things because of the movie.<br/><br/>Will Smith's performance as Chris Gardner is mind blowing. And I was pretty sure that it will brought an Oscar to this man. I think is it his best performance ever. Jaden Smith is looking so cute in this film and there is a perfect chemistry on the screen between these two.<br/><br/>It is quite emotional film. I cried so many times when I was watching this movie, especially the climax. It was so pleasant. This story touches our life so closely. It is not just a family drama, but it also contains a message in it.<br/><br/>It is a film about Chris Gardner, who is fighting hard to bring happiness into his home but nothing is going in his favor.<br/><br/>A perfect blend of real performance and a great story along with the topping of the great emotions, this is what this film is all about. From me its 8.5/10."
"michaelalastair","3","5","9","27 January 2007"," Very disappointing
","To sum it up, it really was a waste of 2 hours. Here's why: After all the great things being said about it, I decided to go and see it with a group of friends. We were all looking forward to it and I really liked the whole 'poor' situation (at first).<br/><br/>Thandie Newton and Will Smith were great casting choices. It got into the first 60 minutes of the movie, and I was still waiting for it start (it never happened). What exactly was supposed to happen? I looked at my watch at least 5 times throughout this movie. I also started talking to my friends after being bored for too long. The theater was packed so I guess that was an other reason that I had high-hopes for this really bad movie. Aside from the internship, what was the point of this story? There was nothing that made me think, this movie could actually be good. When the movie was over, I was glad to get out. I really wish we had gone and seen Employee of the Month instead."

I mean yes,we all face trouble all the time but what would you do if you have no money left,no friends,no place to spend the night in and a child aged 5 with you all the time?

"timbermisc","9","5","9","16 December 2006"," Soulful Inspiration: You care and you cry
","This movie was more than I expected. I am a pro photographer and I am very critical of the director's work. Firstly, this movie has a quick pace about it. We are never left with a sappy feeling. When scenes ARE slowed down our heart feels truly empathetic to this father and son duo. <br/><br/>This, above all, is a personal movie. We are entertained by how a struggling father entertains his son and keeps his son happy through a number of sad situations. And then we are delighted by how the son keeps the father happy, as young as he is. And because these two ""Muskateers"" show caring for one another, we care about them. They are two good people. And we want good people to succeed! <br/><br/>By the way, there is no violence in this film, only some anger. You won't see them become criminals to survive either! <br/><br/>You will be involved throughout this film with their trials and errors. You will cry and care and hope WITH them, not just FOR them because you WILL be involved in scene after scene. The time will fly. <br/><br/>The director surprisingly chose to use a gritty grainy color film style which increases the realism of this movie. The handy-cam, a walking camera, adds style to the realism and rush of this movie due to some deliberate jerky camera movement in a handful of minor scenes. When Chris Gardener (Will Smith) asks someone to pay back a small loan of money($14), you feel like you are standing right next to Will Smith as he begs. And regarding the rushed feeling: Fathers just don't have time to be fatherly, make sales calls without a car by riding the bus, and survive homeless on the street all on the same day. <br/><br/>Will Smith's emotional range is wide here. He has a little of that comedian, that optimism in him, but he shows his universal soul. This is what amazes audiences. The new Will Smith, actor of drama. And the Italian director gave him time to emote! Therefore, you will be delighted with his nuances of emotion from scene to scene. This film is comfortably realistic. Will Smith deserves an Oscar for acting.<br/><br/>The music is all good: Steve Wonder, Gospel music from Glide Church; not one mediocre tune exists in this film.<br/><br/>San Francisco as a setting will thrill those in the mid west with tall views of the city and Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. But this story is not about showcasing places as you would see in a James Bond movie. Rather, you will be taken into Glide Memorial Church where the City's homeless are feed food and soul gospel music. Concentrate on the emotions of the audience, it is so, so real. And yes, I have eaten there and stood in line there. There is no sense that poverty is simply a fleeting condition. <br/><br/>Your good spirit will save you. Personal diligent effort will save you. And Will Smith takes it as it comes. And there are no guarantees your pursuit will end up in happiness. It is not decreed in life, or the Constitution, and it is not decreed in this movie. <br/><br/>The supporting actress was so realistic. She challenges Will Smith with her impatience. You will be rooting for Will Smith and you will care that these two characters, father and son, find their rainbow: which may only be as humble as finding appropriate employment. Will Smith is never foolishly arrogant. To be so would raise the odds against his survival. The miracle here is how you end up crying for someone that simply accomplishes that which we take for granted, something so mundane as getting a job. <br/><br/>This film looks like a documentary at times.<br/><br/>No person seems trite: The landlord is not a parody or a character of a landlord, you know that he is a real person with his own problems. The people are not extraordinary people, you believe them as they are, whatever they are. No one over acts. You are never distracted by a ""false"" character, not even the ""Time Machine Man"". And you wonder if maybe these people are actually non-actors chosen to do what they already do in their ""real life"". But it is a fact that the homeless people in the movie are actually homeless people employed to be in the movie. I live here and I was an actor in the movie. I know this to be true. There were only 3-4 people who acted homeless in this movie, and you know what, their scenes were cut.<br/><br/>This is not a cleaned-up Disney movie. This movie has soul and spirit. It is funny and ironic that the one obscene word is uttered by the 5 year old child. And there are some light hearted jokes that will touch you.<br/><br/>If you liked the movie ""Seabiscuit"" you will like this movie. You will root for this ordinary person as he pushes his spirit against extraordinary odds to survive and to attain his vision of success. But this movie is not dead centered around survival, and the homeless scenes are few. We are really drawn to the conversations between the father and son. And the kid is cute and smart. You never feel he is reading any lines. This movie is really about the relationship of the father to his son.<br/><br/>The book reminds you that even if you only attain ""baby steps"" towards your goal you are on the path to your own success. You are reminded that if you are an ""A"" student, you need to have a humble caring attitude to succeed too. And Will Smith is humble here. Oh yes, he gets angry and he isn't perfect....and his emotional range is wide. He deserves an Oscar for truly carrying this film to its perfectly happy destination."
"perlner","7","8","17","9 December 2006"," Not so happy.
","This movie's tough to watch. It's well done and it's vaguely realistic (it *is* based on a true story), and it's a pleasure to see Will Smith on screen with his actual son, who's very cute. But it gets pretty hairy in the middle - so depressing that even the expected payoff at the end doesn't seem worth it, somehow. It's not really a tearjerker - just more of a downer.<br/><br/>There are, however, very funny moments, with the typical Will Smith humor.<br/><br/>And yes, the misspelling of the title is deliberate, and addressed in the movie."
"bisaglia","1","12","29","18 February 2007"," How mushy can you be?
","Someone has to tell Will Smith that he is not Frank Capra. It is not easy to tell a story about struggle for life and not being maudlin. The film didn't make me cry, or laugh, or even think about it. I left the theater the same way I went in. What about the screenplay? Is it necessary to repeat the same situation ten times just to give the audience an idea of the hard time he had along with his kid? Also the relationship with his wife is weird. The film does not explain why she makes one of the most important decisions a woman can make in a lifetime. Is she bad, or just weak? And what about Chris? As a leading character he should be more realistic."

","A very good film. Although, I have to admit that I felt more inspired and uplifted by Akeelah and the Bee. This story was from Chris Gardner's point of view. It was his triumph. Will Smith did an awesome job portraying a man struggling to find success for himself and his family. But, I think his son, Jaden Smith, stole the show. I'd love to see him in his own film. His acting talent is outstanding. There should be a film made from a young, African-American boy's perspective. He could definitely pull it off. Akeelah and the Bee definitely paved the way for that kind of film. Go see The Pursuit of Happiness. It's a feel good movie. Take the whole family and enjoy!"

","A man goes from being unable to support himself and his family to exploiting others to become a multimillionaire. If you read the Declaration of Independence from which ""the pursuit of happiness"" is quoted, it ends with ""to this we pledge our lives, our FORTUNES, and our SACRED HONOR."" The Founders who wrote that the pursuit of happiness is an unalienable right, gave their fortunes to win it. The end, that the pursuit of happiness is the pursuit of money, that the cure to unhappiness is unbridled greed, is really sad. These people need therapy. I also found the story inauthentic. A lot of support mechanisms are available to homeless people in NYC. Of course, he used those resources but they left out that part to manipulate the viewer."

"mad4u689","5","4","7","28 December 2006"," Not as original as I'd have hoped.
","When I walked into this movie, I expected so much to really like it that I was shocked when I didn't. I have long considered Will Smith an underrated actor (most acknowledge his delivery of wit as outstanding, but his acting has been difficult to fairly assess when his films include Independence Day, Men in Black, Wild Wild West, and I, Robot), and the plot seemed interesting.<br/><br/>However, most of the movie concentrated on Gardner's downward spiral. It was unpleasant, yes, but that wasn't just a sign of realism - it was building up unnecessary tension. The balance was off. Once Gardner got the job (Is that a spoiler? I doubt anyone who has seen a preview will doubt this eventually happens), the movie is over like *snaps fingers* that. You're given a quick text run-through of his future successes. The movie indulges in the bad, so that you can feel good about being so comparatively comfortable, So where did it go wrong? The film could have said something important about poverty, but failed.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't at fault - the acting was superb all around. The casting was great. The directing wasn't even at fault. No, the problem was simply with the script. The writer could have stepped it up a notch and made something great, but instead the screenplay that was turned out was predictable. He turned a story that wasn't a cliché into one."
"mrodgers2","10","4","7","21 December 2006"," Very powerful
","This was one of the best movies I have seen.....everything from the storyline to the acting to the setting was excellent. There were a number of scenes in this movie in which nothing was said verbally (scenes on the streets of the city) but which spoke volumes about the world we live in. Happiness was different than your typical rags to riches movie, especially the ones that involve African-Americans. No one was living in the hood, involved in illegal activities, and trying to make it as an athlete or entertainer. I think a lot can be learned about what it takes to make it in this world from this movie (determination, opportunity, charisma, position, luck). Many people (those who have not always been upper middle class or rich) will be able to relate to this movie."
"booyatom","6","8","18","16 December 2006"," A little too dreary.
","For a film that deems itself uplifting, The Pursuit of Happiness is quite depressive. Most of the movie (""most"" meaning not half but about 9/10 of it) deals with Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) struggles with poverty, the raising of his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and his tired wife (Thandie Newton). Chris' pursuit gets very long and by the time we get to the end, the reward is not at all worth our wait. Besides, we knew it was coming.<br/><br/>Chris longs to be a stockbroker. He marvels and the lifestyle that comes with it. He has no education above high school, he has one suit for special occasions and sells out-dated bone scanners to hospitals which do not want them. However, this is a true story, so instead of being improbable, the plot is feasible.<br/><br/>What gets out of hand is the adversity Chris faces. Steve Conrad, the screenwriter, goes out of his way (really out of his way that is) to emphasize the fact that this guy had it tough. Don't get me wrong, this is necessary in order to fully appreciate the feel good ending, but too much is too much. His wife leaves him, he gets kicked out of a few motels, takes his son to homeless shelters, then ends up staying in a subway bathroom, all this in a background of more oppression and intimidation at the broker firm.<br/><br/>I thought the film would make me feel good (not that I'm feeling bad or anything, I'm just saying), but there's too much going bad for Chris and only at the end do we get the emotional, tear jerking moment. And let me say, it's not that spectacular. Take The Shawshank Redemption for instance. Andy, the main character, wasn't continually put down, yet Shawshank has one of the best, most memorable emotionally uplifting endings in history. We got uplifting moments during Shawshank, which is what Pursuit omits. The key is not to keep beating down your main man in order to have an effective ending. <br/><br/>Will Smith's performance makes the movie worthwhile. Not at all over-the-top, it is just masterfully controlled. We totally buy his character. Too bad Pursuit is so dark and dreary.<br/><br/>Happiness is spelled wrong in an early scene to show that Chris hasn't found true happiness yet. He asks to spell it right so as to not lead his son into error. Funny, I would have asked to make the whole movie right, because it is spelled all wrong."
"raypdaley182","1","11","27","28 February 2007"," Utterly Awful

I can't see how American audiences even managed to sit through it, I thought they'd be walking out on it in droves. not just for the length of the film, for the amount of attention it requires to stick with it.<br/><br/>Based on a true story Will Smith plays a salesman who decides to train to become a stockbroker. We follows the lows and even lowers of his life. the plot isn't very interesting because it's pretty obvious there's got to be a happy ending at the end of all this morose bleakness.<br/><br/>Avoid it.

","""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a movie about Chris Gardner (Will Smith) and his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and their struggle to ""Survive"" in San Francisco.<br/><br/>Chris is a struggling salesman who's wife (Thandie Newton) becomes frustrated with their way of life. They struggle to pay every bill and they can't afford anything other than the necessities of life and sometimes they can't even afford that. Linda leaves Chris after one too many days of disappointment at Chris' inability to sell his product.<br/><br/>Chris and Christopher are on their own. Chris lucks out and gets an internship at a stock brokerage. He's one of twenty people fighting for a spot at the brokerage and he is constantly the underdog. Whether it be having to be the one to stop his work and get a donut for an executive or walking into work with one shoe and being stared at the entire way into the office area.<br/><br/>With the good (Winning the internship) comes the bad (He gets no pay, which in real life, he did, but in the movie, he didn't) Chris spends the next six months of his internship living off the earnings of the remaining stock of his product he invested in. He and his son have no stable home. One night they'll be sleeping in a hotel and then the next they'll be sleeping at a homeless shelter and some nights they'll be sleeping in the bathroom of a subway station.<br/><br/>Is Will Smith good in this? He's decent. Not as great as I had heard. But the acting of Will Smith can't save this movie.<br/><br/>You are left sitting in your seat for two hours watching most of the movie squirming from the uncomfortable situations of being constantly railed on from landlords, etc. and begging his buddy for the 14 dollars he has owed him for months just to take the bus back home. I watched most of this movie with my hands over my face and peeking through my fingers out of the uncomfortable situation of watching a man struggle to survive and to keep his son's belly full.<br/><br/>Go into ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" expecting this: this movie is about Christopher Gardner sleeping on the street and struggling to make up stories to people he comes in contact with about why he's carrying all he owns everywhere around him. It's nothing more.<br/><br/>If you'd like to spend 7.50 to peer into the life of a man who is basically homeless and trying to raise his son, be my guest.

A standing ovation goes out to Will Smith for his amazing portrayal as Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman, who pursues happiness for him and his son, overcoming several barriers such as bankruptcy, divorce, and poverty. There is one minor drawback to the movie: it deals with a very serious subject.

","A few years ago I saw Chris Gardner's story on a news show and was impressed, not to mention awed, on his struggles to get himself and his infant son out of poverty and toward a better life. What I admired most was his strong willed determination to always stick by his son and be there for him no matter how bleak his situation got. And yes, things did get pretty bleak. I always thought about that story's message on having the courage to follow your dreams and to never give up no matter how hard it can be to get there. When it became a movie starring none other than Will Smith, I was estatic. I was hoping it would perfectly capture all the powerful elements of the true story and it ended up delivering though there were a few minor changes: the boy was made five years old instead of an infant and the time spent in a subway station washroom was made into a brief ordeal when, in actuality, it served as a temporary home for many nights(Chris would bath his son in the sink). Will Smith is excellent as Chris, showing so much determination and drive to get to his goal, that you can't help, but root for him and hope that he does. This is a remarkable movie, not only from Will's performance, but that it did an excellent job of capturing the story's powerful message of believing in yourself and to not let anything stand in the way of following your dream."

Not a tear-jerker as I was expecting but a touching, warm film about a man's struggle to make it for his family - to see his goal and do everything in his power to make it happen."

","Will Smith did a great job as the father trying to protect his son from their circumstances of becoming homeless as much as he can, while at the same time trying to work in the competitive world of stocks as an unpaid intern. Jaden Smith was outstanding as the preschool-aged kid who knows things are going wrong and tries to have a stiff upper lip, but just can't do it all the time.I was very happy that this film never got political and blamed Reagan for the number of ""down on their luck"" people that were shown, nor was the race card ever pulled out. It was also refreshing that Smith's character never blamed anybody for his troubles.This movie deserves to be experienced and taken in by the masses.There is a great lesson that is learned in this movie and it truly shares the struggles of everyday life.This movie was heart felt and touching. It was truly an experience worth having. Thank you for making this movie and I look forward to seeing it again."

","My husband and I agree that this is one of the best movies that we have ever seen (and our tastes are quite different). I believe that this movie should be seen by every teen. There are a lot of life lessons here. These lessons are modeled through acts of kindness, courage, tenacity, industriousness and ambition. Chris, (Will Smith), is intelligent, mannerly, charming, practical, inventive, capable, and energetic. Chris is a hero. His heroics don't necessitate weapons or superhuman qualities. He is a ""super"" human being. He reminds us that good parenting means helping a child feel safe and loved, even when the parent does not. His love for and devotion to his young son is unwavering. Will Smith's performance is tender, touching, and truly credible."

I actually wanted to reach into the screen and yell at a few of the folks because I felt so bad for Chris. He had to persevere through so much. I was so moved by this movie.

","I really enjoyed this film. It kept my interest and I appreciated that although many bad things happen to the main character, he never lashes out or gives up. The lack of violence, sex scenes, and drug/alcohol use is refreshing. He cashes a check in a liquor store and when the clerk asks him if he wants anything else, he says no. Not what you would expect in a film. Usually the character would get drunk, etc. He is also discriminated against, but doesn't complain; he just smiles. The fact that he worked so hard and also took care of his son and studied diligently were very moving to me. This movie inspired me to not give up on improving my own life. However, success and happiness are soley equated with money in this film, and in real life, yes of course, money is important, but it alone doesn't make you happy. The spiritual side of this character could have been explored more. He obviously had a ""the glass is half full"" attitude. And there is a scene of him and his son at a church service in a homeless shelter, but otherwise this aspect of his life is not explored. This is a simply lovely movie that I highly recommend."

I am glad that Will Smith played this role as he portrayed the character in such a great way. I think that no other actor could have done it so. Will Smith was so into his character, and he played all the emotions of sadness, anger, nervousness, and happiness in so many great ways that I just can't forget them. Smith is a great actor, and this movie is the perfect example of how from having nothing a man can achieve greater heights and yet still be a man!

","Based on a true story about a man named Christopher Gardner set in 1981, Pursuit of Happiness is probably one of Will Smith's best performances, one that stands unique to the rest, and once again he shows us how powerful his acting ability can be, when accompanied with an incredible story. Written by Steve Conrad (WeatherMan, The Promotion), and directed by Gabriele Muccino (Seven Pounds), comes the story of a man struggling to make ends meet, in which almost every choice leads him down another road with a problem to solve and overcome, while maintaining the will and strength to never give up on what you want.<br/><br/>""Never let anyone tell you you can't do something. If you want something, go and get it"". Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is full of wise wisdom, but sometimes is influenced on his own fears and inabilities that make him doubt, making it difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Chris is a struggling salesman who has invested his life's work in a medical device known as a ""Bone Density scanner"". Unfortunately, he has discovered that his investment is short lived as doctors describe the device as a ""luxury"" rather than a necessity. Gardner's wife (Jada Smith, Will Smith's wife) is completely irrational and clearly selfish, leaves him and their son to fend for their own, of course only after mocking and talking him down, as he tells her his dreams and his efforts of where he is trying to get. Eventually forced to live out in the streets with his son, Gardner takes an internship position at a Brokerage firm, in which he must work and train for 6 weeks without pay. We watch as Chris and his son struggle to deal with the tough times, racing to get in line for shelters, and rushing through work, while staying up nights on end studying and preparing for the finals, in which the company selects only ONE applicant out of 20.<br/><br/>While the movie is indeed filled with sadness and despair, there is a deeper yearning to see the beautiful pieces of work and storytelling in this film. I urge those who may be discouraged with sad tales, as *spoiler alert* things to end on a beautiful happy note.* The film not only exhibits extremely skilled acting and a wonderful storyline, but also is full of incredible cinematography work. Filmed by Phedon Papamichael (Director of Cinematography, Descendants, Walk the Line, Sideways) there is some amazing eye candy. The framing and the locations are incredibly well captured and add so much more to the flow and feel of the film. You will truly be immersed into this film, just remember, it's OK to cry a bit just close the blinds :p.<br/><br/>Untitled-2 On my ""rating"" scale, (this is totally just my opinion), but I put this in the Must Watch category, giving it a 5/5 for the quality in acting and storyline and the final product. Anyone who sees this film as weak, obviously has no heart, or cannot deal with such stories as they seem to think ""this could never happen"" or ""this isn't real"". On the contrary folks, this is based on a true story, and I bet it happens every day on various levels (perhaps not as large as a brokerage).<br/><br/>http://www.screensyndrome.com/pursuit-of-happ/"

"tburke85","8","2","3","12 June 2009"," The Pursuit Of Happiness Much Better Than Expected
","The Pursuit Of Happiness was much better than expected mainly because of the great performance by Will Smith who continues to show his talent as an actor in this film. Director Gabriele Muccino has done an admirable job of making this movie based on an inspiring true story about a struggling salesman who tries to find a steady job so that he can support him and his son after losing nearly everything but finds a chance to get his life back on track with a stockbroker internship at Dean Witter. Will Smith is fantastic as Chris Gardner the struggling salesman giving one of his best performances in this film. Smith continues to show why he's one of Hollywoods best actors today in this one. Well done. Will's real life son Jaden steps into the role of his on screen son Chris Jr. and he is equally impressive. They both have great chemistry together and because they are rally father and son they didn't have to try hard to make that believable in the movie. The rest of the cast are good in their roles. Thandie Newton makes a brief extended appearance as Chris' wife who leaves him. Newton may lack screen time but she's still effective in the role. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but it does offer some humor, drama, and a touching story about the bond between a father and his son which makes up for it's one flaw. Overall The Pursuite Of Happiness was much better than I thought it would be. The movie has drama, some small doses of humor, characters we come to care about, and terrific performances by the cast especially Will Smith who makes this inspiring true story enjoyable to watch."
"yris2002","7","2","3","14 May 2009"," heartwarming, tender, comforting
","I was a little reluctant before watching this movie, I have seen ""Seven Pounds"" recently, and found it disappointing (although saved by good acting) which, together with my low opinion of Muccino's Italian movies, contributed to my doubts on The pursuit of Happiness, but I had to reconsider my opinion, since I really appreciated it, and was able to stand the huge amount of advertising on Italian TV, which often destroys the pleasure of watching any movie.<br/><br/>The plot is evidently but not annoyingly marked by the solid American belief that man's efforts and commitment lead to success, with that maybe too optimistic faith that everything will turn better, and your sacrifices will once get the deserved prize (although life often shows something different), but there's no pretence of too much didascalism, it's a quite realistic portray of the hardships of life, with a happy ending aimed at leaving the audience with some self-confidence and trust in others.<br/><br/>The overall impression of anxiety, with all that running after people, appointments, occasions, is softened by some tender moments between father and son (at times melodramatic, but never too melodramatic) and also relieved by funny moments. <br/><br/>The movie gets to leave to viewer with a positive sense of fullness of life (it could be titled The Pursuit of Life, since life, not only happiness, is to be pursued in every aspect), of the necessity to find a reason to go on, both for yourself and for the dear ones, with a strong meaning that there are really few valuable things in life, all the rest is pure nonsense. Really contrasting with Seven pounds, where a man, on the contrary, gives up and chooses death, leaving the viewer with a sense of sad surrender and illogical, besides humanly disturbing, self-abandonment.<br/><br/>Will Smith truly fits the role, abandoning his rather blank face à la Fresh Prince of Bel Air, he offers a very effective and convincing performance and the young boy playing Christopher is really cute."
"bob the moo","Null","2","3","27 April 2008"," Almost too heartbreaking to be uplifting even if it ultimately does it, but still engaging and driven by another very good performance from Will Smith
","Chris Gardner is a struggling salesman who finds himself having to look after his son when his wife gives up and leaves him. Using his charm as much as his academic record, Chris wins his way onto an internship programme of twenty, with only one job at the end. He has the determination to make it but with no salary and almost no income from his sales efforts, Chris finds himself homeless and increasingly desperate as he tries to keep up with his peers by day and survive the rest of the time.<br/><br/>This is an unusual film that, were it totally successful, could be called a victim of that success. Certainly the story it is telling is uplifting and very much testimony to the determination and courage of one man to make it despite tremendous odds. OK so he is not diving into burning buildings to save babies but it is still an engaging and inspiring story because of the sheer endless scale of the challenge and disappointment. It also helps that the sheer weight of soul-destroying challenges that he works through makes it almost impossible for all but the hardest hearted viewer not to feel happy for Chris when he finally makes it (as we know he ultimately will, or else his story would not be a film!) even if ""making it"" is ""making money"", which some viewers may find to be not totally worthy in itself. Ironically though this same weight of events also works against the film because it does make it a consistently hard watch. It is praise in a way because I personally tensed up with every added sorrow and this happened because of how convincing and heartbreaking this festival of misery and unfairness was.<br/><br/>A massive part of this working as well as it does is Smith's performance. I last saw him in I Am Legend where I thought that the narrative development in that film totally undid his wonderfully convincing performance in the first half. Here again he is quite brilliant  utterly convincing, showing a flicker of spirit deep within him while also clearly showing each kick, each challenge on his increasingly worn face. Smith junior could have been one of those terribly cute-kid type roles but just about avoids it. Sure he is cute but he is not annoying, mainly because of how natural he is. I think he is really helped by the fact that he does seem to be able to act (or at least ""pretend"") but more than he already has a relationship with his father that feeds their on screen one. They work well together but ultimately the film is owned by Will Smith, who is great.<br/><br/>Overall then this is an engaging and ultimately inspiring film but not one that is a lot of fun to watch. By virtue of how convincing Smith and the overall delivery is, I felt the tension in my own body, felt the crushing blows of each misfortune or challenge. It helps the film in a way but it did seem like the ""uplifting"" material is a long time coming."

I've heard this kind of allegations before, against some of the most beautiful of movies.<br/><br/>Leaving out a few minor goofs, here and there, the movie is flawless. The movie is about a man's journey through different phases of his life, looking for that tiny little phase called happiness. We all go through the same phases maybe with a little difference. The movie shows the pain of defeat, despair of loss, boredom of routine, and ultimately the peace of victory. It never goes overboard to show, how sad a man's life can be. Even amidst the saddest phases, there are moments of hope, wonder, inspiration, a little bit of help or a shove towards the right direction. Similarly, even when things seem to look good, a blow falls. What it stresses on, is how far one would go to realise his dreams. How much, would one be ready to withstand but still keep going, holding on to the little positives that come up here and there. How much, or how long, is one ready to believe in the Self.<br/><br/>It also beautifully portrays the father-son relationship. Personally, I think a little more stress on just the father-son relationship would make me love the movie even more. But, then again there's no limit to what one wants.<br/><br/>I say, once again, Will Smith did an impeccable job. The little kid was also great. The chemistry between the two actors was splendid and undeniably REAL.<br/><br/>One of the best movies I've ever seen!!!"

Just give the public the story of real people in real situations. I guarantee success.<br/><br/>Smith delivered the performance of a lifetime. I liked him as an actor before this movie. I'm in awe of him after this performance. There is not much else he could have done to make his character more believable. His real son was a wonderful addition as his character's son.<br/><br/>I don't critique every aspect of a film. It's not my style and frankly I don't care about all the goofs or ""artistic qualities"" of a movie. I have a real life with real problems just as everyone else does. I know movies are not reality. I watch movies to give me a temporary escape from reality. If you want to see an excellent movie with a solid, sequential plot and a wonderful storyline, watch ""The Pursuit of Happiness."" I promise that you will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>P.S. Evidently there is an automatic spell check on the comments. It keeps correcting the word ""happiness"" to the correct spelling.

"teh_mode","7","2","3","28 January 2007"," Genuinely moving, and tear-inducing, tale of one man's struggle against absolutely everything.
","As the main protagonist in Gabriele Muccino's unsentimental film points out  ""The pursuit of happiness"" is written in to the declaration of independence. Happiness might not be, but the pursuit is. And I suppose the point of this film is to show just how miserable that pursuit can be  as all manner of things go wrong for Will Smith, son Jaden, and ever-bitchy wife (Newton).<br/><br/>Chris Gardner is a salesman down on his luck. Having invested his life savings in techno-marvellous (but unnecessarily expensive) bone scanners, he finds it extremely difficult to sell enough just to feed his family. His wife (a thanklessly bitchy role for Thandie Newton) has clearly had enough, and threatens to leave if Chris doesn't pick up paychecks any time soon. One day Chris sees a grin-infested man exiting an exquisitely swish sports car on his way to work. In a chance encounter, he queries to him as to what he does to earn such luxuries. He responds, ""I'm a stockbroker"". And from there, Gardner decides to pursue his own version of ""Happiness"", albeit through a very hard route.<br/><br/>For the most part  The Pursuit of Happiness is more of a disaster movie than a fish-out-of-water tale. After getting accepted for an internship at a stockbroking firm, the film operates as a series of events in which absolutely everything conspires against our hero and his son. From mad hippies attempting to steal his bone scanners to getting arrested for not paying parking fines, the film  despite being inspired by real events  depicts some ridiculous situations that send our hero near to the brink of bonkers. Yet despite this, The Pursuit of Happiness never feels forced, perhaps thanks to the fine performance of its lead. Smith is on fine form, as is his son Jaden, acting with a natural charm and verve that presumably runs in the family. In between the moments of anguish and desperation are some truly moving moments of father-son bonding, one of which involves our two hapless heroes having to spend the night in a train station toilet, to avoid snoozing in the street. But by the end of the film you should feel no shame in shedding a deserved tear for Gardner, as the movie manages to avoid the kind of schmaltzy sentimentality that rolls the eyes against so many other Hollywood films, for a truly heartfelt ending that gives our characters the kind of reward they have worked so diligently for. It is a hard watch at the best of times, but will win you over in the end."

","When i first walked into this film my expectations were not high. I assumed it would be a very sentimental occasionally humorous, feel good film but in the end it became so much more. <br/><br/>Within about ten minutes I realized that I was in for a very special treat. Chris Gardner is a smart man, determined salesman, and a devoted father. However when his sales slowly decrease so does his money and he finds himself struggling to cope with his rent. On top of this he finds himself juggling his son (played by Jaden Christopher Syre Smith ) a stockbroker internship, and a life which ultimately is looking bleak and unfulfilled. <br/><br/>His determination to stay on top of life is uplifting. Will Smith portrays "" Chris Gardner "" in a way which I could never have seen him act. A surprise, but a very welcome surprise nonetheless. The movie is set into chapters of Chris's life. He is the narrator in places as well, where he talks about life, his story and the pursuit of happiness. Which is also the main message of the film, that happiness is something that cannot be found but merely pursued. There is perhaps only one negative point about this film. Which is at times it is a little clichéd. The whole idea has been done before and some parts are a tad predictable but to be honest i enjoyed this film so much i barely noticed. Instant Classic."

"cwrdlylyn","7","2","3","9 January 2007"," THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS : Transcends The Dangerously Sappy Formula With Genuine Emotion...
","THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS<br/><br/>Going into a film like THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, the audience can basically assume that in the end, that happ""y""ness will be found in the end... leading to a tear-jerking finale of overwhelming emotion. As one would expect, that's exactly how THE PURSUIT OF Happiness ends, but even though there is virtually no level of surprise, this Will Smith vehicle somehow manages to stand above similarly themed sap-fests.<br/><br/>THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS tells the true story of Christopher Garndener (played by Will Smith in a very touching performance), a down-on-his luck salesman who finds himself raising his son on his own in the hardest of financial times. In an attempt to make life better for himself and his young son (played by Smith's real life son Jaden), Chris embarks on a demanding internship at the firm Dean & Whitter. It's an unpaid position with no promise of a job afterwords, but Gardener sees it as his only choice and despite being homeless and broke, he carries out the internship with determination to be the one man chosen for a job with the firm.<br/><br/>The movie follows a very conventional format, but it does so in a refreshingly unconventional manner. Gabrielle Muccino, the film's director, embraces a grittier look for the film and wisely chooses to not emphasize the emotions at every possible moment. Too often a film like this seems to be gunning for tears from it's audience at every possible moment, but Muccino shows genuine restraint and instead lets the drama play out very naturally.<br/><br/>Many times throughout the movie, it seemed impossible how difficult this poor mans life... and knowing that this actually happened to someone makes the film all the more powerful. Will Smith grounds the familiar story with a quiet, humble, and stoic determination to succeed that is only overshadowed by a love for his son. Smith conveys the conflicting feelings of love, failure, stress, and anger without ever losing the gentle hearted soul that makes Christopher Gardener. One of my largest reservations about the film was the casting of Smith's real-life son, however it turns out to be a very wise choice. Jaden Smith is so at ease acting opposite his father that he succeeds in avoiding the cloyingly annoying sweetness of most child actors. It's a very natural relationship between the two that works very well.<br/><br/>THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS transcends it's conventionally inspirational story by taking many unconventional approaches as mentioned above. However, there are a few moments that stand out as slightly manipulative... in particular, a sequence in which Smith and his son spend a night in a subway pretending to hide from Dinosaurs. However, in a genre that is usually overflowing with sap, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS makes it through the majority of its 2 hour running time without overdoing it. For that, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS exceeded my expectations, and Smith's performance is deserving of award-consideration at year's end.<br/><br/>... B+ ..."
"samseescinema","8","2","3","15 December 2006"," flings us higher than any feel-good film in a while
","The Pursuit of Happiness reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>For a feel-good movie, The Pursuit of Happiness sure does want its audience to feel crappy. I don't mean this as a criticism. Rather, I think it's a show of intense bravery for a film stuck in a genre already soaked in sappiness. But it's a long, downhill journey for most of the film's duration, watching as Mr. Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is repeatedly pummeled under the American economic system. I suppose it follows Nietzsche's oft-repeated quote ""what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger."" And so, to ravage the saying entirely, if the lows of The Pursuit of Happiness doesn't kill the picture, they make its endingyou know, the feel-good part of the recipejust that much sweeter. <br/><br/>The grand scheme was to tell the story of the American dream from a new perspective. Such was the motivation in bringing European director Gabriele Muccino onto the project. Feeling that Americans have drawn too close to the concept to pull any focus on it, Muccino takes a step back and looks at our American dream from a fresh perspective. The result is indeed refreshing. The movie comes without any fat around its curves. It's a slim, distilled version of the American dream, where a mana smart, good man in whom most Americans probably see themselvestries to better his living conditions using the American system of capitalism promised in the Constitution. It doesn't come with a side dish of romance or tragic hors d'oeuvre; just a man trying to do right by his family. <br/><br/>But Chris Gardner's family is quickly dispersing. Linda (Thandie Newton), his wife, leaves him early on, choosing to fend for herself rather than go down with Chris' sinking ship. She leaves him with their son Christopher (Jaden Smith), whose daycare costs $150 per month. Chris would have to sell two bone density scanners each month to pay rent, daycare and groceries. But he hasn't sold one of the wretched devices in a while and the overdue bills are piling up. Chris is good at numbers though, and can solve a Rubik Cube with astounding ease; so he applies for an internship at Dean Witter. The gig's an unpaid one, but if he gets the job at the end of the course, he's set for life. Problem is, only one in twenty interns is hired; and if you aren't hired, you can't apply for a job at any other stock brokerage firm for six months. <br/><br/>The script is a product of Steven Conrad, the same writer who penned last year's The Weather Man. The films are deceivingly similar, each chronicling a series of unfortunate occurrences that slowly slice at the legs of an American man. In both films, Conrad manages to find a sweet and hilarious humanity in bad days, or bad weeks, or bad years. His heroes are good men and American men, who struggle to find themselves something worth having in our system. <br/><br/>Much huzzah has been made over the familial pairing of Will Smith and his son in parallel father-son roles. The decision was a smart one, as their performances are as sincere as ever. Jaden may not have many lines, but it's not hard to see that he loves and believes in his father, whether he's playing Will Smith or Chris Gardner. And Mr. Smiththe older one, that ishasn't been lying in his much-publicized interviews that this film is a turning point in his acting career. His Muhammad Ali was a force, but the role of Chris Gardner was built for him.<br/><br/>Make no mistake though; for the feel-good genre, The Pursuit of Happiness is a brutal, sometimes cruel entry. But I suppose that's the point, and Chris says it somewhere in the first act: that when the founders of the Constitution wrote ""the pursuit of happiness"" into the text, they only promised the pursuit. The chase is a long, mean one; but when the end is found, it flings us higher than any feel-good film in a while. <br/><br/>Samuel Osborn"
"zsscreen","10","2","3","19 December 2006"," Big Will for a win!!!
","I wasn't familiar with Chris Gardner's story before this movie. I think it's a great story. The struggles he face seem hard to bear. But, believing in himself got him through it. Everyone has that capacity no matter their color, background or religion. Those of you that only see Will Smith as an actor that can only do comedy are sadly mistaken. He will win an award for this role. I'm sure of it. I feel it in my bones...as the old folks use to say. Movie goers need to open their minds to actors or actresses range on screen. Thank God they believe they could do it. Look what Jamie Foxx proved. Who knew Robert De Niro could be so funny. That little Ronnie Howard would grow up to be an award winning director. Maybe, just like Chris Gardner they are able to dream and dream big. To make those dreams come true it takes hard work. My motto is if you're going to dream you might as well dream big. Good luck to this film and all that took part in it."

","It (The Pursuit of Happyness) is disgusting for ideological reasons - that the authors of the film show a terrifying system of inequality, where people suffer from poverty as something unchangeable and offer to build into it and play in these rat races, instead of fighting to change such a vile system. It was created by people and people can change it. In many countries, there is no such inequality as in the United States and in Europe, the state helps people, there is free medicine, education, unemployment benefits and generally humanism. In the United States, a terrible predatory system of social Darwinism, where the life of the poor is continuous suffering (this is not the case in European welfare States).<br/><br/>And instead of destroying this cruel system to the nines, as do healthy Directors and offer a humane alternative, the authors of this abomination show how the main character is diligently embedded and supports this fascism"
"Jodro2","1","1","1","24 April 2020"," A stupid, hypocritical, depressing movie.
","So at the very end of the movie, after spending well over 6 months in movie time making wrong life choices and selling his soul to The Man and suffering greatly and being partly responsible for enormous suffering of his son and wife, The Man finally decides to give Chris a tiny piece of the big money cake. There's no creativity, no light, no brilliance, just suffering, submission, and hard work. And this is supposed to be an inspiring morality tale?<br/><br/>I had great hopes of this movie, and throughout was willing myself to love it, despite its extensive longueurs and the fact that Chris kept making very questionable decisions. The suffering was relentless, and I kept hoping that it would all make sense in the end. It didn't. Chris did not make it big by inventing something, by being original, by taking the path less traveled. No, he made it big by buying wholesale into the capitalist American dream, where only money and hard work matter.<br/><br/>I should have known right at the start that this movie wasn't going to be a social critique, despite the gritty images. The dreadful sentimental music was a dead give-away that that the grittiness was all surface, and the heart of the movie was one long justification of a sick system: the idea that anyone can make it if you work hard enough. This myth is one of the many sicknesses of the American system, because the fact is, only the odd person makes it in this way, because the system is dramatically skewed in favor of the already rich.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes this movie watchable is Will Smith's performance. And as you get dragged along by this, for nearly 2 long hours, all the time waiting for a moment of transcendence, of redemption, of inspiration, it only becomes obvious in the very last minutes that the movie has its heart entirely in the wrong place.<br/><br/>Intelligent perspectives could have been given on the fundamental unfairness of the system, on race, and on other things. But in the end, the only things that matter are money, and the way to get it is by sucking up to The Man and working harder than anyone else. It leaves a terrible taste in the mouth. What a stupid, empty, depressing movie. Ugh."

","Chris Gardner being a broken man he never gave up on life. His wife left him, financially broken, lost the apartment, actually lost almost everything that brings him happiness. But as a courageous man he never ever let the life's challenges to win.
Even though his wife has left him because of his financial instability he never left his son. Such a good father. Normally under such situation the man meets other lady and starts new affair. But he never betrayed his love even though Linda left him. Once Christopher asked Chris ""Did mom leave because of me?"", as a experienced man about the life, Chris gave the most admirable answer I have ever heard, ""Mom left because of mom"". I have never heard such a beautiful definition for quitting a relationship until I watch this wonderful movie!
Chris once said in the interview that ""I'm the type of person if you ask me a question, and I don't know the answer I'm gonna tell you that I don't know. But I bet you what I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer"". I think even that only saying describes him best. Even though he didn't get a salary in the internship he never gave up the chance. Worked hard even without drinking water or hanging down the phone's receiver by the same time he looked after Christopher as best as he can as a good father!<br/><br/>This movie actually gives us he best life lessons!.

"khanaymal","10","1","1","23 February 2019"," Optimism versus Pessimism
","The beauty of this film is its honesty. This movie is going to play with emotions, you are going to cry and laugh along with the characters. An amazing, realistic father and son scenario is well illustrated. The father (Will Smith) teaches his son about the hardship of life and how to deal with it.
In spite of his, failures, he keeps on, trying again and again, and proves that, there, is no age of, success and it doesn't matter what your background is. We need to learn to live with the realization that we have, we equally need to accept that we have failed in succeeding in the first attempt. For every difficult, we encounter in life there are several solutions. To believe that we are the author of our destiny does not deny and that circumstances may severely restrict us. If we are unhappy with our circumstances, we have the freedom to go and seek out more favorable conditions. We have always at least one other option besides self-pity.
In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern which is common in life This movie shows the constraints that are imposed on us by our environment. It shows that it would be foolhardy to assume that we can overrule these constraints without some sort of consequences.
This movie shows that there is always a two-way interaction between ourselves and the people we relate. A further point to note is that not only can we influence others but we can also influence ourselves. We must have the ability to construct our reality, but that means taking responsibility for the choices we make.
The men of self-fulfillment and contentment lie in our own hands. It takes courage to work towards one's happiness because it means taking the risk of trying new ways and learning more about oneself and one's feelings. It takes determination to preserve on a new way and not giving up at the sight of the first obstacle.
Some Inspiring words from the Movie.
""You got a dream... You got to protect it. People can't do something'
themselves, they want to tell you, you can't do it. If you want
something, go get it.""
Will Smith tells his son, ""Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me."""

","The Pursuit of Happyness is an alright movie which could have been a great movie if they had only managed to tone down the saccharine feel of the proceeding. The intentions aren't wrong, and Will Smith should be commended for his portrayal but at over two hours it is way too long and ineptly directed to be recommended. If you are a hardcore Will Smith fan you should have a look and maybe it will even appeal to you (the movie has sharply divided critics and audiences) but for what its worth The Pursuit of Happiness is a middling effort."
"zkonedog","7","1","1","1 March 2017"," A Movie For Its Times (And Perhaps Beyond)
","Back in 2006 when this film was released, the United States economy was headed towards the worst downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930's. ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a reflection of those hard times.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this movie (based on a true story) focuses on Chris Gardner (Will Smith), a salesman who can't seem to make ends meet. His products are not selling and his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) wants to leave him. Caught in the middle is young son Christopher (Jaden Smith). In a sort of last gasp effort to make a better life for his family, Chris decides to accept an internship as an investment banker under the tutelage of Jay Twistle (Brian Howe). It is truly a make-or-break effort that will require even more sacrifice in the short term. as the internship is unpaid (but may lead to stable employment).<br/><br/>The themes central to this film are ones that most viewers can relate to: working hard, making sacrifices for family, and contemplating the hard choices in life. This is why the movie packs such an emotional punch. We all see (or would like to see) a little bit of ourselves in Chris Gardner, and that makes us root for him to succeed in life all the more. His seemingly endless setbacks only deepen that emotional connection.<br/><br/>It helps that the acting in ""Pursuit of Happiness"" is top-notch, with the crown jewel being the chemistry between Will Smith and real-life son Jaden. Theirs are the emotional backbones of the story, to be sure. In recent years, Will Smith has seen his career hit a significant snag, but rest assured that this is him at the top of his acting game.<br/><br/>""Pursuit of Happiness"" is also able to connect with viewers on a personal, day-to-day level. Perhaps in a future United States where the economy improves, these themes won't be so readily apparent. But even now (and especially in 2006) those hard choices that Chris must make I'm sure mirrored many individuals in America. Tapping into current culture can be a powerful thing on the big screen, and this film realizes that potential to the max.<br/><br/>Overall, I very much enjoyed this viewing experience. It isn't quite good enough to go into my ""All Time Favorites"" category, but it easily does enough things write to be an emotional, meaningful film."

","*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***<br/><br/>I was quite disappointed in this film, and I'll tell you why. For starters, it's been on my watch list for quite some time now, since I've been exploring the topic of happiness, well-being, and all that good stuff. I thought this film would provide an interesting angle on this, and present a different point of view. It does indeed present a different point of view. In a nutshell, it tells you that making your family a lower priority, while chasing the dream of making gobs of money at a career you know nothing about, are the keys to happiness. I beg to differ.<br/><br/>As a result of constantly letting down his wife, Will Smith finally loses her, and is left attempting to raise his young son, while essentially becoming homeless, but through hard work and gumption, he makes something of himself. And that's the pursuit of happiness. That's the entire film right there -- I just saved you two hours of your life.<br/><br/>To be fair, Smith, Jaden, and Thandie Newton all did a great job with the roles they were given. But the plot, script, and overarching message of this film absolutely didn't sit well with me at all. I'd rather engage in everyday happiness, than get caught up in ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" (sic), thank you."
"user-926-140067","Null","1","1","17 February 2014"," Review for The Pursuit of Happiness
","We have so many definitions for the word ""Hero"". We call hero people who can save our world, because they are just, brave, and they will fight to the end even though they sacrifice themselves. For example firemen or soldiers are natural heroes we can't help but cheer on. There are also some people who are average folks struggling to pay rent and care for their children. They are all around us and we can also call them heroes. The movie: The Pursuit of Happiness is a very good movie to describe those folk heroes. I recommend this movie because its true story, of the great acting of Will Smith, and it can bring us hope for a better life.<br/><br/>In the movie The Pursuit of Happiness we can see how a good man tries to make an honest living and keep his family together during hard times. Gardner and his wife Linda have a five-year-old son who is named Christopher, and they don't have money because Gardner and Linda have sunk their savings into a truckload of high-tech bone density scanners. Gardner planned to sell these machines to hospitals. However, they have trouble selling it because most hospitals don't want buy his product. Soon, Gardener's family gets into a poor situation. In this time, life for Gardner's family become more and more hard. Gardner and his son start to leave their home. No matter how hard it is to live, Gardner never gives up, and he tries to make a better life for his family.<br/><br/>The movie: The Pursuit of Happiness is produced by Columbia Pictures; the director is Gabriele Muccino, and the lead role is played by Will Smith. The Pursuit of Happiness, set in 1981, is inspired by the real life story of underdog Chris Gardner, who rose from being homeless to become a stock market tycoon. It really happened just in our daily life, and this showed that there are everyday heroes. In this movie we can see the superb acting of Will Smith. He shows every little emotion in great detail, and his vivid acting can touch every audience. I heard about many people crying when they watched this movie because of the impressive plot and Will Smith's perfect acting skill.<br/><br/>From The Pursuit of Happiness we can see that we all can be a hero if we keep fighting and never give up for life. In the movie Gardner is hero for himself and his family, because he makes his dream come true by his hand. I can still remember that Gardner cried twice in the whole movie. The first cry is when they don't have money to live in a motel, and they just sleep in the subway's bathroom. When he looked at his son he can't help but cry, and in that time he swear to try his best to give his son a better life. The second time when he cries, he gets the job which can help him to make the dream come true.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to you, because of the impressive plot, the great actors, and the positive energy. We can clearly know from this movie that however hard life could be, if you keep fighting and never give up, the happiness will knock on your door."

A movie that should form a part of the syllabus in schools, colleges, rehabilitation centers, etc. Parents should show this to kids not doing well. During these times of job losses and lacklustre business environment the world has been going through for the 12-24 months now, this movie should be aired everyday! (I'm lucky to be holding on to my job yet :))<br/><br/>2 parts like any movies - story and the movie per se. I cannot appreciate the greatness of the life story of Chris Gardener without sounding clichÃ©d and boring. It's a story of perseverance, unfettered killer determination, hope, helplessness, confidence, optimism and love for family. The real story is probably even more depressing and gripping due to the longevity of the tough times Chris Gardener went through. Stories such as this can even lift a dead man's spirits!<br/><br/>The movie is just about the story - the story is the hero here. But all credit goes to the director and the actors for not spoiling a legendary story and doing all justice to it. <br/><br/>The movie is nothing of short of wonderful and respectful. Respectful for the justice it has done to one of the most inspiring stories the world has ever witnessed. Very powerful screenplay and performances gives the movie the much needed spirit. Both Smiths have given their career best performances. Will Smith's performance can draw you from where you are in to his world and let you go after 2 hrs with refilled sense of optimism, inspiration and confidence.<br/><br/>Parts of the movie will make you cry because Gardener cries / suffers, make you smile because he smiles, gets you worried because he's worried and finally ""pursue happiness"" because he does it. Gardener's little facial expressions and changes in body language are worth a million words. The everlasting smile on his face and the positive energy he exudes when he meets people despite the fact that he was sleeping in a public toilet at the railway station the previous night or he was arrested for failure to pay parking tickets teaches one a lot. While it may not mean that he's actually happy or positive or hopeful (and in fact it actually does not mean that as his anxiety and worry about his future and his kid's future is being easily given away by his eyes), it certainly means that he believes in fighting. That last scene where he gets his job takes the cake. Like he says in the movie ""this part, this little part"" deserves standing ovation.<br/><br/>The whole movie was something I could relate to though by no means was my experiences anywhere near Gardener's. But the last scene reminded me of similar emotions I went through and similar reactions I had when something similar occurred in my life.<br/><br/>One of the handful of movies that had a lasting impact on me. It is not a 2 timer, 10-timer or something. It's a multi timer. It's like a medicine that's got to be taken whenever the going gets tough. Learnt a lot from this movie. To mention a few - ""there is no y (why) in happiness"", ""happyness is something that can only be pursued but not had"".<br/><br/>Kudos to the team that made this movie. And salute Mr Gardener.<br/><br/>10/10."

","Pursuit of Happiness is one of the most impressive movies i have ever seen and was ever made. everything is so perfect in this movie. the movie rightly portrays the struggle of a simple man from nowhere to top. when a man tries to make his move up the ladder everyone tries to take away that ladder but once he is there he gets that respect. This movie is all about that. coming to acting skills - movie is way above appreciation levels. just too good, especially the last part where he finally gets the job and he walks out to street to express his happiness..now thats what i call happiness. excellent movie must watch for everyone. i don't understand why it is so underrated here."

","This is one of the great movies in recent memory. Will Smith does an amazing job playing the character of a man who has lost it all but is looking to gain a better life for him and his family (son). There are of course the usual ups and downs including housing, family, etc but the plot and the emotion of this film set it apart from the rest. The movie does a great job of showing hope when most would not even consider the idea. Will Smith displays the emotion of a father that is doing everything he can to provide for his family even though everything continues to go wrong and it would be easy to give up. This is a great moving depicting how you can fight against the odds and win, and in the process win the pursuit of happiness."
"russel-kennedy","9","1","1","27 March 2012"," Powerful and Inspirational tribute to the human spirit!
","""Pursuit of Happiness"" was a great movie that really makes you feel good. Although it is frustrating to watch Gardner's character go through all of the ""learning lessons"" he has to, it is so well done and is a story almost any normal (i.e., non-wealthy, non-'Hollywood star') person can identify with and feel compassion for.<br/><br/>What an impressive man! Life can be hard, and he made it much harder than he needed to. But that often happens in true stories, and he learned what he needed to learn in the process, which is the real point of the movie. What a fantastic job Will Smith did, and Jaden is so cute you could just eat him up! (No, not literally!!) I was so impressed I had to see this one more than once."
"StevePulaski","9","1","1","18 March 2012"," Tugs at the moral heart strings as if it has immediate access
","Once in a while, a film will subtly waltz by and sweep you off your feet leaving you with a keen sense of assurance and hope. The Pursuit of Happiness manages to do all that without seeming indulgent or heavy-handed. The film is based off of Christopher Gardner's memoir of the same name, about a stressed father who overcomes the largest of obstacles in order to provide him and his son with the life they have always wanted.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays Gardner, a confident, everyman who has invested his family's savings into bone-density scanners that give a picture slightly deeper than an x-ray and cost twice as much. They are defined as ""unnecessary luxuries,"" and many hospitals have turned down Gardner's offer, much to his dismay. Gardner's long-suffering wife, who finally walks out on him, is played by Thandie Newton. Newton's character is aggravated at his overpowering idea that ""things will get better,"" and wishes he'd live in the moment and admit the chips are down. Their son, Christopher Gardner Jr., is played by Smith's son Jaden Smith, in his first film role. Smith shows signs of possessing a charismatic enigma, that few newcomer childhood actors can replicate. He is funny, sweet, and sometimes eerily passionate about his character at such a young age.<br/><br/>The film follows Gardner's new job as an intern stockbroker, a job that is tiresome, involving, and utterly restless. The job can only be overcomplicated when you're looking for a place to eat and sleep every night, taking care of your plucky and adventurous kid, and fighting back at a society that has become arrogant, derogatory, and shamelessly cynical. This is perhaps Smith's most involved performance to date. It seems the only way Smith could play the character so well is if he had some sort of experience like Gardner's. It doesn't seem like you could just jump into the role of the man so effortlessly, but in order to efficiently pull it off, you would've had to go through some emotion-testing event in your life similar to his. I don't know why, but it just seems that way.<br/><br/>Besides the performances being simply mesmerizing by everyone involved, the film has a good sense of honesty and realism to add substance to the story as well. Far too often are we faced with films that evoke happiness, or happiness in this case, as the thing that gets handed to us in a bright package. The Pursuit of Happiness works so well because it shows the true side of life. That we as humans might go through a number of failures before we achieve what we want, and even when we get what we want, might even still not avoid some failures. After Gardner gets the job as a stockbroker, he still goes through a lot of tribulations and aggravating circumstances in order to keep his new job. Sleeping in a homeless shelter with dozens of other strangers, having little to no money in his wallet, and knowing he can't provide for his son like other fathers are just some of the things that would drive an ambitious father up the wall. Perhaps his choices can be criticized, like letting his son sleep in a germ-infested bathroom, but his persistency must be commended.<br/><br/>There is one scene in particular that is very moving and it is the scene where Gardner and Jr. experience ""time travel"" in the subway station. The scene is so involving, simple, and effective. It's a scene that could've bled corniness and ridiculousness, but almost tugs at the heart strings. And that's what The Pursuit of Happiness does; tug at those moral heart strings not insultingly, but as if it has immediate access to them. And I think it's safe to say that many films know there's an easy entrance to those strings, but few choose to take that exact route.<br/><br/>Starring: Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Thandie Newton, Brian Howe, and Dan Castellaneta. Directed by: Gabriele Muccino."
"m-closson45","8","1","1","15 February 2012"," Easily the best
","I was involved with one of the first test audiences almost a year ago, and came away quite impressed with the acting performances and heartfelt punch of Pursuit of Happiness. This is easily one of Smith's best films, as he pours his heart and soul into the main character. While the plot may remain a bit transparent, it leaves you asking the question of yourself - how long would you keep battling to get what you really want out of life? I plan on seeing the film again when it releases to the general public, and am very interested to see what changes were made after running it through the test screenings. As I saw it then, it needed very few, if any, changes."

","The Pursuit of Happiness is about Christopher Gardner, a man who went through many trials and tribulations to be successful. He was born to a mother who spent time in jail and experienced abuse. He did not know who his father was; his mother's abusive boyfriend threw that in his face every chance he got. Chris joined the Navy as an adult and began medical training. He got married and had a son. His wife left him due to financial issues. The experience of having no father allowed Chris to be a good father to his son at all circumstances. After seeing a red Ferrari, he wanted to be a stockbroker. He worked towards that, homeless and all. That shows determination and motivation; to work towards a goal when it seems almost impossible. After being hired by Bearstone's stock company, Chris gradually succeeded as a stockbroker. He later went on to open his own brokerage firm. I think the message to readers is to not give up when things get difficult and that success is worth working hard for. I think the book is a good book for teenagers who want to know where they want to go in life. People who hadn't really been through anything should read this book and realize how fortunate they are. I think this book teaches readers that they are one choice away from being in Chris's former predicament. I like this book because it shows the steps Chris took to become successful. The book didn't just go straight to the success story. I recommend this book to high schools, colleges, and correctional institutions and jails should offer this book as an option because it gives off a good message."

","I was very happy that this film never got political and blamed Reagan for the number of ""down on their luck"" people that were shown, nor was the race card ever pulled out. It was also refreshing that Smith's character never blamed anybody for his troubles.<br/><br/>It's very funny at parts, but be prepared for some serious drama. In no ways is it clichÃ© or contrived or boring. Let's just say that's it not Oliver Stone dramatic. This truly is a must see. To say ""I laughed, I cried"" would be really lame.

Everybody who believe in good things happen to good people get something for their soul. This is Will Smith's greatest acting by a clear mile. He delivers so well. His powerful emotions and character development are amazing. He nails the role of Chris Gardner, a story of a salesman with ongoing contraries in life to achieve success through determination and attitude. In addition, he has his own son Jaden playing his son in the movie, so it's a natural match.<br/><br/>People need those kind of movies. They need something to keep them going. Many people are facing problems like Chris every single day. The movie not only gives inspiration, but it reminds us the most important factors to achieve success which are determination and attitude. The latter, in my opinion, is the key.

","It is really a good movie. I think that no matter how hard you devote, what difficulties you will encounter, just believe in yourself that happiness and dreams will become yours and come true one day. Don't care about others' depreciation and stand up again when you fail. Just like what Chris said to his son, ""Don't ever let somebody tell you, you can't do something, not even me. You got a dream, you got to protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you that you can't do it. If you want something, go get it."" In fact, happiness is always there, outside the door, but we never open the door for it and refuse it to come in or didn't seize it and treasure it when it passed by. Therefore, we have to create our happiness and grasp it immediately, not let it vanish before your eyes.<br/><br/>This movie uses the way like telling a story. It doesn't have fancy special effects to present this movie. But there are lots of ideas to show implications, like the wrong spelling about happiness . I think it is really a touching movie to see how a father supports his family and takes care of his child. We have to treasure what we have now, what our parents gave us and never blame everyone and everything except yourself."

","The Pursuit of Happiness was a beautiful movie with a theme that sold out to the audience showing that one man in pursuit of his happiness regardless of his difficulties in life. There were many lessons to learn from this movie. The word Happiness was spelled incorrectly but there was something special in the word that stood out and so was Chris Gardener. It foretold happiness, joy, and abundance in life. Though Chris complained about the spelling many times, but there was a true meaning behind it. Chris Gardner (Will Smith) was a man of courage who was willing to risk many things in life for a better future. He was not afraid of anything and was willing to face his challenges regardless of the circumstances. His experience in life was a very challenging one. His wife, Linda (Thandie Newton) thought that failure for him was inevitable, but to Chris it was a risk that he was willing to take to make life better for his family. Chris was going through the storm, but he left his fears behind to seek for lasting peace and a better future. He was persistent in every disappointment that he encountered. His wife, Linda hurtful actions and her personal choice did not destroy his hope for his future. It did not sap his energy and rob him of his joy that he would encounter in the future. Being homeless was a price he had to pay so he could fight harder to achieve his goal. The lighting was appropriate when he was hustling on the streets during the day to sell his bone densitometry machines. <br/><br/>There were many guilt trips that was place upon him by his landlord for not being able to pay his rent on time, his wife nagging him about not bringing in money and she had to work extended hours for the family to survive, the daycare that did not provide proper scholastic teaching for the children in which he knew, but that was all he could afford. He knew that with much faith one day he would resurrect from that life of poverty and excel in this country. He believed that if he studied hard and work hard he would reap his harvest of plenty. He trusted in his inner being to direct him in making his decisions. He did not allow his wife to keep their son Christopher Gardner (Jaden Smith); she would have to go alone. Where ever Chris was he wanted his son to be there. He was a great example to Christopher and a great father. He loved Christopher and promised that he would not let him down. He protected Christopher in every way he could. He was patient and a very positive father to him. He always had some encouraging words for Christopher. He persevered through his struggles and won. In comparison, to Freedom Writers where one teacher, Ms. Gruwell (Hilary Swank) fought tirelessly to help students from gang trouble community to better themselves by continuing to attend school and avoid the dangers of gang life. Giving them the tool to become college graduates and achieve a career for a better future. There were many great characteristic in Chris that many people can look at him and his achievement to partner their lives on that of Chris to become stronger and more persistent when trying to achieve their goals."

","Contrary to the reviews I have already read, I really did not know what to make of this film based on a true story, although I do believe that Will Smith's performance was superb.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of happiness played against a background of modern, free enterprise America, yet there are soup kitchens and clear signs of other deprivation, I believe I caught a glimps of a man lying on the streets, and people were litrally walking past him.<br/><br/>In my view, the soup kitchens, the homelessness, the deprivation across the USA, and the apathy that supports it, are the real story here, and as such need addressing through the American media, but are they being addressed ?????????.<br/><br/>Modern America is the archetype of how ""not"" to run a country, because people have a ""right"" to a decent reasonably paid job, and affordable housing, yet the underclass shown in this film courtesy of Will Smith's travels are being deprived of their human rights.<br/><br/>I can understand the Hollywood moguls wanting to make a film about people who strive against the odds to better their lives, because Hollywood are part of the so-called American dream, yet in the 20's, 30's, and 40's, Hollywood itself treated those who worked in it, like virtual slaves, because they wanted to sell a product for their American audiences, who were, and still are, trying to achieve their own American dream.<br/><br/>Whilst I do take my hat off to the real life character played by Will Smith, and what this guy achieved in real life, this man was clearly an exception to the rule.<br/><br/>Most people in free market America, as here in England due to the same marked based system, live in fear of losing their jobs, their homes, their very livelyhoods, because these are all the downside of a low tax economy free market culture.<br/><br/>I found ""The pursuit of Happiness"" depressing, but I kept with it so I could write this honest review.<br/><br/>I am not giving this film 10 stars. I am giving Will Smith's gripping performance 10 stars.<br/><br/>And I pour shame on America who have the Statue of Liberty as their hallmark of ""Liberty"".<br/><br/>Because frankly there is no liberty, or human rights in America, people can have it all one moment, then lose everything the next."

His real-life son Jaden is also wonderful as the plucky little boy who rolls with the punches and loves his dad no matter what.<br/><br/>This film about a father's descent into homelessness is full of frustration, tempered with the innocence and resilience of the little son.

"Dr_Coulardeau","9","1","1","15 April 2009"," Good acting, good subject but what about all the others?
","We are not used to seeing Will Smith playing the father taking care of his son alone. Especially in his world under Reagan. He lost his wife, then his apartment, then a second apartment, then he had to go to homeless people's shelters, with his son mind you, sleep in BART toilets, with his son mind you, work like hell to get a new profession in the world of finance, go on selling some of the medical machines he was selling before to just make ends meet, to avoid the worst possible, losing his child, his son. And he manages to keep his cool, to remain friendly with everyone, even those who obviously exploit him, and he proves himself and he gets the job, one out of twenty. The whole film is dominated by a quotation from the Declaration of Independence, the ""pursuit of happiness"". And this pursuit is a real chase but a chase that does not so much take place outside, because outside it is a hunt not for happiness but for the game that is homeless, defenseless, out of luck and deprived of the minimum. But the chase, and the pursuit, is in one's mind first and foremost. If you are not free in your mind, if you have no project and if you do not have the motivation and the determination to get it going, you will not overcome the difficulties life will bring. Though I think this is true for everyone, that motivation and determination are the basic qualities you need to get anywhere in life, the end result will be quite different and vary a lot according to the point where you started and the opportunities that will come along across your own path and that you will be able to catch. We definitely are equal potentially, but the end results of people in their lives vary tremendously and then at this point equality is no longer the main characteristic. That makes the film slightly sad. For one financial success, how many meager survivals?

The line where Will Smith says - ""If you have a dream, you need to protect it"" was absolutely amazing. I could absolutely feel his situation and the way he came out of it was completely amazing. This movie completely changed my opinion about Will Smith. I had never thought of him as such an intense actor. The various kinds of emotions that he brought along in his acting were splendid. The movie , in short was all about how one should go about in order to pursue his dreams"
"Rennaman","10","1","1","1 June 2008"," Great, Great film!
","I just watched this film and have to say that it was WELL worth the time. I highly recommend it! As my wife comes from SF and we visit there many times each year, it was fun to relate to places we had been that were used in the filming. In fact, one location, Ross Alley (which has been used in many films) was a location I had taken students to during a recent field trip to the City. What engaged me the most about the film is that Will Smith brings it to life so convincingly. I totally agree with other posters that it is Oscar worthy. I also highly recommend that fellow movie buffs read the trivia section before seeing the film. I just happened to have read a certain line just as it was happening in the movie and it almost brought tears to my old eyes. I rate this movie a 10/10 and hope all will get a chance to check it out. It will definitely be added to my permanent collection. Let's hope that those involved with the production add to the trivia comments."

","This movie only demonstrated the talent that Will Smith possesses as an actor. In contrast to one of his latest movies, ""I am Legend"", The Pursuit of Happiness was an excellent movie and it really goes to show what you can do when you really are dedicated and determined to make something better out of your life. Excellent performance by Will and his son Jaden was wonderful as well. If you're looking for a film that will touch your heart and teach you about the hardships of life, you should go and see this film. It has certainly taught me a thing or two about life and what it takes to achieve something good. I would gladly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it as yet."
"karthik-globalsoul","10","1","1","23 February 2008"," The Pursuit of Happiness  or the happiness of pursuit
","(Karthik Narayan)<br/><br/>My good friend joked, ""Is it the pursuit of happiness or the happiness of pursuit?"" Well you never know what happiness is... Two songs that come to my mind are: ""It's all about the Money"" by Meja and ""Ka ching"" by Shania Twain. Though both songs have different perspectives, the idea is simple  is money happiness? <br/><br/>How can you find happiness in a place that can't even spell it right?  Chris Gardener just opened up my mind to the question of what happiness is. I managed to ask a few people just to get vague answers like  what you like vs. what you get is matched and the result is happiness or otherwise. <br/><br/>Is money happiness? Is fame happiness? Is glory happiness? Is being able to match wits with the best minds in the world happiness? Is merit happiness? So many questions with no answers. <br/><br/>But then I remember the opening lines of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Douglas Adams) which reads  ""This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy."" <br/><br/>So in the hope that this movie would help me find the answer, I sat through the troubles of Chris Gardener (Will Smith) and his cute son (his real life son). What I saw was the hardship of poverty; how in spite of not being able to make ends meet, a person can come out and win in life. And most importantly, how society looks so happy when you are not able to even understand what it means to be so. <br/><br/>Life is like bending a steel bar. A steel bar is so rigid that you need to exert yourself to try and bend it. Happiness is the result of hard work. When the attempt to bend blends with a positive result, we would become happy. But happiness doesn't end with bending one bar. <br/><br/>There is no recipe for happiness. It is not just an emotion  it is the purpose of life. Why do we pursue happiness  to complete our otherwise incomplete life? Why do we live? It is not to wait for death, but to bring joy into the lives of many people including ours. <br/><br/>Will Smith continues to impress many of us in this movie. The movie isn't a blockbuster because it was full of violence, abuse, expletives  the theme is simple; the actors are simple. Sans heavy makeup that make them handsome. <br/><br/>Will Smith's transition from a cool guy to an actor who can taste and display emotions of normal people is groovy. <br/><br/>There are some instances when you don't know whether to laugh or to cry  these provide comic relief from the otherwise serious turn of events in the movie. <br/><br/>The message is simple  have dreams, never give up and follow those dreams; you will get to where you want to be.<br/><br/>This movie will provide you happiness when you find the DVD and after you are finished watching it, a smile that says it all. <br/><br/>How this missed getting into the Top 250 movies of all time is a wonder! More miracles, such good acting went unnoticed at the place where they gave away awards for so called ""Bests"" of the year 2006."

","I would like to have left this appreciation as the simple summery above 'Perfect' but I know IMDb will want me to right more.<br/><br/>But this film was simply perfect. It had everything going for it.<br/><br/>A passionate Italian director in the form of Gabriele Muccino.<br/><br/>Outstanding casting from the leads down to the minor uncredited roles.<br/><br/>Will Smith absolutely nailed the lead roll in this true story of the rags to riches journey of Chris Gardner. Will clearly respected the real life character and working with his own son to make this film made the father son relationship scenes so much more comfortable than they could have been with an unrelated young actor.<br/><br/>British actress Thandie Newton also crossed the Anglo American divide on a par with Renée Zellweger to play Christopher's (Chris Gardener Jr's)less than devoted mother very believably.<br/><br/>The ending was inevitably as predictable as the Titanic's with a lovely nod to the real life hero of the film at the end, but it is the journey to that ending that this film is all about.<br/><br/>This is a feel good film that works at every level. It will inspire many not to give up on their dreams and give those that have already tasted success the opportunity to reflect on the good fortune in their lives.<br/><br/>I recommend watching this at the end of a tough day when you want uplifting."

It made me think about my own son and of the things I can do to make our lives better thru hard work, perseverance and dedication. There are several uplifting moments where you whole-heartedly are happy for the characters when they're able to overcome the obstacles that have been put in their way.

"ronandboys323","10","1","1","10 June 2007"," A Timeless Film
","Will Smith plays the role of Christopher Gardner, a man living from day to day not knowing where he and his child will live. This role really challenged Smith's ability to act beyond the guns, the explosions and the punchlines that are usually in Smith's movies. All that lies in front of him is a camera and his emotions. You can literally feel the pain that he goes through as you see it in his eyes. Will Smith isn't the only one who deserves credit, his amazingly talented young son Jaden plays Will's son Christopher. Jaden's character is the fuel that lights his father. His maturity goes way beyond his age and you can feel the love that he shares for his father.<br/><br/>This movie is absolutely inspiring and should make us appreciate the luxuries that we all have. The movie truly touched me and everyone that I have watched it with, this movie definitely needs to be in your movie collection."
"fwgrhouse","10","1","1","8 June 2007"," Excellent
","I have to say that this is one of Will Smith's most memorable movies. The plot is very simple to understand, a man who's life is going down with his bad job, failing marriage, and extremely short on cash looks for a better job as a stock broker and to make things tougher his wife leaves him and his son and they end up on the streets for a brief time period. However eventually he gets the job and a better life and he and his son live happily ever after. I feel that what makes this film very good is that it's based on a true story. The acting is done very well, the script was well written, and even has good humor in some parts. This is inspirational, uplifting, and a must-see."

","I must say that i always thought that Will Smith could act beyond action and comedy. Well as usual... i was right... not to be arrogant. But i have just watched this film and it has truly inspired me. The Pursuit of Happiness taught me the lesson that no matter how far down the well you fall there's always the bucket next to you. Smith's performance in this caused me so much empathy for Gardner that i felt as though a human being just can't endure this and still retain it's sanity and drive. However the TRUE story managed to push through this and cause such a feeling of 'Happyness' that i felt as though my head would explode with joy for this person who had stayed so sturdy throughout this and come through. There is so much more i would love to say about the way this film touched my heart but i just don't have the time If i may give congratulations to Will Smith for performing so Oscar-ably and Mr Gardner himself for enduring all of that strife while holding a metaphorical roof over your young son no matter what."

","We in our lives always think we have it bad, credit card bills and lack of money, but then seeing this movie made me think really hard at my situation in life and in general my friends and family. It just makes you think that there's people in a lot worse than what you are. Being grateful for what you have is just the beginning. Beleiving in yourself, and going out there and not accepting defeat in the pursuit of happiness is the real story. Will Smith acted brilliantly as the single father trying to keep what he had left of himself and his son together. You get a real sense of the pain and the determination, and you somehow really want him to succeed in some ways even more than him. This is definitely one film that left a huge impact on my mind. A thoroughly enjoyable movie. A must see for everyone who's down in the dumps."

The only thing I would change is the run time of this movie, it seemed to drag on more than it needed to be... In the end, I thought this was a really great emotional movie and both Will Smith and his son did amazing jobs pursuing their roles. Will Smith himself did an amazing job portraying Chris, this definitely to me was one of the most deepest roles I've seen him play yet from everything else such as MIB and it shows that he has grown up a lot more. In conclusion, this movie is an amazing movie which carries a strong message in it."
"KillerLord","10","1","1","30 April 2007"," Superb!
","This is a very heart warming movie based on the life of Chris Gardner starring Will Smith. Will Smith has perhaps done the most challenging role of his career and he has done it with finesse and the Oscar nomination is well-deserved. Full credit to Will Smith for a job well done and to the entire team as well including the child actor.<br/><br/>I guess I need not describe the story for it should be well-known. Briefly put, it is about a man named Chris Gardner and his battle to fight the crisis in his life to come up on the top. It is the story of his struggle to set his life right.<br/><br/>And here is a small address to some of the critics who believe the movie sends out the wrong message. What wrong message? That pursuit of pecuniary independence is the pursuit of happiness? This is utter nonsense. The movie in fact encourages one to fight no matter what and find the happiness they are looking for. And yes, about the importance of money, we all know it is important in the structure of the society that we have created for ourselves. My strong opinion is that it is only the most pessimistic of persons who can ignore all the strong messages in the movie and argue (not discuss) about this ""message"" issue.<br/><br/>A must watch for all Smith fans and the ""real-life inspired drama"" genre of movies."
"nsfp2","5","1","1","12 April 2007"," Bankers Dream
","This film is a great pleasure for any individual who works in finance.<br/><br/>The film's hero has his epiphany after meeting a stockbroker who exiting his Ferrari bumps into our protagonist and announces on demand his profession. It becomes clear to Will Smith's character, Chris Gardner, that if he is ever to achieve wealth and hence happiness (sic) he must enter finance.<br/><br/>We then follow the heart wrenching story of a single parent who does not want to fail in his task of becoming an intern at asset management firm Dean Witter. This includes periods of extremely destitution, when Gardner; who is looking after his son (played by Will Smith's own son Jaden Smith) following the departure of his wife (Thandie Newton) for financial concerns; and among other hardships such as living in homeless shelters and metro stations.<br/><br/>The film moves along with a loud sound track, laughs, tears, and the occasional philosophical jab at big government. Any person who has ever questioned why they plug away in some mundane job in finance, should watch this film. I have already raised it with HR as a possible motivational video at my company's annual dinner. Will Smith both cries and gets run over for a place with Dean Witter Asset Management, something that pleased all of my banker friends very much.<br/><br/>All in a not a bad film but certainly not worth being run over."

But... it was worth it to wait, really.<br/><br/>The scene where father and son are homeless and have to sleep in a bathroom is very emotional and well acted. <br/><br/>The movie has a clear message, the quote which is most 'shocking' is:<br/><br/>Christopher Gardner: (to his son) You got a dream, you gotta protect it.

I went back and saw it again in the theatre and then rented it on DVD. A heartfelt thanks to Smith, Muccino, Gardner, and all who made this such a touching and unforgettable production.<br/><br/>I agree with viewers who appreciate the fact that Will Smith's character didn't blame racism or capitalist competition in America for his problems. He just had a series of tough breaks, not the least of which was abandonment by his wife.<br/><br/>I constantly witness and lament Hollywood's negative stereotypes of fathers. It is refreshing to see such a well-done movie that presents a father in a positive light. I often look to the movie Kramer vs Kramer as an all-time great feel-good pro-father film. But Pursuit of Happiness is even better. One of the reasons is the scene in which Smith's character is assuring his son that his mother didn't leave because the son was bad. Unlike in the movie Kramer vs Kramer, the dad didn't spend five minutes reflecting on what a lousy husband he'd been to his poor neglected wife. Smith's character simply said ""Mom left because of mom. It had nothing to do with you!"" Right on dad. And thank you Will Smith and Chris Gardner."
"andydreamseeker","8","1","1","7 April 2007"," Movie Review: The Pursuit Of Happiness
","It is a struggle to sit through two hours watching The Pursuit Of Happiness. The film is painful to watch. The movie aimed a sharp arrow right at your heart and there was nowhere to run. The Pursuit Of Happiness is inspired by the true story of Chris Gardner, a Wall Street legend. In this heartfelt two hours you'll find Chris Gardner pursuing his happiness as he kept running and running from one part of his life to another.<br/><br/>""Happiness"" here is spelt with the letter ""Y"" instead of the letter ""I"". Chris Gardner (Will Smith) complains about the spelling of the word that was painted outside a childcare centre where he goes to pick up his 5-year-old son, Christopher (Jaden Smith), in the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner was an unhappy man. He's a salesman for a bone-density scanner that doctors think it as a luxury medical item and thus his poor sales record. Poor sales mean no money and no money means no love. That is how the story goes.<br/><br/>Constantly challenged by the lack of security, Chris Gardner remained strong, largely motivated by his sense of responsibility to his son. Linda (Thandie Newton), his wife has chosen to leave him. Without a shelter over his head and without money in his pocket, he made the biggest decision in his life to go on an internship with Dean Witters as a stockbroker. This is his ticket to a place he calls ""Happiness"".<br/><br/>To get there though was no walk in the park, Chris Gardner's character was tested on every level. Often he is seen in a state of desperation and despair, but he never gave up on his dreams. He has a talent, and that talent was perseverance while at the same time he was smart. The only problem was that it was uncertain whether he could rise to that potential. The internship program would take six months, and there was no salary. At the end of those six months only one out of the twenty in the program would be hired. Now, what kind of a person would take such a risk? The answer would be a ""Stupid"" person. Stupid is not the same as being silly or being an idiot. To move forward, perhaps it is wise to first acknowledge your stupidity.<br/><br/>In any good film, there ought to be a defining moment. When Chris Gardner told off his son while his son was enjoying playing basketball, he reflected and he said this to his son:<br/><br/>""Don't ever let somebody tell you you can't do something, not even me all right""<br/><br/>""You got a dream you got to protect it. People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it.""<br/><br/>""You want something, go get it. Period.""<br/><br/>Is this movie any good? It's good. Period."

You know what's going to happen, so the question is does the rest of the movie carry you along and do you enjoy the ride. For me I started to lose interest. You really only see one side. We're supposed to feel for the protagonist and his son. Okay, I got that from the first few moments of the film, but it just continues on with a one-sided story as if the audience is supposed to believe there is a great conspiracy and the world it out to get him. I can maybe watch 30-minute show of car accidents but after that I start thinking ""is there anything else?"" In some ways I could relate to this movie. I had been raised by a poor single parent, and as a young adult I was the poor boy surrounded by rich people so in those ways the movie kept my interest.<br/><br/>It was good movie, but in the end I have to ask myself if it's one that I'm likely to watch again. The answer is I'd probably rather watch The Assassination... again. So I give it a 6/10."

The riches are in the two lines of text in the epilogue of the movie. Maybe it is my own financial woes of late that are finally turning around but if I commit to traveling this journey with Chris Gardner (Will Smith) through the woes I wanted the pay off and it was not there. We were brought to the edge of his success and left there. That being said Will Smith did an excellent job. I did like that Smith had is own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, play Gardner's son Christopher. As Well as Smith actually solves the Rubik's cube in two minutes."

"movedout","6","1","1","3 March 2007"," Hollywood emotional impulses ring hollow
","It is important to note that The Pursuit of Happiness is ostensibly a rags to riches story, despite spending almost its entire runtime kicking Smith's ass and just generally be a real downer. Unfortunately, there's no room at all for Smith's personality to shine through, and then from there it's almost as if he's more concerned about getting an elusive acting trophy. While the child thesp is a real find being Smith's son, his verbosity eventually gets annoying succumbing into the trap many young actors fall into.<br/><br/>As for it's auxillary messages (every movie like this needs at least the one), it really doesn't get much through considering that every stranger Smith's character meets seems sorta pleasant, polite or just plain ignorant but most strikingly, with no preconceptions of race and class being highlighted despite Gardner's background. It just shows Chris Gardner as a good man, great father, even better worker who's just unfairly yet to find a place in this nice little world. As for it being a comedy, the only thing jaunty about this film is the spiteful little percussion that plays as a frantic Gardner runs after his livelihood time and time again. Very calculating. Very cloying."

I have never seen him act in such a role. and more importantly he delivered the message well. I could feel the moments of distress and joy that Criss was going through. It is not easy to involve the viewer into a movie let alone make him/her feel the character and at sometimes lose one's self to the character. It is a strong movie with deep meaning and yes, it teaches a lesson a good lesson. Seldom, are we witnessing such moving movies. Such positive movies. Such educational and educative movies. At first I couldn't believe it was based on a true story. but then again, may be that is where lies the genuine strength of this amazing movie. I simply wish to meet the guy. I wish to meet his kid and ask about their story again and again. For it is never enough to learn from a good source."

","Just watched this movie a week ago. Hadnt planned to, but my friend insisted that I watch it. So well, having seen the movie, I would say that its a must watch for anyone wanting to achieve something in life, lacking in self-confidence, need an external thrust inorder to get their life in shape, or in short wanting to be the next Gardner.<br/><br/>Well, as far as the movie is concerned it simply rocks! Will Smith has more than justified his selection for the portrayal of Mr. Gardner by delivering a stupendous performance. The movie starts with Smith as a nonstarter. He then, adapting to the requirements of the external circumstances, trying to maintain close ties with his wife and child and exhibiting perseverance, crystalizes the fact that nothing is impossible to achieve if the determination is there to achieve it. Gabriele has done a tremendous job as far as directing the movie goes. Its simply awesome guys!!! Some scenes might just tear you apart man!!! In departed you get to hear 'You gotta take it'....but this movie consists of eternal verities.<br/><br/>So guys just go and watch the movie...Sure that you ain't gonna get disappointed."
"rajdoctor","6","1","1","4 February 2007"," Pursuit of Happiness
","The Pursuit of Happiness I had to google the name ""Christopher Gardner"" after seeing the movie. Because the movie is inspired from his life  a true story! Christopher Gardner is a associate producer along with Will Smith of this movie. It has been just 8 months since the autobiography hit the US markets  that people are able to see its movie. That was quick I say  a good marketing and investment on trying to make oneself immortal on screen. Well done Chris Gardner.<br/><br/>Before I write the review  I would like to say that the concept of ""Happiness"" is so different in western society. Trying to be something or someone (one dreams of) to be HAPPY!?? Is that happiness? I do not understand that part. But the movie gives a message  ""Chase your dreams and be happy!"" Does not it sound like an American cliché? Yes it is  so is the movie.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays a 'High density resolution X-Ray machine"" sales person in San Francisco, who is in pursue of THE happiness that he sees on people's faces. He lives a drudgery life, in a shabby small apartment and wants to take decent care of his son  Jaden Smith - when his wife, Thandie Newton, leaves him without any earnings, without a place to stay but a DREAM to make it big some day.<br/><br/>The whole movie is about his struggle - till the very end when he passes and is selected by a stock broker firm.<br/><br/>The way the character is shown facing one ordeal after another, I could not stop thinking that - is this character stupid or dumb or both? I know that many people face much harder challenges without chasing called ""dream"". Knowing that fact - I did not feel much empathy for the character because a lot looked self created to me. But I got the point the movie is trying to make  and I realized it when the tears started rolling my eyes when it is told that Chris has got a job. It was worth all the trouble going through to achieve that happiness. Today Chris Gardner is one the most respected self made entrepreneur in US.<br/><br/>The movie making is perfect. I liked the outdoor shots of San Francisco skyline that are taken wonderfully. It is Will Smith's movie all the way. Jaden Smith and Thandie Newton as son and wife have also done a decent job.<br/><br/>The amount of time Will Smith is shown running in the movie is crazy. For every other occasion he starts running! Good effort  imagining the number of takes each shot would have taken during rehearsals and filming.<br/><br/>A good ""feel good"" movie  that would surely inspire many African Americans to dream big.<br/><br/>Just a trivia  for the first time in Amsterdam, I saw more than 20 per cent of the audience from African origin. Will Smith seems to be popular among them and a current running comedy series on UPC channel of a much younger Will Smith is another proof of the same.<br/><br/>(6 Stars)"

","It really shows the real side of live for million people.In my country last years was the same for almost all the people.It was so sad..just like in the film. Good work to Will Smith. I hope there will be more films like this. I enjoy the acting of the little kid.He is good an maybe become a popular actor after some years. Never seen Will Smith in this light.Very talented actor and producer. For this two month this film and Rocky Balboa are leaders for me.

","Incredible social drama that hardly leaves anyone untouched. The acting performance of Will Smith and his son is outstanding. The movie has very believable atmosphere and it drags you into the story. Going through the movie, I kept imagining myself in the heart-breaking situations the main character - Chris Gardner - had to go through. Chris Gardner is amazing personality with utmost strength and ability to overcome the unimaginable nightmares of destiny, which regular life of and unfortunate may bring. This movie is about the power of father-son love and willingness of a man to do everything possible to secure and protect his offspring(s). The Pursuit of happiness is not 'just a movie' like you see every other day, it's a great film offering a strong emotional experience."

","I loved it because you can really engross yourself in the film... but also look at it as an outsider. The story acts as a litmus for an atypical couple that get wound up in the emerging American status anxieties. This sort of thing reminds me of my English projects in high school.<br/><br/>It also accounts for an economical discussion about taxes versus safety nets. <br/><br/>For all those commerce people out there, I'd rate it as economics on an emotional scale. Love economics. i.e. The consequence when the increase in work does not reflect in a greater marginal increase in 'utility'. This movie is a must watch for people like me who do believe in the power of money."

","Iv used IMDb for years to judge whether it is worth seeing films, never has a film actually inspired me to sign up here.. and then wright about it.<br/><br/>As a Rocky, Rambo and Terminator fan, you could say softer films would not be in my category, but Will Smith has produced an amazing performance to produce the film of the year.<br/><br/>This film presents every day life; a struggle followed by more struggle, moneyless, homeless, and then having to struggle some more. With beautiful moments that make you understand the value of five dollars.<br/><br/>The narration is amazing, the acting meaningful, the music touching, the ending sublime. If you see this film, you will not regret it."

","Expect to cry when you see this film for the first time. Some of the scenes are very emotional, and very sad as well. And yet this isn't a movie you leave feeling terrible- it's a movie of hope. It's a movie you really want to love.<br/><br/>Will Smith gives a stunning performance as Chris Gardner, a man living on the streets with his son as he tries to get hired as a stockbroker. Smith's performance is beautiful and he truly gives the performance of a lifetime. His pain looks and feels completely real. He deserves the Best Actor Oscar. He's that good.<br/><br/>His performance is only made twenty times better by the touching and truly amazing story. For a long time, it seems that nothing can go right for this man. It seems that the world is really against him. He loses everything- yet he still has hope. He holds on to that distant hope that drives and connects with us all. That distant hope that he feels translates to the audience in a way that we can hardly understand. We only know it's a feeling that we don't want to ever lose. We all can feel lost and out of luck at times, but this inspiring film tells us we have to keep moving and keep trying. There is hope in the distance, and though the struggle may be fierce, when we reach that hope it's worth it all.<br/><br/>So, yes, this is a movie you really want to like, and it is very easy to do so. It offers hope to a sometimes hopeless world. And, in the end, it is impossible not to love it. 7/10 stars and it deserves every one! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

","Before i started to watch the movie i couldn't help my self not to look at the ratings. i found out that it was and i guess still is on the box office best list in the current month. Mind you that i had no idea about he nature of the movie when i started to watch it. i thought it was going to be one of those blockbuster hits with no sentimental and educative meaning. Boy was i wrong. the movie is a great example of what a man can do with faith, persistence and guts. the great men of this world weren't always great. they too had to climb there way out of the gutter and into the starlight. the whole movie is about telling man not to give up no matter how hard things seem. and there will be times in your life when you will say to yourself: i can't do this anymore, it's too hard. well take a look at this movie and you will see what hard is. and mind you, this is a true story. this man lives today on this earth.<br/><br/>i have a couple of remarks though. for me the movie was too sad at times. just when you think things are going forward things just stop and shift into reverse. the man can't get a break in life. it's just one problem after another.<br/><br/>to conclude i would just like to say that i didn't comment on the technical side of the movie because that's not the way i look at movies. ""Oh man, who shot this movie. the cameraman sucks. and what about the sound editing..."" That's not me. i look at the story. The idea behind all the technical stuff. that is what makes a great movie. the production, sound, cast... they're all secondary(not to diminish the quality of the cast or anything). This is a movie about life as we know it. some know it more than others, some less. The main message the movie wants to give is that wherever you are and in whatever position you may find yourself no matter how hard it might seem, Keep fighting for your dream with all your might and don't let anyone tell you different."
"meeza","8","1","1","9 January 2007"," Willpower at its apex!
","Will Smith's pursuit of an Oscar might be accomplished for his stellar & heartbreaking work in the sappy, but then again feel-good, flick ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". The film chronicles the true story of Chris Gardner, an economic-struggling medical equipment salesman in the 70's who eventually becomes homeless and has to solely care for his young son Christopher. However, this constant persevering Gardner obtains an unpaid internship at a Dean Witter brokerage firm in his pursuit of his happy dream job as a stockbroker. The film's focus on the kinship between father & son through turbulent times was conducted with the right notating heartstrings. Kudos goes out to Screenwriter Steve Conrad for playing the right heartstring scribal tunes. Will's real son Jaden Smith plays Kid Christopher. Mr. & Mr. Smith pull it off to proclaim their work as the best father & son acting duo performance in cinema history. ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" did get off the ""film happy route"" with a few irrelevant scenes. However, this endearing narrative is one worth smiling about! So ""C'Mon Get Happy"" and pursue yourself to view ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". **** Good"
"redsoxmb545-1","8","1","1","2 January 2007"," Great Story. Great Acting.
","Inspired by true events, The Pursuit of Happiness follows the story of a struggling salesman (Will Smith), who takes custody of his son after his wife leaves, and tries to work his way up to becoming a stockbroker through internship. Faced with a nearly empty bank account, he must try to care for his son the best he can, and pray that his hard work will pay off, and give him the job that will save his life, all in the pursuit to find happiness. Will Smith has come a long way since The Fresh Prince of Bell-Air. This appears to be his shoot for an Academy Award, and his phenomenal acting is definitely worth an Oscar nomination. The story is very emotionally moving, and truly inspiring, however, at times it is quite depressing and drags a little bit. There is a little humor thrown in here and there, but for the most part, the film is quite serious. The viewer really becomes attached to Smith's character, and the movie makes you root for him to succeed all the way through. Although you could call The Pursuit of Happiness a ""feel-good"" movie, for the most part it is on the depressing side. Despite that, it is a great story, told wonderfully by top-notch acting."
"jzappa","7","1","1","2 January 2007"," Interesting: A Feel-Good Movie About How Effort Pays Off, But Happiness Is Something We Never Truly Acquire
","The Pursuit of Happiness is a film that finds suspense and drama in the smaller things in life, and instead of inflating the drama of a more action-packed or special-effects-driven story places us in the shattering turmoil of an everyman's hard knock life. This is my favorite thing about the movie. We are engrossed in the action that takes place in the frantic day-to-day struggle for a man to simply be happy, which in the context of the movie is to be financially comfortable with a roof over his son's and his own head.<br/><br/>The film is a vehicle for Will Smith, not to mention his cute and smart young son whom co- stars, and it's likely a demonstration of his range. During his career, he's grown as an actor. In his earliest movies, he was very stiff, very scripted, and now he is very graceful and very becoming in his roles, and The Pursuit of Happiness is a show of the extent to which his talent reaches.<br/><br/>It's a very well-written and well-directed film, very light but also very tight and emotionally involving, and it's quite refreshing. The only inconsistency is perhaps the almost unreal and hurried finale, but a flaw that can be easily overlooked, as it provokes the audience heavily and doesn't come without grace. The film is an uplifting holiday season return of the great feel-good film."
"RCWjr","7","1","1","2 January 2007"," Good inspirational story
","By far, the meatiest acting that Will Smith has tackled. He takes down the ""Big Willie"" style and is just a plain old average Joe. He is like many people, intelligent yet underachieving. It isn't until he is put out on the street that he stops with the get rich quick schemes and tries to find a ""real"" job.<br/><br/>Smith's son Jaden is very natural in the film. That can be directly attributed to Will playing his father. Will be interesting to see if Jaden is that good playing opposite someone else. Still, he gives one of the purist performances of a first-timer in quite a while.<br/><br/>Specifics of how broke the character really was has been debated, but I don't think that takes away from the film. There is a sense that the film could have gone a lot darker than it did. It always seems to build up to opening that door, but never quit steps through. I think all in all that serves the movie well, though some may have liked to seen more struggle.<br/><br/>Great stuff, Will can do anything he wants. Now he just needs to try and tackle the western genre again, this time with a suitable story."

","The story this movie tells is excellent. 10 of 10 without a doubt. It is a great demonstration of some of the things that make this country great set in circumstances that we as Americans should be ashamed to allow to exist.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was very good. Will Smith becomes a better actor with each film. Who would have predicted this of the ""Fresh Prince?"" His son also does a great job.<br/><br/>One small comment on the casting. I think it is a nice touch that the mom and son in this movie actually have some resemblance. The family has a very real look to it.<br/><br/>I have only one negative comment on the whole thing and that is, it could have been 15 mins shorter and lost no content. Hollywood today seems stuck on the principle that longer is better. This is not always the case. I am not exactly sure what I would have cut but then, I am not a professional film editor. I am a film watcher and this film had a slow feeling to it that needed to be adjusted.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend seeing this movie, especially if you feel the bird of paradise has taken a dump on your head recently."

He was believable and made you feel you were actually watching the events happen. Thank you Mr. Smith! I know this was ""inspired"" by the real Chris Gardener and not exact, but it was excellent and now I need to read the book. There should be more movies based on real life experiences. They provide focus and help us to realize what truly is important, not to mention they make you feel good. MOST enjoyable movie."
"mcw6957","1","9","25","29 March 2007"," This movie is a lie.
","I really did try to set aside my doubts for this one but it didn't take me long at all to get a whiff of something rotten here. On the surface what the makers of this movie want you to believe is that this a feel good movie about a single father struggling to make things right for him and his son. However whats really going on just beneath the surface is something slightly more sinister and deceptive. What happens is the issues are never actually up front and center so it look likes there is no race vs class issue at all just an average every man story set during the Regan era and who better to play the role of Chris Gardner? Someone who wouldn't stir any uneasy feelings in the viewer while they were being spoon fed lie after lie scene after scene. Enter Will Smith aka Mr.Blockbuster himself. I almost bought this notion hook line and sinker. The movie takes its time slowly removing its mask but when it does it is ugly. I don't usually care if a true story isn't to the letter accurate. Some liberties have to be taken but Pursuit of Happiness doesn't want you to know the specifics and for good reason. I urge anyone remotely curious to look up Chris Gardners story on Wikipedia. Even as just a movie it fails. Smiths real life son is terrible. Anytime things start to slow down they cue the kid to say something cute. The lack of direction is annoying. The constant reminders of the time period are false. Avoid Pursuit of Happiness if you can."
"tahoe_2004","2","9","25","15 December 2006"," Don't waste your money!!!
","Yes Will Smith is funny...in other movies. His acting ability seems to have been suffering and he has past that on to the audience in this movie. This movie isn't hard to figure out in the first 5 minutes. I even figured it out before I got out of my car in the parking lot. The storyline seems to be on the straight and narrow, but his life (which is based on a true story) doesn't seem any worse than we have all been through in our lives. Will's main character (I even forgot his character name) makes you feel sorry for him, but it isn't something that was all too realistic. I will leave you with this: Think about what the movie is generally about; think about what time of the year this is being released (Christmas); where will this movie end up? Again, don't waste your money. It really is not good at all."
"IRateFilms","7","5","12","15 December 2006"," Smith is in a Pursuit for an Oscar
","Will Smith's screen presence, despite its clear Oscar yearning, far surpasses this films capabilities on its own. Directed by first time English-language writer/director Gabriele Muccino, this sappy, even cheesy at times, epic drama about one man's determination, is brought to classier heights through Smith's authentic performance. Never going out of character or being ""Will Smith"", Smith's performance in The Pursuit of Happiness, incorrectly spelled purposely, is reminiscent of his role in Michael Mann's Ali. Smith's role as a father, trying to take care of his son, played by real-life son Jayden Smith, definitely brings the father-son chemistry and struggle to tear inducing moments more genuinely. Thandie Newton, who seems to be playing the same unappreciative non-understanding wife, she did in Paul Haggis' Crash, brings nothing new to the table other than a refreshing sense of loathing.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, Pursuit of Happiness has clearly been embellished, allowing Smith and son to really shine in moments that were probably otherwise boring and less intimate. It is the close-ups, the all affectionate moments that Smith pours his heart into, that really push this movie beyond its regurgitating material and into an emotional spin of consciousness. During the films 117 minute running time we are introduced to Chris Gardner's (Will Smith) daily life, which really lends to our understanding of the delicate life this man and his son lead. Many people will obviously be bitter about the manipulative plays of the filmmakers, that through charismatic on-screen presence and tears, will make you sympathize for someone who otherwise would not be sympathized. There is some truth in this, but try and enjoy the movie for how it makes you feel, even if it is using every trick to bring out those usually buried feelings. At least it is evoking something, whether it be fabricated or not, the result is still genuine.<br/><br/>In the tear jerking, man crying tradition, The Pursuit of Happiness has all the comedy and drama woven neatly into this time old story of a screenplay. This film will definitely hit home for many, being that this is such a widely common topic, and the fact that family struggle is universal. There have been films like this before it, and there will be films like this afterward, but I believe that the stunning performances, and smoothly appropriate camera work will set this one aside from the rest."

The good things about this movie is that it shows how very little things could actually affect your life when you have little money. <br/><br/>=Spoiler= <br/><br/>However, the ending actually ruined it. After all the trouble he had been through, he got a position at an investment bank(?) and he made a profit like fortune and became rich. A happy ending. I mean, come on, it's the investment banks that produced the poor people! It's the money game that screwed the economy today. Okay, he was a poor victim once, now he's the one victimizing others, making even more poor people. That's how this movie looked to me. Sure if you don't have money it's hard to be happy, but you never need so much money which you earned by ruining other people's lives. I was quite offended by the message sent from this movie to be honest."

I think Will Smith, because of his upbringing, understands this better than most Hollywood actors. This comes through in his exceptional performance here.

","as i entered the theater last night to watch the pursuit of happiness, and found a few seats up front, i sat right in front of the screen as the movie began. and my mother came sat next to me for a while, but then she left to go watch the new rocky balboa movie with my brother and father.<br/><br/>and as i sat there, watching in pure agony, as Will Smith and his son playing the characters, and how real and raw the story was. i realized, i am such a selfish bitch. this movie has changed my life, i'm a teenager, and we all know how teenagers are.<br/><br/>selfish, spoiled, etc. but this movie has made me change in a way that's unbelievable. i mean, i am the meanest and evil critic, i will say EVERY movie sucks. but this one, this one movie that i am ending the year 2006 with is something special.<br/><br/>it is not cheesy, or corny, if you are not moved by this film, or cannot connect to it in some way, you need mental therapy...fast.<br/><br/>it shows, it really shows that dedication and hard work really pays off, and being extremely smart will also do you good.<br/><br/>i also finished the Rubik's cube, but it took me about a half and hour or so my first time, now i can finish it in minutes, like Chris Gardner. and the way he cared for his son makes you want to sob for hours...<br/><br/>all i'm saying is, go see the movie, change your life, and work hard. i'm a student, and i know what it feels like to struggle and try to be someone when it feels like everyone is in a better place.<br/><br/>but they're not, so now when you pass by a person who is putting on a fake smile...give them a warm smile.<br/><br/>all in all, the best movie, should be next to ""casablanca"" and remembered for years."

","""The Pursuit of Happiness"", directed by Gabriele Muccino (who I thought was a woman by hearing his name), and Italian-born director, who, until now, has only done Italian films, is about just that: pursuing happiness. The funky spelling in the fourth word of the title is taken from a daycare center in the movie, run by Asian-Americans, who have a less-than-perfect understanding of the English language.<br/><br/>Will Smith (that's right, the Fresh Prince) plays Chris Gardner, a dedicated but unlucky and unsuccessful up-and-coming businessman living in San Francisco. In 1981, when the film takes place, he is selling an X-ray-like machine to doctors, most of whom turn the product down. With his wife (Thandie Newton) working double-overtime, the three person family barely makes ends meet. (The third individual is Christopher, a five-year-old played by Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, Mr. Smith's own son.) When Chris' wife leaves him, he makes the elegant but crazy decision to take care of Christopher, while trying to get a competitive internship at a brokerage firm. Because of the lack of need for Chris' medical equipment, and the fact that he doesn't get paid for the internship, Chris and Christopher leave their apartment, move into a motel, and, eventually, and only for a night, into a public bathroom at a BART stop.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" such a great film to watch is because of Mr. Smith's performance. It is so intense, so utterly watchable, that it makes the film. Many scenes in the film, however, involve Mr. Smith running from place to place, without a lot of time to spare. I question the necessity of these scenes; they clog up the film, and make it seem as though the filmmakers were not confident in Mr. Smith's acting ability, so they shot a few minutes of his sprinting. Well, they are proved wrong time and time again over the course of this 110-minute film. Will Smith should garner at least an Oscar nom for his brilliant work in this film.<br/><br/>Steven Conrad, whose last screen writing gig was ""The Weather Man"", a much darker, more cynical and crass black comedy, seems back on track with this film. However sappy the film is, and it is some, Mr. Conrad reins himself in whenever he feels the urge to uplift, and, as Chris says at one point, ""bring me back to Earth."" While this ""Earth"" is a moderately over-dramatized and somewhat-silly one, it pulls us in, and keeps up the pace for nearly two hours.<br/><br/>This is a sublime film, though it is a little dramatized, and somewhat overly sappy. I won't spoil the ending here, but let me tell you, the ole' waterworks were going at a milllion miles per hour for the last ten minutes of the film. When Chris' wife is walking out the door, he tells her to ""get happy."" When I saw this film, I did."
"prayerboy","7","3","6","20 December 2006"," Nice story, but it isn't true.
","The movie is a highly fictionalized treatment of Christopher Gardner's story. For example, the movie suggests that Gardner's training program would be unpaid, while in actuality he did receive a monthly stipend of $1,000. Another interesting fact is that while the movie shows him and and his son being turned away from a womens shelter, he was in fact accepted at one of them. These facts and others could have been included in the movie while not reducing its impact.<br/><br/>While the movie is inspiring in the way Gardner cared for his son and beat the odds, nothing is mentioned of his daughter, and little attention is paid to the overall lesson we can learn from the film and Gardner's life, that having lots and lots of money is a great way to find happiness."

","Mr. Will does an over the top type of job on this movie, but this movie does drag a little to say the least. The movie does have a good message for all that have children and no job to support them. It tells all about paying the rent and how hard it is to make it without a good Pre-thought-out-plan. The Movie although it is touching and the child in this movie does a great acting job also, does seem to have only one direction. The Movie Story Line is interesting, but just about everyone that I know has or had to dig to get where they are at this time in their life.

","All I have to say is this movie is one of the best this year. I couldn't believe how good Will Smith did in this film. I also couldn't imagine a bone density scanner salesman lived a part of his life this way. Sleeping in a bathroom at a Subway station! On top of toilet paper! It made me feel good that I sleep in a bed at night! I do hope with an inspiring story like this, that he gets nominated for an award. I was very surprised at the end when he gets a job offer at Dean Witter-Reyonolds stock company...I think this was a big, drastic change in his life. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who wants to cry."
"seanocean","1","13","44","16 December 2006"," Poor acting
","I am a huge fan of Will Smith and just about all his work. I was excited to see this movie to see Will in a different role other than the usual ""action hero"". Having seen this flick, I would suggest two things: (1) Will sticks to action hero and (2)He keeps his children out of acting.<br/><br/>Young Jaden Smith was simply awful. It was claimed that he ""beat out"" hundreds of other actors to secure the role in this film. Anyone with an iota of a brain knows that this claim is just fluff to justify Will's kid getting the part in this movie. Will is a talented actor and could have made the audience believe that any child actor was his actual son. Jaden was a poor choice and this debut will hopefully also be the final time that the audience has to suffer from watching him on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a nice, heartfelt story. Better choices for the actors would have made it feel more real. Will's appearance in the movie help us to lose the ""action hero"" image of him which was pretty good. But perhaps a lesser known actor could have been chosen and allowed to shine instead of throwing a bone to Will's kid."

","This is not the type of movie we normally go see. But my daughter is a school teacher and majored in Elementary Education. So we went as a family because she wanted to see it. It was strange, the 3 of us all got widely different views of the movie. My husband hated it, he said it was 95% depressing and 5% happy. And he said there were no peaks or lows like most stories you see. It was just flat line depressing all the way. He said he wouldn't watch it again if it was free. I almost got up and went to the lobby at the last 20 minutes. The depression of the whole thing just weighed so heavily on my mind. I want to go to movies to enjoy escapism. I work in a large US city where there are many homeless people, so, yes, I see them 5 days a week. My daughter liked it and found it inspiring. It did open a line of dialogue between us that was fun. She didn't know I sold blood once for money while in the military. And she didn't know I had spent the night once in a homeless shelter in Chicago, also while in the military."
"dimmykarras","4","4","10","27 December 2006"," The Pursuit of Cleverness (spoilers)
","My main disappointment with the film is that there really wasn't much explanation of how Will Smith did well in the stock broker trainee program. They set things up early in the film to suggest he's some kind of a genius with the rubix cube, but then when he gets to work he tells us his secrets to success were that he didn't hang up the phone between calls and didn't drink water so that he wouldn't have to go to the bathroom and thus could leave work earlier and get to the homeless shelter in time. I was hoping there would be some sort of a twist, some trick he discovered to make himself stand out, but it never came. I was thinking of Charlie Sheen in Wall Street or even Michael J. Fox in the Secret of My Success, for Christ's sake--at least in those films there was something interesting going on that showed the new guy in business finding an angle to exploit to get himself some recognition. No such angle exists in this movie, which is too preoccupied with the personal drama to give you any detail about the brokerage industry at all.<br/><br/>My other major gripe is that I felt like there was no clear message regarding the socioeconomic structure of American society. Much of the film is designed for the audience to sympathize with the poor, downtrodden Smith and son, but what are we supposed to take away from this, other than admiring his impressive determination to make things work out? Is there a broader point about American society here? In a few scenes Smith enviously looks upon rich people having happy times--is this supposed to show the unfairness of class divisions in America? Or is it merely the motivation he needs? There is a clip of a speech Reagan gave on the weak economy early on--is that merely for context, or an implied message that government policy was failing to provide for everyone? Smith's character escaped poverty, but millions of others don't. Should they just work harder and be like him, or did his struggles exemplify how nearly impossible it is, even for someone quite intelligent and talented, to climb the ladder in America? In the movie there's more focus on family drama and the struggle to survive, and as a result these larger issues of professional success and wealth and poverty in the US did not get the kind of treatment I was hoping for. I found the film pretty boring as a result, hence my rating of 4."

","The pursuit of Happiness is a 2006 horror movie with Will Smith as the lead role. Don't be fooled by the happy end, horror movies can have happy ends too, and if you're a young person studying or looking for a job like I was when I first saw it, don't watch it unless you're ready for nights of cold sweat.<br/><br/>There's a scene (typical of this movie) where Will Smith barely manages to catch the attention of a businessman by solving a Rubik's Cube in the span of a short taxi ride. It's clear that the intent of the scene is to lift you up (look ! he managed to get an interview ! you can do it too !), but that very scene gave me nightmares : what if I'm not good at Rubik's Cube ? Nobody told me I had to be good at Rubik's Cube to get a good job ! It is a thing now ? Shouldn't it be taught at school then ? And what if I learn Rubik's Cube and the guy does Hanoi Tower ?<br/><br/>Another time Will arrives late and in dirty clothes at his interview (not by his fault), and saves it with a snappy reply. What if he didn't find that reply ? I'm shy : does that mean I have to settle for shitty jobs ? Is there no salvation for people who are in any way short of perfection ?<br/><br/>'Cause there is no nuance in this movie, no shades of grey : it's either thrive like the best, or die like the rest. Never Will rebels or even questions the situation he's in.<br/><br/>But don't worry : at the end of his kafkaesque ride, Will will manage to land the job of his dreams, in the lofty world of rich people, high above the mass of the rest of zombies crawling under the surface in cramped subways. What about you and me ? We're doomed, my friend. DOOMED."
"RoboSlater","10","3","7","16 December 2006"," Oddly, the message is lost on its star
","""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is one of the great movies of the year (perhaps the decade) and a rare product from Hollywood.<br/><br/>In theaters Friday, the film presents a male character and father in a positive light. And it shows the virtues of merit--not race-based preferences--in America. It is the story of the high hopes--and achievement of those hopes with hard work--that are only possible in this great country.<br/><br/>In a day when men are portrayed as losers and dopes, absentee fathers, and deadbeat sperm-donors who don't care about their kids, Happiness tells us the real story of most American fathers. They love their children and work hard to give them a good life.<br/><br/>In this case, it's the real story of Chris Gardner, a down-and-out-on-his-luck bone-scanner salesman who succeeds to become a multi-millionaire, all while raising his young son alone. Gardner's wife, the mother of his two-year-old son (in the movie, he's five), has no faith in him. After bitching and moaning endlessly and trying to kill his dreams, she leaves Gardner to raise his son on virtually no money.<br/><br/>Gardner, without a college education, enters an internship for stockbrokers at Dean Witter. But he's paid no money, and must raise his son and succeed in the internship while homeless. The scenes of Gardner living with his son in homeless shelters, subway station bathrooms, and cheap motel rooms are no exaggeration.<br/><br/>Most of all, Happiness is the story of the love of a father for his son--in the face of incredible difficulties. Every disaster in the world, every bit of bad luck happens to Gardner. The scanners he sells are stolen or fail to work, and he is arrested for unpaid parking tickets on the night before an important interview, evicted from his apartment, evicted from his cheap motel room.<br/><br/>Throughout all of this, it is not just his drive to succeed that motivates him. It is, above all, his love for his son, the custody of whom he refuses to give up. And although Gardner is a Black man, race is never mentioned and never plays a part in the Chris Gardner story.<br/><br/>Still, it is important because the Black fathers we see on television are portrayed most often on venues like the Oprah Winfrey show. To Oprah, Black fathers are absentee millionaire NBA players who cheated on their kids mothers and didn't pay child support. She's also portrayed Black fathers largely as extramarital cheaters, gospel singers addicted to porn, spending addicts, married gay men on the ""down low"", and assorted other highly unflattering presentations America is shown daily on her syndicated daytime talk show.<br/><br/>The true story of Chris Gardner did not originate on Oprah. It originated on a solid news show that doesn't engage in male-bashing, ABC's ""20/20."" Happiness is the story of hard work. Only one person out of many in the Dean Witter internship gets a permanent job. Gardner was the chosen one.<br/><br/>But Gardner did not get a break because of his complexion. He was chosen on merit alone. In the stockbroking business, race-based preferences can't help you sell stocks and make money for the company. Gardner was chosen because -- with his pluck, initiative, and drive -- he sold the most stock and financial packages for Dean Witter. In the movie -- which Gardner says is true to his life (but for the age of his son at the time)--race has nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>Sadly, this message is lost on Happiness star, Will Smith. In an interview with Detroit Free Press film critic Terry Lawson, Will Smith says he is upset that Michigan voters voted for Proposal Two, the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative, which ends affirmative action in public hiring, contracting, and college admissions. Given his role as Gardner, Smith's psychobabble is jarring: ""As a Black American, I am 100 percent in favor of affirmative action. But Jada (Pinkett Smith, his wife) always talks about the beauty and the pain of the true political process. She believes every paradigm ends in paradox, that the result can be the worst thing and the best thing at the same time.<br/><br/>The very thing that sparks one person can break another. For Chris Gardner, defeat only made him work harder and believe in himself more."" But Chris Gardner didn't succeed because he got special treatment for being Black. The company he founded, Gardner Rich & Co., didn't prosper because of race preferences either. He succeeded because of hard work and resulting profits. The movie's script makes the point that equality of result is not guaranteed -- that the Declaration of Independence specifies only the pursuit of happiness as a right, not happiness itself. Gardner succeeded because he was smart, resourceful, hard-working, and dedicated to making a better life for his son.<br/><br/>Those should be the only reasons anyone succeeds in America--not the coincidence of birth with a certain skin tone or set of internal plumbing.<br/><br/>Smith--of all people--should know this. Hollywood is full of unemployed actor-model/waiters of all races. Those few who make it don't get there because of affirmative action. They made it because they appealed to the audience marketplace on merit and talent alone.<br/><br/>Will Smith did not initially succeed because he was ""The Black Prince of Bel Air,"" but because he was the talented ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air.""<br/><br/><ul><li>Debbie Schlussel</li></ul>"
"SimonHeide","2","4","11","26 November 2008"," Get rich or die trying
","This movie is about The American dream in a way that shows an important aspect of this; that you can ""pursue happynness"" without the restrictions of class, caste, religion, race, or ethnic group.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner is really struggling to achieve his dream to the point where he looses almost every thing in his life and when he finally succeeds it feels like justice has been served. So this story is a testament to the idea that it is only a matter of skill and will where you will end on the social ladder and because Chris Gardner has both in abundance he climbs to the very top.<br/><br/>I must admit, that entertainment is important when watching a movie and that for some reason I wasn't entertained during this one. To me it felt repetitious to watch Chris Gardner struggle and it was as if the story was spiced up with humor that again felt repetitious and as if it was forced upon me. The Schizophrenic who thought that the Scanner was a time-machine wasn't one bit funny the way I saw it but it was as if I was supposed to think so.<br/><br/>The whole deroute aspect of the story, which of course is a way of showing us how hard he fought, played to big a part. Unpaid bills, the car that got towed away, the wife that leaves him, problems with selling the scanners and so on. In my opinion this could have been showed in a much more subtle way but then again maybe this is what the whole story is about; not to give up on your dream no matter the circumstances.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner accepts the game - he is in no way critical of the way American society works. That for instance homeless people live next to people with an income that is beyond comprehension to the average citizen. He just wants the ""Ferrari"" himself and thereby the movie becomes mediocre and entirely materialistic.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist.

"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","2","4","28 January 2007"," Now THIS is a 'true underdog story'
","And, as such, it follows the basic guidelines of the arduous journey from misery to happiness. This type of formula is typically very thankful to translate to film, easy to make and ready to be milked for sentimentality for all its worth', which director Gabriele Muccino dutifully does. That is not to say 'The Pursuit of Happiness' does not deliver what it set out to do, for it wholeheartedly does and then some. <br/><br/>Based on a true story, the pursuit of one man to reach the American Dream in San Francisco in 1981 tells the cloying story of Chris Gardner (Will Smith) and his son (Jaden Smith) living in shelters, spending nights on paper towels in run-down, seedy public bathrooms and generally suffering daily hardships by the bucketload. Chris is a good man, but his wife (Thandie Newton) cannot cope with his empty promises and economic struggles, so she splits and takes off to New York City. Now Chris is left with their five-year-old son and an unpaid internship at a prestigious stockbroker's firm. You will be pressed to find a more likable character in film this year, and Will Smith plays him until your heart really breaks for him.<br/><br/>But in my opinion, this is no breakout ""epiphany"" role for Will Smith. The truth is that he has always been a strongly capable actor, although it is of course usually within the comedy field. In the comic moments of the film (and there are definitely quite a few), his funny bone translates excellently. In the drama side of the tapestry, he performs well enough  but it is a thankful, rewarding character to portray, much like 'The Pursuit' is a thankful, rewarding film to make owing to its underdog formula. It is, in this way, the type of film that safely elicits a few tears, chuckles and smiles but ultimately offers no revolutionary insight or social commentary in the way that The Great Gatsby aptly addressed the fickleness and simultaneous necessity of the American Dream.<br/><br/>The real treat is possibly Jaden Smith as little Christopher, and it becomes apparent that either the Smiths have groomed this kid for low-key, understated acting from a young age or that he is a true natural talent  or both. Perhaps his performance is nothing mind-blowing, but it is so rare for child actors to perform this subtly. Usually they fall prey to desperately cutesy or annoying antics, but Jaden Smith does not. ""Simpsons"" staple Dan Castellaneta also chips in aptly as a mentor at work of sorts.<br/><br/>If I have been too unclear or critical so far, let me say that I enjoyed this film immensely as a diversion. This does not change the fact that it is trafficking too heavily in stereotypes and Hallmark staples such as ""Don't ever let anybody tell you that you can't do something"" (yes, Will Smith actually says this at one point) or that it rigorously rubs Chris' misery in our faces in every step of the way, even though we clearly got the gist of his miserable conditions early on in the film. It's almost shamelessly cuing viewers in to feel by unpaid parking tickets, taxes, homelessness and a leaving wife to top it off. The fact is that the film expertly camouflages most of its shortcomings and the end result is even, solid and compelling.<br/><br/>'The Pursuit of Happiness' emerges as a safe but inspirational tale that is undeniably readily-molded for both public praise and Oscar buzz. It is difficult NOT to like a film like this, and the pursuit is no exception at all.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

Will Smith plays a extremely good part in this film.There are a few sad moments so take the tissues with you."
"dashawna_bryant","10","2","4","22 January 2007"," Reality Check for an Ungrateful World
","I read some of the comments that were posted on IMDb sadly enough I do not agree with 100% of the negative comments. I decided to have my own opinion of this movie so me and my college friends went to see the movie. I was upset because of the way that people felt around the world about this movie that was heartfelt and yes heart wrenching; but for way too many people it is a reality. When I was growing up I remember days that we had water and peanut butter and crackers but I was grateful for everything my parents and the Lord provided for us. I was never a depressed person, sad sometimes but who's not. The movie is not about you being happy throughout the whole entire thing, Blood Diamond was a very sad story, and in the end I felt for those who had endured such pain and persecution.In the pursuit of happiness and blood diamond I was not extremely happy or falling over with laughter at the end. But I realized that I live in the state of California and I don't need or want for anything; I'm a college student at an excellent University here. But, watching Blood Diamond opened my eyes to what those HUMAN BEINGS in Sierra Leone endured for years. We should be more concerned about the life lessons in these movies than Will Smith just getting the job at the end. I don't think that is all they wanted you to see or feel and learn in that experience. We should have been happy that a real man wanted to take care of his son and he was trying to provide and protect him from what he could. I feel as though if you didn't leave the movie a little changed, or when you saw a homeless person outside on the street or at a restaurant you didn't think to stop and give them your change, or go into the McDonald's and consider buying a cheeseburger for them to eat. How dare we sit there and critique someone's life story, you never know what people really go through. And if you were sad during that movie, I'm glad you should think about others the next time you leave your home. Because I know I had to console a friend who had to stand in line with her father for a box of food from a church when she was younger; I don't know what that's like and I don't want to know and would never want anyone to experience that. All-in-all I think that you would enjoy the movie The Pursuit of Happiness, those who don't like Will Smith probably enjoy watching Arnold or Sylvester Stallone movies in which you can really understand them. Mr. Smith gave an excellent performance and so did his young son. I think he is a great actor to have portrayed such a character and never come out of his role. The story should be told that you can do whatever you put your mind to and whatever your heart desires you have the will power to do it. I hope that we can all learn from this experience, you never know it could happen to you."
"KatieBug1222","10","2","4","19 January 2007"," Pursuit of Happiness
","I'm not the best movie critic, and generally can find a million things wrong about a movie but ""Pursuit of Happiness"" had to be one of the best films I have seen yet that can mix in light- hearted humor, but also show an intense situation that makes you sob. Near the middle of the movie when they ""go back in time"" and end up sleeping in a ""cave"" (aka run-down subway bathroom) I was bawling. Why did this little boy have to live in poverty? Why did the Chris Gardner have to work so hard yet get no salary? These, and more, questions ran through my mind during that scene on. However, near the end of the movie when he is punching his fist in the air, ""This is what I call 'happyness'"" I looked over at my godfather and he was crying, which really made it even more emotional. It also mixes in humor such as the little Chris' jokes, ""There was a man drowning [...]"" and ""Shelby comin' round the mountain when she comes!"" or my favorite, ""Nobody who? . . . oh! I like that one."" I enjoyed how they showed many parts of his life, ""This part of my life is called; Being Stupid."" <br/><br/>Thoroughly this is an all-around 'feel good' movie that inspires you to go and help someone in a situation like that."

","This was the best movie I have seen in a long, long time. I have never seen a movie that made me cry for half of it, and made me so humble and grateful at the same time. I hate to see a man cry, and this movie just ripped my heart out. The bathroom scene was the most heart-breaking thing I have ever seen in my life, and by the end I was so happy for them to have their dreams come true. After I wiped the miles of tears pouring down my face and left the theater I was so thankful for all I had and actually stepped up my game at work. If I had any say in the Oscars, this movie would get all of them, hands down! Will Smiths performance was amazing and his son is going to be just like his dad! I know it."

Im not doubting his skills as an actor but I think actually having his own son play the part of Christopher really helped to bring his character to life. There are some extremely touching moments that will definitely make you cry!!! Thandie Newton performs well aside from the fact that she is only in about a quarter of the actual film. Overall, a film that has to be seen, maybe even more than once. Everyone involved deserves praise.

"xander-d","10","2","4","11 January 2007"," Simply Magnificent
","Without a doubt one of the finest movies I have seen in a long, long time. Partly due to such a story of hope and the struggle of life with which I'm sure many people can relate, but mainly because of the way in which the story was told and acted. <br/><br/>Smith is superb in his role, you really do forget about his true status in life, and believe he is the man he is attempting to portray. It's always nice to see an actor who has played many different roles in his career, truly shining in a story which many people will take optimism and encouragement from. The rest of the cast including Smiths son play their part, and it is hard to fault any member for their performance. <br/><br/>There is no question about this films potential for award success, Hope, Despair, Humour, Real Life, all told by a truly great movie.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing more than once."
"lovefilms82","8","2","4","11 January 2007"," Great film... and not as heart-wrenching as I thought
","The reason this film is so good is because it is a simple film with a simple message: (For most people) Life isn't easy...things don't just land in your lap. You have to work damn hard and if you are lucky you will be successful. And if you are successful, you might even be happy. Which is wonderful! Not to say people don't find happiness without success and money.... but by god it helps! :) Will Smith is fantastic. I've always been a fan but never really considered him to be a great actor, more a great entertainer. I always thought that he was on screen how he is in real life and never really had to try too hard at acting. This film proved me wrong. He is a brilliant actor in a brilliant role with a brilliant son who is also.. brilliant! This film isn't something that will change your life or be considered amongst the great films but if you want to watch a great story acted well then this is the film for you.<br/><br/>It is not as sad as everyone makes out. Yes I bawled my eyes out whilst watching it but it's not the saddest story ever: there are worse things happening in the world than people who can't afford their rent. But let's not get political.<br/><br/>Cracking film. Go and see it. My guess is that Will Smith will be pipped at the Oscar post by Peter O'Toole (if they are both nominated) but he won't care."
"jez999","9","2","4","10 January 2007"," Charming, moving, well-written, and well-acted.
","With any luck, this movie will sadden you, depress you, anger you, make you laugh, and make you ecstatic. This is a great choice for pretty much anyone to watch.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays a man whose life never seems that it can get any worse, until it does. Repeatedly. All that apparently separates him from a beggar on the street, is his unquestionable self-belief, a black suit & tie, and his obvious complete and utter devotion to his son. The movie never really stops to blame anyone, or anything, for this man's misfortune... no matter how frustrating it is. 'Que sera sera', and life carries on. This requires a lot of self-restraint, both on the part of Chris Gardner, and on the part of the viewer. :-)<br/><br/>Realistic? Who knows. It seems to have been based on a true story. This life isn't what most people go through, which is why it is so amazing to watch. This movie will suck you in, and call upon you to feel what Chris Gardner and his son are going through at every moment. Hopefully, you'll be greatly rewarded. I would recommend for anyone to go and see it!"
"liltnt-1","9","2","4","7 January 2007"," The Pursuit of Happiness
","This movie was a really good movie. It really opens up your view of the world, and how sometimes things aren't really as easy as they look. It follows the life of Mr. Gardener and shows the hardships he has to overcome in able to make a better life for him and his child. It is really emotional and great to watch. Your attention will be captured the whole time. If you think that earning money, and buying the right things, or saving so that you CAN buy the right things is something that people do without any troubles, then you have to watch this movie. There are many examples of how poor people were treated differently then the more wealthy people. That shows a message to everyone about how we can be kinder, and try to understand a little bit more."

","What a movie! Will SMith at his absolute BEST! This movie was awesome. I took my 11 year old son to watch it and he loved it as well. A little sad but a wonderful story. Will Smith's son did a great job in this film. This movie will make you appreciate what you do have in life. I am glad my son got to see that things could be a lot worse and it will hopefully teach him that he should be grateful for what he has. I really didn't care for Will's love interest in the movie. I would have preferred to see him act with his real wife Jada. I think it would have been a better with her but all and all a very good movie. I believe Will Smith should get a Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. I would encourage everyone to go see it. It will make you feel good at the end."
"bubblegumbomb","10","2","4","30 December 2006"," Everyone should see this movie
","The Pursuit of Happiness was a terrific movie. Some people have said it was boring, whoever said that needs help o.0. This movie was very moving. Will Smith is Oscar material, and it was a good move to cast his real son in the movie, that made it even more believable. Some parts, I swear I was about to cry. Throughout the entire movie, all I thought was, ""Man, give them a break!"", which obviously meant I cared about the characters, which is what a good cast is supposed to do. We know Will Smith as more of a comedian, but he took on a more serious side in this movie. However, there were a few funny parts, and Christopher (his son) had some brilliant lines. I love this movie, I think everyone should see it. It really makes you analyze your life, I mean, if you think it's bad now, you probably don't have to sleep in a bathroom."
"loonsntunes","9","2","4","29 December 2006"," In a word...BRILLIANT!
","This is without a doubt the best movie I've seen for 2006. I only just this minute finished watching it, and it was so powerful I HAD to say something about it. To be honest, this was a pretty crappy summer for the film industry...'Step Up', 'Lady In The Water', for example. But here comes Will, in what in my humble opinion is without a doubt his greatest performance EVER in a screenplay! People need to get over themselves. To all the jerk wads going on about how he should stick to action/comedy flicks etc, grow half a brain, acquire some depth and intellect, and THEN maybe you can appreciate this piece of work. I was so happy to see him in a role so far removed from the characters he usually goes for...the sex-symbol/heart-throb kinda stuff. He truly proved himself in this movie, and I think he deserves an Oscar nomination at the very least."

Well done, 10+!! I don't know your name but where did you see in the movie that Will was paid? what was the sense of him struggling so hard if he had money? doesn't it make any sense to you that the CEO which interviewed him said to Will (as he had finished it and went in the elevator) that he would not get any salary for 6 months (the entire training) and Will replied that he would have to think about it because his circumstances had changed and all...i think you should see the movie again.

","I just watched The Pursuit of Happiness today and I absolutely LOVED it. I would have to say that it's definitely one of the best films that I've seen. The story itself was extremely powerful and moving (it certainly moved me a great deal at least). The film also contained many dramatic and heartbreaking scenes/moments which I personally believe, will be able to touch the hearts of even the most egotistical of men, especially fathers. Lastly, let me just say that Will Smith did an OUTSTANDING job portraying the character of Chris Gardner. The scene where he had no choice but to sleep with his son in the men's restroom just... I don't even know how to put it, completely broke me down inside. The final part of the film where he was finally accepted as a stockbroker, and his eyes just swelled with tears of pure happiness, astonishment, and gratification truly made me feel and understand the meaning of ""tears of joy"". After all the pain and suffering, he was finally able to achieve success through determination, hard work, courage, faith, and a positive attitude towards life. Finally, I will just say that this film is definitely worth seeing. So don't miss it! P.S. Jayden Smith also did a great job, and he's such an adorable little kid! Sorry for any spelling errors..."

The other actors in the film (including Will Smith's REAL son, debuting as his son in the film). This movie is first and foremost a drama with tidbits of comedy. The ""Pursuit of Happiness"" is a heartwarming tale of a man and his son living through, well, life. Smith is down on his luck in the fast-moving life of the early '80s. This movie is able to at the very least, give the viewer at least a welling of tears- either by sadness in the scene in the public bathroom or extreme joy for Smith's character in the end.

I have always liked him in his roles, even if some of them were less than stellar movies, but this one I cannot fault, it is a moving portrayal of the real story that you can't help but feel involved in and still in parts Smith manages to bring in the lighter side of things."

The acting was not second rate but good quality, but that is something that should be expected from Will Smith movies. Will Smith's versatility as an actor was especially magnified in this film.

Will Smith does a terrific job of acting, maybe his best ever. He should certainly get an Oscar nomination for his performance. The setting takes place in San Francisco and the Bay Area in general. It reminds us that so many of our big cities have sub-par housing for the poor and needy. This movie also makes you realize the tensions families go through to make ends meet in our modern society.

For some reason I have never been able to take him seriously, ever since the fresh prince. Smith portrays his character in such away that you actually believe your watching the event yourself. Will Smith not only deserves a golden globe but an Oscar. Jaden Smith also found triumph in his big screen premier. The film is not only a biography of one person, but a documentary of poverty around the world. This may all seem great but the one thing that truly blew me away was the directors use of metaphor. Life is like a rub-ex cube, you must sacrifice a small piece to evidently reach your goals. If you are one of those stuffy rich people who can not take a moment of realization, and are too self coincided to judge this film because it hurts your feelings do not go see it.

","The Pursuit of Happyness is one of Will Smith's more popular and well praised films. He was nominated for a Oscar by the Academy, and despairingly so. Considered one of his greater performances as we see the emotion from his character's face showing range throughout the film. He is an easy character to root for and we see the real life struggles he goes through just to survive with himself and his son.<br/><br/>This film is rather touching and has a lot of inspiration scenes and speeches delivered by Smith. It isn't as much of a tearjerker type as initially thought of. Considering we first know the struggles will happen, then ultimately within the end, he will get his big break. Also much more comedic than initially thought as well.<br/><br/>The film works great due to the chemistry between Will and his real life son (Jaden Smith). In the beginning we see Will and his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) arguing a lot, and mostly with Linda complaining and throwing unnecessary fits. They really made her character completely unlikable, where she showed no sympathy for Will when he was struggling and then eventually leaving him with his son and little notice about her departure. We understood that he was struggling to pay the bills and rent, and it was mentioned that she was working extra shifts, but it seemed at no point she was wanting to help fix things together.<br/><br/>It really felt as if she never wanted to keep the family together, and in the scenes with her and Will, he isn't the one to start many arguments. She lashed out on him for about anything and didn't ever seem ever satisfied or happy. Then once her character leaves for New York for another job opportunity, we do not see her again- which has been for the best.<br/><br/>Overall, very good film with touching moments, teachable aspects and a strong message of working hard can lead to success. Recommend if haven't seen already."

Will Smith and his son, Jaden bring to life the true story of a father-son family, struggling to step up from the bottom rung of the ladder. I believe that kids should watch this movie, so they will realize that they are blessed in their lives, and it's not easy for parents to struggle always. This is a movie based on a real-life experience. Will Smith does an incredible job as well as his son Jaden. He had his son in this movie that's why it was easier for Will Smith to put himself out there emotionally. You can feel the emotion and are rooting for his character through the movie."

We say, this is an example, this spirit is worth learning from; No ambition of the people, every day eat lazy, muddle along, but, even if the life is simple, but still have ""not too bad"" hope... We said, this is not good, people should pursue something.
In fact, we are all chasing happiness, but the standard of ""happiness"" is not the same.
But in any case, these are just ""parts of life""."

"blott2319-1","6","0","0","14 April 2020"," Depressing, but inspiring tale of hard work and dedication
","The Pursuit of Happyness is a movie that tells a true story about the most difficult time in a man's life. His struggles are tough, and it's never what I'd describe as a fun film. I appreciate seeing how a man works through the dark times in order to come out in a better situation, because it shows the value of hard work and dedication. The power of all this is magnified, and the stakes are increased, because he is raising a child through it all. I was a little put off by the fact that he probably wasn't providing a better home for his son, and by all rights should have sent the son to live with his mother if she had a stable living situation. However, I do know it might have killed his determination and by letting the son go, he might have never seen him again. Also, many of the complaints that I would have about the actions taken by characters in the film have to be forgiven simply because this is all grounded in the real history of Chris Gardner. There is an authenticity to the story-telling here that reinforces the fact that it is a true story. While I'm sure they took some artistic license, it still felt grounded.<br/><br/>I'm on the fence about the narration in The Pursuit of Happyness. I almost feel like it should have been done by a third-party narrator, rather than Chris Gardner himself. Also, titling different parts of the film as though they were chapters in a book did nothing for me. However, I appreciate the shorthand they were able to achieve using narration. It could be hard to visually show some of the things that set the main character apart from the other interns, so explaining it in a couple of lines helps a lot. I think Will Smith delivers an amazing performance as Chris Gardner, and this is a difficult role to master with all the emotional beats in the film. But in my opinion, the entire movie is a bit too dour. I know the point is seeing the hard road taken to achieve success, but we get such a brief moment of joy, that it can be tough to wait until the movie gets there. I still appreciate The Pursuit of Happyness, though, because all the despair makes the ending that much more powerful, and it's hard not to cry. It's not exactly a movie I'll want to seek out for multiple re-watches, but it is a solid story."

","""The Pursuit of Happyness"" (2006) is inspired by the true story of Christopher Gardner and his fights against his struggles. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>This movie can be perceived as both inspiring and very, very stressful depending on the viewer. It shows the protagonist, Christopher Gardner, dealing with a lot of struggles who rarely leaves him a moment to breathe, and his attempts to push through again and again. It is hardship after hardship after hardship for almost 2 hours, which are rewarding from time to time, but as said, it can ultimately be perceived in very contrasting ways.<br/><br/>The dynamic between Christopher (Will Smith) and his son (Jaden Smith) is heartwarming and touching, which adds another layer to either of the previously mentioned sides the viewer finds him or herself on. Otherwise, The Pursuit of Happyness doesn't attempt to wow the viewer with stunning scenery or a bombastic soundtrack. It is a down-to-earth drama about a father and a son, stripped of any distracting elements to provide a very human experience.<br/><br/>My personal grade: an inspiring 8/10.

"ElMaruecan82","8","0","0","13 September 2019"," The 'Gardner' who took care of his garden...
","...not like Voltaire's Candide but like a man with enough wisdom to know that you never get nothing with nothing, and enough candor to believe that everything is possible if you put your determination into it. Sounds corny? Not really.<br/><br/>You know a film has hit the right chord when at the ultimate moment, your brain is flooded by a triumphing sentiment of sheer satisfaction and you're not just empathetic toward the hero, but almost telepathic. When Chris Gardner, Will Smith in his most spectacular role, learns that he's hired by the stock broker company he's been dreaming of ever since a smiling Porsche driver told him it was his job; at that moment, I could pinpoint every single thought that went through his mind, I could literally taste the tears. Any lesser film, going for cheap sentiments, would have made this an average feel-good crowd-pleaser but Smith's humility and the way he manages to channel every emotion through his eyes was simply mind-blowing. I didn't expect I would connect to a character so rapidly and intensely and it happened to me back to back this week, with ""The Pursuit of Happyness"", and before, ""Sideways"".<br/><br/>Now, it's easy and convenient to label Gabriele Mucino's film as an average rags to riches story, Chris Gardner has become a guru for wannabe successful people. But this would be doing a great disservice to the lesson his life provides by reducing it to the fact that he became rich after being so poor, the soul of his victory lies in his struggle. What made him a rich man is the same spirit that was driving him when he was miserable and while I followed his bad streak all through the film-to call him unlucky is the understatement of the year- I was convinced that the guy had the right stuff, as a father, as a man. And in a time where Hollywood movies are full of stories with brutal fathers, what a change to have a good, decent, honest, hard-working, humble man who takes care of his son at the same moment where it's the mother who throws the towel. Thandie Newton gives a remarkable performance in the film's more ungrateful role, being selfish for lack of patience and irresponsible for lack of strength, she's her first victim.<br/><br/>The mother's character is even more interesting because it mirrors our own mentalities; some accuse the millennials to feel entitled and as a man approaching his forties, I guess I wouldn't have made the same decisions than Chris, if I had to go through an internship without being paid, I might have knocked to another door (and somewhat I did refuse tempting internships for better paying ones but in industries I didn't care of)... if I missed an important meeting, I might have blamed bad luck, but Chris seizes all the opportunities and never lets anything work as an obstacle. Watching the film, I tried to memorize which moments where the most pivotal and you could narrow them down to four or five, Chris giving the money to the CEO, while he needed it to have a roof for the day, an apology for the missed meeting, a cab ride where he could demonstrate his skill at the Rubik cube and get the interview, and finally, having the right punchline during that same interview when asked why they should hire a man coming with jeans and all soaked with white paint.<br/><br/>Chris' determination is a rollercoaster but the film never falls in the trap of sanctification, it's all dealt with rationality. Chris' efforts are due to his fatherless childhood, he must always be present for his son Christopher (Jaden Smith), whatever he does is for his son. He needs money so badly for a roof that he learns how to save money, how to be efficient at his job to get out before the others, how to respect timing, when he gives the money to the CEO, his teary eyes for such a small gesture gives you an idea of how precious money is and somewhat it's that state of sheer poverty that also consolidated his moral strength. It was a matter of survival and Chris fulfilled the seminal role of a father, which is to be both benevolent, protective, disciplining with his child, and ensuring a sane link between the family and the external world. Chris can also be severe with his son, and as the story goes, his easy going nature fades when he's confronted to overwhelming obstacles.<br/><br/>But somewhat, since we know the outcome, we're not surprised, the determination is almost foreseen with the X-ray machine running gag, that big medical ""gizmo"" he must sell to earn a few weeks of living is a real hot potato that is almost unsellable, until it becomes a matter of life and death when he has no income, the more difficult it gets, the more precious these objects are, and being stolen one is something he can't afford and if one doesn't work, well he must fight the way to make it work. As he said in the interview, he might not have the answer but he has what it takes to find it and he's convincing.<br/><br/>Many people would have dismissed one tenth of what he went through his life, thinking they ""deserve better"" while Chris certainly deserved more than anyone to succeed only he faced the adversity and the fog of crap he went through, he triumphed with peril and his story doesn't glorify him but his perseverance, it's not about believing in your dreams because Chris didn't know he was going to be rich, but it's about being decent, and responsible and going till the end, Chris has many breakdowns but he never gives up, he's a class A father and as a struggling father myself, I think I just found myself an inspiration."

"uzairmir-73528","8","0","0","26 February 2019"," A good inspiration but.......
","This is a real inspirational movies based on true story.i believe this the the ever best performance by Will Smith, really enjoyed the movie.<br/><br/>The movies nicely summarized how hard life can be for poor people and how the society treats you because of being poor(the way Chris boss asks him to do his work like parking his car, getting him coffee etc).How all the hard work done finally pays-0f for Chris give an idea that hard work with consistency is necessary to be successful and to get to your goal. Also i think the father-son relation is really cute.<br/><br/>Although given that it is an inspiring movie based on real life there are some things that a normal person seems hard to understand. Given that Chris(Will Smith) with his wife who is working 2 to 3 shifts a day and a son, with no real job not having money to pay his rent neither his taxes and at a time not having a place to live(living at a homeless shelter) decides to go for an internship for a broker after seeing a rich guy in luxury car and asking him how he got the money for the car and even after finding out its not a paying internship still goes with it. The mother working all day and the dad being jobless selling some scanner that no doctor wants(because its expensive and less efficient as compared to the latest technology) ,instead of getting a real job so that he would be able to bring something home, decides to go for it anyway. I mean what father would put his family's life on stake and chase his dream. REALLY hard to believe.
Also at some times he acts totally ill-mannered in front of his son(on a bus station with old women, when he asks for the $14 dollars that his friend owns him) and makes considerably poor choices for himself and his family. For-instance, he forcibly takes custody of his son even he is not the best choice."

","15 July 2008. Mr. Everyman, with a dream out of reach, gets a chance to pursue it. When faced with the reality of a unraveling marriage and dead-end job, along with a son in tow, a man must choose life or avoidance. It's not an easy path that Will Smith as Chris Gardner (based on a real life character) decides to embark on. In the movie, the situations are representative of real life experience, a sampling of emotion and conditions, or luck and deliberate actions that most of us can relate to. The difficulties between Chris Gardner and his wife in the movie are most successfully depicted until one of their most critical scenes that seems somewhat downplayed or inconsistently played out. However, a vast majority of this movie is an amazing glimpse into a variety of images compiled over a segment in Chris Gardner's life that captures a lot of compact dramatic moments - just as a photographer or novelist is able to bring together life in one comprehensible accomplishment for an audience to experience in just under two hours. We almost forget Will Smith as an actor. We are moved in this movie a number of times. Whether or not the pursuit of happiness in 2008 would be the same is questionable in today's economy. Whether or not Chris Gardner's wife had sufficient development during the rest of the movie is uncertain or at least how a child would really react over the subsequent script in which the movie is on display is likely underdeveloped. Nevertheless, this is an important portrayal of a human family in our times with a universal message for everyman and perhaps every woman. Eight out of Ten Stars."

","A 2006 sony picture drama starring Will Smith directed by Gabriele Muccino and written
by Steven Conrad 117 minutes PG-13<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happyness is a movie based on a true story featuring Will Smith as Christopher Gardner and his son Jaden Smith as Chris Jr. This film takes place in San Francisco. It tells the story of a man who invested all of his life savings into a product called the bone density scanner. Unfortunately, he was unable to sell his product and lost everything, this resulted in his inability to support his family. Although he did not give up on his belief in being successful, he came across a new way of making money, by becoming a stockbroker. However, there were a few obstacles, one being that he would have to do an unpaid internship before he had a chance at getting the job. The movie shows real life and realistic scenes and scenarios such as being evicted and the tough thing that they went through while being homeless. Unfortunately, he had to figure out his sleeping for six months while he was doing his internship Chis found a homeless shelter and had to rush there after ""work"" to make sure that he and his son have a place to sleep by the end of the day. In my opinion, I feel that this is a movie worth seeing because of the plot line and the story is played with great emotion and it shows all the different thing that can happen when going through a financial slump I also feel that this movie is a great reflection on life and it shows how some people are very lucky and some are not and I makes us realize that we must fortunate about what we. just like how Chris Gardner (Will Smith) expressed his anger about not being able to support his family and he never gave up and told himself that he would get the job and he would finally be successful. In conclusion, I feel that this is a great movie worth spending your money on and watching."

","It takes hard work and determination to achieve happiness but it can be done. The movie ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" starring Will Smith as Chris Gardner and his son Jaden Smith 5-year-old Christopher Jr. The film tells the truly inspiring story of a single father struggling to make ends meet, while living in San Francisco. Gardner finds himself struggling with homelessness as a result of being kicked out of his home for failing to pay rent. With less than $22 in his pocket, Gardner is forced to spend sleepless nights finding ways to keep his son safe and trying to get ahead in life. From the moment the film begins we get this sad and gloomy feeling from the colors in the visuals and the way the scenes are shot. At one point Chris is forced to spend the night with his son in a public bathroom of a Bay Area transit station. Regardless of his daily struggles Gardner uses his captivating attitude to land him a spot as an intern at a successful firm. One of the greatest scenes in the film is when Chris takes a cab ride with a businessman. The business man is trying to solve a Rubik's cube but can't seem to figure it out and says it's ""impossible,"" but of course Chris proves him wrong by solving it right before his eyes and in just a few minutes. He impresses the man and shows intelligence, which makes him a stronger candidate for the internship. Despite his disadvantages, Chris shows everyone what a hard worker he is and is willing to be. He wins the internship that he had initially been struggling with since it required long hours with no pay, but that led him to come up with more ways to be efficient. Ultimately he then went on to create his own multimillion dollar brokerage firm, showing us how it is possible to lose everything and get it back 10 times better as long as we put in the effort and work for it."

","Will Smith's sympathetic performance drives this emotional drama inspired by true events. It's an examination of life at its hardest, not succumbing to the hardships we're faced with, and that persevering can unlock that door which only had a glimmer of light behind it to begin with. <br/><br/>Oscar-nominated Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a talented, marginally employed salesman who struggles financially to keep his family together. Early on in the film his wife leaves him, but Chris is vigilant in caring for his son - played by real life son Jaden - no matter what. He persists every day to make ends meet, getting an internship at a stock brokerage firm, and putting every ounce of strength into shielding his son from the dire circumstances he's forced into. It's that distant, unlikely dream, driving him forward every day, and the result is an emotionally resonant drama with some serious moments, and a few light-hearted ones comedic scenes, with many unlucky moments befalling our protagonist. <br/><br/>Strongly acted and well written, the film is entertaining from beginning to end... to a fault. It can feel a bit tonally uneven given the events taking place, with the comedy defusing an otherwise depressing scene and slightly undermining the films attempt to emotionally engage fully, because it could have been a masterpiece of raw emotion had it chose a harsher path without detraction of humour. But The Pursuit of Happiness, by the end, earns your happy tears whilst sending a clear and deliberate message about aiming for life's ever elusive dream of a happiness, and the ability to succeed, something that should resonate amongst us all; those who are currently in a plight, and those who've risen against it, fought it, and won. 8/10"

","What do some people want? Here we have a story based on fact (Chris Gardner's year long battle living on the streets).

Obviously these folk have never had to drag their child and worldly belongings around the streets or sleep in public 'shist' houses - while dodging every conceivable trial that life could throw at them! What were they watching (or thinking) I ask? It's so easy for some writers with little or no imagination, to sit in a cozy Cinema or on their easy chair in the comfort of their own space and never know the cold hard difference. <br/><br/>This movie offers class in all departments of cinema: Pathos, Drama, Humour, Social-comment, Family, Work-ethic, Commitment, in fact, just about all areas of human ethical endurance and determination. And, it's all served up with great cinematography, direction, editing and music - capped off with performances to knock you out!

But above and beyond anything else, he wants to be a great father to his 5-year-old son. He wants to be the father that HE never had and always wanted. But, how can one man do all this when he (and his son) are driven from their apartment into the streets and forced to live in public bathrooms and churches? How can he live like this and still keep his son from feeling this trauma too. The answer seems to be imagination, bluffing, and a lot of love. <br/><br/>This is a man driven to survive and keep his son from seeing the harshness that surrounds them.

"mersdlee","9","0","0","4 October 2016"," Excellent portrayal of the true story of a father, his son, and their year long struggle to make it off the streets and find happiness
","The Pursuit of Happiness is a movie full of non-stop misfortunes and unexpected turns, but it proves there's always light at the end of the tunnel. Director, Gabrielle Muccino, does a fine job on all aspects of creating a movie that touches the heart and inspires the viewer. Actor, Will Smith, plays the leading role as Chris Gardner. The plot is in the title, the movie follows the true story of the yearlong struggles of Gardner, a salesman who lost it all and risks everything to get him and his son off the streets to eventually find happiness. It is the story of a true American dream, and this movie does an excellent job portraying it.<br/><br/>After spending all of his savings on something he thinks will carry him through retirement, Gardner ends up in a doomed situation. He can't make any sales, dragging his family into deep debt. After his wife leaves him and his son, he has to quickly start plan B, attempting a career in stock broking. It's a huge risk, but his only chance to make it big without a college degree. They say all you need to know is numbers and how to work with people, and that's exactly what he knows. It's a never ending battle with money issues, built up expenses, and just simply bad luck. It is inevitable that Gardner and his son are forced to move on the streets. This is where the movie really takes a toll on the viewers. With every down there's an up, and vice versa.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the ""based on a true story"" claim, it wouldn't be as inspiring as it is. Today, it almost seems impossible to make it from the bottom to the top. Some of the details of the movie seemed almost too unrealistic and dramatized, which they probably were. Like every Hollywood movie, the ""based"" part should be strongly emphasized. When the real story isn't effective enough, producers often tweak it to make it more appealing for the viewers. This is why documentaries aren't necessarily something everyone is dying to see. However, the overall point was made, and the message was well received.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was well put together; every scene was something as important to the plot as the last. The narration done by Smith made the movie more of a story, and was a very nice touch to the overall effectiveness of the plot. The tone of the narration was calm and smooth, for it didn't seem rehearsed, but rather just known. He was telling his own story, one that only he experienced.<br/><br/>Will Smith was nominated for best actor, as he should have. With every dramatic pause and tear, he makes the audience feel connected to the character. As if when he was telling his own son to be strong and brave, he was actually telling the viewers. Maybe it was the fact that Smith's son, Jayden Smith, was playing the role of Gardner's son, but the chemistry between the two were undeniable.<br/><br/>This heartwarming film, though only heartwarming until the final ten minutes, did a spectacular job portraying the story of how an unlucky, blue-collar man and his son went from poor conditions to absolute hell, yet made it out and eventually found happiness. It is a must see for those who need a little pick me up. Out of all the poverty we see, it's nice to know that once in a while, with enough faith and hard work, it can be defeated."

","Touching, inspiring & emotionally uplifting but also overly sentimental at times, The Pursuit of Happiness is a tenderly crafted, expertly narrated & brilliantly performed biographical drama that's brought to life with utmost care & sincerity, and is also notable for featuring one of Will Smith's most memorable performances to date.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness tells the story of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman who loses his wife, his house, his bank accounts & is forced to live out in the streets with his son when the device he invested his entire life savings into does not produce the results he was hoping for. Desperate for a steady job, he takes an unpaid internship to compete for the paid position of a stockbroker.<br/><br/>Directed by Gabriele Muccino, the story unfolds at a steady pace and is able to keep the interest alive throughout its runtime. The struggles, disappointments & desperation that our protagonist undergoes is highlighted in a grounded manner and is relatable to quite an extent. Its character- driven plot & deftly written script provides sufficient depth to our lead guy's arc that effortlessly allows the viewers to invest in his journey.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, The Pursuit of Happiness is a one-man show that finds Will Smith at the top of his game as he chips in with an emotionally dense, wonderfully balanced & surprisingly down-to-earth input and it remains one of the finest works of his acting career. Jaden Smith also provides a heartfelt support in the role of Gardner Jr. and the moments between this father & son duo are beautifully captured.<br/><br/>There are times when it goes slightly overboard with its melodramatic elements but for the most part, the emotional response it garners from its viewers is well-earned. The technical aspects are finely executed, Editing is smoothly carried out and keeps its plot moving ahead at a consistent pace, while its background score silently enhances the overall experience with its mesmerising tracks and nicely compliments the whole narrative.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Pursuit of Happiness is a fascinating illustration of the American dream that also serves as an engrossing portrait of father-son bonding, and is amongst the best films of its year. Powered by a strong lead show by one of Hollywood's most bankable stars and delighting its audience with a real-life story that's heartwarming, heartbreaking & gratifying on more levels than one, The Pursuit of Happiness comes thoroughly recommended."
"Quinoa1984","8","0","0","26 August 2016"," empathy for the struggling working man - connect with it, if you can
","Sometimes (maybe often times, or not even 'maybe') it really does make a difference when you see a film at a particular time in your life. Case in point, this movie, which got Will Smith his third(?) Oscar nomination playing a down-on-his-luck father trying to support himself and a five year old son and hustling medical equipment while also being an intern at a brokerage. At the time I think I saw the trailers and the reviews and thought 'eh, looks like Oscar-baity pap, pass.' <br/><br/>But also at that time - and here I'll get personal so bear with me - I was actually doing not too badly post college; I didn't have any debts then (my parents said they'd take care of any student loan debt), and had a steady job with my family's business. Since then the family business closed, I went to work at another place that didn't work out, drove a cab for a while, and now I'm working as a deliver driver for a diner - and during this going to graduate school for screen writing, getting that, and then getting saddled with the student loan debt (and debt from financing for the most part myself for a feature film, which is a story in and of itself for another time), and then becoming an adjunct professor, which is not as steady an income as it comes. This may be in too much detail, but the point I'm trying to get at is... life is a struggle. Things aren't always handed to people, and this isn't necessarily a race thing (I can't say for certain if Will Smith's character Chris Gardner was white things would be necessarily easier - certainly being black in America makes rising to the top harder, again another thing to talk about for another time and maybe I'm not the one to write about it, at least not right now).<br/><br/>The struggle of survival is something that crosses lines into something that is fundamental, and certainly it requires some empathy - I don't think this is necessarily for the sociopaths out there, or people who might dismiss it for, say, a guy like Smith who has wealth playing an 'average Joe' - but I think it hit me harder having lived through a life where having to work day by day, having to make bills down to the last minute (or maybe not paying them quite on time), and simply the sheer horrible-indifferent beast known as *bad luck* made me see Gardner even clearer than when I was fresh out of college.<br/><br/>Now, does this make The Pursuit of Happiness some instant classic ala Bicycle Thieves, also about the constant, existential ""pursuit"" of staying alive moment to moment and beat to beat? No, not quite. But then I didn't quite expect that anyway; this is following a character through a longer timeline anyway, as Gardner is at this firm as an intern and sometimes his luck as he has his son (along with his son, played by Jayden Smith at a time when he was more natural an actor than now it seems), and so the rise-fall-tiny-rise-fall-fall-fall-eventual-YES-success story is not too hard to see coming around every turn of the corners of the film. This is also not to say it's not hard to compare it to De Sica's film (also by the way this comes from an Italian filmmaker transitioning to Hollywood): one scene where Gardner and his son are at a restaurant with a moment of respite from life with a meal see a better-off family in the place and looks are exchanged. Class structure in action.<br/><br/>But it's the emotion that's poured in by Smith and how everything is kept at this 'what-do-I-do-next, and then what' narrative that goes between what Gardner has to do and how he *must* always be a good father (this, too, creates some drama), that makes the film work so and connects with me. I don't have a son but that doesn't mean I can't empathize with this part either (ironic to see this here and then ten years later Smith as Deadshot with the 'all for my daughter' part of his character that didn't ring as true, but I digress). He's playing a regular guy who is smart and listens and tries to do his best, and yet he doesn't make him a superman. He can get hit by a car while trying to get back his medical device a homeless man took from him; he can get stiffed $14 from a local ""friend""; he and his ex (Thandie Newton in a wonderful if under-utilized part); he can get angry or distracted at the wrong times. If we empathize with him it's because his character *does* have flaws and has to work through them to get where he needs to be (or as he says, he has to work so much harder just to get ahead).<br/><br/>So, again, this may come down to timing for me connecting with this so much - maybe at another time I'd think 'oh, please' - but at any rate, Smith gives a performance that is perhaps his most convincing as a dramatic actor, with flashes of his charisma but channeled into someone who is more like the audience at large coming to see him than those surrounding him in lush Hollywood. It's imperfect and occasionally sentimental, but it rings true more often than not, and that counts. It's a nice block of studio neo-realism, if that contradiction makes sense."

Also, his son was excellent, too.<br/><br/>I like the movie because it is somehow so real. I like the movie because promotes positive values that getting to the very top requires a lot of hustling.

If something goes out of time, then everything else will be a spoiler. For instance, when he is late from office, he runs to take his son from the creche/school, fails to catch the bus by being late for a second and eventually fails to get a space in the dormant and ends up staying in a public toilet. A movie with a great message, which changed the way I look at the life. <br/><br/>Finally the critics point that he his just running to get a sophisticated life with good salary. To me its not about why is running which need to be taken to shape our life, but how is running is what matters."

","The Pursuit of Happiness (2006): Dir: Gabriele Muccino / Cast: Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Thandie Newton, Dan Castellaneta, Brian Howe: Touching story about our constant awareness for contentment. Set in 1981 Will Smith plays a struggling salesman whose marriage is troubled but he wishes to support his five year old son. After his wife leaves he applies to be a stock broker while spending nights with his son in a shelter after being evicted. While somewhat repetitious one cannot help but feel triumphant as one source struggles aimlessly until patience pays off. Director Gabriele Muccino succeeds in transpiring a realistic worldview for which viewers can relate. Yet the film's strength relies within the real life father / son relationship between Smith and his son Jaden. Will Smith delivers one of his best performances as a loving father struggling to support his son. He is intelligent and thankfully rises above his circumstances by overtaking opportunities with humility. Jaden plays off the confusion and simplistic understanding of his son. Thandie Newton plays his frustrated over-worked wife but the role is merely a prop. Viewers can see where this aspect of the story is headed and Newton's talent isn't elevated above the predictable subplot. Others roles are cardboard and dull at best but its theme rings true regarding our quest for family and contentment. Score: 8 / 10"

","The pursuit of happiness is every person's right. Achieving it is never easy, but it's what comes after, that is important. Based on an autobiography from the real Chris Gardner, The Pursuit of Happiness starring Will Smith and Jayden Smith is a film on Chris Gardner's life journey and struggles. If you want to see a film about life, struggles, family, and drama, you should definitely watch this movie. Chris (Will Smith) is an ambitious and intelligent person trying to find his happiness in the world for himself and his son Christopher (Jayden Smith). He struggles to get by with only being a salesman selling hospital equipment to doctors that most of the time don't even want it. His marriage also falls apart and his wife decides to leave him. On the brink of homelessness and eventually becoming homeless, he lands an internship with no pay for six months with a slim to none chance of actually becoming a stockbroker. Even though life is hitting him hard, he is still pushing to achieve his dream of finding happiness. Will Smith is extraordinary as Chris Gardner. He is an inspirational person that anyone could look up to: positive, driven, and loving. You get an insight into his emotions throughout the whole film. Will utilizes his facial expressions and body to convey his character effectively. That blank and broken gaze he gives when he just feels like giving up is a defeat no one wants to experience. However, he still stays positive and driven to be something better for his family. He really delved into the character and gave a good performance. Another important actor was Jayden Smith. He does a fantastic job portraying Christopher in this film. With being a child himself and the first film he has ever been in, he pulled it off. From the emotions he conveys such as sadness, awareness, and courage, you effectively understand him through the screen. The way Jayden carried himself as Christopher in the film made him a very likable and key character. His skills of acting really made the connection to the viewers. You could feel what he was feeling, and think what he was thinking. Both actors were a strong duo; the performances in this film made it an excellent and touching movie. The plot is relatable and that is why this film is so good. His family issues, money problems, and failures at being successful are important aspects of life. But, the only way to find happiness is to pick yourself up and keep going. Even though Hollywood is not always the most truthful, many of the events actually did occur in Chris Gardner's life. The direction of the film showed many perspectives on life in the light and in the dark. The audience has a chance to relate to the film or get an insight into a world unknown to them to maybe be more appreciative of the life they have or inspired to make a change. The honesty of never-ending downs, positives, and travails in many people's lives are what makes the time line of this film great. The essence of this film is to inspire people to achieve this American Dream that is prevalent in every person's life. The dream is to have money, but we all know that it does not buy happiness. Although, money would surely help a person achieve it, but that's not the point of the film. The point is to not lose yourself when life is hard. The point is to stay positive on the outlook of the future. It's just a heart-warming movie that shows the life of many people living in America today trying to improve their quality of lives. Not everybody is as fortunate as others, but in the end it is all about finding your own true happiness in life."

","'The Pursuit of Happiness' is among the most inspirational and beautiful movies I have seen in a very long time. The real life (and film-life) relationship between father and son is brilliantly portrayed and this is a film that will live long in the memory. Will Smith's acting is typically fantastic and Oscar-worthy without a shadow of a doubt. The in-depth analysis of one mans ambition to achieve the American Dream and the 'Pursuit' to happiness is well played out and clearly discards the racial and political problems of the time making this film a beautiful masterpiece with a feel-good factor involved. Tear-jerking nevertheless, this film will emotionally attach to you especially if you have personally experienced the hard-life. An inspirational fable for the here and now. 8.0/10"

","This film was very inspiring and well told. I am seeing Will Smith in a whole new light after this film (this is my first time watching), and I reckon he is actually somewhat like the father he portrays in the film - seeing as his real son plays his character's son. Anyway, Smith did really well in his role as Chris Gardner, and the expression of his emotions came across through the screen. Jaden Smith too, who was about eight years old then I think, was great. I am not such a big fan of him as he is now, but he had some good talent back then! The chemistry between father and son was perfect. Thandie Newton was good as well, you could really feel how tired and frustrated she was.<br/><br/>The film was also very well made and the direction was superb. Cinematography was great and captured the atmosphere greatly, with long shots of Smith running here and there.<br/><br/>However this film is not without it's flaws. There are quite a lot of times throughout the film in which got me thinking, 'why didn't he do this, or sell that?' I mean it is a movie (though it's based on a true story), and I guess people do things differently and if I were in the same position I might have done the same (maybe). But it seemed like he could have avoided some situations by thinking ahead and planning stuff better. Don't get me wrong I still think he did incredibly well seeing as he was practically running to get everywhere. I'm just thinking that maybe the film-makers added some extra drama to the character to make it worse, to enhance this story of the American Dream. As inspirational as this film is, it probably only happens to one in a million people; the American Dream is after all, an almost impossible dream.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","The Pursuit of Happiness is an inspiring and motivational movie about the amazing story of Chris Gardner and his journey from rags to riches.<br/><br/>Will Smith delivers an amazing performance and has amazing chemistry on screen with his real life son, Jayden Smith. Smith's performance and this chemistry are basically what stand out in what would be without those two things a mediocre melodrama. Which is the movie's flaw. Nothing in the movie stands out. Sure, the story is inspiring but the directing is OK at best and nothing really special happens. A very ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" type of movie, this one just isn't that special.<br/><br/>In the end, I will say that I enjoyed The Pursuit of Happiness, mostly because of Will Smith's performance and his on screen chemistry with his son, but that's it, I could watch this movie again sometime in the future, but I don't plan on doing so."

","While ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" sometimes falls into schmaltzy, over-the-top drama, what really saves it is the acting by Will and Jaden Smith. The film is set in 1981. Chris Gardner (Will Smith) invests all of his money into a stock of portable bone-density scanners, which he hopes to sell to doctors. Unfortunately, these prove very difficult to sell and eventually, his wife becomes fed up with the financial hardships brought on by this hare-brained scheme and leaves him and their young son Christopher (Jaden Smith). Eventually falling to the point of poverty where the father and child have to live on the streets, Chris determined to claw his way out of this hole.<br/><br/>Both actors really sell us on the hardships and moments of joy that their characters experience and it's satisfying to see them make their way through countless obstacles. As the movie passes by, you get more involved in it and you will be left cheering when they triumph over adversity. A movie that isn't as good would have added a villain or a rival for Chris Gardner (Will Smith's character) to compete with and this character would predictably have turned around at the very end to help our hero succeed. While this movie isn't perfect it doesn't fall into cheap and obvious trappings such as this. It's also a good film about a strong (and pretty realistic) father and son relationship, complete with all the not so glamorous patches. (Dvd, October 8, 2012)"

","The Pursuit of Happiness is a 2006 American biographical drama film based on Chris Gardner's nearly one-year struggle with homelessness. Directed by Gabriele Muccino, the film features Will Smith as Gardner, an on-and-off-homeless salesman. Smith's son Jaden Smith co-stars, making his film debut as Gardner's son, Christopher Jr.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Steven Conrad is based on the best-selling memoir written by Gardner with Quincy Troupe. The film was released on December 15, 2006, by Columbia Pictures. For his performance, Smith was nominated for an Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Best Actor. The unusual spelling of the film's title comes from graffiti on a wall that Chris sees near the beginning of the film. In the movie, ""happiness"" is incorrectly spelled as ""happyness"" on the wall outside the daycare facility Gardner's son attends."

","This movie is based on a true story about a smart salesman and family man named Christopher Gardner (Will Smith). Gardner has invested deeply in a device known as a bone density scanner. Even though they are more expensive than the current technology, they are slightly better but do not sell as well. As Gardner tries to find a way to sell them, he began to have trouble with his relationship with his wife (Thandie Newton) who leaves him. He loses his house and his bank account. Now without money his forced to live out in the streets with his son (Jaden Smith), Gardner is now desperate to find a steady job. He takes on a job as a stockbroker but before he can possibly get hired and receive pay, he needs to go through six months of training, and to sell his devices.<br/><br/>A distinctive symbol that is in this movie The Pursuit of Happiness is the strange spelling ""happyness"" instead of ""happiness""; the title comes from graffiti writing that Chris saw outside the daycare his son joins. Chris specifies that the word ""happyness"" had a unique sense. That is something he had to pursue, as Thomas Jefferson put the phrase ""pursuit of happiness"" as a right in the Declaration of Independence ""Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness"". A viewer states, ""This movie shows the audience the bitter sweet of a salesman's struggles from rags to riches, to his happiness.""<br/><br/>The movie The Pursuit of Happiness, directed by Gabriele Muccino, is a very appealing film to watch. It is an inspirational and often emotionally jerking film. As a viewer states, ""He doesn't want just a better, more secure life for himself and his child; either by scripted design or by the example of the real Chris Gardner, he seems to yearn for a life of luxury, stadium box seats and the kind of sports car he stops to admire in one scene."" Chris is dealing with trying to succeed in life and just find happiness in the hell that his going through to pursue it."

After being left by his wife, the single salesman finds it challenging to provide for his and his son's needs, in the increasingly unstable economic climate.

"jake-law123","8","0","0","18 August 2013"," Will Smith is as inspirational as ever.
","This is one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen. Although not too complex on conflict or message, it's still a positive message that carries through all of us. Will Smith brilliantly shows us not only that he's a great actor, but a great father, as the character's son is portrayed by Smith's real life son Jaden.<br/><br/>Based on a true story of Chris Gardner, an entrepreneur who became homeless in 1981 with his 5-year-old son, and for 6 months worked as an unpaid internship to gain a job as a stock broker. Never giving up and always finding faith with his son kept him alive and happy.<br/><br/>Smith gives an unbelievably wonderful performance, portrays his character in terms of his emotions. Very aggressive when he's happy, sad, angry, etc. His son is the perfect sidekick and the motivation for him to never give up. Throughout the film, he, while struggling, manages to stay hopeful with his son, whom he does his best to keep happy through their struggle. Although some argue that the relationship doesn't work for Smith's over the top aggression on his son sometimes, I think it brings out the film's struggle even more, and all together I think the relationship is what makes this film work. They have that energy that makes you want to see them make it.<br/><br/>I think Smith pulled this off so well because since it's his actual son, and not some actor portraying his son, he cares more about him, making him more concerned in a position of him being broke. It was all natural for Smith and he nailed it.<br/><br/>If I had one thing to argue about, it'd be that they try too hard to show us him struggling. Like it's one after another, this happened, then I had to pay this, like it's not too bad, but after a while it can get repetitive, but who cares. The film works so well, and never fails to work me up in the end, (you'll see). Definitely a non forgettable inspiration that will never be forgotten. Smith's best performance!"
"ironhorse_iv","8","0","0","17 June 2013"," I pursuit in finding this movie. Was it worth it? Yes, it gave me a little bit of happiness watching it.
","This movie is probably one of the best father and son relationship movies. I really enjoyed and learned a great deal about persistence in this film. It had me tearing up at times but in a good way. One scene in particular about never giving up, when his son is playing basketball, got to me. I like motivational films like this and this one is definitely hit the spot. The Pursuit of Happiness is based on the memoirs of Chris Gardner who struggle with homelessness with his son for nearly a year in pursuit of his dream job, a stockbroker. In the film directed by Gabriele Muccino, Will Smith starts as Chris Gardner with his son Jaden Smith as Chris Jr. In my opinion, I believe Will Smith was amazing. Glad he was nominated for the Oscar that year. If there weren't tough competitions that year, he would have won. By having the child actor and the main actor related to each other, it's portray a real life parenthood that rarely is shown in the movies. If you didn't know that they were related, and didn't know anything behind the screen. By just looking at the film, you would have think, wow, these actors truly seem connection as a father and son. This movie can be a bit depressing if any of its viewers have dealt with homelessness. There are some scenes that are really hard to watch. In my opinion, the bathroom at a subway station scene was the hardest to watch. Still, who knew Dinosaurs live at the train station? The movie took some liberties with Gardner's true life story. First off, the wife portray by Thandie Newton was just a mean spirit witch who abandon them just because she wanted her freedom back. In real life, she left because he actually cheated on her and the arrest in the film was actually for domestic violence. She did take care of the child for a while he was pursuing his dream job, but in the end, she did abandoned the child with Gardner. It's hard to tell what were the real reasons why she left them, but the film, the wife seemed on the verge of breakdown. Even if Will Smith's character was going through hell and more he kept his poise and kept it together. The mother seemed unstable and not at all trust-worthy with a child. She looked and acted like she was ready to snap. Was she portray a villain on film? Yes. Did she deserve it? Probably not, she probably had her reasons, but still there is no reason to abandoned her child. Certain details and events that actually took place over the span of several years were compressed into a relatively short time. I think if the movie struggle was portray, like it was in nearly a year, it would be just too depressing. Although eight-year-old Jaden is portraying a five year old Chris, during the time of 1981, Gardner's son was just a toddler at the time. Just think of that for a second, that's pretty hard for a homelessness man to deal with. While the movie love to say that he only had 30 dollars left in his bank account and no job when he struggle to find a place to live; in real life, he was earning a small salary and was able to afford rooming. Plus, he was gainfully employed as an early stage of being a stockbroker. Also in no way, did the Glide Memorial Church turn them away. I do like the special cameo by Chris Gardner toward the end that people need to check out. The music soundtrack by Andrea Guerra is amazing. The visuals of the film does make it look like 1981 San Francisco even if there are a few anachronisms. The homeless people in the film were truly sadly homeless people, so that's worth noting. The movie is telling the story of Chris's struggles with poverty and by having real people struggling in the film, it gave the movie more depth. While, Chris isn't the perfect father, he does things that might be wrong, like cheat and lie. Still, Chris isn't a hero, he was just an ordinary human being, and like every single ordinary human being in the world he did some things that probably weren't right and some things that he might regret. By having some flaws in the character was worth watching. What I learnt was that if one is desperate enough, one will do what one can to survive and protect their young. It's fairly primitive. Smith's character did not enjoy reneging on his rent but he had little choice. I didn't find his behavior too reprehensible. Some critics dislike the film with the capitalism ideas it has and the illusion of the American Dream. Was Chris Gardner pursuing happiness or pursuing money? It seem to me, it was money. Does money make happiness? No, always, but it does help. It's hard to find people not interested into making money. Plus, solving a Rubik's Cube in minutes, will make you land a gig as a stockbroker job? I do find that unlikely just as much as the scene with him showing up with no suit and landing the internship. Some people are thinking too much into the film, as they think of this movie as a movie against capitalism, for capitalism, pro-republican, pro-democratic, pro-Marxist, etc. etc. This movie is the struggle of one man trying to live a better life. Yes, times are getting harder, things are getting more expensive, everyday life for those who aren't rich just living from pay check to pay check, but this film gives them the optimism for themselves to pursuit such happiness for themselves. It doesn't mean, they have to be rich, as long as they are stable with who they are, and where they are at. That's what I believe is the overall theme of the film."
"andydgr8","8","0","0","6 June 2013"," 4 Lessons of Life this movie taught me
","1. FAMILY COMES FIRST<br/><br/>The true story of the real Christopher Gardner and how a short time ago he sold off his brokerage firm for millions of dollars can easily lead us to the assumption that the character Will Smith plays in the movie has, as his physical goal, in pursuit of money. But, in the movie, money is never his goal. It's always about the happiness that being a family man will always bring. The confusion about the pursuit of money is understandable because the movie's protagonist is struggling with financial debts, and trying to earn money is one of his principal occupations. We must understand, however, that the movie is NOT saying money brings us happiness; although, I think the movie says that a secure income ensures a less painful family life and more comfort, and to that degree it can bring a level of happiness. I understood this point very well from the scene where Chris begs his wife, Linda, to let their son live with him, despite his financial condition because Chris needed something more than money to be happy.<br/><br/>2. PERSEVERANCE AND PERSISTENCE<br/><br/>In this movie, Christopher Gardner is a seller of bone-density scanners, and he has invested lifelong savings on them. He knows he can only earn money to run his livelihood by selling successfully, although they aren't a very good supply of income. So, his loyalty to selling these medical scanners demonstrates perseverance. It shows the 'can-do' attitude that he possesses and also lives by that principle. This 'can- do' attitude helped open new avenues and support systems for him. For example, he knew that he had to keep himself and his son going for the six months of unpaid probation period in anticipation of a better tomorrow . So he fulfilled the basic needs of food and shelter by taking refuge at shelters for homeless, and free meals at churches. He still didn't give up when he had to spend a night in the restroom due to no occupancy at shelters. His concluding line at the interview is unforgettable, ""I'm the type of person that if you ask me a question and I don't know the answer, I'm gonna tell you that I don't know. But I bet you what, I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer.""<br/><br/>3. IDEAL PARENTING<br/><br/>Many parents would have give up in the face of such adverse circumstances, much like Linda does in the movie when she moves out of house. Unlike Chris, she isn't dedicated enough to make things work out for the family, even though she has sacrificed a lot for her son. Chris also had a choice to give up his son and let go of many hardships that came along the way. But Chris defines happiness as being a responsible parent, a dutiful father, and with that accepts the accompanying adversities. I loved it when his son says, ""You're a good papa.""<br/><br/>4. PURSUE YOUR DREAM<br/><br/>Without anyone's support to help care for a toddler during early schooling, makes life more miserable than it would otherwise be. But Chris has to sustain his dream, that of fathering, his decision to go to school is made even more difficult. On the virtuous side, the training offers him a path to a more comfortable life. But on the vice side, the training threatens his basic ability to function as a father and as a human being overall. However, he has set a goal in his mind and rigorously follows it. He multitasks his role as a father, trainee, and a salesman. He achieves his objective because he knew he can. What he tells his son says it all, ""Don't ever let someone tell you, you can't do something. Not even me. You got a dream, you got to protect it. People can't do something themselves, they want to tell you you can't do it. You want something, go get it."""

","Yani Stancioff 5/16/13 Review The Pursuit of Happiness is a 2006 biographical, heart felt motion picture that was based on Chris Gardener's nearly one year struggle with homelessness. <br/><br/>Life turned out for the worse as Chris began to face extreme debt, unpaid taxes, and parking tickets. Chris hit rock bottom when his wife could not take it any longer and bailed on their marriage, leaving Chris with just his son. What stands out the most about this movie is how Chris had tried his best to protect his son and hold each other together by keeping a positive outlook on their future while he tested his luck of a career as a stock broker.<br/><br/>The climax was reached when Chris and his son were kicked out of their rented apartment and instantly became homeless. They have stayed inside bathrooms, homeless shelters and they even resorted to sleeping inside a bus. The emotional intelligence stands out to me in the particular scene where Chris and his son stayed in a bathroom for the night. It was during this time that they became close when Chris was able to make a game out of the situation. The feelings of pity and sorrow overwhelmed because throughout the movie I noticed many scenes where Chris and his son showed a lot of maturity dealing with there negative situations.<br/><br/>After I reviewed The Pursuit of Happiness, I personally gave this movie 7 out of 10 for many different reasons. For example, how it was based on a true story and the settings and plot were very realistic. Surprisingly, Will Smith was not the main character in the movie; it was his son Jaden which made it enjoyable to watch. The director Gabriel Muccino hadn't done anything out of the blue in this movie but he has simply made it feel so real."

","It is one of my most favored movie. I liked this movie because of the struggles which will smith faces. The story made me cry and i was just flowing with the movie, as this movie is very close to me. I have faced many struggles in my life, and there was a period of about 3 years wherein nothing worked out whatever i did. similar things happens to Will smith in the movie. Like him, I too didn't give up in my life, and I wouldn't say i have succeed in my life, but I am slightly better than my previous state. <br/><br/>The movie shows how, Will was struggling in his life, and his poor condition. I was into tears seeing his position. One thing this movie taught me is to never ever give up in life and never loose hope. I really admire movies like this and shawshank redemption, which give us a hope to move ahead in life."

","This is a really good movie, it is very heavy and uplifting movie without being too cheesy. Will Smith did a fabulous job playing the struggling father trying to make ends meet. Wills nomination for best actor was well deserved. With this being a inspiring movie with a ""go for your dreams accept nothing else"" message, with the main theme being how important family is. Chris (Will Smith) did his best to protect his some from the harshness of their life being homeless, and still trying to work as a unpaid intern at a big time stock firm. Having a rough last few years like many made this hit home. Seeing how he struggled to provide for his child and still made life enjoyable with the odds against him. Watching this you start to see that this portrays the great myth of a self made man and equal opportunity, that if you work hard you will succeed it is up to your interpretation if this is a truth. Some of the bad reviews seem to complain why he would choose the evil job of working for a Investment firm. If you look at in between the lines it wasn't really about getting that job. He dreamed of being able to provide for his son the best that he could and his intelligence was the step up and gave him the chance he needed that others would not give. Watch this movie it is worth the time."

","This movie was just great. It had a wonderful touching story line filled with very dramatic heart wrenching moments. The acting was terrific stared by Will Smith I never knew Smith could act like this but he is just great. Followed by his supporting actor which is his son who actually plays his son in the movie. He is very good for such a young child actor.<br/><br/>This movie is about a man who takes custody of his son as he tries to get a new job that will set him and son up for the rest of their lives. Hes a very smart man but struggles to make ends meet and provide for his son while trying so desperately to get this good job.<br/><br/>This movie is really interesting from start to finish.

","I came across this movie, when I was searching for some interesting titles to watch. I'm not really a drama fan and I wasn't to excited about watching this one. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised. The Pursuit of Happiness is a movie about a hard- working father and his son, struggling to make it in life, as Chris can't pay his bills and tickets anymore. They eventually lose everything and end up on the street. Without revealing any more spoilers, I strongly suggest you watch this inspiring story and you will see why I continue to praise it. The acting is superb, Will Smith at his best. His on- screen son was actually played by Jaden. Not being the sentimental type, I thought I wasn't going to shed a tear during the whole movie. Alas, I was terribly wrong. I had to turn of the lights, because it struck me right in the heart and I kept on wining like a baby. The Pursuit of Happiness? Well said. To be truly happy, you need to give your maximum, never give up and believe in yourself. Again, this is a great biographical drama with an amazing script and the whole plot itself is utterly heartwarming. The line where Christopher says: "" You're a good dad."" made me smile. <br/><br/>Don't skip this one ;)"

","So far, for the last several movies I have watched, I have kept up a good streak. Continuing that streak is ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". This is not the first time I have seen this film; however this experience was quite refreshing, as I had seen it when I was a child, and hadn't fully understood the power of this movie.<br/><br/>First of all, the story was beautiful. It was congruent, moving along smoothly with the convincing dialogue. No scene seemed out of place or un-needed. Adding to the story was excellent acting from Will Smith and company. He played his part perfectly, delivering a heart-wrenching performance; it may have been one of my favorite performances of all time.<br/><br/>The music surprised me. Out of the comments I have heard about ""The Pursuit of Happiness"", none have mentioned the soundtrack. My question is, why not? It was simply breathtaking, and should be talked about in the same conversations as the works of Hans Zimmer and John Williams. It was subtle, yet emotional powerful; soft, yet tear-jerking.<br/><br/>It is through the touching story, the powerful acting, and the moving soundtrack that ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" achieves greatness. Only with these elements could such a monumental story be told. ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a masterpiece, and in the end, yes, I cried. And I'm happy I did; this movie deserved it."

In 1981 San Francisco, Chris Gardner (Protagonist) invests his family's savings in portable bone-density scanners which he tries to demonstrate and sell to doctors. The investment proves to be a disappointment, which financially breaks the family and as a result, his girlfriend leaves him and moves to New York.<br/><br/>While finding it extreme difficult to sell his bone scanners, Chris wants a better life for his family. Chris Gardner is tossed all over the place due to lack of cash and finance. He suffers a lot of mishaps with his son looking on as they move around the city. And the idea he latches onto, because it does not require a college education, but could still pay off big time, is to become a stockbroker. So, Chris pursues his happiness (or happiness) through a six month unpaid internship program with 19 others, in the hopes that, at the end, he will be the one chosen for employment.<br/><br/>With sleepless nights working on the broken bone-density scanner and disadvantaged by his limited working hours, Chris develops a number a ways to maximize his client contacts and profits as it is the only to earn the one paid position. Regardless of his challenges, Chris never reveals his lowly circumstance to his co-workers, even going so far as to lend one of his bosses five dollars for a cab, a sum he can't afford. The Pursuit of Happiness is the pursuit of Chris Gardner becoming a successful stock broker from a homeless nomad. The Pursuit of Happiness concludes with a caption that tells us what happens to Chris after the end of the movie. It promises a better story than the one we have just watched. - Mayank Bhattacharya"

","This, is truly a great film. Do not expect any Hancock-like stunts from Will Smith here - this is all about the harshness of life and the love between a father and his son. A moving story of personal triumph and pain this is one of the most emotional films and acting performances I have seen in a long while. Based on a true story this is like an evocation of the infallibility of mankind and the truth that anything is possible, for anyone. It also portrays the real love that can bind a father and his son and the despair invoked when a father is unable to provide for him. Some beautiful directing brings the story across as a triumph stemming from pure effort and passion. Highly recommended. Do NOT miss this film."

I am about to make a gamble myself and do an internship without pay just to get some work experience under the belt, just like Chris in the film.<br/><br/>Chris had it tough, real tough and has Murphy's law against him as well; when everything can go wrong, well... but with perseverance you can get you a long way. I hoped to get some inspiration from this film, but it didn't really happen for me; mainly because the story was a biography and you kinda know how it is going to end. He is going to get lucky and the many people who didn't, are not in the spotlight and won't get an own movie.

","""That maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and maybe we can actually never have it."" This is what Will Smith said and exactly what should be realized after watching the film, that is, after using up 2 of the 3 tissues that you should bring along with you. With ""Pursuit of Happiness"", Smith takes on a truly challenging role and shines once again, captivating the audience; he is, hands down, the best thing about the movie. Starring alongside his adorable 8-year-old son, Jaden, he turns in a raw, heartbreaking and scintillating performance as a man who struggles to give his child the quality life that escaped him—surmounting a lack of education and homelessness to become a 'rags-to-riches' phenomenon. In the story, Gardner (Smith) is a salesman with an ample supply of bone density scanners collected during an ill-conceived investment plan that has yet to pay off. His girlfriend, Linda (Thandie Newton), is fed up with having to work double shifts while he strolls around town holding these strange devices, only to return by nightfall with a skinny wallet. They have a son together (Jaden) who spends a lot of time in day care watching TV reruns. Point blank, they are going nowhere, fast. When money woes are pushed to the breaking point, Linda decides it's time to go.The decision actually does nothing except that it victimizes Chris. It's hard to believe that while wearing just enough clothes and sporting a paint-smeared face, Chris would land an internship at a prestigious brokerage firm on sheer wit alone. While the film is based on a true story—or, rather, ""inspired by a true story,"" which means barely resembling what actually occurred—you shouldn't have to leave your brains out somewhere to enjoy it. Will Smith is the only honest thing about the film along with his son. It's worth his performance, most evident in a scene where he and his son are sleeping in a public bathroom and tears fall out of his eyes without any strain. His way of engrossing the viewers is more than emotional; it's like getting sucked into a vortex, directly landing into his life. The physical and emotional chemistry with his son is extraordinary and perhaps the best father-son relationship that a father or son can dream of. As for the movie title's oddly-spelled ""happyness,"" the word is painted that way on the outside of a day care center and it inspires Chris to contemplate whether happiness truly exists. For him, it does; for millions of other homeless people, it never will. That is a reality too depressing to be expressed in a movie—and it just may be the one thing that even Will Smith can't do."

I mean, just how entertaining is to to see a deserving, bright, likable and capable individual get beaten up, mercilessly, on a daily basis? And then to have the throw-away ending of ""Chris sold his company for a gazillion freaking dollars and now lives the life of culture and privilege that you'll likely never have"" to scroll up on the screen as some sort of payback for the relentless, dehumanizing, drumming he endured for the whole balance of the film, was the ultimate in anti-climactic endings.<br/><br/>Is that it? Financial abundance is the cure-all for life's problems and lack of ""happyness""? The basic premise of the film is just weak, hackneyed, cloying, and manipulative.

","The Pursuit of Happiness This movie is about a man named Christopher Gardner(Will Smith) and his son Christopher(Jaden Smith).He ended up being homeless with his son after his girlfriend left him(Linda) Thandie Newton because she could not take them being without and broke. The theme of this movie to me is that no matter what you go through you can overcome it and become better,and it is also about Chris wanting to belong somewhere in the world.This movie is based on a true story, and he thought he could come up in the world by selling density scanners to make money and that fell right through the roof and him and his son ends up getting put out of their house and into the streets and that forced him to go and have to go a church shelter everyday but, he just goes to show also when you think you have a friend how that friend can turn their back he had a friend he thought the man that he let borrow fourteen dollars and when he really needed he could not get it back,and when thought he was doing o.k. in his life the bank took what little money he had saved up. Could you imagine having something that devastating happening to you,but he was strong determined black man to come up in the world and do better for him and his son but after having an interview with this internship and finding out their was no money coming in he really got down on his luck but faith was by his side and not only got the internship he got the job and made a life for him and his son.The cinematic element that I see is about the music in the movie especially, when he goes to church and they are singing this song and he just gets little christopher(Jaden Smith) and start hugging him that really shows love for his son and all he had bundled up in the inside of him people could look at him everyday and never tell that he was homeless.This movie tells just what a homeless person goes through and even difficult times when you have a child to see to, but he did not let him stop him for going for what he wanted. He girlfriend did not try to come back for her son or the dad.This movie does not only show about a person being homeless and working for what you want but it shows love and not only what love is but what love does when you really love a person especially your child."

","The drama The Pursuit of Happiness is directed by Gabriele Muccino and stars Will Smith, Jaden Smith, and Thandie Newton. The film takes place in 1980 San Francisco.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is a middle aged man who sells bone density scanners for a living, which does not serve his life style very well. He is smarter than most, and is very good with people. That is why when he sees a man parking his sports car he asks him what his job is. The man just happens to be a stock broker so Gardner decides to apply for an internship program which gives out no pay. When Chris's financial situation gets so bad his girlfriend (Newton) goes to New York to get a better paying job leaving Chris and his son (Jaden Smith) alone and broke. Chris must get the stock broker job to give his son an appropriate lifestyle to grow up in or they will end up homeless and starving...<br/><br/>The screenplay for this film by Steve Conrad is very traditional. It is just the usual uplifting story with all its highs and lows. Yes, the characters of Chris Gardner and Chris Jr. are very likable and the type of protagonists an audience loves to root for. But I thought it was cruel how characters such as Chris's girlfriend Linda are portrayed as a villain. She is going through the same situation as Chris and offers to take their son with her to New York but still the writing makes her appear as a villain. The main focus of the film is money and it seems like Chris Gardner will not be satisfied until he lives a luxurious life like those that he works for. On the plus side there are several very funny and enjoyable moments in the film, I will not spoil them for those of you who have not seen it. This is a very predictable film though, but is still enjoyable.<br/><br/>Gabriele Muccino's direction was not anything really noteworthy. Again I would have to blame the way Linda is portrayed also on him but compliment him for all the great segments of comedy. In no way did any of the shots make me impressed at any point, like Conrad's screenplay the shot selection is very traditional. Muccino did get very good performances from basically the whole cast of the film, never at one point did I think to myself I can't enjoy this film because of how bad that actor is doing.<br/><br/>Speaking of the acting I will start with Will Smith's Oscar nominated performance. I have yet to see the film Ali which he was also nominated for but this is the best that I have ever seen him do. He is extremely likable, as he is in all of his films, but he almost forces the audience to want him to succeed. This film was Jaden Smith's first performance and he made an outstanding debut. Young Smith played the role of an extremely cute kid who just wants a normal life perfectly and supplied much of the comedic relief. Thandie Newton plays the part of the evil girlfriend Linda and plays it very well since she is very unlikable during the film even though she should be very relatable. The rest of the supporting cast does a fine job and keep this uplifting drama going.<br/><br/>The score for this film is very good and appropriate. It added another layer to the stress going on in the film or added light heartedness when it was an enjoyable part. Andrea Guerra's score was definitely one of the strongest parts of the film and is another addition to his impressive resume.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 7/10, it is very traditional and predictable but features some fine performances. This is a good movie and I'm sure that anyone who watches this will enjoy it even though they will think it is corny. This was probably Will Smith's last good movie and hopefully in the future he will be the Will Smith we all know in love instead of trying to get an Oscar so much. Definitely see this if you want to watch and inspirational feel good film, don't see this if you are looking for something original and thought provoking."

","In the 2006 movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"", Will Smith portrays Chris Gardner, a man pursuing a dream. Gardner is a salesman for a piece of medical equipment which is too expensive for what it is worth. After going months without any sales, his wife decides to start a better life, leaving him alone to raise their son, Christopher (Jaden Smith). After Gardner's wife leaves, he continues to try to sell the medical device. He then sees an opening to his future as a stock broker. The only problem is that, in order to be considered for the job, he must complete a highly competitive, six-month, unpaid internship. He does everything he can to prove to his boss, himself, and his son, that he can be a better man, even if this means living in hotels, homeless shelters, or even the bathroom of a subway station. While completing the internship, he continues to attempt to sell the equipment to make ends meet and pay for his son's day care. This tear-jerking, box-office hit of 2006 is a classic story of a family living in poverty working their way up the social ladder towards happiness, and doing whatever it takes to reach the top.<br/><br/>One of the main messages of ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is 'never give up.' Chris Gardner goes from just barely having enough money to pay the rent to having nothing but the clothes on his back, and the love and faith of his son. Gardner was able to dodge anything and everything that life threw at him and became a top stock broker. This film is not as much about finding a job and making money as much as it is about being a good father, providing for his family, and ultimately being happy.<br/><br/>This film may not be the light-hearted story that the title may lead some to believe and this is apparent through the use of colors. The entire movie has a gray muted tone to help portray a grim feeling. Had the film used more bright colors, the viewers would not have received the same message.<br/><br/>""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a must see movie. It is different than the classic Will Smith role and he does a great job of playing a character with whom the audience can relate."
"webmaster-3017","8","0","0","12 July 2009"," HK Neo Reviews: The Pursuit of Happiness
","Tagline: Happiness is for those that are willing to pursue it <br/><br/>Review by Neo: Sometimes in life, we will always meet a crossroad, a moment where you sit back and long behind you, whether it is really making you happy. Happy is not simply smiling; it is a matter of a feeling, an inner feeling, and an indescribable moment that truly makes someone happy. We all have a dream, big or small, it doesn't matter and in the course of our lives, sometimes we tend to forget that dream. Whether it is for money, survival and whatever reason, we constantly make excuses about this and that. What makes Pursuit of Happiness so real is not because it is based on a true story, but rather it explores the very notion of the struggles and the journey that it takes in someone's pursuit of happiness. Like a quote that I recently heard, ""out of difficulties makes miracles."" The harder it is to reach your goal the more satisfying it can be. For me personally, despite doing an office job for whatever reason, I have not given up my dream and writing this will not carry me towards it, but rather prepare me for any opportunities that come along.<br/><br/>The movie is basically about a man struggles to a goal, from selling laser scanner to an industry that considers the goods as only a luxury to losing his wife, living in the public toilets, to lining up with the homeless, this film is really a journey of survival, endurance, persistence of one's goal and dream of happiness.<br/><br/>Will Smith in one of his better performances, plays a battler, a father, a fighter and a failed husband, Despite all his bad luck (especially with all those out of place parking tickets) and some out of his own stupidity and doing (leaving a laser scanner with a hippy, tax evasion to name a few), Smith is able to relate his character to the audience. As the saying goes, when you win the audience, you win their hearts. This is why when the moment, came near the end when he step in the room of all the bosses, the redness of his watery eyes, easily wins my heart and everything that goes along with it. A wonderful performance by all means and not to mention, the chemistry with his real life son (Jared Smith) is simply too natural to be true.<br/><br/>All in all, this is actually my second viewing of this film and it certainly does not disappoint. Sometimes, when we are busy in our lives, especially in the light of the global recession, we tend to forget what we used to dream, want and do with our lives. It is true and real that we all have to eat, work and survive, but it is important for us to keep dreaming a little, enjoy life a little more and most of all, continue and persist in what we really want in our lives. Sometimes, it really isn't easy, and it will probably be difficult to achieve, but if the goal is to be happy, I am guessing it is the essential or perhaps the essence of life. After all, I do believe in miracles, but I also believe that you will have to work hard, before the miracle can arrives.

","A father and salesman is in ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" in this 2006 film starring Will Smith, Thandie Newton, and Jaden Smith. This is the real-life story of Chris Gardner, who was eking out a living selling bone density scanners while his wife (Newton) worked double shifts at a hospital. They weren't making it financially. One day Gardner sees a man get out of fancy car and asks him how he made it. The man says he's a stockbroker. Chris applies to the Dean Witter Reynolds apprentice program, unaware that there's no salary. He gets in by being terribly persistent. Then his wife leaves him, and Chris insists that their son (Jaden Smith) be left with him.<br/><br/>""Pursuit of Happiness"" is a very warm and above all, a very inspiring story about family, determination, and never letting go of one's dream. Very few people, I think, could or would have tolerated what Gardner did in order to make a better life for himself and his son. The two were homeless on and off, and those scenes are devastating. The apprentice program takes 20 people, and only one is chosen, yet Chris goes for it, bringing everything he owns to work when he had no place to live. How he holds it together and talks to clients and makes contacts is incredible. Frankly, if this weren't a true story, I would still have liked it but wondered how possible any of it even was.<br/><br/>Will Smith has proved himself an excellent actor in the past - the way he completely submerged his personality into Mohammed Ali is a good example. Here, he's a charming, bright person who is always a day late and a dollar short. Through Smith's performance, one can feel Gardner's pain, frustration, and joy.<br/><br/>The film's message is clear - the brick walls aren't there to keep you out, they're there to keep out the people who don't really want to get to the other side. And family is everything. In his pursuit of happiness, Chris Gardner goes after his dream on his own terms, integrity and humor intact, relentlessly, all the while knowing that the most important thing is the little boy at his side."

","As my heading goes, what Chris Gardner said to his son Christopher, is not only meant for him but for all of us. I really loved this movie.

Steven Conrad's Screenplay & Story. Andrea Guerra's Exuberant Music. Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Thanden Newton - their individualistic intrinsic performances.

","Will Smith does an excellent job in this movie. It really will have you curled up on your couch crying or almost crying in the middle, but then beaming with joy at the very end. Smith's son also does a terrific job. Really cuts to the core of American values. <br/><br/>The best part of this movie is the way it plays yo-yo with your emotions. One moment you'll be sad that Will Smith is in such a bad situation with the crazy machines, then your happy that that his son likes basketball, then your angry at the day care place, and frustrated that will smith has such a hard time trying to be a stockbroker. Then your happy again that they get to go to the 9ers game, but you feel awkward because they don't have a car. Then your sad again only to be happy by the end. It truly is a roller coaster worth riding.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie"

","""Maybe happiness is something we can only pursue. And maybe we can actually never have it, no matter what,"" says Chris Gardner (Will Smith). It's the driving introspective thought behind Italian director Gabriele Muccino's film, The pursuit of Happiness (2006), and it questions the justice and validity of the American dream as we see Chris attempting to reach his own goal.<br/><br/>The film opens with a series of establishing shots indicative of the 1981 San Francisco setting as well as several close-up shots focusing on the portable bone density scanner, a device that produces slightly higher quality images than x-rays. As the plot begins to unfold, the audience quickly discovers the extent of the Gardner family's financial troubles. Flash back to the young family's brighter past: they have decided to invest their life's savings in the aforementioned scanners with the intention of selling them to hospitals for a profit. However, clients find the product too expensive. The scanners prove arduous to sell, and the financial burdens begin to surmount.<br/><br/>Eventually, Chris' wife moves to New York for a better life, leaving Chris and their son, Christopher (Jaden Smith) behind. Chris, desperate for money decides to participate n a unpaid internship which only promises employment to one candidate at the end of the trial. Financial troubles continue to grow, forcing Chris and his son into homelessness. In spite of hardships, Chris tries to maintain a semblance of family life for his son and relies on selling his last remaining scanners for income. Thus, the scanners become a symbol of hope, the sustaining force that propels us onward toward out dreams, which to Chris is so important that he would literally chase after it.<br/><br/>The acting of Will Smith was perfect for the character he was portraying. Few other actors could have express such pure paternal emotion, Though, much of this can be attributed to the role of Christopher having been cast to Will Smith's own son, Jaden, whose child-like innocence underscores the theme of fulfilling one's dreams by empowering Chris' will in order to continue moving foreword. Camera direction also underscores this movement from a bright past through a darkened period of hardship and uncertainty and ultimately into an enlightened future.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare movies which comes alone only once in a long time. It doesn't simply thrust emotion upon the audience, but rather arouses true sympathy, enabling the viewer to come away with a greater sense of self determination and value in their own dreams. Though at time the plot may progress slowly, this film is worth every moment spent watching."

","Chris Gardner's inspirational story is brought to life by Oscar nominee Will Smith. His son, Jaden Smith, plays Chris' son Christopher in the film. In this story, Chris Gardner is a man who wants to be a broker at Dean Witter. Unfortunately, Dean Witter internships don't pay a salary for six months. I hope they changed that since 1981 when the story takes place. Chris Gardner must deal with his broken marriage and fights to keep his son. They move to a motel after they can't afford to live or pay the rent. Christopher is what keeps Chris going despite losing his apartment, his marriage, his car, but he also has six scanners which he tries to sell. They are bone density scanners sold to doctors. The cast is first rate with James Karen as one of the bosses. Chris Gardner is a man who would do anything and does. It's an inspirational story of father and son in the toughest of times."
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","0","0","21 March 2008"," It's becoming harder and harder to think of things that Will Smith can't do
","To see Will Smith, one of America's most famous and most highly paid Hollywood movie stars, give such a convincing portrayal of a desperately poor black man struggling to achieve a professional career is a memorable experience indeed. But something comes out of Smith when he really believes in a role he's playing, and you can tell that he really believes in the Chris Gardner story. The movie will always be known as being about the single father in San Francisco who pulled himself up by his bootstraps, as they say, barely surviving after tottering on the brink of poverty. It's about the lowest point in a man's life, and the highest.<br/><br/>It is, however, a story as much about desperation as about determination and heart. I think it might not be very politically correct to say this, but the desperation that gripped Gardner as he watched his life fall apart strikes me as just as much of a determining factor in Gardner's perseverance as his will to succeed. But what we remember is not the desperation or the suffering, it's his determination to provide for his son. Gardner watches his world falling apart, but the way he tries to shield his son from that is some of the best stuff in the film.<br/><br/>At the time we see him, Gardner is a self-employed salesman who has made the dubious decision to invest his family's savings in some bulky and expensive bone-density scanners, which provide only a slightly better picture than a traditional x-ray but are far more expensive. Needless to say, he has trouble unloading them, and things become increasingly difficult for him and his family. Thandie Newton plays his wife in a thoroughly unmemorable role, unlike Smith's real life son Jayden, who is astonishingly well-cast as his on screen son. Jayden nearly steals the show from Will a lot of the time!<br/><br/>I am surprised at how badly the story of Gardner's wife is handled. Maybe the real Gardner didn't want her to be much of the story, since she is not the most uplifting thing. Or maybe he wanted them to present in as real a way as possible what really happened. When Gardner tells her about his unpaid internship at Dean Whitter, she criticizes this as a step backwards and tells him she wants to move to Chicago. He tells her that he's keeping their son and, amazingly, she agrees. At this point her crippling shortcomings as a mother become clear and it's easier for the audience to let her go as she disappears from the movie and her husband's and son's life. Too bad.<br/><br/>I can easily relate to Gardner's troubles in San Francisco. I experienced something similar when I first moved to Los Angeles a few years ago, although not nearly as bad as his experience and with no son. It's difficult to make it in a big American city, especially when you are struggling just to get by, you're constantly behind on all of your bills, and you're surrounded by people driving Porsches and Ferraris. The cars alone in LA are enough to depress you if you're stuck in a dead-end job editing together promotional reels for a product placement company for $10 an hour, trying to work enough to get by while at the same time trying to find a job doing something real. Ouch. <br/><br/>I think the movie's biggest success is that it presents the day to day struggles of Gardner's life, as he smiles and charms his way through his increasingly hectic days at Dean Whitter and then wrestles with desperation at night as he picks up his son from day care and tries to find food and shelter for them when they're evicted from a dingy hotel room of an apartment. The movie approaches the dangerous ground of becoming a tearjerker, but the Smiths save it, both of them nailing their roles with a complex precision that only a real life father and son could. <br/><br/>I've decided to show this movie to my students  I teach at a University in central China, and I'm hoping that if more college students see Gardner's story, it might make them realize that the continuing tension between China and Tibet (which is a separate country in every imaginable way except borders) and the emerging desire to gain Taiwan through war is exactly like Gardner getting that job at Dean Whitter by pulling a gun on the CEO and demanding to be hired. <br/><br/>And by the way, this frightening hope in China to forcibly take Taiwan is no doubt a result of that infamous quote from the murderous and ego-maniacal Mao Tse-tung, ""Power comes out of the barrel of a gun."" That's probably true, and the Chinese definitely believe it. But peace NEVER comes out of the barrel of a gun. Gardner had to improve himself to become desirable, and I hope that China realizes that they must do the same if there is ever to be peace in Asia<br/><br/>Note: At one point in the movie Smith runs tiredly up a hill chasing a bus while his son trails behind him. Smith claims that he bases that tired, worn-out run on his father, and that it was one of the biggest stretches in the film for him as an actor, because he has always prided himself on how he looks running in his films."

It's a predictable journey, and yes it has the ending that was never really in doubt from the start, but the film is engaging to those who have that little triumph of the will spirit in their make up???, and to me it hits a nerve no matter how many times I have seen it in different guises. Will Smith is very good, very restrained and believable, and I say this only furthers my belief that he is one of the hottest talents around if he is directed by good hands. The rest of the cast flesh out the story with no great gusto or detriment, and the score is poor, but the film works for those seeking a bit of a heart tugger with the punch the air ending.<br/><br/>It's a tad overrated here in my opinion, but a very safe sweetly 7/10 for me .<br/><br/>Footnote: I don't know who it was who murdered Bridge Over Troubled Water in this, not only is it misplaced in view of the back story to the song, it also detracts from a good sequence in the film...............shoot the scorer"

","Based on the real story of the trials and tribulations of Chris Gardner, the Pursuit of Happiness is an expertly produced piece of film. The narrative may spin a few changes to the truths but it is mixed so cleverly that it glides on a lightness of tone, while touching emotive issues.<br/><br/>One cannot fail but find Will Smith's character, Chris Gardner a highly likable and affable individual. Arguably, one may suggest Gardner is too optimistic and endearing in circumstances that are too glum to beseech such a nature. However, these are moments, skillfully and subtly executed to convey Gardner's inner turmoil and make him a believable human-being.<br/><br/>Jaden Smith, son of Will Smith - is the real star. I was critical of Jaden Smith being cast for this role due to this relationship... But has he proved me wrong! Jaden Smith is perfect as the young boy, he is able to bring joy, sorrow and frustration to the son who must follow the plight of his down-on-his luck father.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness delivers a heart-warming, uplifting and charming tale. Although some may decide that it veers from the more serious dilemmas, an example being the departure of Linda, Chris Gardner's wife/girlfriend, who is incognito in the second-half of the film, it does not limit or hamper the consistency of its message and should be gracefully received as it has been made."

It is of course too simplistic. I'm sure this made the film more accessible to a general public, and it IS inspirational if you suspend disbelief, but Life just ain't like this, folks. One person DOESN'T take all the hits while others always walk away unbruised. The film ended as predictably as an old Western: the calvary arrives at the last second to save the brave-but-outnumbered pioneers. Newton's character is automatically given a nasty role, with no real explanation for her anger, and especially not her final behavior. Many of the people are mere convenient cutouts representing what Smith could not seem to reach. Do we sometimes feel like this? Yes. Is it when we're busy seeing ourselves as victims, even if we ARE trying? Yes. This was a very ""80's"" film. Decent person struggles, has setbacks, overcomes bad guys, and wins in the end.

While learning to be a broker, he continues to sell medical equipment, his only source of income. He loses him home and must find a way to take care of his son. Sometimes it is sleeping in a bathroom at the train station. In better times, it is getting a room at the shelter.

","The pursuit of Happiness is a movie based on the real life story of Chris Gardner (Will Smith). Gardner is a medical equipment salesman in the early 1980s who is down and his luck and attempting to keep his family together. When his wife walks out on him he is left alone to take care of his son with an ever decreasing bank balance. This turns into a desperate situation. What ensues is the tale of how Gardner fights for the chance of a better life by attempting to prove himself in an unpaid internship at the Dean Witter stockbrokerage. He does this while sleeping in shelters and subway toilets and caring for his son. Anyone in finance will know of the competitive nature of such positions and what is required to succeed even when one is presented with abundant resources and creature comforts. Knowledge of this makes Gardeners struggle all the more admiring. The trailer for this movie provides the immediate impression that it is likely to be good but that it runs a fair chance of being overtly sentimental, cheesy and self worshipping. It is not. Will Smith delivers a fantastic performance. Whilst growing up I saw Will Smith in the Fresh Prince of Bel Air and felt that he would go on to do greater things and not just in the realms of comedy. In the movie Smith's character dwells on how he thought that he could achieve great things when growing up but that this had not materialised. In turn, Smith was never destined for movies like Men in Black or Wild Wild West (Men in Black 2 and Bad Boys 2 make me sick) but for films like this and his performance places him in a world class forum. The Pursuit of Happiness is uplifting, inspiring, heart warming and entirely engrossing from start to finish. This is a movie about hope, determination and family. It exhibits excellent performances from the lead characters and a truly captivating story. There is something in this movie that every human being can relate to. If you have ever struggled to achieve something, faced disappointment, the prospect of losing something you can not afford to lose or come close to achieving some aspect of your dreams you will see these emotions depicted and magnified in this movie. In some ways it is not about the exact situation that Gardener faced but about the general struggle we face in life and how one must remain resolute and never give up hope in our eternal pursuit of happiness. This a powerful emotional film with an understated charm that will appeal to almost anyone with a heart. A must see."

","My only problem with this film is it's insidious message that this is the land of opportunity and that a homeless person can, by pure gumption, pull himself up and become a millionaire. Sure it's possible, but so is winning the lottery. It's nice to think that it can happen as an exploration of the resiliency of the human spirit --no one wants to be a victim, and we don't want to watch characters who are victims either. On the other hand, the point is that he struggled against insurmountable odds -- i.e. our society, the growing gap between the rich and poor, and the ever-dwindling support in place for those who find themselves in crisis. This should be highlighted more in the film than it is. It would only make the achievements of the character more resonant and satisfying.<br/><br/>The film did delve into the darker side (the lack of community child support options, the inadequacy of shelters to help people put their lives together, or of any kind of support system to help those for whom things have gone wrong) and the costs of our system for the innocent child, but the makers seemed to determined to make it a completely feel good movie.

From a house to a motel to a bathroom, Smith evokes emotions I've never seen before, and it is very effective, especially in the scene where he sleeps in a bathroom and silently cries with his son on his lap.<br/><br/>The story is also nice; I wasn't absorbed by it but it entertained me throughout its duration. It moved at a steady pace and things constantly happened, holding my interest. What makes it sad is that it's a true story, so this gives it some credibility.<br/><br/>Other than that, I hate to say the movie is no more than average. The kid is a nice actor and all but does have an occasional bratty moment that made me want to jump inside the movie and slap the kid upside the head for being so naive. But then again, he is a child and certainly more simplistic than his father who knows the emotional dangers of his situation.<br/><br/>So the movie did keep me entertained and I will probably buy it unless I find something better. I liked it and you will too, but it's not something that makes me want to watch it over and over again. 6.9/10."

","Whether it's displaying human emotions, portraying the hard life of the modern lower class and their struggle for life or the presentation of family and love, ""Pursuit of Happiness"" takes us all the way.<br/><br/>An excellent drama about one man's infinite struggle to provide for himself and his son, and all the unbelievable obstacles thrown at him daily. It excellently portrays his desire to win and overcome all troubles, and stops at nothing to reach his goal.<br/><br/>Will Smith completely stole the show, his performance was breathtaking, especially how he presented us with the emotional view of happiness at the end of the film. His bond to the son in the film seemed very real and was also well done, but that probably lies in the fact it's his real life son. Nevertheless, an excellent job from the both of them. It's just, I kinda expected Dan Castellaneta to say -doh!- every time he entered the scene :) A strong recommendation to everyone, it's a picture well worth seeing."

","I mean it - the movie was good, but it was depressing. However, the movie wouldn't have been as good if not for Will Smith's acting. He really was good, and should have won the Oscar. However, he was up against Forrest Whitaker, and I didn't think he was going to win in that sense. But, he did give an amazing and 100 % believable performance. I will admit, though, as a kid whose parents divorced at a young age, I can kind of connect with the kid. In the movie, it is written so that Smith's character is a real person, and this is made better by Smith portraying him as a real person. It adds tremendously to the movie, which is worth it for Will Smith at the least. I would recommend it to those who need inspiration in their lives and like Will Smith, which is actually almost everybody in either categories."

It is nice to see an inspiring movie about any one person, and for it be refreshing and not jaded by stereotypes or racial remarks. I love how he he did not blame anyone for his troubles, took everything like a man, he sold every last one of his bone scanners, and went through the whole internship without a home and barely 2 nickles to rub together. Never asked for help or a handout, and really made something of himself.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I was hoping to see Chris and Christopher a little older, and possibly tooling around town in a fancy red sports car, like he asked the broker about, or maybe sitting and relaxing by their big pool...lol Anyway I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it!"

He didn't looked ready for a 12hr shift at the video store. I walked in after 11 and to my surprise saw ""The Pursuit Of Happiness"", which I didn't realise was out. I'd wanted to see this for a while so i was obviously delighted.<br/><br/>The movie is based upon the true story of Chris Gardener, a struggling salesman who takes a punt on an internship at a local brokerage firm. The punt is that he won't receive a salary for 6mths (in real life though he did get a minimal amount)and has to put in many hours of work and study to ensure a decent chance at landing a job. We follow Charles from his struggling sales job, through his marriage breakdown and into the internship.<br/><br/>It's a simple story, but kept me interested the whole way through.

"mOVIemAN56","7","0","0","26 May 2007"," One of Smith's best performances in a decent story
","The Pursuit of Happiness (yes it is spelled wrong) was a film I had very few problems with. A film about dedication to family, never giving up, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done, the Pursuit of Happiness gets your attention early and does not release you until the end. In a time when pointless teen films seem to be coming out left and right with few meaningful movies here and there, the Pursuit of Happiness stands as a film with a meaning that is not out to just entertain.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner is a struggling salesman in 1981 San Francisco. His wife is angry with him, his job is failing, and he is on the verge of being evicted. His wife finally leaves him and Chris and his son, Chris Jr., are forced out onto the streets. As they struggle to get back on their feet, Chris takes an internship at Dean Witter that pays no money. His hope, to get a job as a stock broker and give his son a better life who resides everyday at the Happiness Daycare while he waits for his father.<br/><br/>Will Smith gives one of his most memorable performances. He is near perfect. Smith has always been a great actor but he really shines through as Chris Gardner. It's kind of similar to his performance as Ali. He isn't afraid to hold anything back as he portrays a struggling man trying to get back on his feet. His performance will move some to tears and others to stand and applaud him. This is one of Smith's best performances and is reason enough to watch it at least once.<br/><br/>The story is strong: man trying to bring himself up from nothing to give his son a better life. The story is strong for the most part. There are some slow parts between Smith and his real life son Jaden. There really isn't anything pointless about the scenes that are slow just bad dialog was written. The movie also seems to try to make a point that all corporate executives care little about the people around them no matter what the case which is mostly false.<br/><br/>Despite some flaws early and in the middle, the Pursuit of Happiness' meaning is clear. If you want to change something, you go change it. This message is made quite clear through Chris' actions in the film and Smith's powerful portrayal as him. I enjoyed the film very much. It's a lot better then some of the stuff that has been coming out nowadays/ It's a good family film and I recommend it to anyone especially people with children.<br/><br/>3.5/5 Stars"

","First of all I have to say the ending of the movie was bad. I think they should've let us see what happens when he gets his new job and gets extremely rich. They only let us know he got rich by writing it quickly on the screen at the end of the movie. That could've been better.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was OK though. Will Smith did an outstanding job playing a serious role (he's just one of my favorite actors), and his son did so too. The movie is very touching sometimes, but it made me smile sometimes too. The plot is nice, based on a true story, so very realistic. In my opinion it shows the situation in America very good and to me it explains why I rather live in Holland where such things can't happen.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was great, but not the best.

Smith gives a very convincing display of the challenges of poverty that face many people, and how he goes about overcoming them, whilst trying to care for his child.<br/><br/>I heard from my friends that this film was long, so i expected it to drag out, like some films do, where you just end up looking forward to the end, but its not like that at all, with a run time of about 2 hours you'll very likely be hooked for the whole duration.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended!"

Thinking of him as a loser, his wife leaves him just as he gets into something that might change his life.<br/><br/>This movie takes place in the early 80's; a time when the economy was probably at its lowest in years at the time. Jobs were scarce and money coming into the household was even more scarce. During the film, I could feel Smith's pain as he tries again and again to get ahead, only to be beaten back down for some reason or another.

"postmanwhoalwaysringstwice","8","0","0","23 April 2007"," Will Smith sells ""Happyness""
","Italian director Gabriele Muccino's first English language film ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" weaves the tale of Chris Gardner, a man of strong ambition and drive, but little to show for it besides an unhappy marriage and a struggling door-to-door sales business. When his wife leaves him with their five-year-old things go from bad to worse, but with the love of his son and his eye on the proverbial prize his hope is high. The film has a classic depression era Hollywood feel that thankfully escapes most of the usual pretense often associated with mainstream Hollywood's attempts at social conscience film-making. Will Smith's lead performance is striking, quite endearing, and a reminder why he appears underutilized in such overblown Hollywood set pieces as ""I Robot"" and ""Men in Black II"". His performance, as well as his real life son's presence, helps to capture the viewer's heart with such a strong emotional line that we're so deeply involved in the story that the cloying melodrama feels genuine and the flawless reactionary main character feels human. This is bittersweet, uplifting, inspirational film-making at its current best."
"fwomp","8","0","0","18 April 2007"," A Tale Of Two Struggles: Fatherhood And Financial
","If you're not a feel-good person, it's still okay to watch THE PURSUIT OF Happiness. Although it has some of those moments, it stands out more as a story of human struggle than a touchy-feely film. That it's based on the real-life events of Chris Gardner also increases its emotional heft as the story pulls you in. But there is a bit of cheating that must be mentioned....<br/><br/>Most of the story's impact comes from the father/son relationship between Chris (Will Smith, THE LEGEND OF BAGGER VANCE) and his son Christopher (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden). The interactions between these two are so natural and effortless that it makes watching the film a sheer joy. But herein lay the trap. If any other young actor had played beside Will Smith, I don't think it would've come off as easy. But one can't blame the film team for making this decision. Jaden Smith was the perfect choice, no matter how unfair it might seem to other father/son film's that struggle with the easy-going nature of similar characters.<br/><br/>Viewing one man's dogged determination to maintain a functioning relationship with his son would be admirable in today's society no matter what. Especially coming from a financially destitute and broken family. That Chris Gardner refused to give up on his dream of becoming a successful father and businessman is felt throughout the movie as Will Smith's Academy Award nominated performance comes tumbling off the screen. Losing everything only to scramble back up and be repeatedly challenged is nothing new to cinema, but Smith's completely believable performance is something of a wonder. The real Chris Gardner put himself on loan to Smith and the production so that everything had that authentic feel. It also meant that there were fewer liberties taken with the story, as Gardner wouldn't allow certain omissions or changes.<br/><br/>The big surprise, though, was Jaden Smith, Will Smith's son. His corny jokes, tickle-fests, vivid imagination (dinosaurs?), and touching dialogue all moved the story into brighter territory during the darkest times. Thandie Newton (CRASH) also plays well as Smith's alienated wife but has little screen time.<br/><br/>Learning to never give up on your dreams is something we can all take to the bank. And Mr. Gardner certainly did. He's now a multimillionaire who's assisting the poor in the very San Francisco neighborhood where this sobering story takes place. Giving back to the homeless shelters and getting notice out about hunger in our own cities, Chris Gardner is not only a success, he's smart and thoughtful. If for no other reason than that, you should watch The Pursuit of Happiness.<br/><br/>(Note: At the very end of the film, the real Chris Gardner has a cameo spot while wearing a very expensive suit. The film makers did this in order to show how far the Mr. Gardner had come.)"

","In a dreadful year for movies, this inspirational gem helps to save the day; one of the rare good movies of 2006.<br/><br/>Will Smith is quickly proving himself to be one of the leading men with great range, ingratiating character, and emotional depth. Will Smith is terrific here and richly deserved an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>Besides the acting in Pursuit which is universally good, there are five other positive things to say about Pursuit:<br/><br/>1. It was entertaining without any need for violence, cursing, sex, or death. Can we please see more movies like this? <br/><br/>2. Despite the underlying story of a black man trying to win a job in a white man's world, no aspect of race, racism, or prejudice is ever implied. Wow - can this be? Thank the Almighty.<br/><br/>3. The movie demonstrates the power of the human will to not only survive but succeed at whatever singlemindedness it chooses to latch on to, though the road may be exceedingly difficult indeed. Pursuit of Happiness is not only a well-acted, well-directed, entertaining film but a story with an eternal moral to inspire all of us - at least those with an ear to hear.<br/><br/>4. Great, great, great score! <br/><br/>5. The necessity of faith-based charity. At one point in Chris Gardner's nadir, it was a Christian charity that provided the respite and physical/spiritual care he needed for himself and his son. Those that have never experienced such despair and poverty as Chris did may not realize how essential such charity is for so many lives.<br/><br/>There are 3 negative things that can be and have been said: 1. The movie takes some unnecessary liberty with the details of the real story. For example, the competitive internship was not nonsalaried.<br/><br/>2. We never really see Chris Gardner study any books. A competitive internship was not only about working the phones and hobnobbing. We know he is something of a prodigy but one cannot learn through osmosis either. I admit this is nit-picky though.<br/><br/>3. The concept of happiness to Chris Gardner seems a bit too shallow, deceptive, and purely capitalistic. Becoming a stressed-out stockbroker is something I would consider hell on Earth and brokers have more of a reputation of jumping out windows than being a paradigm of contentment.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it was not really about being a broker or about being wealthy that seemed to have driven him but having the financial freedom to not always have to struggle and survive, which this movie vividly depicts as hellish. And indeed it is.<br/><br/>Great movie. 9 stars."

","I was reluctant about sitting down and watching this film due to the fact that I assumed it would be the usual social injustice and rags to riches movie with all of Hollywood's latest political cliché's that normally come with it, but I came away very impressed and will now put myself into the category of - Will Smith fan.<br/><br/>Smith is one of the actors today that comes off the screen as a natural - making it look easy. His past roles in comedy and action films have not been among my favorites (though I did like ""I Robot"") because a lot of actors can do the same thing in similar type movies. But in this drama he is absolutely riveting. His performance is not over the top, which it could have been designed that way. Many films of this type do approach it that way in order to bludgeon the movie-goer over the head with its message - but this one does not, which is why it works. Smith handles the drama and tension of a man being pushed to his limits with such sharp subtlety that the emotion builds as the story moves along, that in the end you are right there with him, cheering him on, when all his efforts are finally rewarded.<br/><br/>The scene where he is at the playground with his son with no home to go to is one of many moving scenes but this one particular scene really hit home. I have to include the dialogue - ""You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you that you can't do it. You want something? Go get it. Period."" The way Smith handles the character of Chris and his problems and endless obstacles with dignity is what stands out the most. It's inspiring, and every scene with him in it is memorable. A possible award winning performance in my opinion."

","This movie was pretty darn good. I love movies about people who live in the hood. Will Smith and his son look nothing alike, which can only mean mom most look like a monster. The mom in the movie could have acted a little better. I thought her acting was somewhere between Dylan or Cole Sprouse. Even though this movie was hard to watch because of all its chronological errors of miscellaneous objects it turned out to be pretty amusing. Yet if we all go see this movie than we we'll all pay and all of our money will go straight to Mr. Will Smith and his crazy looking son, so all that says to me is he acted as a poor man to make millions. So by saying that we've established that you can stand on the corner of the street in some old tattered clothes and put on a little skit with some ugly kid and live like a king. And if we've established that than soon you will find more and more hobo looking people on the street. And if we do that than the actual hobos will get no money from all the sympathetic little whiny girls in the cars that drive by and hand out a couple Washington's. And if they don't get any pity money than they will die. Which could be OK for some people who think we need to clean up dirty places like the ghetto. But for others that would mean more dead people. But actually to both it just mean more dead people and people always say to be optimistic so that would mean that we are all glad that the hobos died and if we're all glad that the hobos died than we;re all crazy and if we;re all crazy we're all crazy and if we're all crazy than there's a bunch of crazy people driving around in crazy cars because they were made by crazy factory people that put all of the crazy parts together to make a crazy car and if we're all driving around in little crazy cars than we'll never get to work or school and if we never make it to work than we'll have nothing because the truck drivers won't deliver all of our crazy food grown by crazy farmers and if we have no food than we'll all be forced to grow our own crazy food in our crazy backyard in our crazy gardens which of course might be a nice way to pass time since we'll all be crazy but other than that there is no good coming out of being crazy which is crazy so now that we all are not going to work we have no money which means no money for all of our crazy little kids to be taught crazy things at a crazy school taught by crazy teachers so if our kids don't go to school than they'll grow up to be crazy which means the whole generation will be crazy which can only lead to more crazy things which is a crazy chain reaction of craziness's so every one in the world will be crazy poor and we'll all be on street corners trying to get money but there's no money to be given which would mean that we all will die which could be good to suicidal people and bad to other people but people always say to be optimistic which would mean we're all suicidal which in reality is not optimistic so people will not know which way to feel and I'm sure that would be pretty crazy. So I guess the only real way to stop this is to not see this movie. Which will make Will Smith poor so than we might be able to watch the movie because it would be a reality show. So you can pick what you want to do but I think its pretty easy to tell that we should all just stay the way we are and not see this movie and maybe start watching Gilmore Girls as I have seen nothing wrong with that show except the whole show itself."

I still haven't given it back.<br/><br/>Inspired by a true story, Will Smith stars as Chris Gardner, the poor salesman who has a problem with parking tickets and paying rent. He's a very smart guy, though, as he is able to complete a Rubik's Cube in only a few minutes...talk about skilled! He has a son, Christopher, who he had with his girlfriend who leaves him towards the beginning of the movie. Chris applies for an internship as a stock broker in hope that he will be able to produce the money to provide a better living atmosphere for he and his son.<br/><br/>Will Smith has never given a finer performance. As a Hollywood multi-million dollar actor, the way he is able to portray a poor man in such a realistic way is beyond me. Little Jaden Smith (Will's son) does a surprisingly amazing job as Chris's son.<br/><br/>But, in my opinion, the best part about this movie is the message: ""If you want something, go get it.

Also, as American citizens, the Declaration of Independence says that we are entitled to the privileges of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

You know the guy is a kind of genius and it only will take time for someone to recognize it, but then, that is not quite fair---not everyone has a gift or genius for something. And it seemed he made bad choices. Why work for as a paidless intern when your family is starving? Had he never heard of a job? Seems with this apparent talent, he would have been employed readily. I am all in favor of willing suspension of disbelief, but this movie maybe crossed that line. It simply didn't make sense. At some point, with this litany of bad luck, you have to ask yourself, why?

This film is the type of crowd-pleasing Oscar-fodder that Hollywood has been churning out of the machine for ions. All Chris Gardner wants to do is find a job, have a decent place to live and raise his son. He's a nice, hard-working, nose-to-the-grindstone kind of moral hero who goes through every agonizing thing imaginable in a job-less world of the early 80's big city. Extremely well acted by Will Smith as Gardner, a salesman who desperately wants to make an internship happen for a brokerage firm. What he faces, possible poverty and the downs and more downs of making ends meet when there's no income lining Chris' pockets is shown in this film. Audiences have ate these kinds of films for years watching a man persevere against so many odds with a humongous stacked deck which seems to tower over Chris like a dark, looming thundercloud that doesn't like him."

You get caught up in Chris' drive to succeed and along the way there is some humor to blunt the adversities that come his way. And, it was this humor that helped us believe that Chris might make it, but we kept asking when will this turn around for him as so much is thrown his way. He keeps asking his son to trust him and his 5-year old son always complies in the affirmative. I think many men would have given up or done something different, but Chris Gardner had something he could count on and he knew it. He had a talent.

","'Pursuit of Happiness' certainly isn't one of the best movies of the year, but it delivers on its promise of being one of the year's best feel-good stories. There's something so genuine about it, that it's nearly impossible not to be won over by its charm and heartbreak. Will Smith delivers a terrific performance, one of his best, and ultimately helps override one looming question: How could one person go through so much?<br/><br/>Chris Gardner is a struggling husband doing his best to provide a decent life for his wife and young son. But sometimes, trying just isn't enough. When his wife picks up and walks out of his life, it leaves Chris and five-year-old Christopher alone and without a home. Chris becomes determines to do something with his life, refusing to live a life from paycheck to paycheck. He finds hope in the stock broking business, and soon embarks on an internship that'll test not only his character, but his ability to be a father. Yet through all the hardships, the trials and tribulations, Chris weathers through. He seeks refuge where he can, and not once does he give up as he strives to overcome his obstacles. But the question remains, will it be enough?<br/><br/>There's nothing in 'Pursuit' that we haven't seen before, like the sugary-sweet birthday card we get from our grandparents every year. It goes down easy, and for a brief moment makes our day a little better than it was. But there's something about those cards that don't get old, no matter how many times you hear its saccharine message. And so, you understand what 'Happiness' is all about. We've grown up hearing success stories, how someone with nothing became someone with something. For Chris Gardner, I do wonder how much of his story has been embellished. But in the end, does it really matter? If all we're supposed to take away from the film is that, whoever we are, we can make something out of ourselves, should that really matter? No, probably not. And sure, we can focus on how unbelievable it may be that one person suffers so much in a single lifetime, but that'll get us nowhere. We have to accept 'Happiness' for what it is: something that for a brief moment makes our day a little better.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the best thing about the film are the incredible performances it churns out. Not only from Will Smith, but its supporting cast as well. Thandie Newton is back after her Oscar-worthy performance in 2005's 'Crash', and it's great to see her again. Though she doesn't have a great deal of screen time playing Gardner's wife, her talent is certainly felt. Such a wonderful talent, I don't understand why she doesn't receive more attention than she has in the past. One person who shouldn't have to worry about that is Jaden Smith, real-life son of Will Smith who plays Chris Gardner's son in the movie. He brings to the film a sense of innocence, and genuinely becomes the part. It probably didn't hurt having his dad on set everyday to act with, who himself delivers one of the best performances of his career. Will Smith brings life to Gardner's story, and helps give it a sense of reality instead of becoming just another TV-rate production. Perhaps not Oscar-worthy, but very notable.<br/><br/>'The Pursuit of Happiness' represents the American Dream, and Italian director Gabriele Muccino takes that idea and runs with it. And does he ever. It's a flawed film with a so-so script, but nonetheless will have moviegoers across the country standing up and applauding. It's a moving story, even if it teeters on the edge of melodrama. It embodies determination and hope, ideals that America was founded on hundreds of years ago. Ideals that still ring true today, and can still go towards crafting a solid movie."

","Will Smith puts on an absolutely superb performance in the rags to riches story of Chris Gardner, one of the founders of the brokerage Gardner Rich, who at one point in his life was reduced to sleeping in public bathrooms with his 5 year old son because he had no place else to go. This is a heavy movie, in the end uplifting, but hard going pretty much all the way through. Things start out with Gardner struggling, and hoping to make his life better, but things aren't desperate. He's trying to sell bone density scanners that no one wants because they're just too expensive and they're not a sufficient improvement over the x-ray machines doctors and hospitals would have anyway. The bills are beginning to pile up, he has unpaid parking tickets galore, and things with his girlfriend Linda (Thandie Newton) aren't great and they're getting worse. Eventually she leaves, and Gardner is left to care for his son Christopher (played by Will Smith's real son, Jaden Smith, who showed the potential to follow in his dad's footsteps.) Here was one thing I found difficult in the movie: why Linda would leave her son behind in the desperate situation into which Gardner was falling. It obviously happened, but it wasn't really explained. Linda seemed to have been a good mom, but all that gets said (by Chris to Linda) is ""you know you can't take care of him."" But why can't she take care of him? Chris lands an unpaid internship with the brokerage firm Dean Witter, which is his only hope, and the movie moves back and forth from the totally in control Chris working for Dean Witter, to the increasingly out of control and desperate Chris who has no place to live. The two most poignant scenes in the movie are first when Gardner finds himself locked out of the hotel room he and Christopher had been living in because he hadn't paid the rent, and, as he looks through the window into the now inaccessible room, the sense of desperation as he realizes that he has absolutely no place to go is palpable. Then, at the very end of the movie, the heaviness finally (and mercifully) lifts, as Gardner is offered a position at Dean Witter and obviously holds back tears as he accepts. The relief, again, is palpable.<br/><br/>The movie title, of course, comes from the Declaration of Independence, and in an opening narrative, Gardner suggests that perhaps Jefferson wrote it that way to point out that happiness can only be chased; it can't really be caught. And, in pursuit of happiness, Gardner does a lot of running. Will Smith is constantly and literally running in this film, to the point where it became a bit distracting.<br/><br/>There's not much to criticize here, though, except that - as I've said - it was a bit heavy to the point at which one of the people I was watching it with sighed and said ""is this guy's life ever going to get any better?"" It does, and it's a great story. 9/10"

","PURSUIT OF Happiness is a film that despite all its flaws (repetition of chases, repeated encounters that mirror the last, emotional overload, excessive playing time of two hours, etc) reinforces some truly important human values: love between a father and son, pushing forward toward success despite all the roadblocks, kindness for the plight of the homeless, and strength of character in the face of hopelessness. Knowing that the story (by Steve Conrad) is based on fact, that Chris Gardner really existed to survive these hardships, makes the film even more impactful. Director Gabriele Muccino knows how to aim for the heart and the film is bound to touch all who view it.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is an African American very bright young man married to Linda (Thandie Newton) who has a difficult time working double shifts at a thankless job to support the family due to Chris' inability to sell Bone Density Evaluators that he used the family's life savings to invest in for a future that looks increasingly grim. Chris and Linda and their young son Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) live next to the poverty line and finally Linda leaves, frustrated, angry and hurt. Chris and his son strike out on their own: the relationship between father and son as enacted by the Smiths is as touching as any on film. Bruised by the lack of success in selling his machines, Chris encounters a happy man who says his secret is working as a stockbroker with Dean Witter in downtown San Francisco. Chris applies for employment, passes an entrance exam and is taken on with the firm - only to discover he is an unpaid intern who must pass a hefty exam and perform at top speed in order to succeed.<br/><br/>With no income except from Chris' continued attempts to see his medical machines poverty embraces the father and son and they end up homeless and hungry. The only things keeping Chris afloat are his love and concern for his son and his intense will to survive and succeed. How this works out is known because of all the PR from the film and from the actual facts of the story.<br/><br/>Will Smith and his son Jaden give warmly human performances, giving the camera as much with the silence of their faces as they deliver with lines. Yes, there are many moments when the heartstrings are heavily plucked, but there is no problem defending that in a society too famished for stories of human dignity in the face of tragedy. The large supporting cast is well directed and the production values are excellent. PURSUIT OF Happiness is well worth the journey. Grady Harp"

","**possible minor spoilers** Here are my thoughts about the movie. Please pardon any previously mentioned ideas, as I have not read everything on this board.<br/><br/>Like other viewers, I initially marveled at how superficial the message of the movie SEEMED to be: happiness can be reduced to material gain. I wondered why Chris Gardner couldn't find happiness in all the little things in life----""the spaces in between""-----such as all the private moments he had with his son. I questioned the director's wisdom of showing Chris Gardner celebrating in an awkward, suppressed manner his definition of happiness (after being hired by Dean Witter) as well as the director's striving for the ""happily-ever-after"" effect by stating at the end of the movie that the true-to-life Chris Gardner eventually went on to great monetary success.<br/><br/>But, later I thought about the placement of the word ""happyness"" in the film's title and then reflected on the film itself, and it all made sense. As others have pointed out on this board, Chris had no time to truly enjoy these smaller moments of happiness. With abject poverty and homelessness staring him in the face, he had to fight to not only survive but also be a successful provider for him and his son. It wasn't enough to just get by; he wanted to give his son a good life, perhaps one he had never had. For him (and countless others in this world), happiness is something that indeed must be pursued. The movie offers a refreshing, realistic portrayal of happiness that today is too often supplanted by over-simplistic, formulaic varieties espoused by some short-sighted, if not delusional, self-help ""gurus"" (By no means do I wish to slight all writers of the self-help genre, but, unfortunately, happiness cannot be reduced to seven simple laws/habits/eccentricities,etc.). Yes, that a piece of happiness can be found in life's simpler moments is a truth that, hopefully, should never be lost on any of us. But the writers and director of this movie seem to be saying that just as there is more than one way to SPELL ""happiness"", there is more than one way to FIND it too."

"oneloveall","7","0","0","20 March 2007"," Excellent realist piece of Hollywood
","A touching, if slightly manipulative docudrama based around the financial struggling of one Chris Gardner, this inspirational yarn has just enough integrity to override much self-importance found throughout a somewhat preachy script. While relying on another rags-to-riches scenario to hold interest, what The Pursuit of Happiness does well is balance a grimy realism with Hollywood aspirations of sentimentality so as to wrangle both types of cinema lovers in creating one of the more impressive family films to emerge in a while. <br/><br/>Credit producer and star Will Smith for knowing exactly how to play this one. From the sensible employment of Italian filmmaker Gabriele Muccino (who often elevates scene after scene with a greater eye for direction then this American genre is used to seeing), to an instantly appealing soundtrack, right down to his own contribution of his most assured performance to date, Smith is in fine form here. Once again reestablishing his dramatic credit as an actor, the one time rapper and punch line proves he can still carry a film of dramatic weight, and make beneficial choices behind the scenes. The casting of his real son to play his son here, who spends almost as much time on screen as the lead, should have come across as a self indulgent move the likes Hollywood royalty get to wallow in plenty. But just as the script's seemingly cornball leaning somehow plays out with more inherent truth then it should, Smith is able to utilize the precious bond he has with his son to astonishing effect in a way that hardly feels exploitive. Mild cases of overacting do arise, though a certain sincerity based on this real life hardship manages to shine through nearly every clichéd moment."

However the movie lacked in telling the story of how Chris Gardner was treated by his step-father, or how because of that he resolved to end the cycle of abuse that was passed down from father to son.

"DICK STEEL","8","0","0","24 February 2007"," A Nutshell Review: The Pursuit of Happiness
","Will Smith has come a long way since his Fresh Prince of Bel Air days. Starring in an average of 1 movie per year, ranging from action to serious drama, it's without a doubt that he's one of the world's most bankable stars, and turns in an Oscar nominated performance for his role as Chris Gardner in The Pursuit of Happiness, inspired by the events of the real Chris Gardner's life.<br/><br/>Smith's role was wonderfully multi-faceted, as the loving father who's trying his very best to bring home the bacon, for his family, and to pay the bills. A sales person whose product is a bone density contraption, he faces dark days when sales targets are consistently missed, and the bills start to mount. Soon enough his family structure breaks down, as he goes in search for financial independence against incredible odds, in the quest to lift himself and his son from the doldrums of life.<br/><br/>It's a basic rags to riches story, which made the grade based on Smith's performance. With steely grit, determination, and the refusal to back down, it's inspirational in a way, though at times clichéd, with reminders not to let others put you down just because they can't themselves. You feel down when the characters face their challenges, and celebrate when they gain little triumphs. For anyone who had faced financial hardships one way or another, it's easy to identify with elements presented, like how difficult it is to reclaim bad debts, and the feeling of dread when you have but a few dollars in your wallet.<br/><br/>Told as a narration introduced by titles corresponding to the events presented, there were some elements that brought back some memories of my internship days as well, especially the scene where Gardner had to make cold calls. It's not easy, even though you're prepared with some sort of script, you have to be on your toes to negotiate for a meeting to present something substantial, and the challenge is to snag that meeting. Of course, more often than not, it's great training to build up a thick skin, as you'll face with more rejections, some of which are as soon as you introduce yourself. A little street smart slyness is the order of the day, and Gardner in the movie managed to kill multiple birds in one stone, constantly probing for opportunities.<br/><br/>The art direction was superb, capturing the 80s setting perfectly, with little clues dropped every now and then to remind you that it's the 80s - the ad for Robert DeNiro's Raging Bull, Ronald Reagan as President, and the fashion of the days. <br/><br/>While Thandie Newton co-stars as Gardner's wife Linda, a role which allowed her to contribute a lot more than her recent outing in Norbit, the real co-star is actually Jaden Smith, who plays Gardner's son Christopher. In fact, if you thought the father-son chemistry he shared with Will Smith was natural, it is, because Jaden is actually Will's son, so it's no surprise how comfortable they look together on screen.<br/><br/>For an inspirational movie and as much one on father and son relationships, of the sacrifices fathers make, it's balanced in both its lighthearted and melancholic moments, A definite must watch for fans of Will Smith, and for those curious to check out his Oscar nominated performance before the awards ceremony this weekend. My bet is if Forest Whitaker's Idi Amin role in The Last King of Scotland is not competing in the same year, then Will Smith would have had a better chance."

","Will Smith finally proves that he is capable of carrying a movie with his acting instead of his bravado. While the film itself holds little surprise, Smith is truly a revelation.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie you usually don't really need to see if you've seen the trailer, as it does exactly what it says on the tin and little else. Smith's character, Chris Gardner, is a destitute man working his ass off trying to get a job as a stock broker by doing an unpaid internship, while trying to look after his five year old son. The story is little more than a rewrite of the same old themes of love, persistence, determination and faith in the American dream (the pursuit of happiness). There are times when the film becomes contrived, as problem after predictable problem is dropped is Gardner's lap.<br/><br/>In spite of these somewhat obvious flaws, the film succeeds due to a consistently engaging and sometimes deeply moving performance from Will Smith, who inhabits his character completely. There are none of the token Willyisms here either, which was a brave move for all concerned, a move that paid off very well. It's nice to see Smith get his second Oscar nomination, as he fully deserves it for lifting this otherwise mediocre weepie to near greatness."

"PortugalOle7","8","0","0","27 January 2007"," Will Smith is worth the price of admission
","What this film lacks in real story depth, it makes up for in the emotional depth of Will Smith's tremendous performance. While I haven't seen Ali, in my opinion, this is Will Smith's best performance.<br/><br/>The story is about a real-life man named Chris Gardner who hits rock bottom financially but tries to keep himself and his young son afloat by applying for a stock broker training program. Unfortunately the program comes without a pay-check and it forces Gardner to keep at his previous job of selling high-density bone scanners to clinics and hospitals. To further divulge any of the story will really defeat the purpose of seeing the film, in my opinion. However, I have known about Gardner's story for a couple of years already. You might have already seen a feature on him on NBC's Dateline or ABC's 20/20, I can't remember which. To know where Gardner eventually ends up, its a real inspiration to see the hard journey that it took to get him there.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the film comes from the fact it doesn't offer much story depth. Whether some aspects were cut or not, I'll have to find out myself; Gardner has written a memoir with the same title. Where this film succeeds is with Smith. Will Smith has an uncanny ability to draw people into whatever role he is playing. He's funny and extremely genuine in this film and those two abilities are important in telling this story. I'm not sure anyone else could have played this role any better. Why it works is because you feel for the character and the struggles he goes through and his triumphs. What also must not go unnoticed is the chemistry between real-life father and son combo of Will and Jaden Smith. It certainly helps the film because the two ultimately depend on each other for support.<br/><br/>Inspirational true stories such as this are sometimes over-dramatized by Hollywood, but not this one. It feels real and it doesn't go out of its way to take advantage of emotional moments."

","Will Smith's performance as striving single dad Chris Gardner doesn't panhandle for an Oscar in this quietly agonized drama of reaching and missing and reaching and missing again. This Reagan '80s drama takes place in the clearly marked dividing line between that romanticized American dream of ""making it"" and its realistic nightmare shadow. It's a fine film, with a portrait of fatherhood that is driven and real. The setting is San Francisco and it's based on a true story. Smith plays a man who once was a whip-smart kid but Chris never realized his potential having sunk his savings into a line of medical scanners that aren't selling. Chris is fraying at the seams.<br/><br/>His wife, Linda (the very hot Thandie Newton looking worn to the bone and in some scenes clearly channeling her break-out role in 1998's ""Beloved"" by repeating the same facial twitches and creepy neck movements associated with that title character) doesn't handle stress very well when Chris impulsively decides he'd rather be a stockbroker in a six-month internship at Dean Witter with no pay! Linda leaves with their child, but it's clear that Chris is the villain who instills misogynist fear in her to leave the boy with him even when Chris is jailed overnight for unpaid parking tickets! However, Chris is a charmer, and he never stops running -- to do so would be to admit defeat to his son -- but Smith nevertheless conveys the gradual erosion of a man's self-worth. Smith's got it easy since he's playing opposite his son (Jaden certainly looks comfortable hanging with his dad), but the understated beauty of the performance lies in how little attention Chris actually gives the kid. He's too busy worrying about Christopher to be with him.<br/><br/>The director Gabriele Muccino is the writer-director of the 2001 Italian art - house hit ""The Last Kiss,"" from which this year's substandard Zach Braff dreck-of-a-movie was extracted. There's a European sensibility to this movie: behavior here is observed rather than underlined and where another director might overplay the racial divide between Chris and his WASPy bosses at Dean Witter, Muccino and screenwriter Steven Conrad (""The Weather Man"") let it go.<br/><br/>""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a San Francisco movie with a specific sense of place and vibe from the daily homeless lines waiting for a nightly warm room Â… to the hush of a wealthy suburb on a weekend afternoon before a 49ers game. The film stays clear of Hollywood mucking -- a reminder of how close a person can dance to the pit and fall in, only to find out how heartbreakingly difficult it can be to clamber out. Smith's portrait of resilience and Muccino's clarity of heart are above par. The film title comes from a misspelled schoolhouse mural: If America is about the promise of bettering oneself, why does it have to be so freaking hard?"

","This was a breath of fresh air in a world where good movies are getting harder to find. The acting is subtle and superb - with all actors contributing positively without overacting (the director is to be applauded for this as well). This film effectively shows instead of tells - creating insightful reverberations. Some scenes will stay with you for a long time. <br/><br/>The directing and editing are spot-on. No special effects, but the reality is special. Nothing seems wasted here and the storyline is tight.

","""The Pursuit Of Happiness"" is a good based-on-true-story drama. It is the story of Chris Gardner struggling to make a living and literally pursuing happiness. Lead actor Will Smith gives a good performance. The movie succeeds because it never gets cheesy. I was afraid that the movie might be ruined by the last scene being cheesy but the scene is not cheesy at all, very well done. <br/><br/>*spoilers to come* ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is about the life of Chris Gardner, an intelligent and hard working man. Despite his intelligence he has to really fight himself through life. This is not a movie on poverty, it is a well-narrated biography but looking for answers to questions like ""What happens to people who are not as intelligent and persistent as Chris Gardner?"" / ""What happens with those who try hard and still fail? Are they unable to reach happiness?"" / ""Can poor people not be happy?"" leads you to disagree with part of the movie's premise.<br/><br/>""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is far from being a masterpiece. It is predictable, there are numerous differences between the movie and the real life of Chris Gardner, all of which can be considered to be in a way harmful to the movie's authenticity and, as mentioned before, the concept of happiness represented in the movie might be a bit too simple. These are the negative points one can find. On the other hand you will find many, many positive points, such as the performances of the actors (Will Smith in particular) and the good storytelling, that ultimately outweigh the weak points.<br/><br/>Gripping, moving, inspiring drama. A good film...no more no less.<br/><br/>*** 7/10 ****"

","Having seen so much violence and drudgery and sadism in 2006, what a refreshing experience is THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. Will Smith and his son Jaden give tremendous performances, and the story is involving and gripping all the way through.<br/><br/>Based on real events, the journey from failure and poverty to possible success and redemption is a harried but rewarding one. You can really feel for the father who wants to do right by his son, and who also needs to prove his worth to himself. <br/><br/>Life can be hard - yet there is the hope that hard work and perseverance will pay off.

"BJBatimdb","5","0","0","22 January 2007"," Over-long and under-interesting
","This isn't a bad film but it sure is a long one - or at least it feels that way. While the story of Chris Gardner is admirable and inspirational to a point (see below!), the film crawls along at a snail's pace, with the score only underlining the rather repetitive nature of Chris's trials and tribulations. The movie could have done with some serious cutting back to increase the pace a little, and would still have had nice characterisation and strong performances at its heart. So much angst is piled upon this poor guy that it almost becomes comical, and I had to remember my own sense of decency not to snort out loud in the cinema. Will Smith is always very watchable and delivers a really great performance as the dad trying to make a better life for himself and his son. HOWEVER - although I know it is 'inspired by a true story' - for me the character lost some sympathy because when his wife left him with a five-year-old to take care of, he still took a six-month UNPAID internship in the hope of getting a great job, thus putting his son through some real hardship and trauma. With a child involved then, frankly, he should've been getting a job as a waiter or something, not trying to be a stockbroker. I mean, if he hadn't succeeded in the end, then the movie would be about an evil, selfish dad who wouldn't knuckle down and accept the responsibility of caring for his child properly. I know this is not strictly a criticism of the movie, but it bugged me throughout, and probably affected my opinion of the film itself, because it's like glorifying a fantasist who spends money in expectation of winning the lottery. Anyway, I'm obviously in the minority, judging by the IMDb score, but for me this movie wouldn't have been worth paying to see without Will Smith."

","As someone with a very strong relationship with his father, I feel this truly captured the relationship between father and son in a way most movies fail to do. The last time this has been captured so well was in Big Fish (which I thought was the best film of 2003). This Will Smith's best film to date, and probably his best acting performance ever. I love its references to Thomas Jefferson, in a narration sequence I truly found fascinating. There are some scenes that made me feel as though I was on the brink of tears. It reminded me of why I want to be a father someday. This is one of the best movies of the year, and shame on IMDb for its meek 7.4."

","This movie truly reflects the struggle for survival that all face in our economy. The impact of Thomas Hobbes is clearly evident in the story. As noted by Hobbes in the Leviathan, ""the passions that incline men to peace are fear of death, desire of such things as are necessary to commodious living, and a hope by their industry to obtain them"". One would want to believe that Horatio Alger stories portray some level of reality. This film does a good job in providing a sense of hope that everyone has the industry to obtain happiness, if they are only determined enough to go to the end. It would be nice to have a prequel at some point where the young son in the movie can play Chris Gardner as he was growing up to see how he got his inspiration and desire to persevere."

Will Smith played the part of Chris Gardner brilliantly. His real-life son Jaden Smith was fantastic for such a young boy. All the characters were totally believable.

","If your think you have it bad, then you need to see this film. Having seen the story of the real Chris Gardener as played out during his visit to the Oprah Winfrey show last year, I finally got to see The Pursuit of Happiness last night. It was good and I mean very good. Honestly, the promos did it no justice. I haven't gotten around to seeing Will Smith (who plays Chris Gardener here) in Ali so forgive me if I call his performance in this film the crowning performance of his career. This will be hard to top in future roles.<br/><br/>In Pursuit, we meet Chris Gardener (as played by Will Smith) a man who is coming to terms with a bad business decision he made, while battling a nagging wife (played by a very twitchy Thandie Newton) and trying to make sure that his son (played by Smith's real life offspring Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) doesn't have the sort of childhood that he had. Slowly but surely, things begin to fall even more apart when his wife abandons him, his landlord evicts him and the IRS chomp down on his savings account for owed back taxes. Nevertheless, Gardener still manages turn his life around by switching professions, keeping his determination, finish up as a door-to-door salesman, all with his young son in tow as at this point he had become a single father.<br/><br/>tons of kudos to Smith Jr., for as a child he acted very well and broke some major hearts in the theatre. Not much can be said for Thandie Newton though, who plays the boys mother in the film. She was horribly miscast as the American woman she plays. I mean what was up with that nervous Druggie twitch? And that default weird southern accent she always seems to fall back on whenever she plays an American. Come on now Thandie, get creative! The soundtrack was great as were the co-stars. A splendid film indeed."

","Nobody could deny this story is heartwarming and deep; it's only too tear jerking, too much looking, feeling and sounding like a Hallmark card. It gets to generate some pathos - on the other hand Gabriele Muccino is one of the best Italian directors - but drifting too much into melodrama. It certainly works, giving a wonderful portrait of fatherhood as well as an authentic manner of dealing with father/son relation. Smith, along with his child, succeeds in delivering an emotional performance, real and believable; someone said ""The pursuit of happiness"" is a nice - but not wonderful - fairy tale in a realistic way and I might agree on this opinion."

","It seldom happens that I walk out after seeing a film, inspired by the characters, their tenacity and courage. However once the lights come on after this one, I felt this great power inside of me to make a change. Sometimes we don't really appreciate how lucky some of us everyday that we have a place to sleep, eat and a family to turn to.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner was able to make to most of his opportunities and never give up even in the face of losing everything. This man, was not a genius, born with some incredible gift. He is like any one of us. Striving to make the best of himself, giving it a go and always knowing that anything is possible if you try.<br/><br/>The film, aptly directed by Gabriele Muccino brazenly tells the story of Chris and his son trying to make a living in the world. Chris is finding it increasingly difficult to pay the rent add to that the costs of childcare and ensuring his son has a good education. His wife (ferocious and heartbreaking played by Thandie Newton) has little strength and hope left in her and has given up hope completely. Despite this, Chris marches on and into a job at Dean Witter. He's a bright guy and applies himself diligently and earnestly. He uses every opportunity he gets to accomplish is goals, practically doing what needs to be done all while keeping his head afloat from poverty. Most of all, he never backs out when things get tough. By example, he teaches us some heartfelt and reliable rules about life.<br/><br/>I thought it a little strange that an Italian would direct a film starring a black American about the hardships of living in suburban U.S. However when you watch the film, you realise it could be taking place anywhere in the world. This is a story about the steadfastness of a man trying to cope in a system that has abandoned him, where hope is scarce and precious. It is a story of hope, anywhere in the world. Add the shimmering luscious score by Andrea Guerra, I did feel some resemblance towards the films Il Postino and Cinema Paradiso, but this film never shies away from harsh realities and avoids sentimentalism abundant in those films.<br/><br/>1980s San Fransisco and the bay is beautifully showcased by the shimmering waters and azure sky, set against the rolling hills and eclectic mix of Victorian and modern architecture. Seeing the city made me revisit some picturesque scenes in Vertigo where Jimmy Stewart is cruising around on the tail of his mysterious Carlotta.<br/><br/>As many reviewers have already noted, the story never panders to blame, pity or politics. What is more inspiring is that Gardner never uses these excuses to stop him from doing what needs to be done. He always carries himself with confidence, integrity, a smile and fighting spirit.<br/><br/>While some people may take the simplistic view that money is the be all and end all to happiness, the truth is that in order to live and sustain oneself in a developed society one must play be the rules of work to live. It is also necessary to understand that capitalism is necessary to sustain a wealthy economy. This film shows us the darker side of such a society but how each person can still make their dream if they work hard and have hope.<br/><br/>I was deeply affected by the courage of Smith. He has wonderfully evolved since his early days as the skinny homeboy in Fresh Prince proving his versatility and maturity and the transformation is impressive. His character was tremendously brave, bold and inspiring. The qualities that made him a good person, good father were the same ones that told him never to give up. The chemistry with his son was tangible, raw and wondrous. Both of them deserve Academy awards nominations next week. They serve a testament to anyone who needs a chance in life just to live.<br/><br/>I loved that quote that Gardner bestowed to his son when it seemed there was little hope in sight. It basically summed what he was trying to achieve in the film. But it was so simple and true that we should all apply it everyday - ""You want something? Go get it. Period."" I'm not an emotional person, but by the end I was cheering like no other AND had tears in my eyes. Truly inspiring."
"swooshmeister","Null","0","0","16 January 2007"," Great movie about the power of hard work and about family!
","In many ways, The Pursuit of Happiness is a movie about hard work and its rewards, but it also bears many similarities to another great film, Life is Beautiful. Both movies feature fathers protecting their children from heartbreaking circumstances through love and imagination. One scene in particular - where Will Smith convinces his child that they have traveled into dinosaur times in order to make sleeping in a public bathroom (""cave"") seem less traumatic - reminded me vividly of Life is Beautiful. <br/><br/>The movie, besides being about the value of hard work and the love between parent and child, is a grim look at poverty in America. Chris lives in the ever-growing San Francisco during the 1980s, and the amount of poverty and homelessness he probably over looked previously becomes painfully obvious to him once he himself is homeless. It is my sincerehope that many middle and upper class Americans will have their eyes opened to what poor people are going through today in our own country.<br/><br/>The last thing I have to say about this movie is concerning Will Smith and his amazing acting - Will Smith, previously seen to me only as the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, has now earned my respect for him as an actor. His emotional projection of the inner pains and struggles of Chris Gardner is nothing short of heartbreaking, and it is not only because of his struggles, but because of how much we've come to love the character himself, that we become so emotional during the last 5 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this was an amazing film and I think everyone without a good understanding of homelessness should see it, as well as anyone looking for an emotionally grueling, but ultimately uplifting, experience."

If this movie doesn't get at least 4 awards, it is being robbed. Will Smith is a truly great actor and isn't credited for it as much as he should be. This just proves how versatile he is (eventhough there was the odd bit of humour which was straight from Will's repertoire) The ending was exactly what was needed after the constant struggle of survival throughout the film. One of the best films i've ever seen! I can't say enough good things about it, and i'm sure other people who've seen it will agree with my comments. I had no idea that the real Chris Gardner walks passed Will Smith and his son at the end.

","It was strange seeing Will Smith playing a serious role. And his son Jaden can act. He looks just like Jada. Thandie did great in this movie. There are things in this movie that were unrealistic. Most of the time when a woman leaves a man, she takes the child. But there was one thing that was realistic. When the shelter rejected Chris and his son because he was a man was realistic. Society helps women with children but not men with children. Will Smith must have been on a track team in high school. I was about to have an asthma attack just by watching him do all that running around in the movie. Were there really so many homeless people in San Francisco that they had to fight for a space in the shelter each day? There were some things that should have been added to the movie.

The battles in this film really make you think, raising a child, (Jaden Smith) with no fixed abode having to stay up excruciating hours in order to achieve what he wanted.<br/><br/>Will Smith although I don't think he'll get the Oscar (just my opinion) certainly deserves it, he is a talented man (except his rapping) and a very good actor it seems when challenged. The scene where he is in the bathroom (on the trailer) is extremely moving, and the scene leading up to it is also very touching. His acting towards the end is nothing short of superb, the office scene at the end when he is holding back the tears is up there with some of the most powerful acting I have seen, that 1 minute scene will stay with me and hopefully inspire me. Will Smith & Jaden work superbly on screen, obviously it helps being farther and son, but there is a real on screen connection. Jaden Smith is brilliant and looks like a potential star, I would even say possible Oscar nomination for this (or am I being a little too giving?) but he has a presence and delivers some superb lines. He looks an all round good kid (obviously this is a movie) and I hope Hollywood doesn't install and arrogance.<br/><br/>The movie is so moving, my only complaint would be I always felt like something was going to happen, a twist, but it didn't. Obviously this is about a real mans life so that would be unfair, but the way the story moved it felt like something was around the corner. Either way I was going to give this a 10, who knows I might come the end of this mini review but as it stand think a 9 is more appropriate.<br/><br/>To sum up the film, Truly brilliant acting, Will & Jaden Smith should be applauded and no one can doubt Will Smiths ability after this, and even Thandie Newton delivered. Superb storyline, with humour and heart wrenching scenes (women take a Kleenex), and overall all at totally inspiring film, if this film doesn't make you want to achieve all you can then no other movie will in my opinion.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","I liked this film and it was both an inspiration to overcome my own obstacles and to be frustrated and frightened by them.<br/><br/>I found an interesting similarity between this film and last years movie ""Cinderella Man"". Both films showed a man who had a great love for his offspring and an unrealized or overlooked talent (in one case boxing, in the other case math). And both main characters had a wife who did not share her husband's dream. In the case of Cinderella Man the wife wanted him to quit his dream and get a job at the docks, bust she stuck with him when he stuck to his dream. In the case of ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" the man's wife not only didn't share his dream but she eventually lost all faith and hope in him and left. But in both cases the role of the woman was as an obstacle or a force pushing in a direction away from a great man's goal.<br/><br/>I will site two other films with similar female roles: ""Houdini"" with Tony Curtis, and ""Mountains of the Moon"" about the life of the explorer Richard Burton. In both films the women stood in the way and failed to see the genius in their husband's calling.<br/><br/>So, my point is in the observation that the role of women in certain films is contrived to be an obstacle in way of a great man's purpose. And I believe that this is a concoction on the part of the movie makers to create drama at the expense of feminism. And, because I have a daughter I am sensitive to this false assumption. I want her to be great and I want her to support great people. But the media is so strong an influence and a role model in our lives that these powerfully negative views of women as shallow homebodies and vision less turncoats is terrible. In real life women see potential as well as men.<br/><br/>So, for men this film was inspiring. But for woman it was belittling."
"jaredmobarak","7","0","0","13 January 2007"," He must have had on some really nice pantsThe Pursuit of Happiness
","The genre of uplifting, against all odds type stories is probably the second most common behind the against all odds sports tale. Every once in awhile one will come out that just blows the other away, however, they are mostly all just carbon copies of each other. These types of films have a built in formula of acts to keep the audience emotionally attached. You see the happiness taken away, you see the trials and tribulations and failures along the way, and finally you see your protagonist redeemed. I hoped that The Pursuit of Happiness would strive above these preconceptions and become something more than its type. Unfortunately, besides the heartbreaking performances from Will and Jaden Smith, this film really just recycles all the genres' attributes and fills in the blanks with the details of Chris Gardner's life.<br/><br/>Gardner is a very intelligent and ambitious man. He saw an opportunity to make some money for his wife and son, but didn't see the results of his investing in machines, that although state-of-the-art, were luxuries his clientele didn't see benefits in paying for. With all his money tied up in his machines, he never had the chance to find a career, as he needed to sell his products just to recoup the finances he used to pay for them. Finally, a job opportunity arises that would lend itself greatly to his high aptitude of mathematics. He sees a chance to make a living for his family so that they will no longer have to live paycheck to paycheck, but the decision itself would throw his world upside down. His wife can't handle taking another chance at something that may ultimately fail and leaves him, Gardner finds his internship is full-time without pay, the IRS is after them for back taxes, and they find themselves on the street without anyplace to live. The one thing that could turn his life around comes at the price of having just a one in twenty chance at getting out of the worst squalor his life has seen. Homeless and broke, he has no other choice.<br/><br/>I don't know if it was the knowledge of this type of movie, that everything will work out, or the fact that our hero does many unsavory things along his journey, but I just couldn't quite be taken over by the story. You see his life falling apart all around him, but you know that everything will turn out right; you just wait and see to find out how. Sure that journey is a good ride and interesting to watch, it just doesn't resonate as much when you know that no matter how bad it gets, it won't get THAT bad. Unfortunately that fact is inherent in all these types of films, and you need something else to invest in. With Happiness, that something else are the wonderful performances. All the supporting players are fantastic, especially small roles like that of Kevin West's time machine obsessed crazy, and Thandie Newton's heartbreaking wife. Newton is just made up of pain and sorrow throughout, trying her best to believe in her husband. The stress is too much, and she is wonderful at showing every moment of hardship. Although you don't like the way she leaves, you have to almost understand her reasons. Also, young Jaden Smith is a natural on screen. Sure that could be a result of being so young and just reacting rather than acting, (especially having his real father to play off of), but either way it is a brilliant job. His innocence and lack of complete knowledge in what is happening to his life is some emotionally wrenching stuff. <br/><br/>The real leader of the film, though, is Will Smith. He has been a fantastic actor for many years, and it is a joy to see him finally play a role, which allows him to show his skill. Sure we all love the action/comedy fare, but not since Ali have we seen what a professional he is. This is probably the best performance of his career thus far that I've seen and he deserves all the accolades being thrown his way. No matter how well he did though, I believe the character itself leaves a bit to be desired. In order to get where he is, he does a lot of lying, some stealing, (I mean he stays at these places until they throw him out; they will never see any money for the months they trusted him in), and some harsh reacting to characters he interacts with. For every moment Gardner really excels and shows the natural charisma and skill, which will land him a career, there is an instance that you look and feel he could have handled it much differently and better. There is also a lot of luck involved along the way, as every machine he loses miraculously is found, to the point he can run after someone and take it back to stay afloat financially for one more day. I wonder how much of the contrived moments necessary to keep him alive actually happened to the real Chris Gardner and how many were created for the story to advance cinematically."

This afternoon my girl friend persuaded me to see Pursuit, etc. We both squirmed throughout, and by throughout I mean it passed my tipping point - the point at which the shear length of a film makes itself known by the the descent of the plot into one painful episode to another, all the while leaving the viewer with certain knowledge that whatever happens, ""all's well that ends well"". This is an inspiring story told in the most predictable way imaginable. At least Hitch had interesting characters that propelled the plot. This has none of that. As for acting, there is no stretch for Mr. Smith or - and especially - his son. I look forward to his next project - with my girlfriend's apology.<br/><br/>Fljack."
"dfcurran","1","9","35","19 December 2006"," The most depressing movie (not the worst the most depressing) I have ever seen
","Subtitle: a little knowledge about real-life relationships can ruin this movie for you. 1. The kid may be one of the best child actors I've ever seen. 2. Will Smith may deserve an Oscar for this but he was too likable and the character he played had to be a mean despicable SOB. (I have a masters in interpersonal communication with emphasis on male/female relationships, specializing in the effect of parental conflict during divorce on children. that said:) This isn't in any way an uplifting movie unless your god is money! Pursuit starts out with Will's wife hating him--the reason unclear. Instead of trying to save the relationship he tries to earn more money. When she finally decides to leave he tells her he is taking their son. Any normal woman would fight for her son. This woman is obviously so terrified of Will Smiths character she does not--though this is underplayed. (She even brings the kid back after escaping with him for awhile.) Will Smith's character never even considers how this separation from his mother will affect the boy. I actually cringed when he rushed to the day care place and stole the kid so the mom couldn't pick him up. I could believe it, but could not forgive when Will's character l tells the boy, ""Your mother left you."" When the truth was Will's character drove the mother away. The fact that these problems in the relationships are visible signify great movie making. The movie is still horribly depressing and my major problem is that the blurb is ""uplifting."" when in reality it is depressing."

","The first 5 minutes tells us ""hippies are bad, thieves"" and ""Chinese are unsanitary and not responsible for minding children"", but Stock Brokers are great and flashy cars are even greater! Like greed is equal to some sort of morality we should aspire towards. This movie was made in 2006, before the crash, before the record level of suicides caused by those who so heavily invested on the backs of the poor, hard working and repressed. The answer here is for us all to aspire to be equally selfish pigs. <br/><br/>Just make sure that your drive to hate hippies and Chinese is as high as your selfish piggery, and you might be willing to force your child to sleep on a toilet floor rather than move town, or be tempted to make a movie that makes people willing to change the system out to be the 'hero' instead.

","I will watch almost anything Will Smith is in, but I felt let down by this movie. The local reviewer, who watches 150 movies a year, gave it a B+, but I give it a C. I seldom disagree with my local reviewer, but I do here.<br/><br/>Smith is good, but, believe it or not, maybe his pair of ""Bad Boys"" with Martin Lawrence were far better. His son, Jaden, plays his son in the movie, and he does an excellent job for a child actor. It helps, I guess, having two parents who are accomplished actors.<br/><br/>The audience, largely African-American, applauded the outcome of the man struggling to survive a time with no income as a single parent to his five year old son, which is no spoiler because all the reviews talk about it. I didn't, maybe because we all knew he would prevail if we read any reviews at all, and it is ""inspired by a true story."" I was expecting more. My local review said it would pull at the heart strings of men who relive or longed for such a relationship with their father. While reading the review, in my mind I was thinking ""Field of Dreams."" But no. I felt manipulated when it was over. Sorry, Will, but you were good. Not necessarily Oscar material, as the local reviewer said, unless the stars of Oscar politics point to you."

","The story of one man's struggle and pursuit of happiness in the face of economic adversity is never more compelling than that of Chris Gardner.

","When I went to see this movie, for the first time in my life, it was better than I expected. Will Smith and his real son do an excellent job in this movie portraying Chris Gardner and Christopher.

Linda, Christopher's mom, walks out on them, leaving Chris to make sure his son and him stay in a comfortable state while Chris is trying to get a job as a stockbroker.

"antoniatejedabarros","10","1","2","12 September 2016"," A beautiful & touching movie about hope, love, survival, fatherhood, and dreams, with a breathtaking performance by Will Smith
","Chris (Will Smith): ""Don't ever let somebody tell you you can't do something. Not even me. All right?"" Christopher (Jaden Smith): ""All right"".<br/><br/>Chris: ""You got a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do somethin' themselves, they wanna tell you you can't do it. If you want somethin', go get it. Period"".<br/><br/>I have to confess that I have a big crush on Will Smith, an actor and rapper who I find super sexy, nice, funny, and cool. I've recently bought many of his movies and albums. I am only now discovering, together with my kids, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air (Yes, I didn't watch it in the 90s!). So, I bought this movie just because Will is in it. And I was blown away by the movie. The Pursuit of Happiness (yes, with a ""Y"": that's because of a misspelled graffiti on the wall of Christopher's depressing day-care) is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The film is touching, surprising, sad and funny. The Pursuit of Happiness will break your heart and will make you value what you have. But this is not a depressing movie. It is a movie about hope, love, survival, fatherhood, and about never giving up your dreams.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness is based on a true story: the story of Chris Gardner and his struggle for a decent life while keeping his son next to him at all times. The real Chris Gardner was present throughout the shooting and discussed several things with Will and director Gabriele Muccino.<br/><br/>Will Smith was nominated for an Oscar for his breathtaking performance of Chris Gardner. That's definitely one of the best performances of Will's career (if not the best), together with his stunning portrayals of Muhammad Ali in Ali (2001) and Dr. Bennet Omalu in Concussion (2015).<br/><br/>Chris Gardner first thought that Will was miscast to play him, but his daughter Jacintha told him: ""If Smith can play Muhammad Ali, he can play you!"".<br/><br/>Jaden Smith's performance is also amazing. He wasn't cast in the film right away. Director Gabriele Muccino saw some 250 kids and he said that they were all cute and fine. The problem was that Muccino wasn't looking for a cute and fine little boy, but for a little boy who could be real. After a week, Muccino asked Will if his son Jaden could read for him, and, when he did, Muccino was amazed. The love that father and son have for each other in real life can be definitely felt in the movie. Jaden, who portrays a 5 year old Christopher, was 8 years old when the movie was shot and released. The real Christopher (Chris Gardner's son), however, was just a baby at the time of the real events.<br/><br/>The best: Will's brilliant performance, the toilet scene, Will's running, Jaden's fresh performance, and the board room scene towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The worst: nothing. / Antonia Tejeda Barros (Madrid, Spain)"

","You got a dream?You gotta protect it.People can't do something themselves they wanna tell you you can't do it.If you want something go get it. -Chris Gardner<br/><br/>My experience with this particular movie was a heart-rending one.I decided to watch this with my mother after her recommendation and it turned out to be an emotional roller coaster.The movie is about this man named Chris Gardner who is trying to make ends meet by selling a bone density scanner.However, things are getting harder and harder for his family as it's been a long time since he last sold one.We basically follow his life as he strives to both achieve his dream and stay afloat. <br/><br/>what really surprised me was how much I cared for these characters and how emotionally attached I was to them.I would never expect to feel this man so close to my heart and cheer for him throughout the film.After a certain point,I always had to wipe the tears off my eyes while hugging my pillow and being depressed.The soundtrack was not as good as I hoped it would be,given the fact that when a sad scene was coming up they would play a groovy kind of happy song?.. I don't know maybe that is just me.Still,it turned out to be a masterpiece and the best kind of motivation with the messages it was trying to convey to the viewers.To make a long story short, it stresses the importance of pursuing your dream,it makes you think about the meaning and the perception of what happiness really is and leaves you feeling stunned of how conceptual it was.I also loved the relationship between him and his son because it felt really balanced with its ups and downs.I would recommend this to pretty much anyone especially young people like me because you will definitely be inspired to work your way to your goal."

","This story will touch you, if you like a good drama. I can guarantee it. Will play Chris Gardner, a poor and unsuccessful guy in San Francisco. His wife leaves him and he is alone with his son Christopher. He decides to be a stockbroker. He must go through a demanding course, where only one of the participants will be offered the job. Meanwhile, he must cope with a steadily deteriorating cash situation that could lead to him and his son are homeless. The story is based on a real story. This is a heartfelt story about holding on to your dreams and never ever give up. Life is what you make it. Whatever problems life throws in his face, he gets up and does not give up. It's hard not to feel sympathy for Chris, well played by Will Smith. One of his best performances in a film. He should do more of these kinds of films, instead of wasting his talent in films like After Earth. What is happiness? In this film, it is intended that happiness is money and a well paid job. But I think this gripping film is really about courage and not let go of the dream of a better life. This is one of my favorite movies, for great performances for Smith Jr. and Snr., great storytelling and it has a strong, important message. A film you can watch several times, alone or with friends.

"Searsino","9","1","2","10 March 2016"," OUTSTANDING Performance by Will Smith
","There are very few films that have ever actually made me choke up just ever so slightly, but The Pursuit of Happiness not only did just that... but as the film was drawing to an end no less! This biographical piece on the struggles of Chris Gardner is extremely well done. <br/><br/>Chris is an African American father trying to survive in a hopeless America. Also a mathematical prodigy with an unbelievable work ethic, he seemingly does not stop until a task has been completed in its entirety.<br/><br/>Chris has the misfortune of making a very bad investment with his life savings shortly after acquiring a new home and starting a family. The financial burden and all the weight that accompanies it prove too much for his (x-)wife, and inevitably would have him and his son living on the streets. <br/><br/>The film shows us how one mans remarkable efforts, after being placed in a very crude situation, manages to break all kinds of social/financial barriers in order to obtain a suitable living arrangement for both him and his 5 year old son.<br/><br/>As I mentioned at the top, as everything came masterfully to one last crescendo, I was choking up, almost as if I could feel the ""happyness"" that Chris so desperately, tirelessly pursued. And having been through quite a lot of filmography, this is a sign for me that a story was told perfectly.<br/><br/>It has always felt like Will Smith never quite gets the attention he deserves for the numerous high-quality performances on his resume. And to be so convincing... able to draw strong feeling from the audience, with the son played by HIS ACTUAL child no less!<br/><br/>I will continue to watch anything Smith is a part of as there can be no argument made for his being top-tier acting talent in the business. Don't miss the opportunity to see this... seriously, you will regret missing out on such a powerful film.<br/><br/>OH! And do yourselves a favor and hang in there until the VERY END.... the REAL Chris Gardner can be seen in full view walking past Smith & his son (the man wearing a black suit). There was something about only just having viewed such an unbelievable story, with getting to see the ACTUAL person who went through this, that made this a perfect ending. ...or perhaps it was the curious look that Smith gives as he turns his head back as if to indicate to the audience who the man was that just walked by.<br/><br/>----- 9/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----"
"lesleyharris30","8","1","2","16 February 2016"," Well Acted, Emotional Drama,
","The Pursuit of Happiness is a terrific movie with a well developed storyline and a very talented cast. It's an inspiring true story about a salesman who went through real struggles in order to care for his son and make it in business, it's sweet, emotional and hard to watch at times as we see just how much this man had fallen, we are taking in almost immediately, supporting him all the way through. I would have liked to see more scenes between Chris and Linda, their relationship could have been developed much more before she leaves as her intentions were a bit unclear because of just how little Linda was actually in it, as well as that, Will Smith and Thandie Newton played off each other very well and it would have been great to have more of that. Will Smith's performance in this movie is outstanding and easily one of the greatest in his career, he loses the charming, macho persona he normally has to play a humble, down to earth man, and it really felt Smith was more comfortable in this role than any other, that he could really relate to this man. The relationship between the father and son is beautiful, undeniably sweet, it certainly helped that Smith got his real life son, Jaden Smith, as you could feel the genuine love between them. Emotional, dramatic and inspiring, I would recommend the Pursuit of Happiness to anyone looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>A single father struggles to raise his son while working as a salesman. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Will Smith"
"vip-danii","10","1","2","12 September 2015"," Great Acting!
","I gave this movie 10/10 based solely on the acting. I though all the actors were exceptional - especially little Jayden (whose talent, sadly, seems to have evaporated now that's he's a young adult). And Thandie Newton, whom I used to regard as a well-below-average actress, was absolutely marvellous in this (though her character was severely under-developed). Will Smith was semi-believable for one -- playing an actual character (as opposed to just being Will Smith, like in most of his movies).<br/><br/>As for the movie itself... well, it's a somewhat touching story, and the lead character is likable and charismatic enough to make you want to root for him, but, lets face it, - the story is over-dramatized. It is highly unlikely that something like that would happen in real life.<br/><br/>There were several things that weren't explained properly. For example, - why continue renting a two-story house if you're 3 months behind with the rent already? What's wrong with getting an apartment, or even a room in a house with shared facilities, for example? Thousands of families in the US live in conditions that are much worse than Chris's, and many of them are single parents -- some with several children.<br/><br/>Why continue selling something that you can clearly see does not sell? What's wrong with getting a job -- any job? At a supermarket, warehouse, or even as a janitor or something; at this point, for Chris, any income would've been better than no income at all.<br/><br/>How come someone as smart as Chris ended up in these circumstances to begin with? Plus, I did have a problem with the message of this movie, which clearly is: ""money equates happiness"". Chris's idealization of the wealthy (and his trying to get next to them by sucking up) was a bit disturbing, actually.<br/><br/>Well, the message could also be interpreted differently, of course -- ""shoot for the stars, be the best you can be, don't settle for less, etc."", but I didn't really see it that way. Why couldn't he just get a regular job, or even try and start his own *legitimate* business? All that energy spent on trying to sell those useless devices... surely, with his smarts and charisma, he could get any other job or do well as a business-man.<br/><br/>But stock broker? It is not exactly something I would call a profession, and it's certainly not something one would refer to as ""honest"" or ""hard"" work -- not sure what reason, other than the obvious one (i.e. money), one could possibly have to aspire to work in a boiler room, making money by ripping off others...<br/><br/>Given these arguments, you start to question the integrity and likability of the protagonist. And also - the climax was somewhat disappointing.<br/><br/>But anyway... it's definitely an entertaining movie, well-worth seeing. And, like I said, the acting is impeccable."
"sandnair87","10","1","2","4 May 2015"," Will Smith's Pursuit of Happ'y'ness will make Your Cockles Feel Plenty Warm!
","Directed by Gabriele Muccino, the intentionally misspelt The Pursuit of Happiness opens in 1981 as we meet Chris Gardner (Will Smith) barely holding on to normal life as a husband, father and seller of bone-density scanners that few doctors need and fewer can afford. We see from the get-go his devotion to his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and his shoe-leather perseverance with the scanners; we also see his nit-picking, wife Linda (Thandie Newton), who hangs around just long enough to abandon him for a better life back East. Chris copes as best he can: trying to make the rent, failing to make the rent, moving into a motel, trying and failing to make the rent there.<br/><br/>A glimpse of hotshot stockbrokers driving hotshot wheels sparks dreams of capitalist glory that Chris pursues despite every conceivable setback. He schmoozes the suits at Dean Witter with his forthrightness and flair for Rubik's Cube. Chris finally wangles himself a six- month internship as a stockbroker, with a long-shot chance for a job at the end. The catch is that there's no pay. Now he's a solo parent, and his son misses mom and the apartment Chris couldn't pay for, and none of the chirpy suits at Dean Witter realize that brisk, affable Chris is scraping by on nerve and small change. We see him rear his son with a nurturing, steadfast love that sustains them both when they've hit bottom on a bed of toilet paper, even enlisting his son's ingenuous imagination to patch their spirits together. Chris is acting on all fronts - cheerfully boosting his son's morale, while pretending nonchalance with his colleagues.<br/><br/>In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats and missed opportunities, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. The film is tied together by director Gabriele Muccino's adept direction, which keeps proceedings substantial but never melodramatic as he juggles the disparate story elements with more than enough dexterity. Will Smith gives a selfless performance as Chris Gardner, as he conveys the gradual erosion of a man's self- worth. An actor with almost quantifiable likability, he relinquishes his 'actor-ly' vanity and creates a real, complicated and not always sympathetic figure. He plays Gardener with such wry, resigned matter-of-factness that you can't help but root for him. Unsurprisingly, he has a natural on-screen rapport with Jaden, who is himself absolutely endearing in his role, and their powerful father- son bond is genuinely moving. <br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness is a go-for-the-gold heart-warmer affirming that anyone can pull himself up by the bootstraps and make something of himself. It's an earnest, modest, heartfelt little ode to paternal love that will warm the cockles of our hearts, and even a recalcitrant Scrooge may sniff back a few salty droplets."

This film deserves more attention and more prizes. Jaden Smith is also playing a huge and difficult roll in the movie, and in my opinion is the best acting he ever had in his movies so far, even tho at a young age, playing such an important roll he did great.

"KendrickHew","10","1","2","20 May 2014"," The pursuit of happiness is the most realistic film about the struggle of being successful.
","Will Smith had an outstanding performance being a struggling father to support his child and his family. The challenges he faced to become successful was the peak of the movie displaying his attitude to work beyond the average human. By calculating how much time it takes to go to the bathroom and how long a water break would take, he managed to cut down on both of those because he knew that if he didn't have a water break he wouldn't need to go to the bathroom. Alternatively, another brilliant aspect of this film is how much heart he puts into doing something. When the people he meets turned down his machine that he made, he didn't give up, he continued to search for more people to invest in his product. Even though that lead to his wife leaving him, he still had a son to take care of and he didn't stop looking for ways and opportunities to continue to feed his family. Overall, I had given a rating of 10 out of 10 because the struggle of life is never as easy as it seems therefore the movie had portrayed the most realistic endeavor a human being could have."

","Pursuit of happiness made me cry relentlessly. Because at the time I watched this movie, that was about 3/4 years ago, my situation was very close to that of Chris Gardner. I managed little by little to get out of this hardship since then, things are still so tough out there but anyway this is not the subject. 2 scenes particularly moved me to tears, I don't want to spoil so will not tell but man, how I felt the pain and frustration for Chris and his son! Having lived something near similar, I related so much to the main character. This is a movie about poverty, fight, love, determination. I'm glad they make movies like this, movies that show the truth of life, the reality of what perhaps millions of people endure every single day, at this very moment I'm writing this review: the lack of common basic human resources that allow one to keep going, a minimum of food and shelter for the night! The problem is that even after seeing this movie, those who can rescue the most destitutes may or may not bother doing it. I give the movie a 10/10!"

Director Gabriele Muccino knows how to execute an an inspiring story that deserved to be put on the big screen. Also Will Smith gives the best performance of his career for his brilliant work in the movie.In which it has a great supporting cast such as his son Jaden Smith,and Thandie Newton (who plays as Smith's overworked wife in which they end up getting divorced).I truly think that Will Smith really deserved an Oscar nomination for his brilliant work (as he does in his other movies.). Also the movie is historically accurate in which the movie compares to such inspiring stories such as Remember the Titans,Rocky,Malcolm X etc. This is a perfect movie for the whole family to watch but put aside the language and it's PG-13 rating and just appreciate the movie for what it is a true monumental masterpiece."

","Based on a true story, Will Smith stars as Chris Gardner, an investor hoping to make profits in a device called the ""Bone Density Scanner."" But, he has not been making much money out of it, resulting in his wife leaving him and his kid, and him losing his house and finances. He is forced to live out in the streets with his son, and his hopes pins on his internship at a stock company. Gardner has to go through six months of training and to sell his devices before he can be a paid stockbroker.<br/><br/>A solid drama with some descent acting, this movie tells a great rags-to-riches story, where a person could start out with nothing and work his way to the top. It gives an important message that everybody in America has the opportunity to pursue happiness, and it is up to that person how he/she plans to pursue it; nothing should be handed on a silver plate. Smith did great depicting this in his Gardner role.<br/><br/>There are some powerful, yet disturbing scenes of him going through hard times, like the scene where Gardner and his son had to spend the night in a public restroom, and when they were thrown out of their rented motel. Yet, Gardner's perseverance in earning that career despite hard times makes this an inspiring story. A highly recommended movie.<br/><br/>Grade A"
"Nzkiwigirl95","8","1","2","27 September 2013"," The Ultimate Chase
","The Ultimate Chase: The Pursuit of Happiness<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness (2006) revolves around Chris Gardner (Will Smith), who quits his job and invests all his money into ""high tech"" bone density scanners. To make any profit he has to sell them to larger hospitals, most of which already own the machines. His wife leaves him several years later and he is left to raise his son on his own. After he is evicted from his house, he enters a program to train for a position in a stock broking company, but must go through six months of training without pay with only one intern out of twenty receiving the spot. Chris and his son live in a homeless shelter as he goes through training. <br/><br/>Director Gabriele Muccino generated a heartfelt cinematic piece based off a true story. He was able to portray the story of a struggling single father, trying to raise his son in the city. The movie reflects the reality of being a single parent and trying to provide for one's child, while dealing with the stress of competing in a new job market under the added and unforeseeable burden of living in a homeless shelter.<br/><br/>I find this movie fascinating and very touching. It is a rags to riches story, but one that required an extreme amount of sacrifice. Chris could have made it through the whole program and at the end lost the position to another contender or allowed his wife to take custody of his son, but he believed he was smart enough and desired it enough to receive the appointment, and in doing so illustrated his love for his son. He was not content to be homeless, he wanted more from life, and he was willing to chase after happiness and the ability to provide for his son. The movie was set in the early 2000s so costumes were not overly dramatic."

","It is really a hard life, and it is the struggling in this hard life makes this movie sense of tensity. Not everyone living in refuge fates to gloom for the whole life. The thing I saw from the film is a tough man, a responsible father and a clever working guy makes his every effort to survive. I kind of sympathize him at first, however after giving another thought, damn it, I was the man who should be sympathized. No matter how hard life he was suffering, how mess situation he experienced, what he is doing is nothing else but keeping going. He is really battling with the time and the life itself. What's more, he cannot only concern himself. Normal guys maybe have already go mad due to the hopeless life, but for Chris he can not lose hope, because he is the hope for his son.<br/><br/>The picture described how a man compete with his life, change his fate, and be a real admired man. He gets a little son, fortunately, the little man is not naughty at most time. What I want to say is, for most people who under pressure like him, they are probably irritable. Maybe some of them will give up the life the family even themselves. So it doesn't matter to say you even get a child to take care. Chris makes me memorise another father who gives his son happiness even they are on the edge of death everyday, it's really a great paternal love. Here is a little hint, the movie is made in 1997 Italy.<br/><br/>I think the emphasis of this movie is to cheer people up, maybe the director has already predicted the economic recession happening two years later. It's really helpful to hopeless people, to pessimistic individuals to cheer them up. Telling them calm down and carry on."
"lboogie11","6","1","2","13 July 2013"," Man tries to overcome odds and bring up his son
","This film is very watchable, but has one major problem that makes it impossible for me to rate it highly. It's basically a copy of the classic Italian realism film from the 1950s, Bicycle Thieves. The plot is almost identical - just swap Will Smith's radiation machine for a bike and give it a modern reboot with some minor changes and you've got a box office hit on your hands. There is one major difference between the two films - one will do down as one of the greatest in cinematic history, while the other will soon be forgotten. One's McDonald's, the other is Mitchelin starred; one's a tear-jerker, the other's a heavyweight tragedy. The Pursuit of Happiness has the relationship between father and son at its heart. It's about the dad trying to hang on to some threads of dignity and maintaining a relationship with his son while faced with crippling poverty. But the film is painted on a small canvass that fails to really tell us anything worth holding on to about human existence. Whereas Bicycle Thieves is the true story - it shows how many of us live on the margins of society and how luck, good and bad, can decide the course of our lives. In telling us this it tells us so much. I'm unsure what Pursuit of Happiness left me with apart from some fake tears."

","First and foremost Will Smith is an amazing actor and also an amazing person. They couldn't have found a better person to play his role. This is such a powerful powerful piece.<br/><br/>This is based on a true story and it's so inspiring. Will Smith plays Chris Gardener and Will's son, Jaden Smith play's his son in the movie. I think what made this movie feel so real and made will at his best was that his son in the movie was really his son in reality. You could see the emotions and the character in Will's face. It was so sincere! This movie is about a man who would not give up! No matter what life threw at him, he came, he saw, and he conquered. He was homeless and that's difficult enough but being homeless with a child is way beyond. He does everything he can to make a little money and finally does the unthinkable.<br/><br/>This movie is an eye opener and will have you feeling good. Personally, one of the biggest reasons why I love this movie so much is because I was homeless and I had nothing at one point. I saw this movie before I was homeless and during my time of being on the streets I thought about Chris Gardner and how he made it from nothing to something. That helped pushed me to better myself and do something with my life. Like Chris Gardener I went from being poor to working and having a stable income. Unlike Chris I'm not even making nowhere close to what he's making haha.

","This movie is American, so American, even the title itself comes from Declaration of Independence of America. <br/><br/>A man lost his wife, lost his job, lost his house, had no place to live, stayed in a bathroom with his young boy at night. <br/><br/>If this happens to anyone in real life, he would feel hopeless, desperate, angry. <br/><br/>But viewers don't feel that way. <br/><br/>They don't, because they already knew, this story is about Chris Gardner, an Africa American, millionaire, he now has his own brokerage company, and he is the American dream. Just wait to the end, they will see the moment of an American dream realized. <br/><br/>Like many Hollywood movies emphasis, Chris Gardner is a REAL person, and the story is a REAL story! But does it make the whole idea of American dream real? How many Chris Gardner can you find in America? <br/><br/>The story itself was in 1980s, from 1980s to 2006, those were still the years of Wall Street. The movie was made in 2006, just before the financial meltdown. After the meltdown, it would be impossible to make such a movie. Today it will be too ironic to see that in the end, the answer to the 'pursuit of Happiness' is to become a stockbroker. I feel this is outrageous. Wall Street is the answer? They are not the answer; they are the very cause of our problems! <br/><br/>There are many nice things in the movie: Don't give up hope, Love your family, Work hard, all these ideas are fine, I have no problem with these ideas. The problem is the implications behind the whole movie: work hard, American dream will come, believe in love, God will help you, so that the best we can do is work and love and believe, then miracle will happen? Did anyone ask why, a sales man lost his job and what do we do about it? Did anyone ask, in order to make himself rich, what Chris Gardner would have to do? Even the things he do is legal, is it ethical? These are the real questions that this movie never want you to ask."

","I'm the furthest thing from a movie snob there is. A plot I've seen a hundred times before can still sway me emotionally. I'll even go a step further than that. I watched a 20 minute Tony Robins seminar just prior to watching this movie. I was primed, in the mood and was ready to be motivated and inspired some more. That's why I picked this one to watch based on the positive reviews here.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie was almost a complete flat-line of emotion all the way through. There was no display of motivational or inspirational growth here at all. This movie was simply a 115 minute display of tolerance for a world that provided no sympathy, followed by 2 minutes of hope and achievement.<br/><br/>I did, however, scramble as quickly as I could to do something cheerful after having watched it. So I suppose it did motivate me, in a way."
"ackstasis","8","1","2","24 November 2007"," ""You want something? Go get it. Period.""
","We've all seen this sort of story before: a poor man, through his unbreakable courage and determination, climbs the ranks of society to become the best that he can possibly be. The story's conclusion was never going to be in any doubt; we know that it is based on a true story, and nobody's interested in making a film about a failure. However, despite its familiarity, its predictability, its share of clichéd moments, something about 'The Pursuit of Happiness (2006)' really hooked me. We follow Chris Gardner through six turbulent months of his life, experiencing his ups and down, and we really to come to know and care about him. Better yet, we are told from the very beginning that the film is ""inspired"" by one man's true story. Though we realise that dramatic license has been taken in some regards, it really is stirring to know that the real Chris Gardner was faced with many of the seemingly-insurmountable challenges that we witness in this film, and yet he came out of his struggles a successful, independent and happy man.<br/><br/>I've always thought that Will Smith had a lot of potential as an actor, but he's never really had an opportunity to demonstrate his talents {he was Oscar-nominated for 'Ali (2001),' but I saw that film such a long time ago that I can't recall much about it}. In 'The Pursuit of Happiness,' he delivers an intelligent and sensitive performance, his character wonderfully understated, and Smith's chemistry with real-life son Jaden Christopher Syre Smith is genuinely touching. A rare change from his usual cocky and smart-mouthed persona, Will Smith's Chris Gardner is likable, thoughtful and surprisingly reserved, though his self-confidence and determination makes him a legitimate presence in any scene. Though he met with stiff competition in Forest Whitaker ('The Last King of Scotland (2006)'), Smith's second Oscar nomination was certainly well-deserved. Competent supporting performances come from Thandie Newton, Brian Howe, James Karen and Dan Castellaneta, though the real star of the film will always be the beautiful interactions between loving father and son.<br/><br/>'The Pursuit of Happiness' was directed by Italian director Gabriele Muccino in his first English-speaking film, and was written by Steve Conrad ('The Weather Man (2005)'). Technically, there is little notable about the film, but, emotionally, Gardner's story proves extremely powerful. This is the sort of film that really tugs at your heartstrings, allowing you to appreciate your current circumstances and to strive for those dreams that you had previously thought unachievable. In the film, we see that there are thousands of people in San Francisco living in poverty, and yet Chris Gardner seems to stands out among them all. Why is this? Is it just because Will Smith is such a star that even homelessness can't dampen his style, or is it because his character is a man going somewhere? At the moment, he doesn't any money, but his determination and will to succeed make him almost radiant amid the masses of pitiable derelicts. Admittedly, I'm still only working my way through the year, but 'The Pursuit of Happiness' has proved one of my favourites of 2006."

","I'd avoided this film because Will Smith, as an actor, did not impress me.<br/><br/>Well, I was wrong about Will Smith: in this story, he showed that he could produce the goods.<br/><br/>However, the story has been told so many times before: the down-and-nearly-out-hero who still manages to make it big against the odds, and with a young son in tow.<br/><br/>Ho-hum...<br/><br/>So, what's different (maybe the producer asked that question, too?)? Well, if the story is entirely true, Chris Gardner (Smith) got the door to wealth opened by solving the Rubick's Cube in front of his prospective employer, shortly after it came on the market in 1981. That's impressive: shows he could bring all his mental capacities into full force while under a lot of pressure. And, that was a well-done scene...<br/><br/>The other well-done scene is when Gardner succeeds in his quest for a job: the mixed expressions on his face are exquisite, even down to just the trace of a tear in his eyes as he shakes hands with his new bosses.<br/><br/>The rest of it is fairly pedestrian (no pun intended, as you will see) and predictable.<br/><br/>The big failing is this story is that it equates being happy with having a lot of money and shamelessly uses Jefferson's words from the Declaration of Independence as support. As the hero says to his son (Smith's real son): ""Go get it!"" <br/><br/>Granted, money is needed to survive in most societies. Beyond that, and even as our hero admits, being happy is a condition that we all want, but which none ever achieve, absolutely. I would simply add that only the truly insane can hope to be happy! And that's a thought that crossed my mind as our hero entered the broker pit for the first time...an aspect that was done to death in the bleak and very macho world of Wall Street (1987).<br/><br/>There are a few laughs, some tearjerker husband/wife scenes, and a bit about how the really destitute lived in San Franciso in the eighties.<br/><br/>Was it worth a couple of hours of my time? Nah... but you might like it."

","It was without doubt a good movie and more interesting than, say a comic book movie but also frustrating to watch. Its hard to watch sane healthy people who have no control over their lives. Of course it's an oppressive system we must live in which exploits our mistakes and misfortunes but a little thinking ahead can protect us from much of that. It seemed like his series of unfortunate events was compounded by his own poor decisions and irresponsibility. Also his own greed caused a lot of his problems. Why did he spend all of his savings on a bunch of bone scanners that he didn't know for certain he could sell? For the same reason people buy lottery tickets or blow all their money at casinos. I mean with those savings he could have made a significant down payment on a house and then got a regular job to pay the bills and meet his obligations to his wife and child. I found it hard to sympathize with this character who pursued wealth at the cost of his home and family. I thought he was a fool. Why didn't he pay his taxes? Why didn't he bother to check his last scanner after it had been in the possession of a crazy bum for several months before he showed it to a customer? Why did he get into the cab without enough money to pay the fare? Why did he get so many parking tickets? Were the police out to get him? Most intelligent people, after getting a few traffic tickets, learn how to keep from getting them. He admitted it was stupid to entrust a hippie with his bone scanner but then he turns around and devotes six months of his life to a few corporate suits, working like a slave without any certainty of any reward. And he claimed to be good with numbers? Trusting the hippie was far less stupid. But people who risk everything for the big payoff don't see that. Thats what this movie was about.<br/><br/>Will Smith did a good job in a serious role. I was never once reminded of Wild Wild West or Men in Black. His struggle in the movie was the kind of thing typical in many people's lives and the movie portrayed it with painful honesty. That honesty went somewhere else however, at the end of the film when it became a commercial for Dean Witter(Morgan Stanley). I was okay with the movie until its ending and that turned my critical eye towards it. He doesn't just attain happiness by reaching his goal but by becoming a multi-millionaire as the screen text informs us, accompanied by lilting, upper octave piano. What happened to his kid? What happened to his wife? How was he with God? It doesn't matter because he's a rich stockbroker and therefore happy. Propaganda."

How many times can he lose a scanner and then find it again in a city with a billion people in it??? How many scenes of him running down the sidewalk yelling ""hey, wait!"" can there be??? <br/><br/>There's a payoff at the end, but it's a looooong ride to get there. And then as soon as we get the payoff - boom - it's over. Great short story; below-average movie.<br/><br/>Not sure why this gets so many great reviews and a high star rating here."

He lacks charm and expressiveness - he is carried around like a sack of potatoes, dutifully speaking his dialog - but the audience that I was in never connected with him.<br/><br/>This is the closest thing to a one person film I've ever seen. Smith is literally in every scene -everything revolves around him. He is believable but ultimately does not create a very memorable character.<br/><br/>And ultimately, after two hours of this monotonic drudgery my wife and I were looking forward to an intensely happy ending that never quite came.

","A nicely sanitized version of the real Chris Gardner story and it plays with an odd lifelessness, even though Will Smith, along with his charming little son, gives it his amiable best.<br/><br/>The poverty laden underbelly of the U.S., for once, is graphically depicted and that was a plus. But the pursuit of happiness, as promised by Thomas Jefferson ends up, as it always does, in the corporate money-pot.<br/><br/>The depiction of the marriage was too thin to have any impact, it was as if the script writers did not know what to do with this end of the plot so the gorgeous and capable Thandie Newton was given short shrift as a miserable little shrew who marches off quickly, sans son, for a better life.<br/><br/>There are many shots of the studly, dark-suited Will heading across streets and up hills at a very graceful loping gallop. Many shots of him tucking his son into bed in various depressing hostels and cheap motels. Some touching moments between father and child played quite beautifully.<br/><br/>But the whole of it is like a deceptive box of chocolates, all glistening paper and satin bows and inside all you get are these cheap chocolates and not the Belgians you expected.<br/><br/>Disappointing. 5 out of 10."

","What a joke this film was - are they sure it wasn't really supposed to be a comedy? The only reason I gave it an average rating instead of lower despite the nonsense all through it is because Will Smith was pretty good in the part of Chris Gardner (this is based on a true story, though I'm already reading there was more to it than meets the eye). Smith's cute real-life son Jaden gets to star along with pop. <br/><br/>Poor old Chris -- he has so many problems, supposedly unlike the rest of us, the movie seems to be saying: His wife leaves him, he has to try and take care of his son, he loses a shoe, he gets parking tickets including even when it's not his own car, he has trouble making his bills, he has to struggle to make ends meet....... Give me a break. All throughout this film I kept shaking my head in disbelief and shouting at the TV screen: WHY DON'T YOU TRY GETTING A JOB!!!!!!!???. The stupidity of the story is that we're supposed to feel sorry for Chris even though he makes his own problems! He once spent all his savings on dozens of portable bone density testing machines and for years now has been wasting his life trying at least to break even by hawking them all around town to doctors when the product isn't popular and is probably already out of date. <br/><br/>Even though these fruitless bone density gizmos have long ago proved to be a non-lucrative prospect, there is Chris, still fooling around with them and ruining not only his own life but his wife and son's. He's dodging his landlord with rent that's months overdue, even to the point where he gets kicked out and has to live out of a motel with his little boy -- until he gets kicked out of there, too, also for non-payment, and winds up sleeping with junior in bathrooms and shelters. He can barely eat, he has no place to go, the IRS is after him for taxes. So what does Chris do under such desperate circumstances? He takes another thankless position with no salary as an intern for a major brokerage firm, working for free! He has high hopes and determination that if he tries hard enough he may one day make the big bucks. This is all very admirable -- but what about surviving today?<br/><br/>Look, the heart was in the right place here, and obviously Chris Gardner was more concerned with hoping that the end would justify his means. All I can say is, I have zero concern or sympathy for a man who doesn't do what he's got to do to pay his bills, his rent, his taxes, and to put food on the table for himself and his child. And this guy's supposed to be a great dad? There is no reason whatsoever why this man at any point in his nightmare couldn't have walked into the nearest MacDonalds or supermarket to flip burgers or stock shelves, at least to have some form of income. Hell, even get TWO JOBS if he had to! Why should I cry along with a bum who chooses to sleep in a public men's room when that's the path he chose for himself, and his poor little son? He still could have found a way to pursue his dream of making big money (as if a good job and big money is truly the ""key to happiness"" anyway, but hey - to each his own). Chris Gardner was his own worst enemy and nobody's to blame but him. It's no wonder his wife left him. ** out of ****"

After excelling in almost every possible genre (Action, Comedy, Animation, Sci-Fi, Romance, etc.), his 2006 mega-hit propelled him to yet another cinematic height  pure old fashioned dramatic acting.<br/><br/>In Pursuit of Happiness, Smith portrays Chris Gardner, a single parent with no formal education, who decides to beat the odds and make it big in the world of stock broking  despite (and perhaps even in light) of all the objective facts being against him. One of the only films in recent years to have a true heart pounding in the center of it, the film plays out as an unfolding prayer for the Capitalistic and liberal manner through which the American society evolves. Through that, it also carries one of the sharpest and truthful messages i've ever seen at the cinema  the notion that each and every one of us holds the potential to make it big, even huge, in life, if we only put our honest talents to the task."

The faith and belief shown by Chris Gardner goes a long way in proving how love can be the guiding force in someone's life. <br/><br/>This would definitely be one of the greatest role played by Will Smith and not only him but even by his son Jaden Smith.

","The Pursuit of Happiness is a movie based on a true story. The protagonist, Chris Gardner, is no doubted a success; the movie focuses on how he got to success. Nobody is born to win but learns to. Sometimes, people consider themselves a failure even before they try to be successful. To excel is not as difficult as we think. Maybe we just need to find out what we are really good at, create ourselves chances, and the most important, someone who will persistently trust on us and stand by our side.<br/><br/>Chris told his five-year-old son, Christopher, never let others told you that you couldn't do something, not even I. How important sticking to your dreams is. How many times in life we're deprived of our dreams, sometimes even by those loves us dearly and we love wholeheartedly? Why we are easily persuaded to believe that we are incapable of something? Maybe that's exactly how we're driven far from who we want to be. Tell ourselves ""I can do it"" and then prove it.<br/><br/>Chris is doomed to be distinguished because he is the kind of men who tend to create chances for themselves, sharing the taxi fees, telling the truth, showing his sincerity, no hanging the phone between calls, promoting his program in the box of football stadium audience. Poverty, lack of education background, even car accident, nothing's gonna stop him. If he was blocked, instead of an excellent stock broker, he would have been a poor salesman in little needed medical bone density scanners until today. Comparing with him, we are too easily to be frustrated and retreated, aren't we?<br/><br/>Chris could fail without his lovely boy, Christopher, who believed what Chris said even after his mother left with despair. Together, father and son struggled through homelessness, jail time, tax seizure and the overall punishing misery. ""Do you trust me?"" ""Yes, dad."" It's the ""yes"" that supported Chris to overcome all the roughness and insist on what he's fighting for. The beloved boy would grow up and change his mind. The role his father plays would fade with time. Maybe someday, he would no longer need his father as he did in childhood. But what matters. The memory of the time they shared together would last forever; their love and care for each other would last forever.<br/><br/>The success of Chris Gardner is a legend, a miracle, but not an accident. Each of us can make it too. The difference between winners and losers is to do or not to do. Let's just do it."

","I saw this Movie one month ago at midnight and while I was seeing, I cried three times because Will Smith did a great job playing Chris Gardner and the final message it was awesome. This kind of movies are the best, and Hollywood would have to make many of these. I think that the movie deserves the well-known maxim and all the prizes because the direction and Performance are perfect, I do not imagine to another actor who he is not Will Smith doing this paper, really it is the best movie who I have seen in my life and in addition led by an actor that I remember it with many happiness because I grew up seeing the prince of the Bel-Air, I repeat, the best movie at the moment I recommend it to everybody.;) Do not lose the hope."
"guitarkid2006","10","1","2","25 January 2007"," The Pursuit of Excellence
","I have always been a big fan of Will Smith, and consequently, I have always felt that he doesn't quite get the recognition he deserves. His role as Chris Gardner in The Pursuit of Happiness proves that Will Smith is just another action star or rapper. He has now become what I always knew he would--an actor.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness is based on a true story. It follows the life of Chris Gardner, a man who struggles to raise his young son during economic hardship after his wife has just left them. Gardner does his best to work his way up the job ladder as he pursues a job as a stock broker. Through the ups and downs of this pursuit and the heartwarming father-son relationship between Gardner and his son, the viewer will undoubtedly fall in love with the characters and with the film as a whole.<br/><br/>As of this date, Will Smith has been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Hopefully the Academy won't make the same mistake the Golden Globes did and they will actually hand the award to Smith. In fact, I feel that this film has been robbed by critics and actually deserves to be nominated for Best Director (Gabriele Muccino), Best Screenplay (Steven Conrad), Best Supporting Actor (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith), and Best Cinematography (Phedon Papamichael). But since I can't change the Academy, I'll cross my fingers and hope they at least give the Oscar to Mr. Smith.<br/><br/>In conclusion, please see this movie. You will not be disappointed because Will Smith will have you on the verge of tears and laughter all at the same time. If you ask me, a 7.4 rating is ridiculous. This movie is truly excellent."

"diac228","7","1","2","24 January 2007"," Will Smith and Will Smith Jr. propel this dismal tale of poverty full of gritty realism but an overload of drama
","Watching the Pursuit of Happiness, we were looking for the main character's pursuit of happiness as well. In other words, this is a very harsh film, very brutal in terms of reality and the way life is without the luxury of money. Thanks to a stellar cast, good direction, and a nice script, The Pursuit of Happiness is a good film that is hard to look at just because it's so tough, its so hard to see. This trait serves as a double-edged sword, as the realities need to be displayed on movie screens more often, but it comes at you so often that it becomes harder and harder to watch, and it drags a bit in certain moments. Nonetheless, this is a must-see for anyone that needs a little inspiration, of for anyone that might be taking their life for granted.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness follows the gloomy life of Chris Gardner, a struggling salesman losing money, and losing the respect and the love of his wife, while at the same time worrying about the future of his son. He is forced to move constantly, at times doesn't even know if he'll have a home in the evening, all in the meantime he is trying to sell dated products and also attempt to become a stockbroker. With the odds against him, Chris fights for his pursuit of a good life for him and his son.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie comes from the writing. The writing team crafts a script in which it showcases the true, true victim of the story; not the main character Chris, but his son. Chris' son, named Christopher, is shown as the one that suffers the most, as his future is seen in jeopardy, his mental and emotional status at the brink of destruction, and hope in his life fading away very quickly. Steve Conrad's script also displays that it wasn't just the world ganging up on Chris, but Chris making bad decisions as well. Last but not least, it's not a bitter social commentary with hidden propaganda; people are poor and starving for a reason, and the rich are enjoying the fruits of life for a reason. Chris soon realizes that pursuing happiness relies on constant determination and maintaining optimism.<br/><br/>Will Smith delivers his best performance of his entire career as the under pressure father. Already proving himself in action, comedy, and romantic movies; Smith surprises with a heartbreaking and emotionally-moving portrayal of Chris Gardner. His excellent chemistry with his on-screen son can be traced to the fact that it's his real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, who also gives a decent performance for a first-timer. Unfortunately though, acting isn't consistently great, as the wife, Thandie Newton, gives us a very mediocre presentation. One nice surprise is Homer Simpson acting; Dan Castellaneta has a role as Alan Frakesh, one of the big boys of the company Chris is trying to work for.<br/><br/>This film's biggest strength also turns into its biggest weakness. While it is indeed incredibly realistic and can perfectly tear out your heart, the barrage of unfortunate events just continues piling up. Then, with a running time of almost two hours, it starts to drag and can hurl people towards immediate depression. Humans can only take so much bad news at one sitting before reaching for a sharp object. To top it all off after so much drama, sad, tear-jerking moments, and instances that force you to wipe the tears from your face; the movie is over. When the opening credits last longer than the conclusion, we have a major problem.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Excellent script and good acting is barred by poor editing, a long running time, and an ending that comes almost at the blink of an eye. Will Smith gives the performance of a lifetime, his son excels as well, but the story is far too sad to be inspirational, which is what Smith and his cast was not aiming for. Kudos for the tough, edgy look at the homeless life, but with a third act that was dragging, the appeal starts wearing off. Cutting the length, leaving out some of the bad events from the movie entirely would have improved the film, and made it a bit more motivating. Advertised as a dramedy, and comes off more as a gloomy drama than anything else; which is both a good and a bad thing. The Pursuit of Happiness: A story that isn't life-changing, but is a decent example as to what can happen to your life with a bit of effort and perseverance."

","The Pursuit of Happiness is the true story of a man named Chris Gardner who was left alone to raise his son under difficult circumstances. Will Smith delivers probably the strongest performance of his entire career in this film. Most of the actors and actresses, including Thandie Newton and Smiths' son Jaden, are strong in the film. Stronger than the performances is the message. The film stresses that we must dream high and achieve. It's the same thought that made the real Chris Gardner a billionaire today. It's an inspirational and emotional film that I highly recommend for the entire family. Will Smith's performance is nothing short of Oscar worthy in this heartwarming film.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness - ***1/2 out of ****"

","I came into this movie knowing it would be sad, but with a happy ending at the end, but, I didn't realize the happiness wouldn't be till the way, way, way, way end. I don't blame the writer or anything, this was a TRUE story. What I found very disturbing though was when he was giving his blood. I don't know why that was that really ""pushed my buttons"" but it did. The whole movie I was squirming in my seats, but I knew it would end up happy. It really is a remarkable story though, when you think about how it's true. I advise you to see this movie unless you're into happy movies. You'll learn a great lesson along the way too."

","SPOILERS:<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and found it to be a very moving, inspirational tale, especially since it is based on a true story. This is one of the better pictures I've seen this year and I would definitely recommend it.<br/><br/>I could see where some would not like this because there are a lot of very painful, bitter moments but the story is more then just interesting, it's fascinating and it just kind of hooks you in. The real Chris Gardner must be quite a guy. The father and son, played by Will and Jaden Smith, put in excellent performances and one becomes immersed in their story or at least I did. It's an unusual movie, quite different then anything I've seen this year.<br/><br/>As mentioned, there are many a morose moment in this and patience is needed to get to the high point of the movie which comes very close to the end. Actually, My biggest criticism would be that moment which, although wonderful, is way to short and feels to hurried. I also found the believability aspect tested when Chris kept running into the same people on the street but that was the only aspect I felt didn't ring quite true. I would also have liked to know more about Linda, played by Thandie Newton. But despite those things the movie is very good. It flows well and the narration which could have been awful, fits the movie so well, I can't imagine the film without it. I felt the movie pulls one into the story from the very beginning. It's fascinating to watch Chris fight for the job and to see how the brokers warm to him.<br/><br/>I think this was a heartwarming intelligent movie, extremely well written and worth seeing. It does help to know the story ahead of time. Although it's sometimes good to come into a movie knowing nothing, in this case, so much of the movie is so sad, that if you know it's going to have a happy ending, it's probably easier to get through. I would definitely recommend this movie."

I rarely see films where i can just sit and watch and get sucked into the film, it was that good! For me as a student, it is a major wake up call! Chris Gardner talks about how he would get an A on a test and wonders how he got where he was, homeless, and doing everything he possibly can to help him and his kid (Jaden Smith Wills REAL son)get through this. The film co-stars Thandie Newton, and she gives a great performance as well. This movie should be seen in schools! Its that important!

"sullibrandon","7","1","2","1 January 2007"," Amazing Performance by Will Smith
","""Inspired by a true story"" always makes me kind of nervous. It's as if the filmmakers are falling back on the fact that it's a true story, hoping that the truth of it will pull our heartstrings, rather than the actual story. The Pursuit of Happiness admittedly suffers from some of these weakness, but mostly overcomes them, particularly in the person of Will Smith, who delivers the best performance of his career.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner is a man who is struggling financially, because invested in bone density scanners that most doctors do not find to be too useful. He has a wife and kid, both of whom must deal with Chris's difficulties as he goes through life. One day he happens upon a man who is a stockbroker, who tells him that to make it in that field, he only needs to ""be good with numbers, and be good with people."" Soon after Chris pursues this career path, but he still must deal with his family's financial troubles, and selling the bone density scanners. The movie follows his struggles.<br/><br/>The story of Pursuit of Happiness is solid, but it feels kind of pointless. By the time the movie was over, I felt moved by Chris Gardner and his plight, but I wondered why someone had chosen to make a film of him. The end of the movie gave a couple of facts about how Gardner, the actual man, and it kind of justified why the story had been told, but ultimately, it failed to resonate. If a lesser talented actor had been in the role, it would have failed completely.<br/><br/>Will Smith's performance is breathtaking. He undoubtedly gives the best performance of his career, and it might even possibly be Oscar-worthy. I wouldn't be surprised if he was nominated, in any case. He fully inhabits his character and never once slips up. His tragedy feels very real, very present. Only because of him does this movie work. He brings out the best about the movie, and even if one thinks the rest of the movie is worthless, his performance alone is worth the price of a movie ticket.<br/><br/>I respect Will Smith. He went from being a rapper to being someone who will probably be nominated for an Oscar. This is a very difficult transition for a musical artist to make. He has even earned the respect of critics and audiences. Even if the story of Pursuit of Happiness is sub-par, it deserves praise for bringing out the best in Will Smith."

","I really enjoyed the film. If those that see the film would actually understand what happens to those that are downtrodden and have no resources, the film could make a difference in some people's lives.<br/><br/>The film shows first hand how some people cannot see what is put before them. The people that should have realized that Chris had a problem, in fact did not notice. It was partly because Chris did a great job of trying to conceal it, but it also is about how people see what they want to see and not what is before their eyes.<br/><br/>Little Jaden Smith is remarkable in this film. I can bet we will be seeing a lot of this young man as he gets older. It sort of made me feel older to see Will Smith playing the part of such an older, responsible person. The scene in the restroom at the train station was a real heartstring tugger.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film and I also recommend those that see it to pay closer attention to those whose luck has all but run out. They are all around us. We may be the one that keeps them from going down the gutter. There is inspiration all in this film. Pay attention!"

","This film is about a man's struggle to find happiness by chasing his dream to become a stockbroker.<br/><br/>Throughout most of the film, we get to see Will Smith being very poor and have very bad luck. It is a realistic portrayal of how urban life can be for many of the lower socio-economic class. I am sure Will Smith's character gets a lot of resonance in the viewer's hearts. The interaction between Will Smith and his wife and son is also good. His wife (Newton) is disapproving and distant, while his son is warm and adorable. Their interaction is cruelly realistic.<br/><br/>The plot is good because it is not as predictable as the average comedy. We don't get the happy then sad then happy pattern, instead we get a sad sad sad then happy pattern. It is good the Hollywood tries something new! Will Smith's acting is excellent. The final scene where he is very happy when he hears some good news, we do not get a hysterical happiness. Instead, it is subtle and from the heart. It is a very impressive portrayal of happiness.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth the watch!"
"mike-arredondo","7","1","2","30 December 2006"," Will Smith earns a B+/ A-
","First let me say, IMO this is by FAR Will Smith's best acting to date that I have seen. The story is told very well and the screenplay was very good. If I had to nit-pick the movie however, I would say the film should have been just a little MORE emotional and a little more depressing. Don't get me wrong, the story IS depressing in itself. Anyone in those situations would be hard pressed to keep moving forward after losing their wife and living on the street with their child and struggling day to day to survive. However the WAY that those spiraling events were subtly glossed over were a little disappointing to me. Perhaps the real Chris Gardner didn't get more emotional as his wife was leaving him than the character did in the film? Maybe the real Chris Gardner didn't lose it when he realized he had to spend the night in jail? Maybe he didn't get more angry when he learned about his account getting levied by the IRS, getting evicted and was stiffed by his friend on a small loan? Maybe we're supposed to assume he internalized a lot of this? Would it have hurt to yell and hit something in anger to portray the disappointment a little more? I don't fault Will Smith entirely for this, as the director generally dictates how much emotion to portray in each scene. Also, would it have hurt to visually SEE an ""update"" of Chris Gardner's life and career instead of merely reading about it in the captions at the end of the film? I'll say this in Will Smith's defense though, I really enjoyed the acting and the weight of the scene when he is called into the conference room at the end of the film. This is where he really shined in my view. Overall I enjoyed the movie and left the theater with an overall appreciation for the little things I sometimes take for granted. It renewed my sense of brotherhood with my fellow man, that we are all alike in many ways, regardless of where we live, how much money we have or how we dress. As for Will Smith, I would not be surprised to see him get award nominations, however I believe we are yet to see his best performance should the right script and director cross paths with him again."

The difference here is that it is the TRUE story of Chris Gardner. Sure, the story is entirely from his point of view and the only bits we get of his wife are as an angry, bitter, fed up Thandie Newton who just boils over with disgust at her life with Chris.<br/><br/>The pleasure in this film is watching the scenes with Will Smith (as Mr. Gardner) and Jaden Smith (his real life son). The spirit of these two and the perseverance the display are very uplifting. Nice support work is offered by Dan Castellanata (voice of Homer Simpson) and Kurt Fuller.<br/><br/>Director Gabriele Muccino steps into his first mainstream Hollywood film and does a pretty good job in most scenes. The ""action"" scenes of Smith running in the streets are a bit hokey, but I really enjoyed the more personal moments. Overall, pretty good film of an amazing story.

","t couldn't be more straightforward, but the new inspirational melodrama ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is like a Rorschach test. If you bring to it the desire to smile and suffer and laugh and cry with its protagonist, you likely will. If you expect its tale of struggle and triumph to set your teeth on edge, it'll do just that. And if you come to it with no preconceptions at all, it could strike you as flat, formulaic and pat or sweet, inspiring and real. It all depends.<br/><br/>The question, then, is whether the film's mutability is a sign of mastery or of a failure to make something substantial of itself. The answer, maddeningly, is a little of both.<br/><br/>Directed by Gabriele Muccino (""L'Ultimo Bacio"") from a script by Steve Conrad (""The Weather Man""), the film tells the based-on-truth story of Chris Gardner, a luckless but bright San Francisco salesman who dreams of being a stockbroker and loses his wife and the roof over his head while pursuing that unlikely goal. Homeless, broke and desperate, Chris manages, however, to hold onto his son, Christopher, as well as to his ferocious personal determination and his winning sense of humor.<br/><br/>Life throws bean balls and knocks Chris to the ground, but, eyes ever on the prize, he gets right back up every time and pushes on. Oh, he loses his temper once or twice, and tells some harmless lies, and does a couple of things that he's probably ashamed of today, and even cries one night when he is well and truly crushed. But they don't make movies about folks who succumb to such moments, no they don't. Which is another way of saying that if you can't figure out where this picture is headed then you need to surrender your car keys and checkbook to a trusted friend because your brain is broken.<br/><br/>Chris is played by Will Smith in a performance that's being buzzed about as the rapper-comic-action star's breakthrough as a legitimate actor (which makes you wonder what the buzzers were doing when Smith was deservedly nominated for an Oscar in the lead role in ""Ali"" or delivering a subtle performance in ""Six Degrees of Separation"" more than a decade ago). There's real range in Smith's work here: frustration, irony, despair, grit, wit, professional savvy and, especially, parental warmth.<br/><br/>The latter is especially important to the film and arises from the relationship between Smith and the young debuting actor who plays Christopher, one Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, Smith's 8-year-old son. The fact that there's real on-screen chemistry between a real-world father and son is no mean feat -- just ask Sylvester and Sage Stallone. The repartee of the two Smiths can be playful, strained, clingy or tender as the script calls for. It's not mere behaving; it's real acting.<br/><br/>Also real is the atmosphere provided by Muccino, who assiduously resists any temptation to sugarcoat or gussy up the texture of the film. In his native Italy, he has specialized in plausible melodramas; here he uses contrast-rich photography, grimy sets and a firm control of the film's rhythms to keep the Hollywood treacle mostly at bay.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the script has an episodic quality that, combined with Muccino's restraint, results in a feeling of bloodlessness. The narration also has a self-satisfied quality, which mirrors a smugness that occasionally creeps into Smith's eyes. These sorts of things push you away from the film and make it seem like a series of moralistic tableaux about somebody's hard road to the top.<br/><br/>Still, there's a decency at the film's core and a desire to do the predictable thing in a generally unpredictable fashion. Those traits make it impossible to reject ""Happyness"" out of hand. Muccino has an assured technique, and big Smith and little Smith are strong. When the film finally gets to where you always knew it was going, you can rightly feel satisfied if never exactly overwhelmed."
"danielgramstrup","9","1","2","21 December 2006"," Excellent performances from the Smith's!
","I just came home from watching this movie, and I must say I'm still very touched. I like the fact that this is based on a true story. The fact that you can compare it to the reality of the real world, really gives the movie something special. It's touching, it's real, and yes it do have it's few funny moments.<br/><br/>What lead to all that was not only how it was directed, but definitely by the two Smith's - Will Smith and Jaden Smith. This was definitely the best performance from Will Smith I've seen. Together with his real-life son, he really took my breath away, and I have to admit, I did shred some tears, in eventful moments. This movie however also made me very tense. Because it kept running on the clock, meaning paying the bills, taking care of a son, finding a place to stay ... through the whole movie my stomach ache, and no it wasn't because I'd ate something bad - it was because of the tense mood in the movie. That - to me, just shows how excellent the movie really was, and how it really did move me.<br/><br/>Will Smith definitely deserves the Oscar, for best acting performance - he really did an OUTSTANDING performance.<br/><br/>Too anyone who enjoys movies - go watch this, it really is an outstanding movie, with a real touch.<br/><br/>The reason I give it 9/10 is because of the fact, that we did not see that, according to Chris Gardner's own website, he receives a monthly amount of $1000 in pay. (Which in the days that the movie is going on in, was a bit more than today) - It really doesn't catch the completely true story. Otherwise - go watch this!"

","I didn't choose to see this movie. I was going to see a sneak preview of ""Dreamgirls,"" (which I had been eagerly looking forward to for weeks) but was turned away because so many other people were there to see it too. As consolation, the theater management let me into a sneak preview of ""Pursuit of Happiness."" I went in utterly unprepared for the emotional ride I was about to take, not having seen a trailer or any early reviews. Needless to say, this movie totally made me forget my disappointment! Everyone around me was crying shamelessly -- myself included. I left the theater convinced I had just seen this century's equivalent of ""It's a Wonderful Life."" It's that great! <br/><br/>Excerpts can't convey the full impact of what happened to this man. You really have to see the movie all the way through to get the cumulative effect of one hit of bad luck after another. When you're already down and desperately struggling to hang on it doesn't take much to push you off the ledge. The movie was utterly convincing in its depiction of what it must be like to spiral down into homelessness -- and the number of paths that can take a person there, over and above the usual stereotypes. (I understand they used actual homeless people as extras and it showed. You can't ""act"" that look).<br/><br/>Some have complained that the movie was too long, or too repetitive, with not much going on in the middle. I would contend that this was a deliberate attempt to convey what it's like to be caught in a Sisyphean routine of hoping to get through day after day of not much hope. I thought the setting was used really well to show this -- San Francisco is a gorgeous city, but Chris (and the camera) barely has time to notice, because he is too busy just trying to get from one place to another.<br/><br/>I've never been a huge Will Smith fan before now but the gamut of emotions he conveyed in this movie without uttering a word was just brilliant. His kid is adorable -- and an astonishingly fine actor. Thandie Newton as his wife was the one weak note -- she came across as more of a shrew than a woman who was once a loving partner but now just exhausted and worn down."

","After watching this movie, I sat stunned ,cried and couldn't let go of my 2 yr old son for a long long time. This moving portrayal of a guy sinking into the abyss of poverty will shake everyone, but specially those blessed with little boys. Will Smith illuminated that tenuous line between comfortable middle-class existence and the slip-slide into poverty like few others. People may criticize the lack of focus on race--somewhat justified--but in my opinion it turned out to be the correct decision for preserving the core message of the movie: anyone can descend into poverty at a moment's notice, and only perseverance and a dose of luck can get you out--the latter cannot be underestimated."

","This movie was so fantastic and it was so painful to watch at the same time. Because The Pursuit of Happiness is based on a true story I found myself struggling to watch it. I knew that someone actually went through everything I was watching and it wasn't just entertainment. Actually I would call it the opposite of entertainment. The movie was very slow and took a long time to get to a point. Will Smith's character shows so much drive and motivation and I wonder why I can't be more like that day to day. It was really amazing to consider how hard he worked to provide for his family. The acting was great and the story was great. At the end of the movie it all comes together and it makes the rest of the movie worthwhile. I have very mixed feelings about this one so just go see it for yourself and make your own judgment."
"Citizen_Cane","9","1","2","20 December 2006"," Well made, great story
","I didn't think Hollywood was capable of showing Capitalism in a positive light. This movie and story is inspiring, motivational, and actually believable. To me, the message was that a man with enough hope, a positive outlook, and determination can accomplish absolutely anything.<br/><br/>What I have come to expect of the entertainment industry in America is the message that that everyone needs a helping hand, socialism is good, and nobody is capable of succeeding alone. It's true that we need each other in life, but the message in this movie is that YOU are responsible for yourself. You can succeed if you try hard enough. This is a capitalist's story. There is nothing wrong with making money. Happiness is not an entitlement, but everyone is free to pursue it.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Will Smith and his child is completely obvious, and Will Smith really turns in his best performance IMO. The acting and on-screen chemistry is what upgrades this movie from a TV Family movie special into a true world class production.<br/><br/>This movie is stressful to watch, but is very rewarding. Personally, I recommend it highly!"
"the_scandal_cha","8","1","2","17 December 2006"," A few things aside, a pretty good movie!
","It's getting to be general knowledge that The Pursuit of Happiness is one of Will Smith's best performances, if not his best of all. Walking into the theatre, I was skeptical. I knew he was up for that Golden Globe nomination, but still I was skeptical. I knew he had some skills, but I didn't know he could bring the emotion out like that! Sometimes the dialogue, especially between Will Smith and Thandie Newton, who plays his wife, Linda, was strained and slightly unbelievable, I have to admit. In fact, I hate to admit it because I liked this movie so much..but just thought I'd warn you.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness is a cute little movie centering on Chris Gardner, a salesman in the early 80's selling bone scanners. As his sales slow down significantly, he finds himself in huge financial trouble, struggling to live day by day. Trying to take care of his son, also named Chris (played adorably by Smith's real-life son, Jaden) by himself is tough, especially while being an intern for a potential high-paying job he may or may not get. The movie is one of those tearjerker-yet-heartwarming movies that I tend to hate, yet this one was so well acted by both Smiths, I couldn't give it a bad review! All in all, this was a cute little film that I enjoyed very much. If you want to laugh a little, maybe cry a little, or just see Will Smith stretch from his usual groove, then The Pursuit of Happiness (yes, with a y!) is a must-see!"

","I'm a avid movie watcher and I would say this is one of the best movies I've watched this year among a 50-100 movies I have watched this year. The main reason for my appreciations are (i) An excellent acting: Will Smith has not just acted but he became the real Chris gardener, just like a commoner you see on the road. (ii) An inspiring story: I'm a person who likes movies based on true stories more than fictional stories. Movies should have an impact on the society and it has had in the history of human kind. This movie really does that job.<br/><br/>There are two or three quotes worth remembering in our life from this movie, like ""If you need something, go get it period"".

","After that point it was waterworks for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Will Smith does a great job as Chris Gardner. A dad who kept getting tripped up in his quest to provide for his son, played by his real life son Jaden. He's a salesman whose product isn't exactly in demand. Things get out of hand for him financially and in trying to get himself out of a bad situation he's in a race against bad luck and the runaway train that is a glimmer of opportunity. Will hasn't been this good since Six Degrees of Separation and Jaden was great as well. Totally natural, not one of those annoying Hollywood kid actors. Thandie Newton I can do without. She overacts.<br/><br/>I don't know how much of the story was fudged, if any. It seems just like real life. You can't make up that many bad/good coincidences. It's an uplifting story but not in a cheesy way. It's got a PG-13 rating and I'm going to guess that it's because of the one occurrence of the F word, otherwise I think it's appropriate for anyone. It's another in a great holiday movie season."
"Lejink","2","2","7","13 January 2013"," Trivial pursuit
","I didn't like this Will Smith feature at all. Was there really a movie in Christopher Gardiner's story of his struggle to preserve his relationship with his infant son, while striving for a shot at making big money in the world of stockbroking...? After sitting through this sentimental, obviously Oscar-targeted mush, I certainly didn't think so. It has all the appearance of a vanity project for Smith and I'm not just referring to the obvious nepotism of advancing his young son to main supporting actor alongside him.<br/><br/>I see from the high IMDb score and indeed box office returns that this particular espousal of the American Dream found favour, principally, I would imagine with its home audience, but to me, it came across as corny, undramatic and ultimately boring. <br/><br/>You can see Smith putting out for the Academy pretty much all the way through, his son can't act either and by the time he gets his big break at the end, I just felt manipulated. Inspirational...? I didn't think so. And why a film set in 1981 relies so heavily on an early 70's soundtrack featuring classics from Stevie Wonder and George Benson only added to my confusion.<br/><br/>This film for me represents the worst of mainstream Hollywood, blatantly sentimental, heart-string tugging tosh of the worst kind."

","An intensely annoying one-dimensional study of perpetual disappointment, culminating in a highly questionable pay-off. Particularly in the wake of a stock-market blow-out of gigantic proportions, engineered by demented greed and unregulated irresponsibility, the depiction of a poor man achieving the status of a card-carrying merchant of pump-and-dump bondage as if he had attained the Promised Land is to say the least nauseating. But to frame the parable in a script that fails to deliver even the ghost of a sub-plot and tells its tale in a monotonous and-then-and-then-and-then series of setbacks with the occasional very implausible advance is a kind of torture. We know that the people behind the cameras are filming poverty from a position of comfortable corporate wealth. The whole movie is a very lengthy commercial for a profession that has contributed to destroying the post-war American way of life. This is corporate Hollywood at its most hawkish: to be avoided like the plague."

I went thinking it would be maudlin and possibly a tearjerker. If anything, it was the opposite. Unusually realistic. Sometimes frantic, like homelessness. <br/><br/>Another Rottentomatoes critic said, astutely, that for a Father-Son film, Smith's character shows remarkably little chumminess with his boy, and that this is what makes the relationship so realistic. The movie is--but isn't--a Horatio Alger story. And (like *another* Rottentomatoes critic says!) there's a European impressionism about it.

Even worse is the common sense that most of the time you can leave your belongings at the reception especially if ""you're good with people"" (to quote the movie). <br/><br/>The following unnecessary, thrill-ride running after hippies is forgivable though, but the thin plot is not.<br/><br/>A further dislike is regarding the overall aggressive culture. From yelling to the kid to yelling to random people. I'm done with such aggressiveness against those who are also on the bottom. (Taxi driver, bus driver, homeless, or the worst: his neighborhood friend). Yes, he sometimes 'stands up' to his injustice but most of the time he is blatantly hurting random people.<br/><br/>However, there are some noteworthy scenes: particularly the basketball-field motivational and the one on the subway (where he imagines that it really is a time-machine). These seem like the only genuine moments in the film. The only reason I give it a decent score.<br/><br/>One would get further in live acknowledging to your loved ones that you are in trouble with this-and-that. Start with the basics. Explain to your kid the situation, make a plan & calculate outcomes. This movie, to me, almost glorifies hiding your poverty. <br/><br/>Lastly consider the final 'happy outcome'.

I hear he still goes to the missions and feeds the poor, I certainly hope that true. Why? Because the business he so pursued is the business of liars and hustlers. That's what the movie portraits a man who lied his way to the top. He was a clown, a kiss butt, a slave to the white men in the office and the good Negro landed the job, rah, rah.

","pursuit of happiness - Now that what i call a movie, life is so tough, i think we can get happiness if we think every moment of life that could be much worse than it already is. And we would realise that our life is not bad enough to complain ;). Will Smith has generated Oscar buzz for his portrayal of Chris Gardner, the real-life guy whose rags-to-riches story forms the basis of the movie. (Impoverished guy becomes capitalist poster boy.) While it's fair to say that this is one of the best straight performances of Smith's career, it didn't blow me away. In and of itself, the acting, while effective, is not Best Actor material, but it wouldn't surprise me if the movie's prestige factor and Smith's popularity earn him a nod. Meanwhile, his female co-star, Thandie Newton, isn't going to be considered for any award. Newton spends about 90% of her screen time doing an impersonation of a harpy: screeching, bitching, and contorting her face into unpleasant expressions. Smith's son, Jaden, is okay as the movie's child protagonist; it's unclear whether his occasional deficiencies are the result of his acting, Steven Conrad's writing, or Gabriele Muccino's direction, but there's not much personality behind the cute features and curly hair."

I love that Chris always fights for what he believes in and for what he wants, and never gives up. His strength, intelligence, and love for his child are attributes to strive for. He deserves each and every blessing he receives. It surprised me a bit throughout the movie, that the subject of race was never broached. I would think that in real life, Chris might have encountered some difficulties as the only black man interning to become a stockbroker, in a rich, white company. I would have liked to have known how things turned out with Christopher's mother, since that felt unfinished. I would also have liked to have known how Chris and Christopher are doing now. I left this movie with a heavy heart. Although Chris' story has a happy ending, I couldn't help but think about the fact that this story is so true for so many people. The stress of financial hardship is something so many people can relate to. How many moviegoers, spending $10 on a movie ticket, can relate to the helplessness and desperation that so many Americans face every day?

I had heard so much about Jaden's acting ability that I was particularly focused on his every acting moment. They were super except at the very beginning of a couple of scenes you would catch his eyes coming into position. I mean like if time the director said ""action"" the camera instantly started and by the time the word ""action"" was processed in Jaden's mind there is this little half a second reaction delay that the editor didn't cut out (edit). I think it only happened maybe 2 or 3 times. Yes, I guess I'm being a tad bit critical, but I just like to really look into movies and actors that will potentially be nominated (and rightfully so)major awards.

No one knew.<br/><br/>At this time of giving, renewal, and resolving to be kind for next year:<br/><br/>How many of us may have a co-worker who is near homelessness?

It is the beautiful, dramatic, and romantic story of a father and son struggling with every day's life problems of present past and future.<br/><br/>I think is very well written, and although it was inspired by a true story there are some faults with the plot which affects the final product, especially in regards to its relation to the 'real'. I personally discovered a hidden ideological message (nothing wrong with it what so ever), that is, you have to be efficient like a machine in a world of deadly competition. The situation surrounding the main character is one of constant stress. He is under perennial judgement by all the institutions surrounding him. He seems to be constantly under assessment, in often hidden ways. For example, you can especially see it in some scenes during the internship, when his supervisors ask him to do things to test how good, how efficient, how multitasky he is. That maybe possible however the facts shouldn't be represented in such a unilateral perspective and uncritical way. I would have appreciated a more thoughtful representation, so that the 'American way of life' doesn't come out as the only possible path to 'happiness'....especially in a time when American is brought to dramatically recognise the existence of culturally/politically different agendas which do not just disappear."

","A very standard ""rags to riches"" story that is lifted to another level by the absolutely masterful performance by Will Smith. Of course, being filmed in the SF Bay Area definitely brings the story ""home"" that much more.<br/><br/>""Pursuit of Happiness"" is about a very poor family with a 5 year old kid trying to survive in a big city. Will Smith plays Chris Gardner, a smart man who for some reason or another (wasn't explained in the movie), never achieved all the dreams he went out to achieve. Instead, he's stuck selling medical devices that nobody wants and barely surviving with his wife (played by a very good Thandie Newton) and son (Jaden Smith, Will's real life son). Without going into a summary of the movie, the ""Pursuit of Happiness"" explores what has happened to the idea of the ""American Dream"" and the famous guarantee that all Americans have the right to ""life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness"".<br/><br/>The plot is predictable, some parts were ""cheesed"" up for dramatic effect. The social commentary about the rich-poor divide and homelessness issues are also valuable. But overall, you really appreciate the father-son interactions (definitely helped by being real life father and son) and all the sacrifices that a parent has to make to provide for a better living condition for their kids. It is also a story about one of the few who ""made it"" in our modern world pursuing a better life. If not for Will Smith, this movie would just fade into the drowning roar of ""inspiring movies"", especially during this Oscar season. But I now firmly believe Will Smith to be one of the premier young(ish) actors out there and am truly impressed by the acting range he had in this movie.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended in this holiday season!"

He simply did whatever he had to do to get out of his rotten, miserable situation and turn things around for himself.<br/><br/>I found some of the scenes extremely touching, especially the night he spent in the train station bathroom with his son.<br/><br/>While I did not find this to be Oscar worthy or outstanding in any way I thought it was a touching story of the American Dream and how it's out there for all of us if we want it badly enough."

","Ordinary family (Dad, Mom and their son) live bellow an ordinary life. Bills, dephts, job from morning till night and a 5 years son who sees a life thats probably far far away from ours. Dad (Will Smith) shows great acting. He is a dad that is worth of that name, though we can't say that mother is the same. When she realizes that her husband is kinda broke she just leaves him and goes out. Thats what women usually do. In a coincidence dad applies for a stock broker job competition. But till the final decision he and his son were kicked out from their home. Eventually they even join bums in a row for a free bed. Finally dad makes it to the top, being in a situations that are called impossible to solve he becomes a stock broker. Story shows us that you can be whatever you want. You must fight for it. And a person like mother in this film don't deserve to be called like that, nor as a wife. Believe in yourself, believe in your love, never do a mistake like she did, be good and proud person!

"Robert_duder","7","1","3","18 December 2006"," Just falls short of greatness...truly uplifting and touching but yet lacks great heart
","This unfortunately for the most part turned out to be the kind of film where the truly moving and important parts were used up in the trailer which definitely gets you rushing out to see it and I must stress that I don't mean to downplay the story or the message because there is something powerful and meaningful to it and Will Smith is brilliant but I just didn't feel the intense heart in the film that I expected. I don't know if it was the direction or the story or what it was but it lacked that little touch that made the film truly brilliant. I felt like the story dragged a lot and it wasn't smooth or well put together for the most part despite it's message, moral and strong lead actor.<br/><br/>I have never doubted Will Smith as a serious actor. I have always enjoyed his performances from slapstick comedy, to action, to serious roles like his under rated performance as 'Ali' and The Pursuit of Happiness certainly displays his talents. Smith plays the lead role of determined father, husband and man Chris Gardner. Now Gardner is a man who has chased dreams and never gotten them fulfilled. He lost his life savings in a face down business venture that he STILL believes in and cares about, he is stuck in a relationship with a woman who doesn't believe in him or support him, and yet it doesn't slow him for a minute in chasing another dream that does indeed work for him after a struggle unlike anything before. The true underlying message of the film is that you don't ever give up on your dreams no matter what the cost and his dream almost costs him everything...in fact does for a lot of time. But Gardner never stops fighting, never stops trying despite desperation and homelessness and trying his very best to raise his son. Smith is inspirational and important and single handedly makes this film worth while despite a sub par script. Jaden Smith (Will Smith's real life son) premiers as Gardner's young son who doesn't really ever understand his circumstances but loves his father unconditionally and does see what his father is doing. Both father and son go through so much and give up so much of what they both love to accomplish something bigger. One of the stranger things is I expected an unmistakable and real bond between Father and son and I just didn't feel it. There wasn't reality there and I had hoped for more. However Jaden does a great job in his first role opposite his Dad. Thandie Newton plays a graciously small role as Smith's wife who is working herself to the bone to support them but comes across as whiny and unappreciative and doesn't want to chase anything but survival for them to barely get along. She quickly and rather shamelessly gives up her son for a job in New York. Newton looks awful, worn out, overworked, exactly what the role called for but I still always find Newton hard to swallow in her roles so it's good that the role is small. The rest of the cast is barely visible except in small doses and the entire story revolves around Gardner's determination and survival.<br/><br/>That being said I think is one of the films drawbacks. The entire hope and heart of the film rests on Will Smith. Not that he can't pull that off but the film needed more talent, it needed some strong supporting characters and actors and there wasn't any. The biggest supporting actor was a brand new 7 year old who is good but not that good. I can't honestly say I've seen too many Italian films but perhaps Italian director Gabriele Muccino's style is just different and slower paced but I found the story dragged a little and made too much focus on the already obvious point. All this aside the film has some truly moving moments and really does make you look at the life of a homeless person in a completely different light. The film will pull at your heart strings and I think it's an important film, and a great Will Smith movie where he deserves some critical attention but not necessarily awards. It's good but it could have been outstanding. Still well worth seeing right now!! 7/10"

","From the opening shots of urban San Francisco poverty to the taxi cab with the ad for ""Raging Bull"" plainly displayed, ""Happyness"" weaves an accurate heart wrenching tale of the the triumph of the individual, the triumph of sticking to one's goals despite overwhelming odds.<br/><br/>There are so many poignant scenes in this film that ring true in incredibly insightful ways for anyone that has ""been there"" The look in the eyes of the protagonist's wife as he explains how things ""will get better"" financially cuts like a knife for any man who has had the same conversation with his wife or girlfriend. You can tell that she stopped believing long ago and only now are her emotions matching her outward display toward her husband. Will Smith is terrific cast against type as a hard working down and out Medical Equipment salesman who one day sees a stock broker pull up in the fanciest of cars. At that moment he knows what he wants to be and the barriers before him will be conquered, one way or another.<br/><br/>Many critics on the left have attacked this film. The fact that Will Smith is an outspoken Republican and that the film places financial success as the ultimate form of human achievement (that and being a good Dad)may rub them the wrong way. It shouldn't. There is nothing overtly political about this film and it really shouldn't be missed for any reason. It looks like the Best Actor category is crowded this year but it would take a miracle for Will Smith not to get nominated. Some may carp that the supporting performances are nothing special but that is because there really are no supporting performances. No other Actor gets great lines to work with but they all acquit themselves just fine. The real co-star is the city by the bay which looks alternatively beautiful and frightening. Given what it costs just to live in San Francisco it would probably be the worst city to be poor in. Overall this is a very fine film, a film that is perfect family viewing, especially for kids who may not be getting as many Christmas presents this year as they thought they should."
"cinelyze","8","1","3","18 December 2006"," One man's pursuit of the American dream against all odds
","The indomitable power of one man's spirit in the face of overwhelming adversity is the subject of ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" directed by Gabriele Muccino. Inspired by the real life events of Chris Gardner, a 1980s San Franciscan who lost just about everything but his faith in himself, ""Pursuit"" tells the story of an everyman who overcomes some serious living nightmares before he can achieve the American dream.<br/><br/>In a satisfyingly dramatic departure from his usual boisterous roles, Will Smith plays Gardner, a family man trying to keep his head above water in the Reagan-era economy. Early sequences show him making calls on doctors and hospitals in an attempt to sell the portable bone density scanners, which provide ""only a slightly better image than an x-ray at almost twice the cost,"" into which he has sunk his entire fortune. <br/><br/>Gardner need only sell two of these machines per month to cover his overhead which, judging from where he and his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), and their 5-year-old son (Smith's son, Jaden, in his professional debut) live, can't be much. Sadly, his efforts at entrepreneurship only lead him deeper into debt: he loses his car, is behind in his rent, and he's remiss in his taxes.<br/><br/>These financial woes place an understandable strain on the marriage. When Linda, already exhausted from working double shifts at a laundry, reaches the end of her rope she decides to let go, but not before she belittles her husband for dreaming that he can become a stock broker. No matter that that dream is accompanied by a plan, however farsighted. <br/><br/>Gardner is admitted into an elite brokerage training program, a 6-month long unpaid position in which the competition is fierce. That he has what it takes to succeed -- the ability to be ""good with numbers and good with people"" -- is without question. But a man, not to mention one with a child, still has to have enough money to live and to eat. It's an understatement to say that, without income, their survival becomes an enormous challenge.<br/><br/>The film follows Gardner as he runs (and runs and runs) all over the city to meet the demands of his declining lifestyle, struggling all the while to stay one step ahead of the next disaster. And there are many. It's a wonder he doesn't give up.<br/><br/>But, like the men who founded our country and wrote the Declaration of Independence on which our democratic principles are based, he doesn't. In fact, it is the preamble to that document, and its specific language about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that informs Gardner's thinking and the film itself. (The incorrect spelling of happiness in the title is taken from some graffiti Gardner takes issue with.) <br/><br/>Smith more than capably carries the film (and sometimes his son) on the shoulders of this already overburdened character, especially in the more heart wrenching scenes. Anyone with children (and even those without them) will recognize and respond to the love he exudes for his son, and the sense that he must stop at nothing to protect him. Come prepared with a hankie or two, and save at least a corner for the sob-filled finale.<br/><br/>The younger Smith is precocious, but not obnoxiously so. One is hard pressed to imagine another child in the role, so well do these two interact. Perhaps it is the chemistry between the real father and son that contributes this harmony, or maybe the boy is a natural. Regardless of the reason, the relationship works.<br/><br/>Cinematographer Phaedon Papamichael (""Walk the Line,"" ""The Weather Man""), gives San Francisco an appropriately somber '80s recession look. Smith's gray-tinged Afro and disco- era moustache further convey the period with subtlety.<br/><br/>Although the despair of potential homelessness hardly seems like the stuff seasonal feel good films are made of, ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" will leave you feeling good about the world. At least until you have to go out and face it again."

","THE PURSUIT OF Happiness (2006) *** Will Smith, Jaden Smith, Thandie Newton, Brian Howe, James Karen, Dan Castellaneta, Kurt Fuller. Smith gives an Oscar worthy turn in the best role of his career so far in this truth-based account of a struggling middle-class man named Chris Gardner attempting to change his luck and finances by taking a huge leap of faith in an unpaid internship for a financial investor Fortune 500 company that leads to only more pitfalls and heartbreak including the dissolution of his marriage to his angered and frustrated wife (Newton precariously balancing her character from shrew to fed-up human being with dignity) and raising their only child (Smith's real-life son Jaden making an impressive debut) in the process. Steve Conrad's adaptation of Gardner's account hits all the marks impeccably and director Gabriele Muccino's reality based American dream slices of life are on the spot.

","Super wonderful acting by Will Smith and his real life son,Jaden. The type of movie that tugs at your heartstrings, saddens and THEN you walk out of the theater feeling like a million bucks. Anyone writing a spoiler for this baby ought to be kicked off here for good because the story is remarkable-it's based on fact and goes to show what a great country we live in.<br/><br/>Yes, it was written that we are granted ""Life,Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness"" but the last word is slightly altered as you will find out. It was wonderful seeing how a man of color, so caring about his five year old son, was able, under the most adverse circumstances, to pursue a dream, suffer for it, exhaust himself, cry but never give up and the rest is for you to see. This story is what the country needs after the Neanderthalic racist outburst by Michael Richards that shocked us all.<br/><br/>Indeed, Mr. Will Smith does an ENORMOUS job as Chris Gardener whom in real life never heard of the word ""surrender.""

"JumeirahSun","10","1","3","17 December 2006"," Smith runs away with it
","""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is a retelling of poor-boy-makes-good, or what some people like to call ""the American dream,"" but it avoids the pitfalls of a clichéd storyline. Certainly, the audience can feel secure that Chris Gardner, the main character, will succeed in some fashion or else a film would never have been based on his autobiography, but the simple, sentimental score, well-written screenplay, subtle direction and, above all, Will Smith's acting make us strive with Gardner, cry with him, and hurt with him. <br/><br/>Smith is a gifted actor, and this film really showcases his emotional range. His natural rapport with his son is in no way one-sided; Jaden Smith is believable and very charming. <br/><br/>While I do not buy into the idea that a big house, fancy car, oodles of money made never mind how, and a high-stress Wall Street job equal happiness, to focus on the merit of Gardner's capitalist dream would be to miss the heart of the film; Gardner believes that becoming a stockbroker is his key for happiness, and we are here to appreciate his struggle as he claws his way out of the gutter. He doggedly completes his tasks each day, getting knocked down and staggering onward, sometimes taking his immense frustration out on his son, and attempting to keep up appearances so that he can go to the office. <br/><br/>Gardner's tale is like ""Die Hard"" for the masses; he has to endure being arrested, being evicted, fighting for a bed at the homeless shelter, trying to keep appointments and to study while holding down two full-time jobs with no car, sprinting all over San Francisco, attempting to keep himself and his son clean--it just does not stop. Watch Smith's face during the film--he shows us a man who only just manages to fend off despair. He bleeds and weeps because of the injustice in the world, with disappointment at how his potential has been wasted, with the weight of all his past failures, and with worry for his son. But he clings to the path he has chosen in the belief that it will lead him from this torment. One can actually see the dead look in Smith's eyes, the punch-drunk expression of one who is suffering, who is juggling so many burdens that his mind spills over with the effort, for whom a seemingly minor setback is a Big Deal. Smith gets it, and he makes us get it, too.<br/><br/>Incidentally, were Will Smith not an actor, he could probably have been a stuntman or a professional athlete. He has had running scenes in many of his films to date, and in this movie he looks ready to set a new record for the 400 meters. Smith is a little too fit and energetic for a homeless guy who hardly sleeps and eats in a soup kitchen for much of the movie, but his running and carrying feats illustrate Gardner's bulldog tenacity, and how his own physical power and endurance aided him in achieving his ends. <br/><br/>Smith deserves an Oscar award for his performance in this film. The movie itself is well made overall, but Smith's acting towers over everything. Well done."

","Sadly disappointed, it seemed to me a wholly depressing film about a man who desperately seeks money to solve his various woes, and somewhat seems to miss out on all the other aspects of life which could be considered important... The end of the film could so easily go one of two ways, and it seemed entirely at the director's discretion whether he chose a happy or sad ending.<br/><br/>If happiness to you means 'risking it all for huge wads of cash' then you'll probably like the film. There's a lot in the way of triumph-over-adversity, however I think it could do with a dose of common sense. Very few people (IMO) would risk *everything* on an off-chance.<br/><br/>I was left with a feeling that the lead character was reckless with his own and other people's lives, and was looking for the standard lottery-style 'quick fix' and didn't really seek happiness at all."

","Am I the only one who is wondering what happened to Chris's son?

Makes me wonder if all he did was for his son or for himself, could never tell from the movie. The movie shows us 6 hard months of a man's life, very hard months and the eventuality that he makes a lot of money later. So? What does he do with his son? for his community? Am I supposed to read or watch talk shows to find out what really happened in the end of a movie? Will Smith was incredible, his acting is beyond reproach, I just wish there had been better screening of the ending, because the way it played to me was ""success = money"" and NOT family."
"isabelle1955","Null","1","4","17 December 2006"," The Redemptive Power of Hard Work
","If this were not a true story I would simply not believe it. There really is some truth in the old adage that truth is stranger than fiction, because if this were merely a Hollywood fictional rags to riches story, I'd have been yawning and looking at my watch after the first half hour, and the word cliché would feature large in this review. But how do you reasonably criticize something which is essentially fact? Put briefly, Chris Gardner survives a string of disasters (the demise of his business selling bone scanners, the loss of his disillusioned wife, becoming homeless and a single parent, broke and even at one point, a felon - after he is arrested for unpaid parking fines. A wonderful use of tax payers' money I'm sure, jailing people for unpaid parking tickets) to go on to become a multi millionaire stock broker and father extraordinaire, a cuddly capitalist, the epitome of The American Dream. As one disaster after another lays him low, his sheer tenacity keeps him going, to eventual financial salvation and professional success. It's a movie about the redemptive power of sheer hard work, politeness, honesty and love. And it also proves the relevance of another old adage  nothing ventured, nothing gained. Offered a chance to intern at a major broker, Chris grasps the opportunity, working his balls off despite the lack of regular salary, just on the slight hope that at the end of the internship he might be the one out of twenty hopefuls chosen for a proper job. But the movie doesn't actively ram anything political down the audience's throat, his ultimate success speaks for itself.<br/><br/>As the disasters in his life piled up, Chris' remarkable lack of cynicism had this viewer shaking her head in disbelief. But you have to take this movie at face value and accept that there really are people around as remarkable as Chris Gardner. I'm going to take this movie totally on trust and assume the story hasn't been prettied up too much for the screen. If it really can be taken at face value, then I find it rather reassuring that the Chris Gardners of this world can succeed. Resourceful and dogged in his pursuit of success as well as happ(y)ness, he never resorts to self pity even at the lowest points (sleeping in a public toilet, bathing his son in a sink at a homeless shelter.) And like any parent under stress he occasionally cracks and loses his temper with his vulnerable young son, but as a good parent he pulls himself together and shields the child as much as he can.<br/><br/>Will Smith is remarkable in this movie. I've always liked the guy, who seems affable and clever, but this movie proves that he is an excellent actor. It's a very honest and engaging performance which draws even the most cynical of viewers in completely. I thought it was a terrific performance. Also remarkable is Smith's real-life son Jaden Smith playing his son in the movie. The child is just wonderful.<br/><br/>It looks as if most of this movie was made on location in San Francisco, and I thought the cinematography as excellent. The location shooting worked well to give the film an authentic feel, with mostly natural light, suitably grimy exteriors etc.<br/><br/>One small gripe; the sound track. Intrusive sound tracks are really becoming one of my bêtes noir. Just at a moment when everything seems blackest for Chris, and we wonder if he can possibly keep going, a bright, zippy, zingy little piece of music intrudes so we know in advance that everything is going to be OK. This drives me nuts, and in this movie, it ruins several moments of tension, signalling as it does, an upbeat outcome in advance of the resolution. A movie should succeed or fail on the basis of its performances and its writing, and the performances and writing here are very good. Good enough to carry the dramatic moments of the movie without advance guidance from the music. But overall  a pretty fair Friday Night Movie."

I can say that I was inspired to do more in life to help the unfortunate. I have a direct relation to this movie by way of the Glide church in which my cousin is the pastor.

","I found this movie distasteful, offensive and down right horrible.<br/><br/>For starters having Will Smith with his son in this role showing all the viewers that money and wealth equals happiness left me feeling very affronted.<br/><br/>As for other issues don't get me started except to say this film was filled with patronizing and condescending rot that belittles every person who watches this film I am just hoping that a sizable chunk of his fee (which I am sure would be millions) was donated to some worthy cause to help the homeless but you know what I doubt that very much.<br/><br/>Will Smith ...

","Will Smith's acting saved this movie from a zero rating. If you're feeling too happy one day, see this movie -- it'll get you back to being depressed.<br/><br/>The movie is almost 2 hours long with the plot continually going from a bad situation to a worse situation until you're wondering why he just doesn't end it all.<br/><br/>One critic stated that he liked the fact that Will Smith wasn't going for an Oscar with this one --- he sure wasn't with the plot.

"superduperspit","6","1","5","20 December 2006"," Smith breathes life into his film in a way few actors have this year, though ultimately this is a predictable pursuit
","When a big, likable star goes ""serious,"" it seems that everyone must pay attention. This is the case with ""The Pursuit of Happiness,"" (yes, ""Happiness"" with a ""y"") where box office superstar Will Smith ditches the action hero get-up and the comedic angle of ""Hitch"" for a serious turn as a real person. Due mostly to his superstardom and the fact that he hasn't tapped into this kind of role (or at least not recently), Smith is getting early awards attention for his role, as distributor Sony is pulling out all the stops to assure the star his second nod (following his revelatory turn as Muhammad Ali in Michael Mann's engaging but overstuffed 2001 biopic ""Ali""), and Oprah Winfrey has also jumped on board in support of the star.<br/><br/>In spite of the movie's insane predictability, Will Smith makes the whole ordeal work. His on-screen charisma and likability add to a performance that shows his entire range as a dramatic actor, which was unknown in his previous roles. He carries the movie from start-to-finish, successfully giving the audience a likable hero to cheer for. It's certainly a powerhouse performance, and he pulls it off convincingly enough for the movie to click. It's really Smith's movie, and he ends up doing a lot with it. While it's not his best role (a title that still goes to his portrayal of Muhammad Ali), it's certainly among the top of his career. As far as effort and skill goes, this is arguably Smith's most ambitious turn to date, and he is in every way the movie's ""MVP."" The decision to cast his son Jaden as Gardner's son in the film was very wise, as the two have perfect chemistry, believably playing out the father-son relationship. Sadly, the rest of the cast is flat, even the usually dependable Thandie Newton, who is annoying and somewhat miscast as Gardner's wife.<br/><br/>As was said before, it's Smith's performance that carries the movie, elevating it from average mediocrity and making its flaws less visible. The script gives way to strong material for Smith, but not really for anyone else. To be honest, the rest of the characters seem like the kinds that are just randomly tossed into the film for filler purposes. The film also spends so much time on Gardner's personal conflicts that there's never really much insight on what he had to do to get the job. The audience is supposed to take the Dean Witter big-wigs at their word that Chris is diligent and- more importantly- the best choice for the job, as there is very little time spent on what he must do to earn the job. The musical score is also overly obvious and derivative, and it ends up getting in the way of important scenes. (For example, an inspirational tune plays in the background while Gardner advises his son to ""never let anyone tell him he can't do something"").<br/><br/>The one thing that ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" sadly cannot be redeemed for is its constant predictability. Though it has to be expected (if the movie didn't end like about nine out of ten people who will see this movie think it will, there would be no reason for its existence), there isn't a whole lot in the film that cannot be seen coming from a mile away. Though the real Chris Gardner's story is uplifting and inspirational, it- like all such stories- doesn't transfer over to celluloid as well as it sounds when told in the form of a book or a news segment. Granted, it's not as annoying or tedious as other such ""triumph of the human spirit"" films, but anyone who sees the film will pretty much know what to get going in. It helps that it's easy to feel good for Gardner given his reasons for what he does and that he achieves it not only for himself, but for his son. However, that still doesn't change the fact that it seems to load up on the clichés and provide very few surprises, though it still somehow manages to stay likable and appealing in spite of its flaws.<br/><br/>For the most part, ""Pursuit of Happiness"" clicks. After it's past the 45-minute mark, it moves quickly and is an appealing, mildly uplifting movie, though the ending is abrupt and it takes a while to really get going. It's being sold as a ""feel-good film,"" and though the movie tries its hardest to depress the audience for the first 105 minutes before lifting its spirits in the last five, it's a safe bet that audiences will walk out feeling good for what Gardner has achieved. Though it's not really anything special, Will Smith does a very nice job, and as such, single-handedly makes it a reasonably good way to spend two hours. Essentially, Smith takes his trademark life and breathes it into the film in a way that few (if any) actors have managed to accomplish this year. For that- if nothing else- ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is worth a look.<br/><br/>Review by W. Slinger, written for film site www.boxofficefanatic.com"
"dunmore_ego","4","1","6","5 January 2007"," Dispiritying, Disheartenying, Distressying.
","*The Pursuit of Happiness* needs to take a Prozac.<br/><br/>Relentlessly depressing, director Gabriele Muccino's first English feature film is Inspired by a True Story - which only inspires nausea with their ubiquity these days - and though its intent is to be a ""feel-good"" movie, it goes awry in its execution, paying such sadistic detail to every mishap, misfortune and misstep of its hero that it loses all semblance of entertainment. (And why that annoying ""y""? We find that there is nothing intriguing in the misspelling of ""Happiness,"" simply a reference to graffiti on his son's day care center wall.)<br/><br/>Will Smith trades his Actionman for an Everyman, playing Chris Gardner, a late-thirty-something in 1981 San Francisco, with a Bitching Wife and Convenient Kid. Gardner is a bone density scanner salesman  as hard to sell as they sound  he investing his life savings purchasing them on spec, only to have his prospective clients (hospitals) consider them unnecessary icing; hence, to pay the 3-month-late rent and offer his five-year-old son better opportunities, whilst trying to pay bills with the few-and-far sales of scanners (simultaneously his albatross and his bread), Gardner gambles on a long shot, a six-month non-paying broker's internship which may lead to financial stability  if he is chosen over hundreds of more qualified applicants. A Rubik's Cube comes to his rescue. True? Who knows  but it was fun to see that old demon puzzle resurrected. <br/><br/>Thandie Newton is Bitching Wife, almost a caricature, providing emotional baggage when necessary and excised when she might start convoluting the plot with realistic action or threatening Will Smith's screen time. Smith's real son, Jaden, is Convenient Kid, with nothing noteworthy to offer (except maybe his *Boondocks* hairdo), who only once acts like a real kid  when he irrationally screams to be let into a hotel room they've been evicted from; otherwise ambivalently following his father into destitution with nary a whimper for ice cream and dangerous toys. Dan Castellaneta is the intern trainer, not being very Homer Simpson about it.<br/><br/>Over the course of Gardner's internship, he loses his wife, his car, his friends, his apartment, his shoe, and at various intervals, his scanners (for which he must pour on the Will Smith Sprint to recover them from thieving hippies  Smith spends so much time in full stride, it almost becomes *The Pursuit of Bone Density Scanners*); his one constant is his son, for whom he is enduring this hell. When is this guy going to catch a break?<br/><br/>Yet we are never allowed to consider that Gardner just might be irresponsible in pursuing a six-month dream which may end in failure through no fault of his own, instead of simply bellying up as a McDonalds cashier. You need to feed your son NOW, Horatio Alger! While pretending solvency to appear well-adjusted  at one point surrendering his last five bucks to a millionaire boss who forgot his wallet  Gardner and son spend the night in flophouses, homeless shelters and on the streets, at one point sleeping in a railway public toilet, leg propped against door to stop people entering. Smith's acting takes us to this place, with such a traumatic look of dejection and loss and fear for his son's wellbeing that the insistent knocking on the door becomes scarier than any axe-murderer or twenty-foot bug. <br/><br/>Apparently there's a message to this onerous exercise: follow your dreams and don't listen to anybody who says you can't. In which ten billion Disney movies have we heard that before? Trouble is, we'll never hear from the millions who actually go Gardner's route and fail. That's a reality too, more so than Gardner's.<br/><br/>*The Pursuit of Happiness* is a badly-made film of an inspiring story just waiting to be made into a formulaic film.<br/><br/>Smith's occasional unnecessary voice-over is like some kind of perverse attempt at irony. When he's running, he informs us, ""This part of my life, I call 'running'""; when he's riding the bus, he cleverly intones, ""This part of my life is called 'riding the bus.'"" It ain't irony if it is what it is. His voice-over laments, ""Maybe happiness is something that we can only pursue and never have."" ""When I'd get an A on a test, I'd get this good feeling about all the things I could be  and I never became any of them."" <br/><br/>Welcome to the real world, Chris.<br/><br/>We are shown so much misery (Gardner has to sell his blood to pay for a bulb for his scanner, he spends a night in jail for parking tickets, after painting his apartment for free for his landlord, then having to attend his first broker interview in paint-smeared rags  and on it goes) that by the time the movie tries to perk us up with the mandatory upbeat ending, it comes too late and we don't want to forgive it. Who can blame us? <br/><br/>A text screen informs us Gardner became a multi-millionaire. With his gamble paying off, Voice-over Gardner informs us that ""this is called happiness."" So money DOES buy it<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)"

","So many reviews (600+) and only about the first/top thirty get read/acknowledged. I'm not sure I saw the film the same way as others. The kid (Jadeen Smith) was great. The father seemed to be a con man, as if a continuation of ""Six Degrees of Separation"". There were not enough scenes of connecting with his son and too many of him being short (angry) that I would have thought the child would be conflicted as to where he stood. Then there was no satisfactory showing how things changed, if they did, once success was achieved. Was the relationship better? Were they spending quality time together or did the 'pusuit of happiness' continue to interfere?"
"abduali-68802","8","0","1","7 August 2015"," A great Movie. Inspirational Movie
","""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is one of the best movies of all time in which Will Smith plays a character of a single father struggling to earn a living faces numerous hardship. This movie is directed by Gabriele Muccino was released on 2006. It is very heart touching and inspirational. It is sure to make you cry. Will Smith is a natural actor who has brought his character in this movie to life. He has justified his character and proved that no one could ever match up to his grace.<br/><br/>The character of Will Smith as a Christopher Gardner, a salesman struggling to make ends meet for his wife (Thandie Newton) and son (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith). As the family faces financial crisis, his wife leaves him abandoning her son. The pressure for survival of Christopher and his son becomes intense. He runs from here and there to arrange food and shelter. He even sells his own blood for living. This scene was heart breaking. Tears rolled of my eyes while watching this movie.<br/><br/>It has shown how a father would work endlessly to fulfill his responsibility. It has also shown how the miserable life can be when luck does not favor you. In spite of tough luck, hard work and focused determination can bring back luck in your life is what the movie is about as it ends with a happy ending when the never-ending tries of Christopher finally pays off making him a wealthy businessman. After watching the movie, I get insight to work hard in life. I rated this movie 8 out of 10 for being the best inspiration movie for me."
"CinematicInceptions","8","0","1","4 August 2015"," Inspiring, emotional, and well done story.
","I don't know that this can be considered a feel-good movie. It has a happy ending, which is kind of inevitable given the title, but almost nothing leading up to that point is terribly happy. It feels a lot like the Shawshank Redemption or 127 Hours since the protagonist's final victory is so genuine because of how much the protagonist has been through. It also helps make the happy ending be much less clichéd and less insulting to the audiences' intelligence. In fact, if you take out the ending, it turns out to be a pretty depressing movie.<br/><br/>The main complaint that seems to surround this movie is that Chris Gardener's mission seems too money based. This bothered me at first too, but I took a step back and realized that it's not quite as much about money as it seems. The initial stock brokerage scene is the only scene where the money=happiness concept is really present. We see that Chris is struggling to make ends meet, and, with the setting being corporate America, this means that he needs a more substantial income. So really his constant need for cash is just that: a need. His joy at the end is probably more a result of his hard work finally paying off than the thought of being ""rich"". <br/><br/>I know that the story deviates a bit chronologically from how Chris Gardener's life actually panned out. This is a common occurrence in non-fiction movies, and it sometimes doesn't work out well, but I thought it did here. I'm not sure what was different about how the movie pulled off the story element differently, but it just came off as a story and not a less interesting sequence of events. One explanation might be that the story is also about Chris's relationship with his son and Chris's struggle as a single dad. In another dimension, it's about social mobility and just how much it can pay off to jump on the opportunities that come our way and to be as self-sufficient as possible.<br/><br/>Chris Gardener is a pretty likable and realistically written main character with some great lines. Will Smith gives a believable performance and shows us the many sides and emotions of our protagonist. The chemistry between him and Jadon Smith was great, as can be expected since they are the roles they play. I thought Christopher Jr. was really well scripted in that his character was as smart as someone of his relative age would plausibly be. Jadon has that kind of mumbling quality that a lot of little kids have in their voices, but he's still coherent. Jay Twistle and the Dean-Whitter employers are sort of the dramatic conflict since their program and its rigors are the main challenge that Chris has to overcome, but none of the characters themselves are portrayed as villainous. You can believe that they are as human as the guy sitting next to you. Linda Gardener is a relatively minor character, and you could make an argument that her relationship with Chris wasn't sufficiently developed.<br/><br/>There's not much to say with the execution. I really liked the piano theme song, and felt like the sequence of the scenes was well done. The directing acting is solid and even superior at a few points. But this is a movie that isn't about great technical feats, just as long as they aren't noticeably bad. Still, it was nice to see the filmmakers make a sincere effort.<br/><br/>If you're in a bad mood, don't watch this movie unless you plan on finishing it in one sitting. If you don't like nonfiction movies, I would advise that you put aside your conventional perception of that genre going into this. It's relatively family friendly, but there are a few pretty emotional moments and it definitely isn't family geared. If you're looking for something inspirational, it fits the bill in a number of different ways. Overall Rating 8.3/10."

It might partially be a true story but it is a very exceptional one and even though it's of course nicer to watch something like this I personally feel that this movie pretends to be a deep going and biographic movie while actually only being a feel-good flick for the idea that everybody can make it if they try and work hard enough."

I read what the story was about only when I got back home from the mall, and it didn't get me interested at all. Probably partially that is because I more like action movies. Now I can say how wrong I was! When I got to watch it, I was into the story from the first five minutes. I really praise the acting in the film. Will was amazing. In this movie I finally got to know him as a great dramatic actor. I cannot speak of a single scene in the movie that seemed fake to me. The relationship between the son and dad couldn't be fake because Will and Jaden are the actual son and dad. Nevertheless, they both did a great job showing the real affection to each other.<br/><br/>This movie being based on the true story proved again that everyone can achieve a lot in one's life. One important thing is to have the goal and be ready to pull out all the stops to achieve it despite what people might say to you or what the obstacles are.

","Why write a review when there are 551 already written on the same film ? Well, what pushes 550 people to write yet another review on a film that has been publicized everywhere and that everyone knows about ? That would be rather pointless, wouldn't it? And so TPoH is a seriously pointless film; Chris Gardner (Will ""Welcome to Planet Earth"" Smith) is your average college hippy, who has a brilliant idea, gets married, and rather rapidly becomes flat broke on the grounds of his brilliant idea being ""bollocks"", as Blackadders would say; Reduced to misery, and left by his wife to raise his child, Gardner gives his best shot at success by joining a trainee stockbroker program, all the while trying to scrounge a living; The focus of the film is a good 90% on how Gardner tries to appear a clean cut, serious businessman to his clients and bosses while actually being a miserable wretch. Then, through mostly chance, and maybe a very small amount of human talent - of which we all have some - actually lands the job.<br/><br/>Then why ? <br/><br/>Why make a film about it? This man is not, in any way better than any of us, or even better than any other stockbroker (joke); My guess is that mr Welcome to Earth wanted a platform to win an Oscar with.

If only he stuck to comedy, Smith *might* have a claim to being a serious actor, but trying to be a serious actor, he shot himself in the foot...<br/><br/>Awesome film to bring your girlfriend to, extremely boring and uninspiring for anyone else, except maybe children, who watching this might want to become a - white, preppy, high class - stockbroker.<br/><br/>5/10, for having a script as entertaining as waiting in line at the toll booth."

"nturner","8","0","1","8 November 2008"," An Excellent Film Made Better by Watching It at Home
","I have a running debate with friends and family as to whether it is better to watch a film in the theater or at home. I almost never go to movies in theaters because they cost a small fortune, and I am usually beset by some rude person or persons who spoil my enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness is another positive to my side of the discussion because of the extra features available on the DVD.<br/><br/>The story is of the real Chris Gardner who overcame great obstacles in order to become a successful multi-millionaire. All the while following through with his pledge to be a good father - not absent as was his own. I have seen Chris Gardner in a number of interviews on television. He is a dynamic personality who has achieved phenomenal accomplishments. Therefore, this unbelievable story is really true.<br/><br/>Will Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Chris Gardner, and he certainly deserves the acknowledgment. But, in my mind, he deserves even more acknowledgment for giving his star power for this project that would have probably been overlooked by the Hollywood powers-that-be.<br/><br/>The first thing that Smith did - as co-producer of the film - was to hand pick Italian director Gabriele Muccino. Smith had seen two of his films and was entranced by Muccino's ability to project real human feelings to the screen. He was certainly right because the director shows us real people and real emotions in every character.<br/><br/>I read the thoughts of one reviewer who thought that this film suffered from the fact that it had a big budget - because of Will Smith's star power - and would have been better as a low-budget independent film. He makes the statement that the homeless extras in the film look too slick to really be homeless. The irony is that the homeless characters in the film were really homeless people hired to perform in the film. He would have done well to investigate the actual production of the film.<br/><br/>Because of the big budget, the viewer is treated to the real locations in the life of Chris Gardner. This is something that could not have been accomplished in a film with a lower budget.<br/><br/>In the DVD extras, the director states - this was for me, an enlightening theory. He says that the American Dream is not fully understood by citizens of the United States, therefore he, as an Italian, can better express the full ramifications of what the American Dream actually is. In other words, the American Dream is a reality and it is available for anyone who seeks its promise. Considering the state of our country today, those are certainly encouraging words.<br/><br/>Here, I hark back to my opening paragraphs. This is an excellent film made even better by watching it at home and enjoying the extra features available on the DVD."

"PersianPlaya408","10","0","1","26 July 2008"," Spectacular Drama, Smith shines
","This movie is Will Smith's coming of age type role in my opinion. Its a good transition for him from a leading action star, to an actor who has proved he is capable of delivering complex and very human performances, rather than just dealing with comedic/alien roles. This film is not only a tale of human triumph, the troubles of poverty, but it is also a very good example on people who can slip through the cracks in the states, as well as some of the negatives of the social system and welfare programs in the US. The film doesn't make many judgments, but has some very good subtle messages, and personally i took a lot from this film as well being very entertained, emotionally rattled and ultimately cared for the characters. One of the best dramas in recent years. IMDb Rating: 7.8. My Rating: 10/10"

It was also nice to see his son Jaden give such a believable performance on screen. <br/><br/>The only thing I did not like about the movie is the fact that there was upbeat music during many of the scenes that could have been more intense (ie. when Christopher loses Cpt.

"Sheldonshells","10","0","1","5 July 2008"," One of the Best from this Decade
","Probably one of the better films of the 2000s, this picture of getting what you give is one of the best films I've ever seen. On the surface, one may take it as a formulaic rags to riches story, and truly that's one of the things it is, but there is certainly more to it than that. Since many other accolades have been given to this great film already, I'll mention some things from an angle that is often ignored or just plainly not seen at all.<br/><br/>In an era when fathers seem to want to be more directly involved in their children's lives than ever, there's a readymade contradiction that their role is somehow inferior to the mother's role. This film, with its poignant examination of a father's relationship with his child, helps put a few holes in that notion (and it helps that it was based on a true story). This is a rare, serious, film that offers the idea that the father may in fact be the better parent, a somewhat bold move. In the family law system, father's needs and rights are often neglected, dismissed as unimportant, or just plainly trampled over. In many ways, current family law discriminates against fathers, precipitating the need for a father's rights movement. The first film that might be viewed as a vouch for that movement was Kramer vs Kramer back in 1979, with Hoffman's character's often overlooked statement on how if women can be financially as capable as men, then men should be as emotionally capable (i.e. with their children) as women. Mr. Mom followed, with Micheal Keaton playing one of film history's first househusbands. Now, in this decade, there's a film that beats the latter and even rivals the former. And importantly, a black father is represented as a nurturing and involved dad; let's hope it provides one nail in the coffin of that ridiculous and played out macho, gangsta, black male image you strangely still see all the time in the media.<br/><br/>Beyond those more heavy considerations, the film's two leads play their roles so expertly that it almost seems like they really are father and sonoh, whoops, they are (I'm sure someone else made this stupid joke already, but really I did not just copy someone else who has already done it in a review). Oh well, they still make some memorable moments together. Among the more poignant scenes is one where Smith's character reaches rock bottom and is forced to sleep in subway bathroom with his son, but he musters up enough strength to keep the boy amused and excited, taking advantage of a child's active imagination to do so. Young Smith also has a knack for acting subtle emotions, such as in the scene where he wants his dad to buy him a chocolate bar but understands the his dad might not be able to afford it. Such subtle acting at such a young age is impressive. Seeing Will Smith in something other than an action film is also refreshing (the last time I saw him in a non-action film was Six Degrees of Separation back in the mid 90s. The movie also has many humorous and clever moments, adding to the overall enjoyment.<br/><br/>The only depressing thing about this film is that he is striving to attain a job as a stockbroker. To me, despite being financially rewarding, that would be one bleak and abysmaland highly highly stressful existence (despite the smiles Smith's character sees on their faces near the beginning of the film). But to remove my tongue from my cheek for a moment, it's better than living in poverty with a five year old boy. At least he's not striving to be an accountant, or trying to get an MBA (well, my tongue's natural place is in my cheek anyway). <br/><br/>More than just a rags to riches story (even though it is engaging on that count) it also reveals that a father can love just as much, and sometimes better, than a mother. It's a much needed wake up call for awareness of the father as an intelligent and capable good man. Looking at most movies and TV shows these days, depressingly you don't see a lot of that, a direct assault on the new reality of many fathers. Hopefully this film will be a harbinger for more good depictions of men and fathers on screen."
"jpschapira","7","0","1","4 July 2008"," Good.Period.
","I've mentioned in many occasions that sometimes it's good to let yourself go with a film, let yourself carry away by a story even when you know exactly what's going to happen. Well, if you know movies, you'll realize that you know the whole development of ""The pursuit of happiness"" when the film begins. Of course, it's such a touching film that I don't even have to recommend that you let yourself go, because it will come automatically.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner (Will Smith) is a fighter who wants the best for his family and tries hard to get it but apparently is not enough. His wife (an overacted Thandie Newton), incapable of dealing with the poverty they're immersed in, leaves him. Chris doesn't make much (in fact he's due with the rent and there are scenes where he just has five dollars in his wallet and he has to run from a taxi driver because he can't pay), wants to keep his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) who goes to a caretaker that has the word ""happyness"" misspelled on a wall. ""It's with an I"", he tells the janitor. Chris deserves a shot like the one he eventually gets. <br/><br/>A movie like this one needs to establish familiarities, because it's about family, and probably Gabriele Muccino, whose wonderful ""Ricordati di me"" deals with family, was a wise choice for the job. He shoots the city, accompanying Chris in his endeavors and takes the time to show us iconic characters that will appear from time to time throughout the film; like a bump who thinks a product Chris sells is a time machine, or a couple of hippies who steal this product from him. Muccino also makes sure that we believe the father-son relationship that defines the film, filming the kid with tenderness, as we see a shot of him walking alongside his father, but we see the kid's face and body and only the father's waist and feet. <br/><br/>But it would have been the same if Muccino hadn't paid attention to this 'family' issue, because the chemistry between Will Smith and his son is instantaneous, natural and the main reason to watch the movie. Smith, a charismatic, versatile and popular actor, gives here what I can simply define as a winning performance; because he wins as an actor by fulfilling a new challenge, his character wins in the story, and he wins the audience, that is amazed by scenes in which Smith and his son, and no one else, generate magic. <br/><br/>Going back to what started this review, I ask: does it matter that ""The pursuit of happiness"" is inspired by a true story? Yes, because it instantly changes the perspective of the viewer, who will deliberate how 'true' the events presented are. I believe that if I'm going to let myself go, a movie has to be fair with me; this means it has to keep things between the limits of reality, and if things happen that are too unreal, there only has to be few of them. <br/><br/>""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is unfair to the viewer, because it plays with him by repeating situations that at some point he has to stop believing; or at least that's how I felt. Is it possible that man doesn't find a pen in his own house after his wife has taken everything and has to go to a store around the block to write a number down? Yes, it's possible, but I couldn't find it believable after all the similar extreme situations that the film's main character had been constantly going through before that exact moment. <br/><br/>I don't think this is a bad or a regular movie; I think it's a good movie. Period. Could it have been great? I really don't care, because the fact that it's based on a true life story and Smith's performance make it more moving, and because Steve Conrad finds a great help in the narrated parts of his script, that make the repetitive parts of the movie seem less repetitive. <br/><br/>Also, I don't doubt the real Chris Gardner went through all these things; maybe it was just too much to include in a two-hour movie."

"alhooky","3","0","1","9 May 2008"," Vacuous and misguided
","This film has left a bad taste in my mouth. Not so much the direction, photography or acting, but the story and screenplay. This is meant to be the story of a man who struggles against adversity to find happiness. What it transpires to be is the story of an irrational human putting himself and his family at risk in search of money - not happiness per se. Peppered along the way is some terrible, clichéd sound-bites for his son - ""if you see something you want, take it!"". In the end his gamble pays off and he lands a well-paid job, the end! The assumption that his procuring a well-paid job is intrinsically leads to a happy life for the protagonist and his son is naive and shallow in the extreme and makes the time spent watching the film feel like a brain-washing session for the corporate American 'dream'.<br/><br/>On the plus side there is some nice photography in this film, and it's always fun to see eras from the recent past portrayed on film. But don't expect a feel-good film if your moral centre lies nearer your brain than your wallet."

Yet, there are too many cases of disillusionment, he succeeded and congratulations to him, but that's not about every one. I gather that the happiness (or happiness) here means that he is out of monetary plight. My more serious question: has his wife returned to stay with him and the kid? Personally I don't want to be any Chris Gardner because happiness is so difficult, so cruel to obtain. In my own experience (I did had hardship/difficult time in life), after so much hard time, I don't feel especially ""happy"" when the hardship's gone or when what I wanted came to me, the only feeling was, and always was ""tired"" and ""exhausted"" but not happy."

In fact, he's the main reason to watch this film because I felt the rest of the movie falls flat on its ass. The film is a certain type of tearjerker but it's one of those films that I'd call a tearjerker-off. I really didn't like the character Smith played and in fact, I couldn't give a damn if he got his dream job or not.

","I have been running businesses for over 25 years now, and until today I never formally recommended that employees see a movie.<br/><br/>This is the story of anyone who has had to overcome great obstacles to achieve success in the US. For some of us, it is a medical limitation; for others, family situations. Chris Gardner dealt with his obstacles without ever losing his optimism. He never whined or asked for special treatment. He never played on his race. He got up ever morning and did what he had to do to improve his family's lot in life. And, in real life, he succeeded.<br/><br/>Now some have knocked this movie because it exemplified to them our American need to achieve success through career and money. I say those people never had either. Life's failures will look at this movie and see that they didn't have Chris' drive or brains. They gave up their dreams for far less imposing obstacles.<br/><br/>Finally, I find it interesting that this movie was not one of those shown to schoolchildren, whereas ""victims"" movies like GREAT DEBATERS and even SCHINDLER'S LIST were.

It was a simple movie really, one about a father's unwaivering love for his son, and absolute refusal to give up. It was also all about not blaming others for your misfortune, but doing something about it and improving your own life through your own efforts for the sake of your family and yourself. This was by far my favorite performance from Will Smith. It was a radical departure from his usual smart-alec tough guy role, and was very deep and human.

","Great acting and performances - fine script and dialogue - looks authentic 1981. But something just didn't work for me. I think I finally figured that it was the punchline. This is fundementally an 'American Dream' movie - nothing wrong in that, the American Dream is one of the greatest things in the world. What just doesn't gel for me in this is the version of the American dream that is sold - the greatfulness to get a zero paid job to work in a boiler room (albeit for a major player) the ceasing cheerfulness of the main character in the face of a world stacked against him. Then after all that - just the one line on the screen at the end - ""and he sold his company in a multi million deal"". I guess the gritty reality is kind of the point, and the magic line about the knowing to put the word 'pursuit of' infront of happiness as a right underlines this. But to me the movies end tries to marry the gritty reality we have just watched (and was very well presented) with the equivalent of the fairy tale 'and they all lived happily ever after' - there is just something about the ending that didn't feel right in the context of the rest of the story. So for me it let itself down right at the last. Glad others did enjoy it though. There are some gems in this script."

I can't think of a better actor than Will Smith to deliver this message either, because his existence is testimony to the fact that it's not who you know or what you know, but how you look. This film has everything: a male eye-candy actor delivering a powerful, phantom message to a receptive audience that loves those who tell it what it wants to hear.<br/><br/>Charles Gardner is living proof that if you don't rock the boat, don't rat out those who break the law, and are an activist on issues that have no true opposition (who is in favor of poverty?), you'll be revered for taking a nonexistent stand, and rewarded for being a useful pawn of the powerful and corrupt. Watching this film, you'd think racism and sexual harassment were historical artifacts, and that the reason whistleblowers have little or nothing to fear is that there simply are no more whistles to blow because the world is now a happy place where everyone does the right thing.<br/><br/>The fact is, had Gardner ever become a true whistleblower, ever compalined about the massive sexual harassment in the culture that made him rich, ever complained (as in filed suit over) racial disparity, or ever blown a whistle on any dishonest people in his industry, his success story never would have been told because it never would have happened, as his career would have stopped on a dime. It's not like he or anyone else who climbs the Wall Street ladder doesn't know this; after all, someone with mouths to feed can't go around getting themselves fired for doing the right thing or standing up to evil. Better to just play along, cash in by being silent, and then leave those who fight the system to starve so that eventually they'll shut up. There is nothing wrong with what Gardner did in bettering his life, but there was nothing right with it either. Right would have required far more. You didn't see Martin Luther King cashing in on government contracts instead of protest marching, but I guess in this day and age all problems are solved and there is nothing left to protest, so it's all good.<br/><br/>As a white male who has confronted racists and sexual harassers in the workplace, and wound up blacklisted in retaliation by many of the same people that both Gardner and Smith call friends and do business with themselves, I cannot begin to explain the awful place God must have reserved for these two who dare to attach morality to their greed and career opportunism, as if them getting rich by rewarding don't-snitch behavior somehow meant that the world were suddenly a better place. I suppose when one is wealthy, they have to downplay injustice and their own cowardice in refusing to fight, because otherwise they might actually have to pitch in, offend the corrupt, and actually fight for something.<br/><br/>Will Smith and Charles Gardner are nothing more than wealthy cowards, men whose mark on this world will not include any victories over our true evils, but rather a messge from them, through this movie, that your problems are your own doing, including any problems that may have been caused by you being too stupid to realize that in this society, to get ahead, you must not nnitch, for even if you are homeless and shirtless, and with far less skills than any fired whistleblower, Wall Street will hire you as long as it does not consider you a threat to rat them out.<br/><br/>I can almost picture Will Smith arrogantly pontificating in Oprah's chair again like he once did when he toyed with the idea of becoming President one day, speaking of ""haters"" and how ""negative"" it is to point out things like this, yet to folks like Martin Luther King, the negative people were the ones who stood down in the face of injustice and stood on the sidelines because it was simply more profitable to do so.<br/><br/>Like it or not, when it comes to standing up against racism, I am blacker than Gardner or Smith will ever be, but that is also why I am not richer. I am viewed as a traitor to my own race, which didn't surprise me, but that the race I ""betrayed"" my own race to help didn't seem to want that help, did. It was then that I realized that Black is a state of mind, not a skin color."
"jboothmillard","6","0","3","8 July 2007"," The Pursuit of Happiness
","Based on a true story, this is quite a good drama showing the traumas of poverty and homelessness, and how it affects family life. Basically it is the 1980's, and Chris Gardner (Oscar (the only one) and Golden Globe nominated Will Smith) is currently a struggling salesman who once a month sells hospitals little needed medical bone density scanners, and because of failing to make a decent living, his wife Linda (Crash's Thandie Newton) leaves him with their son, Christopher (introducing Smith's real life son, Jaden Smith). Chris then has the inspiration to become a stockbroker, where he has a one in twenty chance for a full time (and paid) career. Meanwhile, he and Christopher are living as best they can on whatever they can get their hands on, as long as he can keep selling his scanners (and not have them nicked). Their life starts to crumble though when they are forced out of their house, and are now homeless, with only the city shelter to go to. There is also a point when Christopher goes to prison. But their hope grows when he finally sells a scanner, that he had to mend, and he is more recognised at the company. In the end he achieves his dream, because he signed up the most companies (due to his never hanging up the company phone) and he is the company's new stockbroker, and a millionaire, the text at the end said he went on to more success. Also starring Brian Howe as Jay Twistle, James Karen as Martin Frohm, The Simpsons' Dan Castellaneta as Alan Frakesh and Scary Movie's Kurt Fuller as Walter Ribbon. I like Smith's narration, there are some small comedic moments, and the relationship between him and his real son is strong, I can agree the film does focus on more despair, but that is the point for this quite realistic biographical drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""A Father's Way"". Will Smith was number 51 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!"

","Will Smith was nominated for an Oscar in his role as Chris Gardner, a struggling medical device salesman in 1980s' San Francisco who one day gets the inspiration to better himself by becoming a stockbroker for Dean Witter Reynolds. Gardner is a real person who years later reaches his dream of fortune through his own investment firm, and even fame as a motivational speaker and philanthropist. <br/><br/>It all makes for an inspiring movie albeit a grueling one. Like The Last of the Mohicans, the lead character finds himself seemingly in a constant full runin Chris's case either to catch a bus, put a dime in the parking meter, pick up his son Christopher at day care, meet an appointment, prevent his landlord from evicting him, and so on. <br/><br/>When not running at full-tilt boogie, Gardner encounters one major obstacle after another. <br/><br/>Sales of his network-marketed portable bone scanner are slow (yet it doesn't stop a hippie chick or an old crazy man from trying to steal it), he's behind on the rent, his wife Linda (Thandie Newton) leaves him, his son's day care center pacifies the kids with daytime TV drivel and sugar treats, friends stiff him on debts they owe, the city impounds his car... and that's in the first five minutes!<br/><br/>Seriously, the movie does a fabulous job conveying the frustrations so many well-meaning lower-income people, particularly minorities, face as they try to get ahead. The IRS even attaches his meager bank account for back taxes! <br/><br/>And seeing a young man Jay Twistle (Brian Howe) emerge from a streetside beautiful red Ferrari, Gardner asks the man what he does. Stockbroker. He sees his break. He manages to convince Twistle to give him the opportunity to take the training course and become a fulltime stockbroker. Two problems: a) Gardner doesn't get paid for taking the course, and b) only 1 in 20 graduate to become employees.<br/><br/>Naturally, due to the extra time needed to study as well as to take care of his son, Gardner falls behind in other areas of life such as selling bone scanners. He's evicted and for a time becomes effectively homeless. A scene in the movie conveys the desperate condition of such people as he and his son fall into a line for The Cecil Williams Glide Community House simply to have a bed and three square meals for that day. ...<br/><br/>For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.<br/><br/>Brian Wright Copyright 2007"
"MOscarbradley","6","0","1","8 June 2007"," Believe it or not, this really happened!
","The misfortunes that befall Chris Gardner wouldn't seem out of place in a Victorian melodrama, (he's like Eliza on the ice), if it were not for the fact that they are all true, true in so far as the film is 'inspired by real events' which is a cop-out way of saying 'based on a true story'. Gardner is a classic example of the schmuck who made it, the Little Joe with Big Ambitions who went through every adversity and finally realized those ambitions. His was the ultimate 'rags-to-riches' story and it really happened. Did it happen quite like this? And even if it did, is it a story worth telling? I couldn't help wishing it were all fiction and they would embellish it in some way. There is only so much running around with x-ray machines and studying through the night by torchlight you can take.<br/><br/>The film is curiously unsentimental which may not be a bad thing, (better, I suppose, than the usual maudlin tear-jerkers Hollywood turns out), but in refusing to give in to cheap sentimentality it becomes strangely uninvolving. If you go to the movie knowing anything about Gardner you are unlikely to care to much how he makes it through.<br/><br/>The blame for that can hardly be laid at Will Smith's door. Smith makes Gardner a very real, very fallible human being, a 'good man' with enough genuine idiosyncrasies that he never comes across as totally likable either. He's the kind of man you might not want to have to sit down and have dinner with. The closest the film comes to being an honest tear-jerker is at the end when Smith's elation is only fractionally removed from a kind of breakdown. It's a wonderfully moving moment, the best in the film, and those few seconds alone were probably enough to give Smith a crack at the Oscar. Otherwise, it's just another 'inspirational' movie, a kind of poor man's ""Kramer versus Kramer"", (wife leaves him; he has to bring up his little boy alone), with too many soaring, up-lifting ballads on the soundtrack."

","I've never been in a cinema before where the audience cheered and applauded at the climax of a film (...and not because they were glad it was over!!). I don't mind admitting that it brought me to tears, and judging by the other snuffles in the cinema, I wasn't the only one.<br/><br/>Will Smith plays this part incredibly, and maybe playing alongside his own son helped him have an empathy with the character. If you are a parent then I suspect you will have to be pretty hard-hearted not to be empathise too.<br/><br/>Just when you think the character's fortune couldn't take another turn for the worse - it does. The fact that this isn't purely fiction makes it all the more heart-wrenching. Even knowing that it must have a happy ending, you just can't possibly see how it can come about.<br/><br/>Any film that makes me want to discover more about the real life characters behind the film is always a sign of success for me. This film & the true story it tells is truly inspiring."

","This movie is poignant, thought- provoking and much more. After i watched the movie i felt very emotional and threathened by not only how the main non-fictional protagonist handled his financial problems on a new and dramatic level, but also how he exhibited his determination and resilence on a extreme and positive level! you can't help but learn not just from chris who followed his dream and ingrained that mentality on his beautiful son, who also was a fighter and looked up to his father but, also the movie- how it shows the struggles and lows of chris and his family and the negative people (his evil wife- linda-ggrrr....i wanted to hit her!, the guy who he shown the cube puzzle to, who eventually turned out to be good and co-operative, the guy who he kept getting food and coffee for-gggrrr....a**hole!-seriously)chris encounters. It didn't bother him, at all, he still had to do what he had to do...no matter what! 'The Pursuit of Happiness' is a movie that is dramatic, too realistic and one that is impeccably acted and handled with empathy and care, by the brilliant man himself mr will smith, who showed so much anger and faith in himself and his talented real-life son who played his character so well with sadness and empathy.<br/><br/>i recommend this movie to anyone who wants to feel captivated and inspired by this true story of a movie!

","While ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is by no means a perfect film (it skirts more unpleasant issues such as racism in the workplace), it is nevertheless a moving, watchable true-life parable about the rough road towards achieving the American Dream. Will Smith is shockingly good as Chris Gardner, devoted father and aspiring stockbroker. He is recently homeless, has only a high school degree, and a five-year-old son (Jaden Christopher Smith) to support. Thankfully, Chris has pluck, charm and a childlike stubbornness in abundance. I don't know if the movie tell the real Chris Gardner's story 100% accurately, but I have no doubt ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" captures the seeming hopelessness of his situation and Gardner's spirit and dogged determination. A fine effort that makes you believe anything is possible."
"ingres77","9","0","1","27 April 2007"," The performance of the year, and a film to be enjoyed for years to come.
","I'm an unabashed sucker for feel-good movies. I'm not going to apologize for liking a movie that tugs at the heartstrings. Especially if it works.<br/><br/>And this movie does.<br/><br/>Simply: it's about a man who, along with his son, is abandoned by his wife because of financial difficulties. Having no prospects, he latches on to the idea of being a stock broker. He's highly intelligent, and driven, but lacks the education or experience to be taken seriously. Through force of will, he's accepted into an unpaid internship with a firm, but he's also forced into homelessness, because fighting for this internship doesn't allow him to work (except for some sales work on the weekends).<br/><br/>Oh, and it's ""inspired"" by a true story.<br/><br/>That's all I'll say about the plot.<br/><br/>This film works because it's not ""just"" a simple, heart-warming tale of a man's struggle to gain control of his life and pursue his dreams. That's not really what this film is. We've seen that film a hundred times.<br/><br/>No, this is about a man trying to understand his place in life, when the situation he's found himself in is so vastly different from what he feels his life could be, or should be. It's not just ""inspiring"", it's evocative. It's eye-opening.<br/><br/>This film works because it's emotionally honest. It goes beyond simplicity, and achieves a poignancy few films even strive for. And all through this film, Will Smith's brilliant portrayal gives the story a relevance it wouldn't have if another actor was in the roll. He shrugs off all the mannerisms and personality that has made him the biggest star in Hollywood (since the collapse of Tom Cruise, at least), and disappears into this movie.<br/><br/>Will Smith's performance is a tribute to everyone out there who's had far-reaching dreams, but never actually accomplished any of those goals. It's beyond ""inspiring"", because that's such a hackneyed description of a film. Film's are often called ""inspiring"" when they're really nothing more than derivative of other films that actually do instill some sense of the ""brotherhood of man"".<br/><br/>After watching this film, I found myself more aware of the people around me. More respectful of everyone else. I realize this feeling is only temporary, that I'll go back to being annoyed by people in my way at the grocery store. But for those fleeting moments after seeing this film, I liked people more. I wanted to help complete strangers have a good day.<br/><br/>And that effect far outstrips the great performance of Will Smith. This film dug through the cynicism and apathy in life, and touched the core of my being, inspiring me to be a better person.<br/><br/>And, ultimately, shouldn't more films strive to do that? Will Smith should have won an Oscar for this, and this film should have gotten nominated for Best Picture (I think it was better than Babel, though more conventional). This movie is the most emotionally powerful film since Brokeback Mountain, and the most inspiring movie I've seen since, perhaps, Life is Beautiful in 1997.<br/><br/>Thirty years from now, I think I'll love this film more than any other released this year."
"TwentyCalls","8","0","1","23 April 2007"," You are what you think about
","I'm a salesman myself and I can almost empathize with Gardner's struggle to achieve his dreams. Having a very strong desire to attain our goals and believing that we can do anything is so key to being successful. That's the inspirational message I drew from this movie.<br/><br/>I read several comments from others that criticize the film in its strong association of happiness to getting a job in a stock broking firm. Taken literally, I would have agreed. However, I like to believe that Gardner's happiness is not so much as to getting a job in the stock broking firm but in achieving a step in his goal. His goal was to be with his son and to provide for him. He could have gotten a job as a dishwasher and still make-do. But if man do not have big dreams, we might still be living in caves.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness is about the realization of a man's goal. He does that by simply programming in his mind that he can and must achieve it. When that's done, nothing can stop him - be it discouraging words from his wife, the financial difficulty he was in and the disadvantaged position compared to his peers. The mind will find the way.<br/><br/>I would have given it a 9 or a 10 but in many parts, I felt it was too dramatized and far-fetched."

Not in one of their best scene though (which plays in subway tunnel).<br/><br/>Will Smith himself, said in an EMPIRE (magazine) interview, that he was really fond of the idea of the movie. He said that you don't have the right to be happy, but the right to pursue it (which is written exactly in that matter in the Declaration of Independence by T. Jefferson).

This film was not about a guy struggling at the bottom to work his way up, it is about a guy clearly born under a lucky star where everything just went wrong in his life. Just as there seemed to be a glimmer of hope, it was all snatched away again. I hated this film, it was very very depressing, I had to switch it off in the end as I was thinking about topping myself.

","If you aren't totally familiar with the state of poverty and homelessness in America, then ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" will not only show you but shock you. It tells the true story of San Francisco scanner salesman Chris Gardner (Will Smith), who set about trying to get a job as an intern in a stock broker firm in the hopes of trying to show his son Christopher a better life.<br/><br/>What struck me more than the main story itself was what the misery that Chris and Christopher experience. They get evicted from one place after another and when they get to stay in a shelter, they have to listen to a preachy choir. All this and Reagan remained mired in optimism.<br/><br/>Is this a perfect movie? No, far from it. Large portions get kind of treacly, and it often seems like Chris and Christopher are a little too lucky. But overall, I thought that the movie did a good job showing how they know that they have to keep going even in the most desperate and difficult conditions. I recommend it.<br/><br/>Also starring Thandie Newton, James Karen (you've probably seen him in something) and Dan Castellaneta (that's right: Homer Simpson's voice artist!)."

"jluis1984","8","0","1","15 February 2007"," A really nice surprise...
","It seems like it was only yesterday when hip hop artist Will Smith decided to try his luck with acting on a sitcom named ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"", becoming a star thanks to his natural charm and talent for comedy. Soon after that, Smith proved to be a bankable movie star, thanks to a series of very successful action films, but it was only after his roles in ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" and in ""Ali"", when Smith started to be considered a serious actor. More than 15 years after ""The Fresh Prince"", Will Smith has finally proved that choosing acting over his singing career was a serious decision for him, and as he was not another singer playing himself. ""The Pursuit of Happiness"", a movie also produced by himself, is another step in that progression towards more serious roles that he has taken recently; and like in Ali, this movie inspired by a real story puts Smith's talent to test, and to the surprise of many, he succeeds.<br/><br/>""The Pursuit of Happiness"" is very loosely inspired in the autobiographic book by Chris Gardner. In the movie, Gardner (played by Smith) is an independent salesman constantly struggling to sell a sophisticated, but little needed medical equipment. After investing all his savings in this business, he finds himself troubled for the lack of sales, and constantly struggling to pay the bills. The situation becomes unbearable for her wife Linda (Thandie Newton), so she decides to leave him alone with his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and move to New York. Without a stable job and with a son to take care for, Gardner decides to try for a stockbroker internship, hoping to be able to be selected to get a full time job. However, he won't see any money while the internship takes place, so he'll have to face homelessness. together with his little son he'll have to find the courage to keep pursuing ""Happiness"".<br/><br/>While the movie is based on the Gardner's experiences written in his book, the script (by Steve Conrad) takes many liberties with the story. People expecting a true adaptation of the book will probably be disappointed by this, but Conrad's changes are really interesting; and while probably a bit too emotionally manipulative, they keep the spirit of Gardner's life story and most importantly: his inspiring message. Probably the biggest difference between the movie and the book is the change of Gardner's son Christopher from a baby to a 5 years old kid, and to make him his companion through the difficult lonely months of the internship. This was a very good addition in my opinion, as since in real life it was his son who inspired Chris to succeed, it made sense that in the movie their relationship was established in a more ""cinematic"" way than in the book.<br/><br/>Story says that director Gabriele Muccino was picked by producer Will Smith to direct this movie after watching his work in ""Ricordati Di me"" (2003) and ""L' Ultimo Bacio"" and it's not hard to discover why. As proved by his previous movies, Muccino has shown a taste for portraying stories of troubled men in his 30s struggling to overcome their own personal difficulties, as well as a talent for this kind of character driven dramas. Visually the movie really captures the atmosphere of the 80s (the movie is set in 1981), and has a somewhat gritty look that makes it feel very real, as if it was a documentary about this man's problems. However, Muccino's best trait is the way he directs his cast, as not only directs Will Smith's best performance so far, he also gets a remarkable (and very underrated) performance by Thandie Newton.<br/><br/>Will Smith has walked a long path to become who he is now, and is in this movie when he really shows what he is worth. His performance as Chris Gardner is breathtaking, frighteningly realist, and one of the best male performances of the year. Surprisingly, it never feels like he is playing himself (as it often happens in his action movies), as really becomes this intelligent yet troubled man decided to follow his dream. Smith's enormous improvement is so notorious that it overshadows Thandie Newton's own amazing performance, but Newton's turn as Gardner's wife is also a performance worth to talk about. In a bold move, Newton takes away her image as a sexy woman and appears as an unsatisfied working woman completely tired of Gardner's failures and tired of her own life. Finally, the supporting cast is really excellent, specially the young Jaden Smith (Will's real son), who gives a very natural and charming performance as Gardner's 5 years old son Christopher.<br/><br/>If the movie has any real problem is that it may appear to be too manipulative at times, specially to those aware of Gardner's real story as the changes seem to point out in that direction. However, I found those changes to be nice additions that actually made the movie to flow a bit more easily, and actually made the story not only inspiring, but also charming and funny at times. It's true that at first sight this movie looks like the typical ""underdog story"", but what makes ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" to stand out is the harsh realism the film has, specially in the scenes related to homelessness. It never romanticizes that sad situation and one can actually feel the real desolation of not having a place where to spend the night.<br/><br/>This movie is not a masterpiece of film-making, but it's definitely the film where Will Smith delivers his best performance so far. Many have said that the film advocates the idea of money as the source of happiness, but I disagree; what this movie advocates is the idea of a proper home as a source of happiness. The sad fact that money is needed for that is actually the point of this movie. 8/10"

I really cannot enjoy a movie in which you can tell from the very beginning how the story is going to end, how the characters are going to behave in every scene, what they are going to say. Such a movie does not leave much space for your own thoughts and ideas about the subject it tried to present. I deliberately used the verb ""tried"" because the way of filming definitely killed the message of it. Seeing this movie is a waste of time and money, I am afraid.

Talking about Will Smith I do have to say he doesn't seem to me that super-actor someone said, at least in this film. That Chris Gardner is really an unlucky man (in here I could say ""sfigato"" but I donnow the translation), every time he seems to rise up, it's a deeper fall down. And he's very stupid too...look at that leaving the scanner to a hippie! tsk! His wife (Tandie Newton) is so unpleasant that she seems almost a comic, not a person. And I do have to say her Italian dubbing was terrible. The lucky thing is Muccino fortunately didn't fall in his most defect: making actors scream like mad ones. This happens only once, but it's OK there. So, just to finish this, I didn't like this movie, it's only a 5 to me.

","What a brilliant piece of acting by both will smith and his son jaden. That was the feeling i got when i left the cinema, with my girlfriend with tears in her eyes, and to my right a family with pockets loaded of used tissues.<br/><br/>What got me as an observer to the film was that no matter what happened under the circumstances of Chris Gardner (Will Smith) he kept on going, and stuck by his son.<br/><br/>As a critic, you can't fault anybody's acting, as you can see, if you watch the film, how will smith had numerous occasions to put in a few of his well known funny lines, but instead put in his best performance i think he has ever performed on screen.<br/><br/>A real tear jerker, that is probably, not possibly, underrated."

","The pursuit of happiness is without doubt one of the best movies i have ever seen. The cast could not have been better and the performance by Will Smith was impressing. I think this is one of those movies it's worth watching. It gives a very good perspective of life and the way people fight every single day to survive. I loved this movie so much i can't even start to describe the feeling i had during the movie. Knowing that it's a true story makes it even better because it's not that dramatic as typical Hollywood movies (which are more commercial). If you watch this movie i'm sure that you'll be moved by it. It certainly touched my heart. I had heard on TV that many people used that movie as an inspiration to get out and do their best in their own pursuit of happiness. Not everyone lives a happy life, or better said an easy life, but by not giving up things change and they get better. I didn't think the movie was going to be that good, but it certainly is much more than i expected."

","I've never known how one only person can have so much misfortune- 'til now. That movie is excellent! The movie shows us what life can be. We have to work for what we dream of. And we have to fight for it. Don't let you tell by other people that you can't do the things you want to do! That's what Will Smith wants to tell us in that movie.<br/><br/>He lived together with his wife Linda and his son Christopher in a small apartment in San Francisco. The couldn't pay the rent. And then Chris' wife Linda left him and Christopher. They had to move into a motel. But after a longer time they were thrown out of the motel. They walked through the city but couldn't find any apartment to sleep in. So they had to sleep in a bathroom in the subway. That was the most emotional scene in that movie. Chris and Christopher were sitting in the bathroom and when Christopher had fallen into sleep Chris (Smith) had begun to cry. It was so emotional! The most emotional scene in this movie. He worked hard to get money to find a apartment to sleep in or to buy food. Another emotional scene was, to my opinion, the scene in the church where so many poor people stood and prayed to god and were crying.<br/><br/>To see what some people live like is very hard. To see in what misery they do live every day. <br/><br/>I think Will Smith should win the Oscar for that role! He was so brilliant! <br/><br/>I gave that movie 10 of 10 stars, because it was so brilliant, so emotional and had a perfect cast!"

","I went to see The Pursuit of Happiness to the movies and I really enjoyed it a lot. First of all it's cool to see Will Smith and his son acting together. I was surprised how good actor Will's nine-year old son was and Will is nominated for Oscar and now I know why. In a way this movie is really sad but most of all it's about hope. The movie was supposed to be drama/comedy but basically it was just drama, I think I laughed twice. The story didn't need comedy it would have just ruin the spirit in this film. The Pursuit of Happiness is filmed in San Francisco, beautiful city if I may add. I was also pleased to the music; I'm a George Benson fan and it was nice to hear his version of This Masqurade.

","A sentimental biography drama focusing upon the life of Chris Gardner where he finds life difficult with his family and his job. <br/><br/>Will Smith (Independence day) takes up the role and his strong positive portrayal of Gardener was enough to earn him an Oscar nomination. Deserving definitely but this year I believe will go to Forest Whitaker. No disrespect to Smith who was fantastic as Gardner and he definitely captured the true meaning of this film, which was emphasised through the hope and desire of his character. <br/><br/>The film is consistent enough with entertainment throughout, the occasional joke making the audience chuckle if nothing more but mainly this film is all about how difficult life is for many people. It's strong; it's passionate and justifies the drama genre. <br/><br/>Though Smith has said in interviews he did feel upset when filming particular scenes when juxtaposed with his own son, occasional scenes are hard to grasp and are not presented as strongly as they could be.<br/><br/>It is heart-warming on occasions. There is nothing wrong with the story as such, as it's based on the life of Christopher Gardner. Some scenes are hard to comprehend in realistic terms and I was very shocked to find out it was a true story after watching certain scenes believing at the time that it wasn't realistic. It is strong on many occasions, especially the relationship between the characters. <br/><br/>Many audiences can use Gardner as an inspirational role model as even when he is down he has the courage and confidence within himself to know that they are going to make it through no matter what. <br/><br/>It's a great inspiration for someone like me who can be negative on occasions and to look up to someone like Gardner is great as he is what a negative person would look for in a role model. <br/><br/>Smith deserves his Oscar nomination as he does make this film at most acceptable. <br/><br/>The plot does lack on many scenes and is not stressed as much as it could do but otherwise the film conforms brilliantly to the drama genre and is a definite watch."

","The stories about fight against adversity tried to inspire humanity from its beginnings.But, with the creation of movies and television,they transformed on a simple thing which manipulates emotions.Sometimes,there's a movie that avoids on falling on that following a good story and almost redeeming that cheap genre.The pursuit of happiness is one of that surprises that,without being perfect,produces emotion on the spectator with a great work from all the actors.This film is based on real events and,luckily,Steve Conrad's screenplay feels honest without cheap sentimentalism and it does not have the clichés this kind of movie usually has.There is not shallow drama or villains.There are good performances,realistic situations and a story which progress on a natural way making that the spectator can feel identified with the main character's evolution,his triumphs and failures.Will Smith brings a great performance.Jaden Smith(Will Smith's son on real life)has a very natural performance.Thandie Newton shows conviction on her performance.And the supporting cast brings realistic performances.I found two failures on this movie:the first one is that,on some moments,the film is too slow.The second one is that the film could have been a little shorter.The pursuit of happiness is a fun movie and it can inspire without manipulating the emotions.Italian director Gabriele Muccino made a honest drama and I recommend it because the film brings a good experience."
"jemps918","7","0","1","28 January 2007"," an extended version of its trailer
","The Pursuit of Happiness is an extended version of its trailer, which pretty much already tells the against-all-odds story of how a down-and-out salesman (Will Smith) chases after a job that he has no background on while caring for his son (Jaden Smith).<br/><br/>Based on the life of Chris Gardner, The Pursuit of Happiness tells of how he overcame every daunting obstacle in his life by sheer perseverance. Despite all the terrible things that just kept happening to him, he never wavered his focus on what mattered most: to be a good father to his son Chris Jr.<br/><br/>Gardner wasn't perfect all around, but he showed how he achieved the American dream (hence the repeated references to the Declaration of Independence) by making the best of whatever situation he was in and doggedly pursuing his ambition to have a better life for him and his son. Even in his desperation, he found solace in the Declaration: ""And it was at that time that I thought about Benjamin Franklin. Him saying that we have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. And I thought about how he knew to put the 'pursuit' in there, like no one can actually have happiness. We can only pursue it."" One particularly emotionally-charged scene was when father and son were playing ball, and Gardner warns Chris Jr. not to spend too much time with basketball because his son wouldn't be good at it anyway, because he wasn't good at it either. When Chris Jr.'s glee turns into a hurt mope, Gardner realizes his mistake and tells the five-year old, ""You have a dream, you gotta protect it. People can't do something themselves, they wanna tell you that you can't do it. You want something? Go get it. Period. Don't ever let them tell you what you can't do."" It was refreshing to see Smith play something other than his usual romantic lead or wisecracking action star. In Pursuit, he is bravely out of his comfort zone, without humor as a fall back. He does his dramatic scenes convincingly with help from his real-life son (with Jada Pinkett Smith). Smith proves that he is ready to pursue acting for real with the same bulldog determination as his character."

The Pursuit of Happiness helps show viewers that even when you're at your lowest, there's someone who cares, and someone who's willing to help you get back on your feet.<br/><br/>In The Pursuit of Happiness, Chris (Will Smith) is a salesman who has put his entire life-savings into a contract to sell as many bone density scanners as possible. His wife soon gets fed up, and leaves her family, to flee to New York to pursue a career as a waitress. Chris' son, Christopher, is the motivational part of the entire film. Christoper helps show his father that love and happiness are all it takes to live.<br/><br/>Soon after hitting rock bottom, things begin to look up, as Chris sales his final bone density scanner, and is opted out of the contract. He interviews for a job at a brokerage firm, and must go through several harsh weeks of internship training, before he'll actually get the job. Through determination, Chris gets the job.<br/><br/>Will Smith was an excellent choice to play this role. His down to earth character was perfect for the role.<br/><br/>I give this movie no less than two thumbs up, and encourage every adult to view it.<br/><br/>COMMENTS: I DO NOT recommend parents let their children (under 13) view this. There is some minor ""language"" used. I must say it was quite inappropriate to have a child referencing to the ""F-word,"" in which Christopher full fledge says the ""F-word."" Other than that, the movie was great."

","When I first saw the trailer for this film I thought to myself that it had a lot of promise. I was totally disappointed because after watching this crap they should change the title to the Pursuit of Money because that is what it really is. It hides behind a persona that it's a sensitive and touching look at a man's struggle to change his financial circumstances. It really is not. Will Smith is a terrible actor in the sense that he tries too hard to impress that he leaves the audience exactly with that. He's trying too hard. Casting his own son in the film takes it a notch lower. What is it with Hollywood and nepotism these days? Can't they find a good child actor not related to anybody in this movie? Its not that making a film about struggling to make money is bad. Its making a film about struggling to make money and making it look deep and life affirming now that's really bad. While watching this film I kept trying to find an inner meaning other than what was already the shallow plot. There isn't. In my opinion, they should just call a spade a spade. This film is like Wall street minus the sex and drugs. At least Wall street wasn't trying to hide under a veneer of being a ""sensitive"" film. It was brute and shallow and that made it a very powerful film. In the Pursuit of Happyiness it was just merely shallow."

The Pursuit of Happiness is set in the eighties and in the eighties the main objective above all else was The Pursuit of Personal Wealth. Personal Wealth = Happiness. Now two decades on we have moved on (albeit ever so slightly) from believing this ethos so wholeheartedly. Personally I was looking forward to a film that was a little more spiritual than a very below average rags to riches tale. Based on a true story, I doff my hat to whoever it is based on, well done. Having read an earlier posting on this site it mentioned an ending comparable to the golden moment in The Shawshank Redemption; sorry that must have been missing in the edit I saw, it just chugged along the whole way through, the ending came as sure as death and taxation with as much surprise as a Sly Stallone movie.<br/><br/>So this film taught me nothing I didn't know prior to viewing and left me cheated out of my GBP8.

Will Smith was a man that showed strength and weakness with flawless sincerity. This movie unforgivably show the rage, depression, and anxieties of a single father trying to bring about happiness, overcoming circumstances that show an enemy is not always person, but a system. There not many movies where the single dad is the hero or have the nerve to show a single mom walking out the door because she's selfish.This is a great father-son story and acting. The Douglas men have nothing on the Smiths. It's a shame that they took some liberties with the true account, which does change some of the emotional connection I built with a few of the scenes - but the film does say BASED, not IS the true story Chris Gardner."

It would have been nice for the movie to continue a few minutes at the end, but for some of the middle to have been cut out.

","Director Gabriele Muccino may be big in Italian films, but his first English language film can only be described as a bore. That's pretty hard to accomplish with someone as talented and interesting as Will Smith as your movie's star, but Muccino manages to accomplish it with the help of a script that piles problem after problem on our poor, poor hero to the point where we don't sympathize him, but rather want to say ""Gimmie a break"".<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is things were not nearly so dismal for Chris Gardner as this movie would have you believe as it veers from a dull story about his marriage falling apart to a dull story about his being unable to sell the medical machines (in real life he didn't buy them and sell them, he just sold them for the company that makes them---no out of pocket investment) to a fairly interesting story about him getting a unpaid (in real life he was paid) internship at Dean Witter.

There are some tender moments where he shows his vulnerability - that may be, in part, because he holds his REAL son and can empathize with what his character must have gone through. In particular, the scene where they spend the night in the washroom, and he has to fight to keep people out while comforting his son and crying. What a complex moment! However, the end of the film is where I was left wondering. Did he retain the special bond he had with his younger son? Did he become a corporate executive who puts business before family? We know what kind of poor man he was, but I want to know what kind of wealthy man he became. There were many opportunities to show him as ""successful"", including: showing him driving a shiny,red sports car similar to the one that was his catalyst for enrolling in the program in the first place; driving up a drive way on the street where he had to walk and lie about being ""car-less"", or showing him 'paying it forward' by offering someone a helping hand 'up'.

","Will Smith puts forth his best performance since his gut-wrenching portrayal of ""Muhammad Ali"" in Ali and his son, Jaden Smith gives one of best child performances in the past decade but all those things don't mean this is a great picture. The film tells the story of Chris Gardener, a single dad who has had a few too many bills pile up and decides on a career change. He becomes an unpaid intern at a prestigious stock firm and his only source of income is selling microscope machines to doctors and hospitals. During this time he has tax problems, home issues, family separations, and many other things that could plow down the spirit of any human being. The story is entirely predictable and it's just the performances that pull you through.<br/><br/>I feel the movie flaws in the fault of the writer, Steve Conrad who has written past misfires The Weather Man and Wrestling Ernest Hemingway. The film is ""inspired by a true story"" and he made it into this unbelievable, downfall after downfall film that features Will Smith running entirely way too often and luck getting worse for no apparent reason. Logically, life does throw you curveballs and coincidences do happen, but come on, the audience isn't stupid. We need a bit more substance than that.<br/><br/>Been homeless? Parents struggle immensely raising you? Feel like you're doing good in life and then something comes and knocks you down? If you answered yes, to any of those questions, then you should be touched by this picture. The sequences of Will Smith becoming homeless and watching his spirit collapse with his son sleeping in his arms in a bathroom stall is really heartbreaking. Due to Smith's powerful performance you feel the fear and anxiety right beside him and that daunting wondering of what to do next.<br/><br/>The true revelation of the picture comes from Smith's young son Jaden Smith. May be more of the ""cute kid"" factor but I walked out of the theater thinking of him the most. His ""knock knock"" jokes, crying over his Captain America and general enlightenment of his father are the most poignant piece of the film. When the experience of the movie is over you want to know very badly where his son is and what he is doing. Jaden Smith created that for us; that love for little Christopher and wanting to teach him life lessons and make sure he doesn't get plowed by the negativity around him.<br/><br/>Italian Director Gabriele Muccino played the film extremely safe with shot to shot dialogue and leaving no room for artistic imagery. But it is a solid effort and I wouldn't hesitate to see his next American film. All in all, The Pursuit of Happiness is a movie that a family could enjoy together and it will make you grateful for what you have but take it all with a grain of salt. This film stretches the mind and not in a good way.<br/><br/>Grade: **1/2/****"
"moutonbear25","8","0","2","29 December 2006"," Hollowing Pursuit
","As the opening shots of THE PURSUIT OF Happiness establish San Francisco as the setting for this tale of adversity with the Golden Gate Bridge and hordes of people rushing up and down the steep hills to get to their important jobs, I couldn't help but begin to worry that I was about to be fed Hollywood's take on what it means to go through hard times. This is after all a Will Smith picture. My anxiety eased up slightly though when the view dropped down from the indistinguishable faces of the swarm to a face that blended in all too well amongst the masses of determined feet. Throughout the opening credits, Italian film director, Gabriele Muccino, drew my attention away from a race I know all too well and ever so subtly forced me to look at what I am accustomed to looking away from, the homeless. And though Smith's Chris Gardner is currently employed, he is about to face challenge after soul-depleting challenge until he too finds himself amongst the people he turns away from as hurries about his day as a unsuccessful salesman. THE PURSUIT OF Happiness is a hollowing drama that drags both its protagonist and its audience deeper into despair than either would have expected. It is a relentless assault on the sense of security and entitlement many of us have as supposed functional members of a working society and by the time I left, I knew that I had absolutely nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>Chris Gardner's story would be nothing more than one man's pursuit of the American dream if it weren't for one very important thing. In this case, that thing is actually a very charming, young boy, Chris' son, Christopher (played by Smith's real-life son, Jaden). Watching Will and Jaden quibble and endure provides for some endearing screen time but their plight and performances overshadow their off-screen family ties. If Chris fails, he will not only be begging for his food but he will lose the one thing that gives him purpose. Little Christopher's future depends on whether his father can successfully overcome his horrible misfortune to beat out nineteen other candidates in a competitive internship for thriving brokerage firm, Dean Whitter. Today, the American dream often symbolizes an unhealthy, greedy amassment of unnecessary material goods but Chris' fight is for the bare essentials. His son deserves a stable home and regular meals. He deserves these and other rudimentary needs in order to have the opportunity to pursue his own dreams. And while I'm certain Chris wouldn't mind a bigger piece of the proverbial pie, he knows what he needs to survive and by chasing that, he reminds the audience that the American dream should be spread more evenly. It is not a contest to win out miles ahead while the rest clamor for scraps.<br/><br/>Will Smith is by far the most successful black box-office star of his generation, if not of all time. He has broken barriers around the world and yet manages to find himself facing criticism for not addressing any specific racial issues in THE PURSUIT OF Happiness. However, not verbalizing the unavoidable prejudices a black man must face competing against a room full of white faces in 1981 doesn't mean it isn't there. If anything, Smith's Chris exhibits his intelligence by pushing his understandable racial frustrations aside in order to appease his potential employers. He becomes the showman who gets his foot in the door by making the white folk laugh, all the while knowing he has the goods to surpass all their expectations once he's in. In one of the film's many moments of desperation and impending disaster, Chris finds himself sitting in his first interview at Dean Whitter, splattered in dried paint, wearing overalls and no shirt at all. The men who sit opposite him are all white and not amused. When they leer at him, they certainly aren't just uncomfortable with his appearance; they see his black skin just as plainly. Not focusing on the obvious showcases Muccino's subtle grace handling Hollywood and allows Chris to be the smartest man in the room. It also allows for Smith to give a performance where he appears as though he might break at any given moment while he wears the knowledge that closing his eyes for even a second is never an option.<br/><br/>Without confirming whether THE PURSUIT OF Happiness actually concludes with Chris achieving the happiness he works so hard to get, I can say that it deftly humbling and certainly doesn't allow for the viewer leaving that happy. Smith's backwards journey towards the top speaks to anyone who has ever struggled to succeed. What it says to them is to ask themselves if they have ever truly suffered and if so, for what? Have you been fighting to make your dreams come true or fighting to beat out the next guy? More importantly, have you ever tried to be happy in exactly the spot you're standing?"

","The endlessly hyped, tear-jerking trailer for ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" doesn't even come close to capsuling this powerful film and inspirational story. From the short opening morning scene where Chris Gardner (Will Smith) simply informs his son Christopher (Jaden Smith) that it's time for him to get up to begin the day, the chemistry between the real life father and son is immensely felt and enjoyed. There was no question in the mind of this reviewer that, regardless of how well the actually film turns out, the acting was going to be pleasing enough to make this experience worthwhile. Indeed it was, and the film itself, telling one of the more heartwarming stories of the American dream that this reviewer has ever witnessed, was nothing short of inspiring.<br/><br/>Will Smith delivers the best performance of his career, pursuing Oscar gold just as relentlessly as his character pursued happiness. I have to admit, before actually seeing ""Happiness"" I was in the crowd of skeptics that perceived Smith's Academy Award case as nothing more than dying a few hairs white and growing a mustache. The role appeared to lack any complexity at first glance, and came across as pure Oscar-bait. Both ideas may still be true, but that hardly takes away from the pure greatness of Will's portrayal of Gardner. At this point, I'd venture to say that Will deserves to be crowned in February (possibly January as well...possibly) just as much as his main competitors, Whittaker and DiCaprio.<br/><br/>A surprisingly good aspect of the movie was the emergence of Jaden Smith. Every line he utters is believable and flows perfectly in the mix of often fast-paced scenes. When he's not talking, his facial expressions strongly convey the feelings the young Gardner must have been holding in during such dire times. Jaden also successfully adds quite a bit of comic relief in between the constant sobs that break out throughout the theater.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a heartwarming holiday movie that teaches hard-working American values to take the family to, you've found it. If you're just looking for a great movie, you've found it. Don't let the trailer fool you into thinking you've seen everything you need to about ""The Pursuit of Happiness"". In that regard, and only that regard, it fails."

","Thank God they didn't let Muccino write the script. In this case, as a director he could made but minimal mistakes. This shows how an excellent script and a wonderful performance can make a great movie even when the director has really no fantasy and just some technical skills. His 2 previous Italian movie were really boring, just focused on minimal target characters, definitely talking just to an audience of 30-ers with money, without an idea of where to go and do of their life. Just the first movie was of some freshness, about adolescents at school and their discovery of sex. Hope this movie opens a new path both for Muccino in order to change his mind and NEVER write stories any longer, and most of all for the wonderful Will Smith. Too often the movie industry cages actors in a genre, and this was exactly the risk for Smith: here he shows us how he can act in a different context - and successfully! How many other possibilities will he catch?"

","First question: if Muccino has moved to Hollywood, who's going to be the mainstream film voice of Italian thirty- (or forty-) somethings now? <br/><br/>This is the true Horatio Alger story set in the early Eighties of a black San Francisco salesman, Chris Gardner (Will Smith). It's focused on a narrow slice of time when Gardner's wife (Thandie Newton) leaves him with their five-year-old son Christopher (Jaden Smith) and he becomes homeless while in an unpaid, highly competitive program to become a broker at Dean, Witter that he's betting can turn his life around. He and his son are pushed from apartment to cheap motel to BART restroom to Glide Memorial Church daily beds till his smarts and drive make him the one intern out of twenty hired. End titles tell us the real Gardner later started his own investment company and just sold out his limited partnership in that company for ""millions."" When the story begins and throughout most of it Gardner struggles to sell a bunch of bone density scanners he's unwisely bought; they're expensive, irrelevant, and hard to sell to doctors' offices but he's got to sell them to keep afloat at all, even homeless. A running theme is how several of these machines are stolen from him under odd circumstances and he struggles to get them back. This is the part of the voice-over-narrated story he calls ""running."" Christopher goes to school in Chinatown. Another part of the ever-present San Francisco atmosphere is Gardner's success selling retirement plan investment to Pac Bell execs following his wangling a trip to a Candlestick park box to watch a ball game with a CEO, and frequent BART rides. One night father and son, who have used a station Men's as a ""cave"" for the night, sleep on a moving BART train.<br/><br/>Emphasis is on Chris's devotion to his son and the son's good humor (""You're a good papa""), Chris's willingness to go to any lengths to succeed and never let rejection get him down. It's a simple enough stuff. Only Muccino's sense of movement and Smith's charisma and positive vibe as an actor pull us through and keep this from being dreary or mediocre; it's got to have that zing but they get the zing. Using Smith's real son in the son role also obviously helps. There is chemistry, but the son isn't a professional cutie either.<br/><br/>Also emphasized and a way this story is realistic is the importance of Chris's brains. He's good at numbers and always has been (as well as with people) and did well in school even though he missed college. He drills his son in basic information and gets a foot into the Dean, Witter program initially by solving the Rubik's Cube in front of a Dean, Witter boss who thinks it's impossible.<br/><br/>Happiness is a misspelling in Chinatown Chris objects to, not some sort of hip-hop gesture. Quite the contrary: this is about making it in the mainstream world. Love it or leave it. If this is a sellout, so be it.<br/><br/>This simple, upbeat movie hardly shows what Muccino or Will Smith can do. The Italian director's early films were original and mainstream in a good sense and have a wonderful momentum to them this hard-driven story doesn't really quite need his talents to convey, though he knows how to do it, of course. How does it feel to be famous in your own country and a freshman director in Hollywood? Another question, along with ""Why?"" This movie is ably done but lacks the complexity of Muccino's mainstream, but stylistically original work Italian work (he created the mainstream for his generation).<br/><br/>Similarly, this role shows Smith's usual charm and charisma but isn't the kind of rich role (Ali) or edgy one (Six Degrees of Separation) he's capable of and too rarely tackles. Sourpusses might see this as capitalist pap. Okay; but it doesn't lie to us any more than Smith's character does. And he is ruthlessly honest whenever he can be: he can't tell Dean, Witter he's homeless  that wouldn't look good  but he does come in for one interview in shirtsleeves and covered in paint drippings and admits he's just been released from jail waiting for a check to clear for an unpaid parking ticket. Chris Gardner lives on the edge. If any of this is true, it's an amazing story of determination.<br/><br/>It's not often Hollywood acknowledges homelessness in US cities like this, or shows how a struggling person can slide down into it  and what a heroic effort it would take  a miracle, really, to get back out. Happiness has some tears, but it's relatively free of sentimentality. Gardner doesn't have time for that. He's too busy running to stay afloat and making dozens of cold calls, selling. This is a Willy Loman who's straight and successful; who isn't pathetic but awe-inspiring. When he gets hired, he doesn't jump for joy. He's just tired and stunned. ""Was this as easy as it looked?"" an exec asks. ""No, sir, it wasn't,"" he quietly says. There's truth in this too. Showing that some people are exceptional and beat the odds isn't a lie. It's called a role model. It's called an inspiration. This is a simple movie, but you have to be an ideologue with a somewhat mean spirit to object to it too strongly."

","In life, there are certain moments that when you look back on them a smile plays around your lips. For Chris Gardner, looking back at 1981 will bring a smile and a tear.<br/><br/>The Pursuit of Happiness stars Will Smith in his most sincere and serious role since 2001's Ali. Here we find Smith as Chris Gardner, an out of luck salesman who is desperately trying to support for his son Christopher, played by his real life son Jaden Smith, and his over worked wife Linda (Thandie Newton).<br/><br/>One day while on his way to try and persuade some doctors to buy a portable bone density scanner, Chris runs into a well-to-do stock broker who seems to have it all. The car, the job, and the happiness Chris is searching for. From that moment on, his determination cranks up higher than ever to try and land a job as a stock broker.<br/><br/>All the while Linda is slaving at work while trying to deal with their debt and her husbands failing sales career. Fed up with his far out dreams, she needs to get closer to reality by leaving all of this behind and starting a new in New York City, even if it means leaving behind the husband she once loved and the son she can't care for. Chris and Christopher now must fend for themselves against the harshness that is life.<br/><br/>Italian director Gabriele Muccino had not directed a movie in the states previous to Happiness. With the help of writer Steve Conrad (The Weather Man), the film was pointed in the right direction. Inspired by a true story, there is no better person to fit the shoes of Chris Gardner than Smith, someone who is not shy on letting his emotions spill out onto the film.<br/><br/>First timer Jaden Smith is a blessing for the film. One of the main characters, Jaden had to take on a demanding role, at times emotionally stressful. I'm sure having his papa there was a big help. The two have the perfect on screen chemistry that is intense, memorable, and down to earth. There is a definite bond, for obvious reasons, and it shows on screen.<br/><br/>Although the story is one that is not so foreign, it is still uplifting. Like last years Cinderella Man, Happiness takes on the ""underdog"" genre cleverly and passionately. It is a heart melting tale of one man trying to survive in an urban jungle that is just waiting for the cards to fall in his favor for once. <br/><br/>Certainly there are a handful a year that aim at pushing this message of ""never give up"" and ""keep on dreaming"". Some just don't quite succeed be it the acting or a weak and over used story. Happiness fits the mold, not breaking it, but certainly filling it to the brim.<br/><br/>Happiness works on an emotional level. Smith carries the picture from beginning to end. Never once breaking character or going over the top. You won't find groundbreaking filming techniques, but that's not to say that the film doesn't look nice. The music too goes right along with the story, seemingly bringing out the emotions of the characters.<br/><br/>In a world where people can be so cold and so harsh, there are those who survive and thrive amongst us. Not everyone has there life story told on film. Some with the most incredible stories go unnoticed. But there are those that don't and these are the stories that inspire and keep us believing in ourselves. This film, this story, answers the question, ""Why not?"""
