"Infofreak","Null","44","51","8 June 2003"," Smell the testosterone! The Dirty Dozen is the quintessential ""guys on a mission"" movie!
","Quentin Tarantino looks like he just might follow through with his threat to make the ultimate ""guys on a mission movie"" if he gets his 'Inglorious Bastards' on to the big screen, but he'll be pushed to equal 'The Dirty Dozen', the quintessential movie in the genre. 35 years on and it's still one of the best WW2 adventure movies, and a strong contender for the ultimate guys movie. It shouldn't be taken too seriously - I don't think anyone is going to argue it's a realistic depiction of war - but it's still one of the most entertaining movies around, and it's impressive collection of tough guys and character actors is really hard to beat. Director Aldrich had previously made the classic noir 'Kiss Me Deadly' (starring Ralph Meeker who reappears here in a supporting role) and the wonderfully creepy 'Whatever Happened To Baby Jane', but this is arguably going to be THE movie he's remembered for. Screen legend Lee Marvin ('Point Blank', 'The Killers') with the assistance of his Sgt (Richard Jaeckel), must train a motley collection of criminal and misfits (including John Cassavetes, Jim Brown, Telly Savalas, Charles Bronson, Clint Walker and Donald Sutherland), for a suicide mission behind enemy lines. Marvin is just great, extremely cool and charismatic, but also a fine actor, something which is often overlooked. The ensemble cast (which also includes George Kennedy, and two future stars of 'The Wild Bunch', Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan) are uniformly excellent, but Cassavetes is particularly outstanding, Sutherland is memorable as a half wit, and Savalas is unforgettable as the religious psychopath Maggott. 'The Dirty Dozen' is first class entertainment and highly recommended. It put 90% of today's ""action movies"" to shame!"
"hitchcockthelegend","10","47","59","11 December 2010"," One of the most quintessential macho movies of all time.
","The Dirty Dozen is directed by Robert Aldrich and adapted for the screen by Nunnally Johnson & Lukas Heller from the novel by E. M. Nathanson. It stars Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Telly Savalas, Charles Bronson, John Cassavetes, Donald Sutherland, Richard Jaeckel, Robert Ryan and Jim Brown.<br/><br/>1944, just prior to D-Day.<br/><br/>Major Reisman (Marvin) is a none conformist kind of guy and he riles the higher brass no end, so it comes as no surprise to him that he is the man assigned the unenviable task of assembling a suicide squad of army criminals for a mission to destroy a château in France. This particular château has no military value as such, but as it is used by many of the Nazi big chiefs, destroying it whilst they relax inside will upset the German plans immensely. But can this rag tag band of murderers, rapists and thieves shape up into something resembling a fighting force? Their reward, should they survive the mission, is amnesty, but Reisman for sure has his hands full on both sides of the war.<br/><br/>""One: down to the road block, we've just begun.. Two: the guards are through.. Three: the Major's men are on a spree.. Four: Major and Wladislaw go through the door.. Five: Pinkley stays out in the drive.. Six: the Major gives the rope a fix.. Seven: Wladislaw throws the hook to heaven.. Eight: Jiménez has got a date.. Nine: the other guys go up the line.. Ten: Sawyer and Gilpin are in the pen.. Eleven: Posey guards points five and seven..

Fifteen: Franko goes in where the others have been.. Sixteen: We all come out like it's Halloween...""<br/><br/>The Dirty Dozen has become one of those films that is a perennial holiday favourite like The Great Escape, Zulu and The Magnificent Seven. Which while it most definitely deserves such big exposure, it's a little surprising it's part of the holiday viewing schedules given its cynicism and amoral core, something which is one of the many great & intriguing things about Aldrich's testosterone laced movie. Met with mixed reviews on release, with the negative side of the fence bemoaning its nasty violence and preposterous plot, The Dirty Dozen none the less performed great at the box office where it was the fifth highest grosser of the year and the number one money maker in terms of profit to budget. Coming as it did during the middle of the Vietnam War, it was evident that the paying public quite easily bought into the thematics of it all. Over 50 years since it first lured people into the picture houses, Aldrich's movie shows no sign of aged frayed edges, or better still, and more remarkable, the enjoyability factors it holds has not diminished.<br/><br/>What makes it a great film, then? First off is the all-star macho cast assembled by Aldrich and his team, big hitters like Marvin (stepping in when John Wayne balked at the script), Borgnine, Kennedy, Ryan and Bronson were already names to the public, but these are also supplemented by soon to be ""stars"" like Cassavetes, Sutherland and Savalas (also stepping into a role vacated by another, this time Jack Palance who didn't like the racial aggression of the character) & stoic performers like Jaeckel & Robert Webber. Into the mix is curio value with the casting of singer Trini Lopez and Gridiron star Jim Brown. Throw Clint Walker into the pot as well and you have got a considerable amount of beef in the stew! Secondly the film led the way for a slew of movies that featured bad guys as heroes, so with that Aldrich's film holds up well as being a hugely influential piece. Then thirdly is that not only is it intermittently funny as the violence explodes on the screen, but that it's also chocked full of action and adventure. All that and for those so inclined you can find questionable morals under scrutiny and see the ""war is hell"" banner firmly flown during the nastiness of the missions' culmination.<br/><br/>Split into three parts - meet the guys - see them train - and then the mission, pic has been criticised for its lack of realism, but is that really needed in what is essentially a male fantasy piece setting out to entertain? Besides which, lets applaud it for acknowledging that brutality and atrocities were committed on both sides of the fence, rest assured, The Dirty Dozen still had enough edginess about it back in the 60s! It's also true enough to say that the characters, are in the main, stereotypes, and that the unravelling story is a touch clichéd, but these are men that men want to be (okay maybe not Savalas' religious maniac rapist!) and men that women can cast a flirtatious eye over - there's plenty of character here to hang your hats and undergarments on as they appeal to the inner rebel hidden away in many a viewer. The messages in here are not sledge hammered into the story (Aldrich always said he wasn't making a message movie, just a film about camaraderie and unlikely heroes), and the construction of the action is top notch from one of America's most under appreciated directors. It's nicely shot in 70mm MetroColor/MetroScope by Edward Scaife (Night of the Demon/Khartoum) and features a suitably boisterous music score from Frank De Vol (Cat Ballou/The Flight of the Phoenix).<br/><br/>It's a far from flawless picture, of that there is no doubt, but it's loved by millions and continues to gain an audience yearly by those who are willing to view it on its own entertaining terms. As a boy I wanted to be Lee Marvin because of this film, as a middle aged man now, I still want to be Lee Marvin in this film. That's yet another reason why The Dirty Dozen is so great. 10/10"

","Acclaimed director Robert Aldrich (also famous to war film buffs for his rule-breaking drama, ""Attack"") twists the familiar 'unit picture' into a famous story of unexpected heroism in the midst of World War II. Instead of making his heroes clean-cut, American draftees, we're looking at the dirtiest convicts the Armed Forces has got to offer. <br/><br/>OSS Major Reisman (Lee Marvin, ""Hell in the Pacific"") is an insubordinate Army officer who's facing a court-martial, when he's given one last chance for a reprieve: select twelve Army prisoners from a maximum-security detention center, train them for a top-secret mission behind the German lines, and then lead them into battle. If they succeed in the mission, they'll be released. For Reisman, it's a tough call, but it's his only chance to save his career. <br/><br/>The men he was to work with are a mixed batch, and director Aldrich packs a lot of character development into a two-and-a-half-hour movie. The most important of the ""Dirty Dozen"" is Franko, a small-time Chicago hoodlum who's facing the gallows for robbery and subsequent murder of a British civilian. It's clear from the start that Franko is a loner who thinks he's big stuff, but Reisman manages to prove that he's really all talk. More than once, he considers and even attempts escape from the remote training camp that the Dozen are forced to build  but maybe, just maybe, beneath that rebellious attitude, there's a chance for redemption. <br/><br/>Then there are some more sympathetic types: Wladislaw (Charles Bronson, ""Battle of the Bulge"") was once a front-line infantryman who shot his platoon's medic when the medic got scared under fire and started running  Bronson says ""He took off with all the medical supplies only way to stop him was to shoot him."" Jefferson (Jim Brown, ""Ice Station Zebra"") has been convicted for murder  his defense is he was defending himself from vicious, racist MPs who were abusing him. Wladislaw and Jefferson find themselves allied in order to get Franko on their side, because they have faith in Reisman and aren't willing to let Franko's rebellion become infectious. <br/><br/>Also in fine support is Clint Walker (""None But the Brave"") as the big Navajo, Posey, who punched a man too hard for shoving him. He really didn't mean to kill him; he just doesn't like being pushed. Posey comes off as a cuddly teddy bear who'd never intentionally hurt a soul, and it's clear from the start that he's one of the good guys. Finally, Telly Savalas (""Kelly's Heroes"") lends a hand as the psychotic, racist, religious fanatic Maggot, who believes his job is to punish the other 11 men for their ""wickedness"". His motives are never really clear; all we really know is that Maggot is somewhat unhinged and potentially dangerous. <br/><br/>Even though Reisman and his squad don't get along, they're forced to become allied against a common enemy  the American General Staff, who want to do nothing short of shut the operation down. Aldrich again breaks the rules, making the conventionally ""good guys"" into the enemy. The Germans are barely mentioned throughout the first two acts, and only become involved for the explosive finale. The heart of this movie is anti-establishment behavior, right in the vein of the protest culture of the 60s: the good guys are the unshaven criminals, and the bad guys are the clean-cut, well-dressed Generals who come across as stupid and vain. As Colonel Everett Dasher Breed, Robert Ryan (""Flying Leathernecks"") makes an excellent bully, a villain that the Dozen eventually unite to take action against. <br/><br/>Once the men have been trained and are finally cooperating and acting as a unit, it's time to set them loose on the Nazis. And still, the story doesn't become stereotypical. The mission is simple: the men will parachute into occupied France, penetrate a château being used as a rest center for high-level German officers, and kill as many of said officers as possible in a short amount of time. This operation involves stabbing defenseless women, machine-gunning prisoners, and finally, locking several dozen German officers and their mistresses in an underground bomb shelter, pouring gasoline down on them through air vents, loading said air vents with hand grenades, and then blowing up the whole place. <br/><br/>Characters and story aside, the film benefits from some superb editing by Michael Luciano. Director Aldrich and cinematographer Edward Scaife work hand in hand to compose every shot. The cramped, dank prison cells in the first act are utterly convincing, and the layout of the huge, magnificent German-occupied château looks, quite appropriately, like a cross between a marvelous mansion and an impregnable fortress. The battle scenes are well-choreographed, too. Never does a moment go by where we do not know where one encounter is happening in relation to what the rest of the squad is dealing with in and around the Château. Frank de Vol's sweeping score is used sparingly, and adds to both the humor and suspense of the picture. One scene, in which Donald Sutherland's character ""inspects"" a platoon of the 82nd Airborne, is set to a live orchestra's performance perfectly. <br/><br/>War is a really a dirty business  this isn't a movie about men playing by the rules. It's about breaking every rule in the book to get a job done, and if a few innocent bystanders get in the way, they're simply collateral damage. On a higher level, Aldrich's film reflects culture attitudes of the late 60s. Moviegoers wanted a film which encouraged breaking the rules, which showed the higher levels of the American military as deeply flawed, and made the dregs of society into the heroes of the piece. It's a cynical representation of the time it was made in, but holds up flawlessly 40 years later, in a culture which has probably been shaped by the attitudes the film reflects in every frame. <br/><br/>10/10"

","John Wayne who apparently was offered the part of Major Reisman probably wisely turned it down. Wayne would never have done in the part of the maverick major in charge of training the way Lee Marvin was so perfect in the role. In fact Marvin's and the performance of others in the cast helped The Dirty Dozen get over two very big improbable situations I have always found in this film.<br/><br/>The first one being the way the conflict between Robert Ryan and Lee Marvin is handled. I can certainly see why a spit and polish West Point graduate like Ryan would not like Marvin, why Marvin would rub him the wrong way. But I cannot understand why when the Dozen are transferred to his command for parachute training they don't tell him what's going on. I would think he would have a need to know. Then again a whole big part of the film wouldn't have occurred if Ryan had been let in on Marvin's mission.<br/><br/>The second thing is that granted these guys might be considered expendable to say the least with several of the dozen scheduled for a firing squad, but the army would want to make sure the mission had some chance of succeeding. There's no way, absolutely no bloody way, that a psychotic like Telly Savalas would have been allowed on the mission. And why Lee Marvin didn't scrub him when psychiatrist Ralph Meeker offered to is beyond me as well.<br/><br/>Those glaring holes in the story have always prevented me from giving The Dirty Dozen the top rating that most have given it. But it hasn't prevented me from enjoying the film.<br/><br/>The basic idea of the film appeals to me. An unorthodox major taking a group of nonconformists to say the least and making them a crack fighting outfit. Regular army training did not do it for this crew the first time around.<br/><br/>Charles Bronson is one of the dozen and this film certainly put him well on the way to top billing. A dozen years later in fact he'd have it over Lee Marvin in Death Hunt. Jim Brown also having just finished his football career began his movie career with a winning performance as another of the dozen. John Cassavetes was singled out for a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Also Donald Sutherland got his first real notice as yet another of the dozen.<br/><br/>A year later William Holden and Cliff Robertson did The Devil's Brigade which bore a lot of resemblance to The Dirty Dozen. It got slammed by critics for ripping off from The Dirty Dozen. The only problem was that Holden's film was based on a real outfit and The Dirty Dozen is pure fiction. Only in movieland.<br/><br/>Marvin's mission is to infiltrate and kill a lot of the German high command as they gather at a French château in the weeks before D-Day. How he does is something you have to watch The Dirty Dozen before. But I think you'll like seeing what happens."

","Many viewers of film, myself include, rate this as one of the most exciting ""mission""'' stories of all time. Adapted from an intelligent but Freudian source novel, the plot theme is a subtle one for a movie; it's about convicted men in WWII being given odds for life in the form of a suicide mission that may wipe their slates clean-- or perhaps not... its main theme is self-assertion, set against its opposite, enforced repression. The key to every action men undertake in this very tough and and tough-minded Nunnnally Johnason and Lukas Heller script is: ""Is that person dealing with the reality of the world of and his/her own responsibility to act?"" From convict Telly Savalas' character, mystical murderer of women who claims a divine calling to punish their sexuality, to Charles Bronson and Jim Brown who reacted to persecutions and are innocent by reason of self-defense, to their leader, the mission's architect, Major Reisman, who wants his plan to go forward his way despite resistance from brass, every man of the outfit is tried against the same standard. Jimenez is climbing a rope and says he can't make the tower; Franco refuses to shave because the officers have hot water and he does not, Posey can't control his temper, control-freak Col. Breed hates any man who does not go by the book; etc. As a production, Robert Aldrich's direction is probably his masterpiece; the acting is far above average, especially Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Donald Sutherland, Clint Walker, Robert Webber, energetic John Cassevetes and Al Mancini; the inspired casting of powerful top-sergeant-level Ernest Borgnine as an obviously far-beyond-his element general works brilliantly. The art direction, special effects, sets, and music (by Frank de Vol) all complement a taut script filled with memorable terse dialogue. Entire sequences such as the selection interviews for the mission team, the building of the camp, a visit to Breed's hq, Breed's invasion of the camp, the training regimen, the ""graduation party"", Reisman's verbal defense of his men, the war games' challenge, preparing for the mission, the early invasion steps, Maggot's adlib, the attack by Reisman's team, the escape and the hospital climax and denouement--all these sections are made memorable to many admirers of this beautifully made and unusual story. As officers attached to the mission, George Kennedy, Richard Jaene-too-subtle secondary theme of the film is: the wrongness of arbitrary power in anyone's hands, including Nazis, US army officers or their brutal agents (such as Breed's men who beat up Charles Bronson for information). The film is about individuals who when they harm no one else and are effective human beings, men who can always get the job done, always control themselves. who need to be free to operate. Such men the film says are ""heroes""--men with an unusual ability to create results on Earth; the sort of men films ought to be made about in a nation that talks individualism and claims to value capability. This is a great adventure, of enduring artistry, occasional brutality and intelligently-developed dialogue. It has logical actions, and spectacular physical performances and This is a strong and well-thought-out adventure film, one of the richest of its genre, to be watched many times."

If you want to catch a thief, you hire a thief and that is the same principle used throughout this impressive motion picture.

","During World War II, Major Reisman is called to a high level meeting to discuss his next mission  to train a group of soldiers and prepare them for a mission behind enemy lines.  However the `soldiers' that Reisman has been assigned are all sentenced to death or life in prison for their crimes.  The mission is a suicide mission on a French chateau where German top brass will be, the aim being to kill as many as possible.  But before the mission, the group must pass a training to be considered for pardoning.<br/><br/>Well known by all men everywhere, this is less a serious war movie and more an enjoyable ensemble romp through a training camp, with the final third being the mission itself.  This is the film's strength  the training sections are very enjoyable and good fun to watch.  The mission is punchy and dramatic and works very well as the conclusion to the film rather than the whole film itself (which other `mission' films have to do).  The training is slick and enjoyable, not only it is occasionally quite funny but it is also consistently amusing and exciting at turns.<br/><br/>The film's main selling point (increasingly so) is the all star cast, all of whom do really good work.  Marvin is tough in the lead and he is well supported by Borgnine, Kennedy, Ryan and Jaeckel playing the other officers. Of the prisoners Cassavetes steals the show with his cocky Franko although he is not short of famous support.  Sutherland (although not well known at the time) is good comic relief, Savalas is a little too heavy for the film but adds menace, Bronson is good value, Brown is strong and is well known due to a weepy Billy Crystal!  The rest of the dozen give good performances, but I'll be honest and say that the famous faces stuck in my mind more.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a wonderful film and, as a war movie it isn't the best `mission' movie you could find (simply cause the mission is quite short and straightforward.  However it is a fun movie that never drags despite the slightly longer than normal running time for this type of movie.  The training section and the mission itself combine to form an enjoyable film that is driven by a great cast playing good characters."
"Rich B","7","45","65","20 February 2005"," A well structured and interesting story, although poorly edited in the final act
","It's difficult when you approach an old movie to see it for the first time and you have to try and drop all the baggage associated with it from reviews and analysis over the years. The Dirty Dozen is such a movie. I just watched it for the first time last night on TV, clipped though it was for those smaller brained people among us who don't like to see dark bits at the top and bottom of their screens.<br/><br/>It's interesting that there are three real character acts to this movie. There's the dark opening and character introduction, the fun act where the characters meld together into a team, and the closing act where the mission, and the war, become a stark and deadly reality. That last act is dark too, although there a couple of accidental laughs in there for the worst character expression at a death ever, and one particularly bad death scene.<br/><br/>What does strike you about the opening is how really dark it all is. We're talking about murders who are looking at to be retrained. Indeed one is a rapist with a serious God complex who is bordering on utterly insane. They are about to be hanged for their crimes, but have one last chance. Poor Major John Reisman has no say in the matter, he has his band and has to make them work.<br/><br/>It's well filmed for the first two character acts, and the acting is very good. John Cassavetes and Telly Savalas are wonderful in their roles. In fact it's a surprise to see Savalas in such a role and shining so brightly. Donald Sutherland also shows he has some excellent character acting in him. The rest are far from bad, but you can see a lot of typecasting for them.<br/><br/>The movement from the dark opening to the more jovial training act is interesting to watch, as this is exactly how many of the characters are seeing it, as a bit of fun. What they aren't expecting is the third character act, that of the actual war itself, and for some this proves too much.<br/><br/>The difficulty I had with the final act is only in the filming. There are premature cuts, awkward angles and jumping storytelling. So much is missed by the camera, and it doesn't feel like it's there to let your imagination run, it seems like someone has cut the film deliberately, and quite badly. There are quite a few scene transitions that just don't work at all.<br/><br/>However, where it doesn't fail is bringing the characters to their ultimate journey, that of redemption and a renewed desire to fight for their Major, and their fellow men. They become soldiers, and indeed heroes.<br/><br/>It's a good war film to watch, very well structured and reflective of the characters journeys. It's just that final act for me which spoiled my enjoyment, and purely in the filming of it."

","I'm a bit surprised by the critics who have a problem with the ""disgusting"" ending of this film. First of all, the ""burning to death"" or ""bombing"" of the civilians is not graphically portrayed. Some comments would have you believe that it's shown with ""Private Ryan"" realism. I have a hard time believing that a 10-year-old was shocked into crying hysterics by the ending of this movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, perhaps the film makers WANTED the audience to feel uneasy, ambiguous, or even a bit disgusted. War IS hell, remember? Which is why 11 of the 12 die on the mission.<br/><br/>And while the Nazis are not portrayed as evil caricatures, anyone who sees them as ""victims"" needs a history lesson. Overall, I think the film makers were trying for the 1967 version of ""realism."" That's why the film presents an effective mix of humor, horror, and drama."
"tigerman2001","Null","11","14","30 August 2002"," Actually, the Foul Fourteen...
","Spoilers ahead...<br/><br/>It's funny -- 1967 saw the summer of love but it also saw the release of a raw, violent war movie in which more than a few of the heroes are psychopaths.  I've kind of wanted to see this movie since I was a kid, but it's taken me a good three decades to realize that goal.  It had all my little kid friends abuzz in the '70s -- those who'd seen it, somehow -- and I can see why.  This, really, is your basic macho war movie.  It's a kind of film that doesn't get made much any more, or -- at least -- not released theatrically.  It's got fewer redeeming qualities than war movies (or movies set during wartime -- there's a difference) made since the mid-'70s, basically in light of the American experience in Vietnam and the domestic reactions to that experience, and it's more a straight shoot-'em-up that almost glorifies violence.  It has a few subtleties, however, that set it apart from the truly mindless violence of some films that I could name (many of them from the '80s).  The film touches upon class, race, and other social structures and its diverse cast does a great job of creating and resolving conflict as kind of a microcosm of any multicultural society.  Justice and the idea that officers might sometimes be the last people that you'd want to have running things also belong as major themes, though they've been more fully and effectively developed before (e.g., ""What Price Glory,"" ""All Quiet On The Western Front"") and since (e.g., ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Gallipoli,"" ""Hamburger Hill"").<br/><br/>The cast works really well, and includes some unlikely candidates such as footballer Jim Brown (who did a great job in this, his second movie, by the way) and musician Trini Lopez (who even gets to sing a song).  Lee Marvin is excellent, as always, as the gruff but not humor-free (and, in his own right, subversively insubordinate) major who's charged with the team of criminals that become the Dirty Dozen.  I don't know who thought of casting the prototypical Noo Yawker Telly Savalas as a southern religious maniac (emphasis on maniac) but it does work and he's scarily and creepily good in the role.  Charles Bronson plays it straight in one of his better roles and does a good job.  John Cassavetes delivers the most intense performance (if I recall from seeing him in other films, I think that he _always_ did) as a troublemaker and his is a standout performance.  Donald Sutherland's character isn't fleshed out much, but he does get to act the fool in a couple of memorable scenes, including one in which he's passed off as a general.  The massive Clint Walker, who looks like a 70s-era Big Jim action figure come to life, is also great as a backwoods giant who's gentle until pushed too far.  Richard Jaeckel also acquits himself well as an MP in what I expected to be a short role, though he ended up going on the mission and was one of the three that survived.  George Kennedy and Ernest Borgnine don't have huge roles in this film but each is good in their part.  Of note perhaps is that both Lee Marvin and Telly Savalas were WWII veterans, both wounded in combat.<br/><br/>This bunch of misfits are eventually whipped into a unit and they're such underdogs that most viewers will probably revel in their victory over Lee Marvin's priggish superior officer (played to arrogant perfection by Robert Ryan).  There's a fair bit of humor in this film, too, at least until the attack is launched.<br/><br/>This is a violent movie and I found one particularly interesting moment to be when one of the Dirty Dozen is told to execute some Germans -- he obviously doesn't want to do it but the script doesn't belabor the point, it merely makes it obvious without him saying a word.  So, too, do some of the soldiers seem to harbor some qualms about obliterating Germans that they've trapped in a cellar.  The Germans herded below are slaughtered -- looks like a war crime to me, friends and neighbors.  In this respect, the film pulls no punches and, although otherwise not a particularly realistic film, it shows quite nicely (i.e., disturbingly) the ugliness and brutality of war. It's also commendable that this film never dehumanizes the Germans.  For that matter, if anyone are brutal thugs here it'd have to be the Dirty Dozen.<br/><br/>I guess the bottom line for me is that I basically like this film, though I'm quite disturbed by some elements within (dumping grenades and fuel on trapped German officers and their ladies being the biggie) and I'd be a bit worried about someone who was a rabid fan of the movie -- at least if he giggled like Telly Savalas' character while watching Germans bite the dust. Maybe, on second thought, I just like the first half of this film.  By the way, Lee Marvin's character has a German name, that I'm sure was not unintentional ('rice man,' I think...I'd speculate that this was an oblique reference within an oblique reference, related to the Southeast Asian conflict that the US was embroiled in during 1967, but I'm not sure to what extreme these kinds of things need to be taken)."

I first saw this film when I was about 8 year old and thought it was the best thing I'd seen on TV.<br/><br/>Lee Marvin heads the cast as an unorthadox, short on discipline rebellious Major during World War II whose given a suicidal mission by a bunch of Generals headed by the excellent Ernest Borgnine. He must take 12 convicts train them and take them on a mission behind enemy lines to destroy a large chateau and kill a large number of important German officers who'll be partying there that night.<br/><br/>The films explosive climax is fantastic as you know inevitably that not everyone will survive the mission and by now you've sort of chosen who your favourite characters are. The build up and the training scenes are also brilliant as you discover the backgrounds behind these violent criminals.<br/><br/>It's Marvin's show but John Cassavettes is superb as Victor Franco, in fact with a supporting cast featuring Robert Ryan, Charles Bronson, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, George Kennedy and Clint Walker you know you're in for a great ride, nobody is wasted.<br/><br/>There's a lot of humour mixed with quite serious issues...you sometimes forget that this band of jokers are killers with only one chance to survive a mission they are hardly trained for.<br/><br/>This classic is on par with The Great Escape and Where Eagles Dare, Three inferior TV movies were made in the mid eighties which basically take the same idea from the original but they are obviously no match.<br/><br/>It's available on video and DVD and every home should have a copy.

"ma-cortes","7","12","17","18 June 2011"," Box-office hit about a misfit team led by Lee Marvin who carry out a suicide mission behind enemy lines
","A group of conscripted convicts formed by twelve condemned , already destined for death row, are drafted to go on a near-suicide mission and attempt to eliminate a Nazi staff . ¨Dirty Dozen¨ is an entertaining film with Lee Marvin as tough officer along with the ordinary team of renegade soldiers of World War II . Marvin training a group of rebel and misfit soldiers for a dangerous assault on a palace-château. In the hands of hardboiled director Robert Aldrich and a tough-as-leather cast headed by Lee Marvin , as a troublesome U.S. Army Major , that's all the plot that's needed to make one rip-roaring wartime flick. Marvin's mission is two-fold and in violent and cynical style : first turn his prisoners into a fighting unit and then turn them loose on a German fortress located in Britain . His crime-minded characters include John Cassavetes as rebel inmate , Clint Walker as a chronic malcontent, Telly Savalas as a ready-to-blow psycho, Donald Sutherland as a lame-brained convict and many others . The first half of the film allows the colorful cast of character actors to have their fun as they get their tails whipped into shape and develop shaky relationship with their leader. The final part is all action, as the culprit commandos wreck havoc and then run for their lives. Despite the fact that few of the ""heroes"" survive the bloodbath, the message here isn't that war is hell. Rather, it seems to be: war can be a hell of a good time... if you've got nothing to lose . The relentless assignment is set against strong training, risked adventures and hazardous feats . The dangerous mission includes a numerous group formed by a motley and diverse squadron played by all-star cast .This is a rugged WWII actioner concerning about an experienced officer , Major Reisman , he's assigned by Military staff (Ernest Borgnine who acted in the original and all the sequels, Robert Webber , George Kennedy) to train a dropout group of murderers , criminals and rapists who get a chance to redeem themselves . They are a bunch of dispensable characters with no past and no future . Lee Marvin reprieves a bunch of ¨Death Row¨ inmates , forges them into a two-fisted fighting unit and leads them on a deadly assignment into Nazi territory , but there is a religious crazy in the team .The prisoners are oddballs , rag-tag and undisciplined gang (a large cast formed by John Cassavetes, Clint Walker , Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas , Jim Brown , Charles Bronson, Trini Lopez), under command a sergeant (Richard Jaeckel). The team is hardly trained by the Major Reisman . In this film Marvin and his motley band , the Dirty Dozen, are suppose to destroy a fortress where resides various Nazi officers . Then they are parachuted and arrive in French Bretain and attacking the palace . At the end they must participate in the suicidal mission behind the enemy lines , to wipe the German group by means of a violent assault over a strongly protected castle.<br/><br/>Lee Marvin as Major Reisman assumes the character of the leader of the Dirty Dozen in this wartime classic movie directed by Robert Aldrich and based on the characters created by T.M. Nathanson , being scripted by Nunnally Johnson and Lukas Heller. This moving film packs frantic thrills, perilous adventures , relentless feats , and buck-loads of explosive action and violence. The noisy action is uniformly well-made, especially deserving of mention the rip-roaring final scenes on the fortress , including some spectacular shootouts and bombing . Apart from the values of team spirit , cudgeled by Lee Marvin into his rebel group , the film is full of feats , suspense , and thrills . Rough Marvin is good as leader of the motley pack together thwart the Nazi schemes, as well as the largely secondary cast with special mention to Telly Savalas and Donald Sutherland . Atmospheric and martial musical score by Frank De Vol and appropriate cinematography filmed by Edward Scaife in several locations from Gaddesden, Hertfordshire , England and MGM British studios, Borehamwood . This is is a wartime typical vehicle and into the ¨warlike commando genre¨ , which also belong : Where eagles dare(Brian G. Hutton) and Kelly's heroes(Hutton ), Tobruk (Arthur Hiller), Devil's Brigade (Andrew V McLagen) and many others .<br/><br/>This exciting , original and Box-Office hit ,¨Dirty dozen¨ was followed by various sequels , a trio of inferior Telefilms (1985 , 87 , 88) as ¨Dirty Dozen II: The next mission ¨ by Andrew V McLagen with Lee Marvin and Richard Jaeckel, Borgnine , Larry Wilcox and Wolf Kahler , ¨Dirty Dozen III : Deadly mission¨ by Lee H Katzin and ¨Dirty Dozen : Fatal mission¨ also by Lee H Katzin and starred by Telly Savalas replacing Lee Marvin; both of them shot at the same time with similar actors and director ; furthermore a TV series."
"Sonatine97","7","27","44","9 July 2000"," A good old fashioned war film with no hidden agenda.
","A generally entertaining war film with no real political axe to grind  or patriotic flagwaving getting in the way.  Its very dangerous trying to humourise war in the movies, because that  would be offensive to all those that had served & died in real life.  Kelly's Heroes and 1941 probably went a little too far, pretending that  war is really fun & cool when you've got people like Clint Eastwood in  charge.  But then you have other war films that are black in its humour but  manage to keep into focus the cruelty & horrors of war at the same time  - M*A*S*H and Catch 22 are the best examples.  With Dirty Dozen we have something of a go-between; the humour amongst  the characters is light & welcoming but never falls into farce or  bad-taste; and Aldrich quickly pulls us back into the fold with some  tight scripted scenes of drama & mass murder (throwing petrol &  grenades into that German bunker to name but one. I often wonder about  that scene, and whether it was some kind of metaphor for the gas  chambers & concentration camps in Belsen)  But unlike MASH & Catch 22, Aldrich resists the temptation to openly  politicise the effects of war, after all this film was made in '67 near  the height of the Vietnam war/protests. Instead he takes a straight  line course of action and lets us be moved & entertained by the  convicted GIs doing their duty.  Marvin is excellent as the hardnosed but disobediant Major. He plays  the anti-hero far better than Eastwood in Kelly's Heroes. Marvin just  looks the type who'd give the top brass as well the Germans a real hard  time.  But special mention must go to Cassavettes as Viktor Franko, the  trouble-maker's trouble-maker. His character is so refreshing & wild  amongst a relatively mild cast of supporting extras, with the exception  of Savalas. Franko is the Joker of the pack but you soon feel an  attachment for him in spite of his crimes.  Sutherland & Bronson, don't really add much. The former plays a  slightly naive man who hasn't really grown up and Bronson just smirks &  mumbles a lot.  The only other character worthy of a mention is the truly terrifying  Savalas, who is a Christian through & through, yet hates all women as  much as the Germans; and has a most spine chilling laugh! Difficult to  believe this man later became Kojak!  The film is a tad overlong; the first & last 40 minutes hold the  interest but the middle section (the War Games scene), is far too long  and generally detracts.  All the same, DD is a very good movie, especially for those who don't  want to be politically moralised too.  ***/*****"

","Time and Turner saturating the airways about once a month have taken some toll on the impact of this great action adventure film which has the best ensemble rugged he-man cast every to take on the Nazi's on film. Tame by today's standards it was landmark in 1967 for unlike any previous war film the objective was not to take an island or a hill or a fortress but to kill enemy officers. Released during a time when we still considered war to have some morale standards at least when conducted by American's what better way to justify murdering our enemy than using the dregs of the American Army in a top secret covert mission.  Our heroes a mixture of murderers thieves and rapists were actually more villainous than their Nazi adversaries  The dozen's casting was highlighted by the brilliant Cassavetes as the punk gangster Franco and Savalas as the sadistic psychotic bigot Maggott. Bronson, Brown &  Walker are the brawn of the group and the film provides all of them the opportunity to display their physical attributes. Sutherland represents the only other major character of the dozen as the unit idiot. Lee Marvin was in his prime and I consider this his best and most definitive role as the leader of the dozen. Borgnine and Ryan also standout as adversarial superiors to Marvin. This was a man's film from beginning to end and although not as colorful or explicit as the excellent book it was based on it was every bit as good a film as was the book and the exciting climax was a big improvement on the non climactic book."
"tedg","Null","11","16","11 April 2001"," Magnificent Seven Meets Great Escape Meets Catch 22
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Most films are not about life, but about other films. Sometimes you get one that recasts old forms and sets new cultural milestones.<br/><br/>Just a couple years before, Bronson was a part of a rag-tag group in the US remake of 'The Magnificent 7.' Then, that same ethos of inventive rebel was recast into patriotic honor with the Americans in the 'Great Escape.' This was one of the defining archetypes of the culture, just in time to catch and influence the Vietnam era. Now, the idea is brought home more clearly: rank criminals with defining but limited honor.<br/><br/>What's unique about this film: the bad guys aren't the Nazis -- it is them, their servants and women, the whole complicit people. Behind the humor of the middle part is a more harrowing reality of that war than seen in 'Private Ryan' and the ilk: the war was brought by and fought against the German people. No honor on either side, only film justice.<br/><br/>++++ Added later:<br/><br/>Sometimes distance sharpens the politics of the thing. At the time, the U.S. was conducting an immoral war in Vietnam. The Army was aggregated from conscripts most against their will; some significant portion were sent from the judicial system. The rules were brutal on civilians. It would be some time before the extent would become known, but war crimes were common. <br/><br/>I think when this film came out few would have mourned the loss of a few French prostitutes and wives. This was far closer to WWII than to the current time, and the image of stereotypical German generals being taken from lavish pleasures and incinerated in a cave would have evoked notions of justice for the holocaust. So we would applaud the black guy triggering the deaths. <br/><br/>How blind we seem to be about the present, any present."
"johno-21","7","3","3","10 April 2006"," Like a 1960's DC Comics World War II adventure
","I saw first saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. A group of prisoners are led by a renegade Major with disciplinary problems of his own to penetrate enemy lines in preparation for D-Day and disrupt the German chain of command by killing a gathering of top Nazi brass at a château. If the prisoners succeed and survive they will have their sentences commuted. If the Major pulls it off he'll save his career. This is adapted from the 1965 best selling novel by E.M. Nathanson and based on a story told to Nathanson by sexplotation film director Russ Meyer. Meyer was a cameraman in the signal corps during World War II mostly assigned to General Patton. In the real dirty dozen story, they were parachute dropped into occupied France on an assassination mission. They never completed their assignment however. Being typical undependable criminals once they hit the ground they hightailed it for Spain for the rest of the war. The real dirty dozen scenario is much more plausible than this far-fetched tale made into a film by director Robert Aldrich. Proliffic writer/director/producer Nunnally Johnson wrote the screenplay. Aldrich had made some good films in the 50's including Kiss Me Deadly and had a string of good films in the 60's leading up The Dirty Dozen including Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, Hush Hush, Sweet Charlotte and Flight of the Pheonix. He dealt with prisoners again in the Longest Yard and would revisit the violence of the Dozen with Ulzani's Raid. A great cast here with film veterans Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ralph Meeker and Charles Bronson and actors who would become well known including Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, George Kennedy, John Cassavetes in his only Academy Award nominated performance (he lost out to Kennedy who won for his performance in Cool Hand Luke)and Jim Brown, who retired from the NFL while filming this for an acting career. Also in the cast are Richard Jaekel, Robert Webber and Trini Lopez. Nominated for four Academy Awards the MGM Sound Department took home it's only win for Best Sound Effects. It's a good action film with a great cast but it's too much like a comic book action story than an actual war drama story. The entire plot is so implausible and unnecessary that if there is a message in this film about war, double standards, senselessness, hypocrisy etc.. it gets lost in the mayhem. If you remember World War II themed comic books from the 60's like Sgt. Rock, Our Fighting Forces or GI Combat, this movie more resembles them than a typical war picture. There are some good lines and dialog and this is well made film but not my favorite war picture. I would give it a 7.5 out of 10."

You have one of the best premises ever, a cast that is to die for, but some how the film makers managed to make it only average.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is great -- John Cassavetes in particular shines. The problem with the film -- it's too silly.  The Dirty Dozen should be the grittiest, meanest movie out there; and at times it is.  But it also has some laughably cheesy scenes, and the action is very flawed and confusing.

","Robert Aldrich, about as lively a director as ever made a movie in Hollywood, Hit pay dirt with this expensive, widely far-fetched WWII Yarn.

"jckruize","7","11","18","8 October 2002"," Reality intrudes on entertainment.
","It's hard to figure what director Robert Aldrich and his writers meant to say about war with this famous 60's box office hit. Working from a script by veteran screenwriters Nunnally Johnson and Lukas Heller, (based on a novel by E.M Nathanson), Aldrich wastes no time on extraneous detail or historical context; he's clearly interested in keeping this 2-and-a-half hour epic moving along, as it contains a lot of characters, tough dialogue, and well-staged action.<br/><br/>At the same time, little effort is expended in disguising the story's schizoid nature. Its first half is a fairly standard, though rousing, WWII adventure with a skilled cast expertly portraying the typical band of misfits -- in this case, American military prisoners -- who bond under fierce training and are molded into an efficient fighting force. <br/><br/>Then in the second half, the results of this training are unblinkingly depicted with the assault on an R&R stronghold for the German high command in which the mission is simply to kill as many of the enemy as possible. That this happens to include a large number of civilian noncombatants, many of them women, seems of scant concern. The slaughter is mainly accomplished with gasoline dumped down ventilator shafts on those trapped in the cellars below, then ignited.<br/><br/>It makes for exciting spectacle, but might also leave something of a bad taste in your mouth."
"Theo Robertson","7","7","11","7 January 2010"," Where Classic Hollywood Meets The New Hollywood
","THE DIRTY DOZEN is very much a film that stands between the fault line of the old classic Hollywood and of the New Hollywood . Arthur Penn's BONNIE AND CLYDE was released the same year to great commercial and critical success . The Hays code that dictated what could and couldn't be shown in American cinema was being replaced but a certification system and this film reflects this . Notice how a well regarded film critic like Roger Ebert was shocked at the amount of violence on screen . Of course it's very tame by today's standards but Robert Aldrich like Sam Peckinpah always did try to push on screen violence in the 1960s<br/><br/>It's interesting that there's moral ambiguity surrounding the plot . With a film like THE GUNS OF NAVERONE and WHERE EAGLES DARE it'd be jolly decent chaps been given a mission to kill the dastardly hun but here we saw a bunch of criminals doing so . Also interesting how the film differentiates between the "" good criminals "" and the "" bad criminals "" even if you haven't seen the film before you'll be hoping which character gets their pardon and which one dies in action <br/><br/>Of the cast Lee Marvin , Ernest Borgnine and Robert Ryan would have been well known where as Donald Sutherland , Charles Bronsan and John Cassevetes weren't famous names . Bronson did go on to be a big name in 1970s cinema and it's difficult to think of a decade apart from the 1970s where a tall , thin slightly goofy looking actor would have been a film star . Cassevetes didn't really become a big name as an actor but did become a highly acclaimed director of independent features . Post 70s indie cinema owes much to him <br/><br/>As for the actual plot there's a major plot hole in that the allies know there's a Nazi conference taking place but instead using a squadron of bombers to reduce the château to rubble they come up with a scheme that's little chance of success involving the condemned men , but if the allied planners showed more sense there wouldn't have been a story . The plotting does mean the film is rather flabby and overlong but it's a fairly entertaining one if you like war adventures and Lee Marvin and his cohorts are much better actors than Brad Pitt and the ones who appeared a recent film by Tarantino"

","Warning: spoilers ahead. Despite great performances all around (save for Telly Savalas' giggling psycho), this is one overrated and overlong 'classic' action movie. I have a hard time when Hollywood tries to turn murderers and rapists -- all sentenced to death or life in prison -- into a bunch of lovable, misunderstood goofballs. I could buy it if one or two of them had been wrongfully accused, but eleven of them? Or rather six of them, since the other half of the 'dozen' aren't even developed into characters. I could also buy it if they redeem themselves or come to some personal revelation through their mission, but the finale of this film was so sadistic that it ruined everything that had been set up. Are we supposed to cheer when these so far unredeemed 'heroes' pour gasoline on a bunch of trapped Nazi officers' WIVES?? Why did the writers put women in this scene at all? Where's the redemption in psychos acting psychotic? This finale just puts them on the same level as the Nazis, but unfortunately this film isn't going for any kind of moral message. The screaming, trapped women getting doused in gasoline by a bunch of unredeemed murderers and rapists completely ruined what had been an OK action film."

Someone commented that ""they deserved it"". People thinking that are likely to be the ones voting for the next Hitler, as they are devoid of any empathy.

To take a bunch of murderers, rapists, thieves, then make us root for them as war heroes, and laugh at their antics, then get caught up in their mission but (if we catch it) feel an unease at how that mission quietly echoes the gassing of Jews in concentration camps leads to high number of levels at which to take the film leads to a very complicated movie experience masquerading at 'fun' entertainment. And it IS fun -- that's where Aldrich pulls you in. <br/><br/>Yet to admit even subtly (as he also did in 'Attack') that even a war as 'good', just and necessary as WWII was still an act of insanity on all sides may be even more brave than Altman's more overt counter-culture skewering of the Korean War, a war more 'acceptable' to ask moral questions about. <br/><br/>All that said, as often happens for me with Aldrich, it lost a bit on second viewing.

","I can see how The Dirty Dozen could be considered a prelude to Police Academy. Well, I guess I should say that I consider it a prelude to Police Academy. I saw many parallels with Major Reisman (Lee Marvin) trying to train his band of misfits similar to Police Academy. But The Dirty Dozen isn't simply a crude gag-a-minute comedy. It is a nice blend of a bit of comedy, some drama, and some wartime action.<br/><br/>The story is very smartly put together. Taking place during World War II Major Reisman is told to train a group of twelve military prisoners to go on very much a suicide mission. I know, I know... Suicide Squad right? Well, this was 50 years before that and with far more endearing characters. The prisoners have the choice (which is not much of a choice) to go on this mission and be pardoned or refuse and accept their sentence. Being that all of them are facing sentences from as little as 20 years up to hanging, the choice became easy.<br/><br/>The characters were fantastic: Donald Sutherland as the Christopher Lloyd-like goofy Vernon Pinkley, Jim Brown as the few-worded Robert Jefferson, Telly Savalas as the fire and brimstone Southern religious nut, and John Cassavetes as the loud, unruly, and obnoxious Victor Franco were the real standouts. I loved the mixture of characters and Major Reisman's relationship to them all. They were all condemned and in a way he was condemned with them. That didn't mean they had to live condemned and that didn't mean they didn't have anything to contribute. But as I said, this movie was made awesome by the performances. Every character contributed and made the film great."

It is likewise the premise of Ocean's 11, Ocean's 12 and Ocean's 13. It can be bloody. It can be a con. It can be phony- tragic. It can be suave and funny. But it's pretty much the same film in every case. ""The Dirty Dozen"" is not one of the better examples."

","A highly unrealistic story of a group of men sent to mass murder a group of unarmed German officers and their wives by locking them in a bunker, pouring gasoline on them, and setting fire to them. The creators of this story seem to have tried to make up for the bad acting and lack of reality by lots of explosions, acrobatic dying, and machismo. I find it interesting that the filmmakers did not realize that if this story had taken place in real-life, the American soldiers and their superiors would have been guilty of committing a war crime. Another person indicated that the women were prostitutes, which would add crimes against humanity to the charge. This was not a battle against armed combatants, it was an Auschwitz-style execution. I have nothing good to say about the German army of WWII, but in democratic countries, people are entitled to a trial before being executed. There is no indication that any of the German officers that were burned alive were Nazis, and I didn't see any SS uniforms. If they were SS from the Death's Head Brigade, then burning them alive would be justice (after a trial), but this film didn't make that distinction."

I am not trying to excuse what the Nazis did, but this does not mean everyone was like this. Lots of Germans were actually opposing the totalitarian system of Adolf Hitler. The worst part is when you have all the people locked up in the bunker and the have the Americans throwing the grenades down the air vent, pouring the gasoline and blowing the whole thing up. This makes the Americans no better than the Nazis. I could actually live with it, if the three remaining Americans were also killed. 1 out of 10."
"Det_McNulty","8","5","9","17 August 2006"," Psychos, Thieves, Rapists, ThugsGive A Warm Welcome To ""The Dirty Dozen""
","Back in 1967 The Dirty Dozen was a very controversial film because it went against everything the army stood for and so was nearly not able to be made. Luckily it did and still today it stands as one of the greatest action/war movies ever made and it still rings with its anti-war message. If you want to know what kind of a film The Dirty Dozen is I'd say it's a cross between Full Metal Jacket and Animal House, strange right? The thing about The Dirty Dozen is it is very different to most other war films and with the added comedy you've got something very unique. Most importantly The Dirty Dozen proves that to be a good solider you have to break a few rules.<br/><br/>From the cold opening monologue to the explosive finale you've got yourself a film that sets a standard for how to make an action movie years and years since. The Dirty Dozen is famous for its wonderful ensemble cast that provides humour as well as study. All of the 12 men trained by Lee Marvin the cold head of command are ex-convicts and all of them are some of the most twisted people known to man. The film studies the violence on and behind the war zone. The Dirty Dozen entertains as well as an insight; this is great in my opinion. Some people say The Dirty Dozen can't be taken seriously, I sure think it can. Even though the film is a comedy it still is a serious film in many places. The film has managed to place itself in 60s pop culture for being so iconic. The film's acting from the entire cast remains on top throughout the entire film. If you think about The Dirty Dozen is a disturbing film, the segment with the gasoline and grenades being poured down the shafts is done in such a odd fashion that you'll find it hard to grasp it.<br/><br/>The film's style is one that remains as cool as it was back in 1967. The editing is very cleanly cut and The Dirty Dozen's pace runs with a rhythm still keeping its substance. Many of the camera shots and the final, body count filled massacre has a certain feel of excellence to it. You can really feel the time spent on creating set pieces, acting ability, direction etc. The Dirty Dozen's atmosphere from all this is a menacing dark one, the fact it's menacing is because of the added humour and the dark because of the whole crazy idea. The film does run smoothly and feels very tight because there are no subplots and the fact that everything is so precise. The Dirty Dozen is a movie that has been spawned with carbon copy films and TV sequels.<br/><br/>The script is one of great originality because it mixes sardonic humour with great speeches and one-liners. You'll be sure to have a favourite character by the end of the film. Many of the cast and characters have gone down in history providing a great step up for the cast's careers. Charles Bronson. And Donald Sutherland are probably some of the most recognisable to the viewer today. The Dirty Dozen remains a sharp, raw and stark film through its two and a half hour running time. So you can either watch The Dirty Dozen in two ways, one to study the army through a wide open image or secondly as a highly entertaining action movie. The most important question The Dirty Dozen make the viewer ask is none other than ""Is this what the army is really like?"" I'd say it is and by making a film that shows that the best war men are criminals Robert Aldrich has created an anti war statement."

","Twelve Leavenworth- or gallows-bound Army misfits are gathered together and trained for a suicide mission. The film gives us the tale of these assorted loonies becoming a solidary male group under the tutelage of their tough but practical major (Marvin) and his Sergeant (Jaekel) who accompany them as they are parachuted behind German lines to carry out their mission.<br/><br/>Except for the last half hour, the movie is a kind of ""training camp"" movie familiar to audiences during World War II. Everybody wisecracks and insults everyone else. There are fist fights and pratfalls. When a stern and distant colonel (Ryan) penetrates the secret camp he is humiliated and run off by the filthy trainees. Later, Ryan is further humiliated when the dirty dozen play on the opposite side during a combat exercise and manage to capture him and his headquarters by pretending to be on his side. (I can't count the number of times this had been done in earlier movies. Even Laurel and Hardy did it.) The laughs and grabass disappear in the final thirty minutes when the group's mission becomes clear. They are to invade an estate in which German officers take some rest and relaxation with their families and girl friends. And the film now begins to make us squirm a bit.<br/><br/>Members of the group penetrate the castle and hide in various niches while others prepare to trap the German officers inside. The slimiest and most clearly nuts of the dirty dozen (Savalas), who is referred to by a staff officer as ""a malignant dwarf"", silently knifes a victim in one of the bedrooms. The victim seems to have been playing a game with his girl friend who enters the room and begins inquiring where her partner is. Savalas is behind a curtain, caressing his knife like Jack the Ripper, and stifling maniacal giggles. The young woman finally grows impatient and says angrily, ""This is no longer a joke."" Indeed it isn't. Savalas grabs her from behind, covering her mouth, holding his knife against her delicate neck and taunting her for being a filthy slut who deserves God's punishment.<br/><br/>The whole tone of the movie changes with this scene because we realize that these guys we've been rooting for all along can be pretty thoroughly murderous thugs.<br/><br/>After Savalas finishes her off, bells ring, alarms clang, shots ring out, and all the guests -- men and women alike -- retreat to a bunker in the cellar. The dirty dozen lock them inside, then pour gasoline on them through the ceiling vents while the girls scream and the Germans shout while trying to stuff the vents closed. They don't succeed. They are all blown to bits and most of the dirty dozen are killed in the action.<br/><br/>I don't know if the director intended it or not, but he's pulled us into a state of sympathy with these raggedy undisciplined warriors and then turned around on us and shown us that their mission consists of the deliberate murder of a hundred or more people, many of them innocent, all of them helpless. It does not leave the viewer with any feeling of triumph. Guilt is more like it. The greater message is that war itself is nothing more than organized homicide, not at all like a football game.<br/><br/>The acting really MAKES this movie. Lee Marvin has never been better. And his support is great -- stalwarts like Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, John Cassavetes, Jim Brown, Ralph Meeker, Charles Bronson, Donald Southerland. We don't get to know all of the men equally intimately. Some of the dirty dozen apparently have no lines of dialog at all. And sometimes the humor is silly. But all of that is papered over by the performances, by the efficient direction, and by wardrobe and cinematography, both departments outstanding.<br/><br/>It's long but never dull. It's both an entertainment and a lesson. See it if you get the chance."

","I've seen this movie several times. It really is a ""man""-movie, tough and all. However its attitude is very disturbing. The allied soldiers are a bunch of crooks (were they??) who are sent to Europe to kill german officers and their wifes (!) at a recreation center. Well, someone who calls himself a soldier fights on the battlefield for one thing. I'm not saying the allies were not crooks, but the glorification of that is very perverse. After having read the book of german officer Otto Skorzeny (he freed Mussolini from a mountain retreat in an operation that would make Lee Marvin look like a first grader) ""My command operations"" I threw the dirty-dozen-tape into the garbage can. NOT because we are the ""bad-guys"" in this movie, but because the attitude of the movie is so very wrong. Real life Skorzeny gave out the order to his crew: ""no shot is fired unless you hear ME shoot"" and he did not use his gun during, e.g., the entire daredevil Mussolini-operation. That was how the ""real-life-good-guys"" handled these things. So maybe you can understand that the dirty-dozen-massacre-movie is in a way both very pathetic and evil."

Surprisingly, the movie was better than I expected.<br/><br/>Somewhat unbelievable, perhaps, but quite amusing at times.

Are our Medal of Honor winners anything like the perverts portrayed in this movie? Are we supposed to believe that such characters were even allowed to stay in the army? Are we supposed to be believe that such characters were entrusted with defense of the United States? Are we supposed to believe that such characters could last even one minute on the same battlefield with the Germans? No way! Our heroes were men of honor, men who put duty before everything else, men who were brave and who were good, men who were nothing like the misanthropes portrayed in this movie. This movie is just another example of Hollywood using an historical incident, such as in this case World War Two, to make a movie that shows scene after scene of gratuitous violence, this time involving mentally ill soldiers.

","""The Dirty Dozen"" plays out as an increasingly perverse, puerile and pathetic male fantasy, taking us deeper and deeper into the twisted stupidity of a certain type of machismo which glorifies bullying, violence, misogyny and ego gratification in place of functional social relations. It achieves this quite efficiently, with a reasonable standard of acting and film-making. The first three quarters of the film could be defended as brainless fun for certain kinds of people, but the finale descends into an indefensible quagmire of incompetence which is even more offensive for its blasé justification of atrocity than for its utterly ludicrous depiction of military action. The patterns of male bonding and conflict depicted in the film are laughable in their combination of gratuitous nastiness and infantile naïveté. <br/><br/>Having no connection at all to the realities of the conflict depicted, the realities of conflict itself, nor the realities of any personal or cultural interaction at all may not make a ""war movie"" offensive in itself. However, when the result is as vacuous and idiotic as it is here, it can be argued that this sort of film insults anyone involved with or interested in any of the subjects it touches upon (hello ""Inglourious Basterds""...)."
"zkonedog","5","5","10","11 March 2017"," Does Just Enough For Younger Generation
","During the 1960s, a glut of films set in World War 2 America were produced. This was one of them. If your generation's pivotal moment was WW2, then you will enjoy this film very much. However, for the younger generation, it does just enough to stay on the right side of the ""boring line"".<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on the efforts of Army officer Major Reisman (Lee Marvin) to turn a ragtag group of convicts into a serious fighting force for a suicide mission behind enemy lines. Many of the cons are played by popular actors/personalities such as Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, Telly Savalas, and Donald Sutherland, to name but a few.<br/><br/>Like I said, this film does just enough to keep it from being boring. The characters are by-and- large entertaining, the plot is interesting enough to make you want to see the resolution, and the acting is solid.<br/><br/>Here's the problem: it also has the pacing of a 60s movie (which will be a problem with the younger crowd). This movie could have been 30 minutes shorter and probably been just as good, as parts (like at the beginning and end) really got bogged down. Again, this is probably a generation-gap difference in film watching at play here, but I just wanted to point it out.<br/><br/>Thus, though I wouldn't ever call this movie a ""classic"" unless I'm referring to the decade in which it was made, it is decent enough to warrant a viewing if you are a fan of either WW2 flicks, or ensemble-cast blockbusters that showcase celebrities of that era. If you don't fall into either category, then you should probably stay away."

The Dirty Dozen is my favorite World War 2 movie.  Its another film that was influenced by the Seven Samauri.  Was done at a time when many Hollywood features had some true all star casts compared to some of today's films.  Lee Marvin is both tough and hard as the individualistic, Major John Reisman.  The Dirty Dozen is one of the top ten films that Charles Bronson has been in.  The story is excellent and the music is good.  One favorite scene is when the convicts overtake Robert Ryan's troops during a military exercise.  Another favorite scene is when Donald Sutherland is asked to impersonate a general.  John Cassavetes gives the film's best performance as the cocky Victor Franko.  Telly Savalas gives his most famous performance as the religious and self righteous psychotic rapist, Maggot."

The actors are quite good, and the premise is interesting, but the way its carried out and scripted is completely unrealistic, silly and downright cheesy. That's why they're fantasy movies, as there's no connection to reality in any movies in this genre.<br/><br/>This is really on par with ""Lord of the Rings"", except instead of slaughtering Orcs by the millions, they're slaughtering Nazi's. Some prefer Elves and swords, others prefer GI's and machine guns, but its all the same. So, if you like to see wacky American misfits killing Nazi's like its no tomorrow while delivering one snappy liners, then this is the flick for you.

It was nothing of the kind. The whole object of the mission was to kill Nazi officers and their wives and girlfriends by trapping them in a cellar, pouring down gallon after gallon of petrol on top of them and igniting it by throwing down hand grenades. There were some heroic deaths enacted by the stars, but the theme of the film seemed to be one of celebrating the burning of the Germans. Maybe things were different when the film came out, the bombing of London was still a fairly recent memory, but watching it many years later I found it left a nasty after-taste.

The commando raid turns into a shambles, almost everyone gets killed, but there's no real explanation of what went wrong, or why, or whether the Dirty Dozen actually accomplished anything or not. <br/><br/>Maybe that's the point, but I still feel like the ending was a weak payoff for a movie with a spectacular buildup and great character development."
"MartinHafer","9","3","6","29 June 2007"," You can almost smell the testosterone when watching this great war flick
","I have seen a lot of films over the year--meaning, I guess, I need to get a life! However, despite all the hours I have spent on films, I rarely watch a film twice and practically never see a film more than that. It is a tribute to the greatness of this film that I have probably seen it four times over the years and each time I marvel at the film with its wonderful ensemble cast and excitement that just oozes off the screen! There are very, very few war films that are better than this and I almost found myself giving this movie a score of 10. However, since I RARELY give films a ""10"", I am hesitant to do so here but I mean no disrespect against this nearly perfect film. If you asked me what three features made this film great in particular, I would say the excellent direction, the long but always engaging script and most importantly, Lee Marvin--in his greatest role of his career.<br/><br/>Marvin is placed in charge of a group of 12 demented sociopaths who are given the choice to either join him in a suicide mission or have their full sentences enforced (and in many cases, this means the death penalty). While a few of the 12 are naturally just faces in the film, there are so many wonderful standout performances that give the film so much color and depth. Telly Savalas was given perhaps the most exciting and depraved role in the film and he milked it for all its worth. Charles Bronson and Clint Walker both played strong but decent men who seemed to transcend their circumstances. Jim Brown had a great role that seemed to justify his early retirement from football. Donald Sutherland was a freak--and a very lovable and cool freak at that. But the best role of the 12 was that given to John Cassavetes as the malignant jerk, ""Franko"".<br/><br/>Apart from these 12 twisted men, Marvin was given TONS of support from some terrific character actors--Ernest Borgnine, George Kennedy, Richard Jaekel, Ralph Meeker, Robert Ryan and Robert Webber. With all these wonderful actors gathered together, it's natural that you'd have an excellent film. What was amazing is that with all this talent, Marvin STILL managed to upstage them all with his tough as nails role as the group's commander! As for the plot, it's so very long and complicated I'd rather not get into it, since it's already listed on IMDb. However, when I say long, this is NOT a complaint. I love long movies provided the script is tight and merits the extreme length and complexity. THE GUNS OF NAVARONE and GONE WITH THE WIND both fall in this category, while THE English PATIENT seems like one of the longest movies ever because it is so dull and needed to be desperately shortened.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this is an exciting film from start to finish thanks to every aspect of the film working perfectly together. I also appreciated some parts of the script that were risks--injecting humor into such a gritty film as well as the horrific way the film ended. Both aspects of the film worked but could have easily fallen flat with the audience.<br/><br/>A great film and a must-see for any serious fan of cinema.<br/><br/>By the way, many years later, a follow-up to THE DIRTY DOZEN was made for TV. It was totally unnecessary and is very skipable. As the old expression goes, ""you can never go back""."

","The special operations by convicts are described in the books in the series 0011 by the Germans on the East-front.  There were never American convicts doing an action in war.  The attack by the SS-parachutists and convicts on the headquarters of Tito were well conducted and at the last moment Tito could escape but there were heavy losses specially on the side of the partisans.  Oberstürmbannführer (he never became general but he laughed at the action by the parachutists on the raid on Tito) Otto Skorzeny did a lot of operations in the uniform of the enemy and he even got into the headquarters of the Hungarian army. In the battle of the Bulge he just had not enough American material (jeeps, weapons etc...) to conduct a similar operation.  I think Robert Aldrich made the movie at a moment Americans needed support for their war against Vietnam. However, in reality German sharpshooters shot and did not miss their target, something the Americans seem to have forgotten since then. I found this movie a pleasure to watch at but at the same moment I had to imagine that it was only cinema and had nothing to do with reality.  So I imagined that the killed human beings in the movie were only puppets and that it was only a game.  The actors are good and the action is good.  Telly Salavas, Don Suterhland, Bronson, Lee Marvin they are OK. Just one question: in our time of computer-games, did this movie get old?"

A unclear shot that couldn't of hit kills a character after a corny line like ""we did it."" Not that you could see where it hit anyway. One work LAME! Oh, there was one person shot in the head. Even though that didn't seem to add up. This was directed by a child's mind. Like kids playing army man. I shot. Oh I will fall down. They smile even though they are slaughtering women, and we are to pity them getting shot? Or believe it as they chant like it was a game? Yeah I know they were mostly murderers, but still the ones that were sane smiled killing people like this. And why would any of these idiots get on a little boat to do nothing? <br/><br/>This movie SUCKED BIG TIME> A movie for the lesser mind. I watch a lot of movies from every era. This has to be the most over rated movie I have seen yet. I like the Wild Bunch and love WW2 movies. You would think this would kind of a combo here. But this...

","Wellington's famous remark about his soldiers would seem to apply to the dirty dozen, but the only really unpleasant member of the team was the religious misogyny maniac played by Telly Savalas. The rest seemed fairly normal, just like ordinary everyday criminals. Presumably the military has always offered refuge to the unfortunate detritus of humanity. It has often licked the scum into shape. In Britain, they used to be sent to sea.<br/><br/>This is not an easy movie to review, nevertheless. The direction is skilled, the acting totally competent, if not especially demanding. The narrative is gripping, although there are a few disconcerting jump cuts. Lee Marvin holds it all together with exemplary swashbuckling style. However, and several reviewers have pointed this out, there is something highly distasteful about the way the final half hour spins to its ruthless conclusion. Was this some form of retribution for the Holocaust ? Realistic perhaps, but I have to dock a few stars."

The plot: take a bunch of hardened and/or condemned military criminals and turn them loose on the Nazi High Command.

","This film is a wonderful achievement.<br/><br/>The story is intriguing, filled with bitter irony, violence, and tension. The characters are great, too (and so are all of the performances.)  We really get to like and care for all of the sentenced men who make the ""Dirty Dozen,"" and also for Lee Marvin, the best bad-ass to ever appear on the screen!  The movie is funny, extremely brutal, and even touching at the end. Although it is quite fictional, and considered an ""action"" film, it still leaves much up for discussion, such as the way these men are locked up for committing crimes at first, keeping them from doing their jobs as soldiers, or professional killers.  And once they do get their chance to serve, and become heroes, their actions are merciless--the mission is plain and simple; kill a group of unsuspecting German generals to cause confusion on the eve of D-Day.  It has many chilling moments; Lee Marvin orders that they dump gasoline on their enemies.  The MP's response, ""Gasoline!?  Are you sure?"" is unforgettable, and so is Marvin's expression when he leaves the embattled chateau and sees that one of his men has been killed.<br/><br/>The final forty-five minutes of the movie are amazingly tense--and possibly the shortest forty-five minutes you'll ever experience watching a movie. The only thing I wish they could change;  I'd like it if a certain character (the last one to get killed) lived.  Oh well, I guess it does give his arc some closure.

","I was not much entertained by this old WW2 epic. Felt slow. Probably I have seen many similarly themed movies by now which were spawned by this one. A colourful gang of allied forces military/criminals were recruited to do a focussed attack behind enemy/german lines during the later part of WW2. They were led by a Rebellious type Army colonel- Lee marvin. I liked his portrayal. The team consisted of later day famous actors including Charles bronson, Donald sutherland etc. I particularly liked the actor of the role of Franco. He got nominated for some awards including Oscar.
The preparation for the final project went on very long and in some parts were enjoyable. Ego issues between the team and the other army divisions were well depicted.
The ultimate attack had a lesser screen time. The germans felt caricatures to me. May be the time this movie was made has been to far from my time now.

"screenman","6","2","4","13 November 2010"," Formulaic
","Although it was considered to be a pretty ground-breaking movie in its time, today it comes across as over-long, predictable, and formulaic.<br/><br/>The story premises that a bunch of criminals can be trained to commit slaughter behind enemy lines. Quite why such a dangerously rebellious team would be considered more fit for a stealthy mission than specialised outfits is never made clear. And really; the disbelief begins there.<br/><br/>Once selected, they are trained in various techniques. About three-quarters of the movie (I never actually timed it) is dedicated to this whipping-them-into-a-team business. It's far too long and discursive. We don't actually see much of the training, just vignettes. There's also a lengthy war-games episode where they get to prove their worth.<br/><br/>Along the way there are plenty of little gags with humorous twists of military music lending it the flavour almost of a comedy drama. 'Kelly's Heroes' comes to mind.<br/><br/>The cast contains some of Hollywood's top drawer. Lee Marvin, Ernie Borgnine, Charles Bronson, Robert Ryan, Telly Savalas and many more give decent turns for their money. The script isn't too bad either. Otherwise the mission is just another standard juvenile shoot-em-up. The Nazis are - as usual - arrogant and stupid (you wonder how they managed to conquer Europe). The 'Dirty Dozen' get winnowed down to one. Curiously, one of the stockade MP guards also goes on the mission. Did he volunteer? For a fantasy war-time actioner, it doesn't get close to 'The Guns Of Navarone', 'Where Eagles Dare', or the already mentioned 'Kelly's Heroes'. It's got more in common with 'The Wild Bunch'. <br/><br/>As to the mission itself: Herding a large group of German Army Officers along with their wives & girlfriends into a cellar and incinerating them alive with gasoline would surely amount to a war-crime by any reasonable evaluation. It's outrageous, scarcely any different from what the Nazis did to the Jews. Sadly, it also typifies the inveterate sense of western moral superiority that has dogged its international relations for so many decades. We are in the right so we can do as we like.<br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen this movie then it's well worth a look. But far more tense or humorous, intelligent and believable wartime actioners both fantasy or otherwise are out there, not least the three just mentioned."
"Polaris_DiB","6","2","4","7 February 2009"," A dirty, grungy film.
","WW2 classics tend to have the unfair connotation as being those movies your grandfather likes because they reflect conservative patriotism and Americans defeating evil Krauts and Japs with flashing grins and gusto. The Dirty Dozen is not that movie. Instead of beaming, all American youth, the cast is filled with slightly menacing, slouching actors portraying counter-cultural antiheroes the witch tit's side of likable. Instead of glorifying the ranks and institutions of the military, the film delights in criticizing and tearing down its structure. And instead of an awarding cathartic defeat of the Germans, the viewer is treated to disturbing and morally ambiguous ending.<br/><br/>It's definitely a film of the 60s, but weirdly one that you wouldn't expect would be as appreciated and recognized as others. Its counterculture and anti-institutional approach is not set as a rallying cry for individualism or anti-war protest, but instead is subjected to leering and sometimes frightening characters like Franko and Maggot (get it? A Spanish fascist and a putrefaction growth as a violent bully and a disturbed racist and sexist Southerner, respectively?). The movie doesn't have an anti-war message but certainly does not make war seem sensible or dignified. The Americans certainly aren't the good guys but neither are the main characters. Pretty much all the viewer has going for him in terms of relateability or enjoyment is Lee Marvin's curmudgeony major. Everything else in this movie stinks to high heaven--but at least that's intentional.<br/><br/>It's certainly an interesting viewing experience, I'll give it that, and I'd like to know more about its reception at the time.

"Gatorman9","8","0","0","4 January 2013"," Very good, however implausible
","This is another one of those excellently-crafted movies you see sometimes which successfully romanticizes something that in reality would have been a very repellent business, and moreover does so in spite of a seriously implausible plot premise. As anybody with any experience with real screw-ups of the the variety featured in this movie knows, the chances of getting consistently constructive work, much less making useful members of team of much of the human material available here, and even under the least stressful of conditions, is right at about zero, and as true war history buffs know, the kinds of real-life efforts that inspired the raid that forms the basis of this offering have been manned and carried out without the need to descend the extreme depicted here. <br/><br/>That said, however, the American imagination, which has proved it can swallow anything from children's dolls possessed by evil spirits to Santa Claus alive and well and living in a Long Island retirement home (and even to any number of overwrought, incompetent buffoons seeking high office), can easily digest this one, and once it does you have a meticulously written narrative with excellent dialog expertly performed by an appealing cast led perfectly by Lee Marvin, who was just perfect in his role. I thought that apart from the plot premise the writing was so superb that it was a shame that the original premise was not altered somewhat to make it as believable as much of the rest of story and dialog are. Had it been, rather than one of the best Saturday afternoon military video fantasies ever, it could have had the potential to rank up there near Bridge on The River Kwai or Lawrence of Arabia as a true artistic achievement. Instead the whole thing comes off as something of a two-hour-long gag, one long, running smirk at authority more in the manner of a light parody rather than the depiction of reality, even with questioning of authority, that it could have been. In this sense I do not think it is fair at all to compare it to the much more reality-anchored Great Escape, for example. <br/><br/>All that said, this movie is at least one of the best rainy Saturday afternoon military video fantasies ever, and is still in the top 10% in that genre to this day, more than 40 years after it was made."

I was a little troubled by two things though.....the gasoline being poured on the wives and girlfriends of the German officers, although I guess it could be considered one of the casualties of war, and the stereotyping of the psychotic Maggot as a religious white Southerner.  Hollywood seems to have a problem with religious white southerners usually portraying them as rapists, murderers, and all around bad guys.  My favorite character in the film was John Cassavetes' Victor Franco though.  Cassavetes played the role to perfection. But that's not taking anything away from Lee Marvin's or Charles Bronson's performances.

","The Dirty Dozen was right up there with the other WWII epics that were made in the 60's. Lee Marvin has always shined in these roles because he actually saw combat and was wounded in WWII, so what you're seeing on the screen is close to the real deal. The Big Red One is another example. Here, Lee is given the task of training a dozen army convicts, some basically decent guys, some real psychos, and lead them on a suicide mission to a French chateau to assassinate as many German officers as possible. Along the way, we see them training, eventually bonding, and then finally going on the mission. It has a few scenes that are comedic, and some scenes have a certain edge, or meanness to them, like when innocent civilians get killed with cold detachment. The cast is great, with each principal actor given his moment to establish his character. So all in all, it's a great action flick, especially the last hour."

The guardhouse from which Robert Ryan comes out and orders the band to eventually play was only demolished in 1992, but the main gate and base were demolished quite soon after RAF Hendon closed down in 1969. The spot where Lee Marvin and Donald Sutherland stood is more or less where the present day traffic roundabout is. When Lee Marvin is in the jeep being driven to the base, they are driving down Aerodrome Road (still there, and originally built by German POWs during the First World War). If you look carefully at that scene, you can see a building at the right-hand side which is part of the Metropolitan Police training camp. Incidentally, the Douglas C-47s in the background were just wooden mock ups. Where they stood is now a road leading to a large housing estate. Like some of the reviewers on IMDb, I also have serious reservations about the ending. It is extremely disturbing when you realise that the women are having petrol poured down on them. Admittedly, they are with Nazi officers, and a similar fate would have befallen them if the building had, for example, been bombed by an RAF Mosquito squadron (which was far more likely), but even so it the idea still seems nasty and, in the circumstances, rather unnecessary. For that reason I only give the movie two stars."
"writers_reign","8","2","5","31 July 2018"," 12 Angry Men
","This film stands up remarkably well after half a century and the casting separates the men from the boys in the sense that the real actors like Robert Ryan went on getting work for years afterwards while the flavor-of-the-month school like Telly Savalas plus the out-and-out novelty castings like Trini Lopez enjoyed a mayfly moment and then found their natural level. It was a workable idea and movies with numbers - The Magnificent Seven, Ocean's Eleven - tended to score by a combination of potent names and a decent script. This is no exception and it has another factor going for it i.e. the three stages; 1) Recruitment, 2) Training, 3) the caper and/or mission, all designed to generate interest segueing into suspense. Whilst it can be faulted if one puts ones' mind to it it is also easy to score it eight out of ten for all three stages."

","There have been plenty of films about small groups of soldiers pitted against superior forces or given special training to achieve a seemingly impossible task. And many of those films involved ragtag misfits given a chance to avoid far worse ends than death in battle.<br/><br/>But ""The Dirty Dozen"" is notable for its less biased portrayal of Americans at war. Unlike the war films produced during WWII, ""The Dirty Dozen"" paints both sides of the conflict with the brush of realism. We see American soldiers commit crimes and act out of malice.<br/><br/>Another notable aspect of the film is that one of the dozen was portrayed by Jim Brown, active NFL running back. As an Ohio native and a fan of Brown (and the Cleveland Browns), it was novel to see the athlete--certainly one of the best athletes of all time and the best running back ever by most accounts--on the big screen.<br/><br/>The story, which portrays the hellish nature of war, including the slaughter of noncombatants, still has a humorous side. The dozen, who are recruited for a mission behind the German lines, have no respect for authority or discipline. Their recruiter (Lee Marvin) uses novel ways to gain their respect and to convince them that he values them as men and soldiers. On one occasion, he imports prostitutes into the training camp for their entertainment. And the men display cleverness and outside-the-box thinking (something most soldiers have drilled out of them) to prove their mettle and earn the chance to attempt the mission.<br/><br/>As in detailed bank heists, Marvin trains his men thoroughly and tests them repeatedly. But things never go exactly as planned. During the mission, they have to be creative.<br/><br/>In an odd way, this film probably appeals to those who like films of wartime and those who possess more anti-war sentiments. The all-star cast is largely responsible, though the story is certainly engaging."

","""Vera Cruz"" director Robert Aldritch made a one-of-a-kind World War II movie with ""The Dirty Dozen"" based closely on E.M. Nathanson's bestselling novel about a U.S. Army plan to sneak military prisoners behind enemy lines at a rest and recuperation château where high ranking German officers had time to miss the horrors of war and indulge themselves in wine, good food, classic music, and willing women. Although it is the most popular of the parole-them-from-prison plots, ""The Dirty Dozen"" doesn't qualify as the first Hollywood film to exploit this gimmick. The Errol Flynn swashbuckler ""Captain Blood"" is the earliest of the films about prisoners who receive a parole or who are exonerated for their crimes in return for valiant service to their country.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this groundbreaking World War II adventure epic spawned many imitators from European filmmakers, and Aldritch himself fared unsuccessfully in his own attempt to imitate himself with ""Too Late the Hero."" Insubordinate U.S. Army officer, Major John Reisman (Lee Marvin of ""Point Blank"") finds himself shafted into recruiting twelve hardened criminals that he must then train and take behind enemy lines to carry out a mission. Naturally, Reisman regards the plan as preposterous, and General Denton (Robert Webber of ""$"") is properly outraged. Reisman argues that these half-wits must receive a pardon or they will not go for the deal. Most of the men that he recruits are awaiting execution of their sentence, namely getting hanged by the neck until dead. General Worden (Ernst Borgnine of ""The Wild Bunch"") is inclined to agree with Reisman in his assessment of the plan.<br/><br/>Warden picks his twelve prisoners, among them are Victor Franco (John Cassavetes of ""Saddle the Wind""), Archer Maggot (Telly Savalas of ""The Battle of the Bugle""), Samson Posey (Clint Walker of ""Cheyenne""), Robert Jefferson (Jim Brown of ""Rio Conchos""), Vernon Pinkley (Donald Sutherland in a pre-""M.A.S.H."" role), and Joseph Wladislaw (Charles Bronson of ""New So Few""), and they are a dirty, unshaven lot that don't respond well to discipline. ""I think the first chance they get,"" observes M.P. Sergeant Bowren (Richard Jaeckel of ""The Devil's Brigade""), ""they will shoot the major in the head."" Reisman relocates his men to a compound that they must build where he trains them in assorted maneuvers. The worst of the bunch is Victor Franco and Reisman uses Franco as a means to draw the others together so that they become the 'Dirty Dozen.' He does this by denying them water to shave with. Meanwhile, snooty Colonel Everett Dasher Breed (Robert Ryan of ""Hour of the Gun"") contends that his men can beat Reisman's rabble, so Worden schedules a war games and the Dozen prove that they are fit for their mission. Breed and Reisman hate each other with a passion.<br/><br/>Basically, ""The Dirty Dozen"" occurs in three parts: (1) the training, (2) the war games gauntlet, and (3) the final mission. The assault on the German château in the last half-hour of ""The Dirty Dozen"" is a nail biting, spine-tingler. ""The Dirty Dozen"" tops the movie chart as the most profitable movie made in its year of release. Belatedly, a number of lackluster sequels and eventually a short-lived television series followed in the wake of Aldritch's dynamic opus. Probably the most reprehensible character in the ""Dozen"" is Telly Savalas' racist Southern redneck who loves to use the N-word. The most suspenseful scene involves Jefferson's dash against machine gun fire as he dumps hand grenades into pipes leading to an underground room in the château. Of course, not everybody survives this blood curdling shoot'em up. The Charles Bronson character manages to stay alive and he has one of the best lines at the end of the film: ""Killing generals could get to be a habit."" The name-dropping celebrity cast, great production values, and taut helming by Aldritch make this a first-rate movie for guys. If you are a World War II fanatic and you haven't seen ""The Dirty Dozen,"" then you must watch this movie!"
"Quinoa1984","9","2","6","13 March 2008"," one of the supreme ""d*** flicks"" of its time
","If you want that charge of adrenaline, and more than a few laughs, from an era when men were MEN, in capital letters, look no further. And what entertaining, all-absorbing MEN, or rather real-life stars. The basic gist we got here is as follows: Lee Marvin is the Major who leads a a rag-tag group of convicts in WW2 Europe on a daring, very dangerous mission to kill as many officers possible in a huge fortress. The premise has that ensemble ring of Seven Samurai, but it's given that level of pathos that is not entirely dissimilar (or not featuring some of the same cast members) as Cool Hand Luke. This isn't your common war movie in the sensibility of the characters, a mentality that has just that whiff of professionalism and a whole lot of ""let's mess with the heads of those in charge."" It's a balancing act that director Aldrich tries for with the material, with half the movie being bad-ass hijinks- bordering almost on sophomoric, as the music often chimes a level between chirpy military anthem and Donald Duck- and the other as hard-edged action movie.<br/><br/>While Aldrich is up to task, performing his directorial duties with a cool professionalism (particularly in the climactic attack on the fortress, which goes between exhilarating and terrifying and with suspense thrown in for obvious measure), it's the cast assembled that make the mark it as an excellent effort. Everybody is spot-on, from Cassavetes, in one of his most notable turns, as a wise-ass who wises up, to Bronson and Brown in their own distinctive molds, to Sutherland's aloof ""General"", and to especially the real psycho in Savalas. Even parts that are pretty standard like Borgnine and Kennedys' parts are fulfilled with all their worth. And Marvin steers the ship with a level fo vigor that defines what the hell we guys watch these flicks for. He's no fake; beneath his actual acting chops he's the kind of guy who looks like, under these circumstances (not to mention, especially, Samuel Fuller's The Big Red One), like he can get things done.<br/><br/>But beneath the veneer of being a total hard-head who won't take any guff and can poise attack or defense in a heartbeat, there's humanity to him. And this, too, reflects a good lot of the Dirty Dozen. Just watch the scene where the girls are brought in from town to 'amuse' the soldiers. That moment when all of those guys, bearded and without a shower in weeks, are before these semi-attractive ladies, are sort of humbled and Franco asks one to dance despite the lack of music, which he hums. This interaction itself doesn't have much to do with the plot, albeit the scene's needed to get Marvin in trouble later with his superiors, but it's crucial to see a glimpse of the other side to these men, when all of a sudden taken out of their 'guy' element. And it's a help that there's this backdrop of humility in the face of wackiness and a climax that stands as one of the greats in war movies. 9.5/10"

","There have been many sequels,copies and even a TV show about this concept. But the original ""Dirty Dozen"" is still the best. Even when you look at this movie now it is exciting as hell. The action mixed with good performances is something you just have to see. Even people who don't like war movies will like this movie. Technically this is a movie about one mission to be fulfilled by expendable soldiers (read convicts who are trained) in the second world war. You will see the very reluctant and disorganized convicts transform in highly trained and competent soldiers. This is a fun thing to see and experience. Of course it is not realistic but the idea of using a team like this could have been real. If you think about it convicts who are sentenced to death could be of use in killing (in this case) the Germans. They have nothing to lose. The chance of defecting to the German would be very minimal. After doubts from a Col. Everett Dasher Breed the team are put to the test. They win the test in such a brilliant way that you are convinced that they will succeed the mission. From start till the end ""Dirty Dozen"" doesn't disappoint. This is a movie you can watch over again and again. That's why ""Dirty Dozen"" is a wonderful classic!"

","""The Dirty Dozen"", Robert Aldrich's 1967 adventure classic, would redefine a whole genre of films, as public attitudes towards warfare and heroism changed, due to Vietnam. With 'heroes' who were certainly not noble, a mission that would require a level of cruelty film audiences had never before seen from American fighting men, and graphic language and bloodshed, the impact of the the film was both immediate (despite huge 'box office', many critics panned the film as 'disturbing' and glorifying violence), and continuing (influencing films as diverse as ""Patton"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""). It can be viewed at many levels, as a crackling good adventure yarn, an 'anti-establishment' and anti-war statement, the ultimate 'buddy' film...few films have generated as much controversy, or stood the passage of time, better! <br/><br/>Based on E.M. Nathanson's novel (of rumored 'Death Row' convicts offered a pardon or reduction of sentence for volunteering for a suicide mission), with a large dash of the Pathfinders' legendary ""Filthy Thirteen"" of WWII tossed in, the property was purchased as a potential starring vehicle for John Wayne. The Duke passed on the project, however (choosing to make ""The Green Berets"", instead). Director Aldrich never envisioned Wayne in the lead, preferring WWII Marine vet Lee Marvin in the complex role of maverick Maj. John Reisman, and the actor, fresh from winning an Oscar for ""Cat Ballou"", was dead-on perfect in the part. Veteran stars Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Ralph Meeker, Robert Webber, George Kennedy, and Richard Jaeckel were cast as Marvin's military allies and adversaries.<br/><br/>For the ""Front Six"" of the Dozen, sullen Charles Bronson (another WWII vet), John Cassavetes (who would garner an Oscar nomination), Telly Savalas (in the most 'whacked-out' role in his career), Clint Walker (of ""Cheyenne"" TV fame), football legend Jim Brown (in only his second film), and popular singer Trini Lopez (in his film debut) would dominate the screen time, with a ""Back Six"" of character actors in much smaller roles, simply filling out the rest of the twelve parts. But a movie 'miracle' occurred; when Walker objected to a scene where, as a bogus 'General', he would idiotically review an Airborne unit (feeling it demeaned Native Americans, who his character portrayed), Aldrich passed the scene to ""Back Six"" actor Donald Sutherland...and the scene would spectacularly launch his career, leading to his starring role in ""M.A.S.H."" <br/><br/>Aldrich's meticulous shooting style, and the often rainy British weather (where the film was shot), more than doubled the shooting schedule, and after seven months on location, Trini Lopez (on the advice of friend Frank Sinatra), informed Aldrich and the producers that he was missing singing dates, and would need a pay hike to continue. To Lopez' surprise, Aldrich 'dropped' him, having him die in the climactic parachute drop! <br/><br/>The director was warned that if he didn't eliminate the film's most controversial scene (pouring gasoline and dropping grenades on the women guests, as well as the Nazi officers seeking refuge in the bomb shelters), he would lose any chance of a 'Best Director' Oscar nomination. After soul-searching, he left the scene in (""War is Hell, and HAS to be portrayed that way""), and while he sacrificed the prize, Robert Aldrich gave the film a brutal honesty that subsequent wars would sadly verify.<br/><br/>""The Dirty Dozen"" survived contemporary criticism, and has proved to be one of the most enduring war films of all time, as fresh today as when it debuted in 1967."

","http://www.all-reviews.com/videos-5/dirty-dozen.htm<br/><br/>According to an article written many years ago, the original ""The Dirty Dozen"" novel was actually based on real life story. US military convicts were offered pardon in exchange for similar suicide missions in Nazi occupied France. They agreed, but after the drop they turned their tails and spent the rest of the war in neutral Spain. In real life, use of pardoned convicts as soldiers is rather common phenomena, as experiences in former Yugoslavia indicate. In WWII Red Army and Wehrmacht employed such practice. The operation that actually resembles this movie the most was conducted by Germans. In May of 1944, frustrated with unsuccessful attempts to chase down and destroy the core formations of Yugoslav Partisans, German High Command planned the daring parachute raid on the headquarters of Partisan leader Tito and trained entire battalion of convicts for that very purpose. At the end of the day, Tito, although initially surprised, managed to get away and the convict paratroopers, decimated in a hellatious battle, took only Tito's freshly tailored Field Marshall uniform as their only trophy."

"Lejink","7","1","2","26 February 2012"," Lee majors...
","No pretensions at art here, this was a contrived, unbelievable, but ultimately very entertaining war movie. Following the multi-star cast approach of ""The Great Escape"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"", we get the naturally elongated running time, as much to allow us to familiarise ourselves with the individual characters as anything else.<br/><br/>There were aspects of the plotting and pacing I didn't take to though, especially the borderline psychotic character Telly Savalas is asked to play, a misogynist racist. I can only guess he was in there to show social awareness for the then current civil rights movement in his spats with Jim Brown, but why make him a woman-hater (and killer) too? I also felt too much time was put on the pre-amble where the dozen bond together at the expense of a miscast Robert Ryan as a pompous general. And I also took exception to the wanton slaughter of women in the Nazi stronghold cellar - yes, war is hell and all that, but such butchery brought the Americans almost down to the level of the Germans, especially when there was little in the film demonstrating the savagery of the Nazis, even if I'm not naive enough to not be aware of their barbarism during the war itself.<br/><br/>On the positive side, most of the casting is excellent, my only other carp being the inclusion if singer Trini Lopez who wouldn't you know gets to strum a guitar and sing at one juncture. Of the rest, Lee Marvin is excellent as the granite-hard maverick major, John Cassavetes is fine as the recalcitrant Franko and Charles Bronson delivers another effectively stoic performance.<br/><br/>The climax is suitably tense and action-packed, although I might have wished for the sequence to be extended at the expense of some of what went before, but for mindless, action-filled war entertainment, this was good stuff."

A sort of Magnificent seven (featuring some of the same actors) set in world war two, with some light hearted training sequences and a bloody finale. This film is not as good as the film it imitates however. Part of the problem is the set up. First we see Lee Marvin witnessing a hanging. Then we are introduced to a gang of reprobate soldiers. Despite it being hinted that some of them may not be guilty, it is hard to feel much sympathy for them. There's a whiner (cassavetes) a smiling idiot (Sutherland) and a religious nut (Savalas) plus the usual short guy and big lummox who doesn't know his own strength. After these grim opening scenes, suddenly things are light hearted. The long training sequences are highly entertaining (Sutherland surveying the troops is a joy) but they seem to come from a different film. One always has in the back of the mind that these men are supposed to have committed brutal and sadistic crimes. As the mission starts, the tone inevitably darkens, back to the mood of the opening only more so. A bloody raid on a château kills many indiscriminately, most notoriously the fire bombing of the basement. After this the brief mildly comic hospital scene is out of place.<br/><br/>A curate's egg of a film, but definitely entertaining."

","THE DIRTY DOZEN is a war action film that, in an unconventional and violent way, but with a lot of emotions, glorifies a group of criminal soldiers. This story is very brutal and perverted with a single sadistic note, but it is not irresponsible. It is based on E. M. Nathanson's novel of the same name that was inspired by a real-life group called the ""Filthy Thirteen"".<br/><br/>Major Reisman is assigned to coordinate a suicide mission on a French château held by top Nazi officers. He is to train a small band of the Army's worst convicts (selected for him) and turn them into commandos to be sent on a virtual suicide mission. After witnessing a hanging in a military prison, Reisman meets his 12 convicts (the 'Dirty Dozen'), all either serving lengthy sentences or awaiting execution. He visits them individually in their cells. Some details of their crimes are revealed and he uses a different approach with each in an effort to gain their cooperation. After being forced to construct their own living quarters, the 12 men are trained in close combat by Reisman and gradually learn how to operate as a group...<br/><br/>Simply, it is difficult to imagine such a situation and conditions, but the plots are very exciting. The characters have an anti heroic mood, which corresponds to their harsh habits and indiscipline. This story does not resist various forms of sadism and morbid situations. Mr. Aldrich has made a trap, as he has managed to bring the army and the criminals into an imaginary line. This may be somehow absurd, however, given the conditions of warfare, that makes sense. Simply, in this movie, they are all rough, crazy and incapable for something.<br/><br/>The characterization is not bad, but dialogues are pretty poor.<br/><br/>Lee Marvin as Maj. John Reisman is an impolite and ruthless but very brave colonel. Charles Bronson as Joseph Wladislaw is a silent and staid killer. John Cassavetes as Victor R. Franko is a psychopathic rebel, who has a strange desire to prove to himself. Telly Savalas as Archer J. Maggott is a sexual maniac under the guise of a religious fanaticism. He is, probably, the most striking character in the movie. Jim Brown as Robert T. Jefferson is an athlete who seems to be in a wrong place. Donald Sutherland as Vernon L.

","After years of reading about it, I finally decided to watch The Dirty Dozen on Netflix Streaming especially since it would be off it by tomorrow. Lee Marvin as Major Reisman is assigned to lead the title group of men either condemned to death or a very long prison term. Among them: Charles Bronson, Donald Sutherland, Telly Savalas, Jim Brown, and John Cassavetes. The last one is the first to rebel against Marvin and he's perhaps the one that made the most impression on me as a result. No wonder he got the Oscar nomination. Sutherland has a funny scene when he has to pass himself as a general that I read later got him the movie version of M*A*S*H. Savalas and Brown provide the conflict within the team that gets the exciting climax going. And Bronson essays the authority to go with Marvin in leading the mission. Some mistakes that I noticed-like when the Dozen switch the blue bands for red during the ""War Games"" sequence before they seemed to switch back for a few minutes or women wearing '60s hairstyles in a '40s setting-confused me but overall, The Dirty Dozen has enough compelling dramatics and action for me to recommend."
"Steffi_P","8","1","3","8 July 2010"," ""Playing war games""
","The war movie was in constant evolution in the decades following the worldwide conflict which most of them drew on for source material. We went from respectful recreations in the immediate aftermath, to the use of war as a backdrop for fictional stories (e.g. From Here to Eternity, Bridge on the River Kwai), at which point tentative anti-military themes began to creep in. But while previous anti-war pictures may have been tragic, ironic and harrowing, The Dirty Dozen revitalised the subgenre by showing war as bloody, brutal and nihilistic.<br/><br/>A few years after this a man called Sam Peckinpah would become a byword for screen violence. Peckinpah, by the sheer poetry of his images, inadvertently glamorised the very carnage he sought to condemn. However Robert Aldrich, who directs The Dirty Dozen, takes a slightly more detached view. Sure, Aldrich knows how to make dynamic and exciting combat scenes, shooting series of increasingly frenzied images for the editor (honourable mention to the very talented Michael Luciano) to patch together. However, he takes care never to let us get swept along with the killing. There are scarcely any point-of-view shots, and indeed many of the camera set-ups throughout the picture are from positions where no character could be – up on high or peeping through bits of foreground clutter. These were always typical of Aldrich, but here his use of distant ""god"" shots is more abundant than ever. The sense of aloofness this creates means that, while the action is great to watch, it never quite makes us want to pick up a gun and get stuck in ourselves.<br/><br/>That is not to say Aldrich is completely cold and detached. He frequently finds room for intensely personal close-ups, showing the humanity of the men and thus drawing out an important strand in the story. Although he was only a writer on a handful of projects, Aldrich always sought to demonstrate his ruggedly affectionate side through his imagery, in even his most macho and ostensibly emotionless pictures. And when at one point he makes a visual reference to The Last Supper, it's not done directly enough to be some twee bit of ironic symbolism. Instead Aldrich seems to honouring these men with their final shred of dignity.<br/><br/>But all these intentions would be lost if it were not for a delightfully talented and appropriate cast. Lee Marvin does his superb world-weary, grudgingly humane hero act, and there are some nice supporting roles by the up-and-coming George Kennedy and former lead man Ralph Meeker. But let's face it – it's the titular twelve whom we really want to watch. With one or two exceptions, these guys were more or less unknowns, and it was only really Donald Sutherland who would ever become an ""A"" player. And yet, virtually all do a marvellous job. John Cassavetes is more than just a psychotic grin – everything in his body language radiates his rebelliousness. Telly Savalas gives one of the most credible maniac performances I have ever seen – far better than the hammy Ernest Borgnine in Flight of the Phoenix. At first glance these guys appear to have been picked for their twisted faces or burly physique, but they can really act.<br/><br/>The end result is an intelligent and professional work disguised as an action no-brainer. So why were pictures like this – violent yet incisive – being produced around this time? It was of course partly the increasing frankness of the era and the fact that the old production code was now in tatters. But it was also the ongoing conflict in Vietnam, which thanks to television was bringing the horror of war into the living room, and also galvanising a popular anti-war mood. It would still have been commercial suicide for a motion picture to critique the war directly, but a lot of movies from the time lambasted it indirectly with the terrors of a previous conflict. And oddly enough, perhaps through their honest intentions of being entertainment rather than mere soapboxes, pictures like The Dirty Dozen hold up better than many of the genuine anti-Vietnam pictures that were to appear once that war was over."

","I saw this film in 1967, at the age of 13. I had been watching ""Combat"" on TV, and I knew the ""Krauts"" were evil, and the ""G.I. Joe's"" were always good and heroic. What a surprise to find out that Americans could be evil as well. I will always enjoy Telly Savalas, as Pvt. A.J. Maggot. He has the most evil laugh, and he is a Bible-reading, avenging angel of the Lord. What an over-the-top performance. When he is walking around the château, saying ""Come out you sinners, come out come out, wherever you are!"" I always cheer. Go get 'em A.J. !! The cast is superb, the film was Donald Sutherland's big break, he was picked to play the ""General"", and he ripped into the part, like a pit bull, the perfect touch of comic genius. Even Trini Lopez, was terrific, as a felon, whose only problem, is that the guards won't let him have any strings for his guitar. He gets the strings, and gets to sing ""The Bramble Bush"".<br/><br/>John Cassavetes (oscar-nominated) is perfectly slimy, as the ""little bastard"", Victor Franko. Always bitching about the floor,or the hot water, just superb.<br/><br/>The terrific cast includes Robert Webber, as a brightly polished adjutant officer, the perfect counter-point to the undisciplined Major Reisman (Lee Marvin). Robert Ryan, plays a west-pointer, who has the perfect combination of rage and humor.<br/><br/>The technical side of the film is excellent. Superb camera work and cinematography, smooth editing, great close-up work on Telly Savalas. Frank DeVol's score is riveting: drumbeats, and precise military rhythms. We even get to hear Sousa's ""National Emblem"" march. Robert Aldrich's precise direction, keeps a fine pace, during the first half of the film, mixing some comedy with the efforts of the scum-bags to become soldiers again. The climax builds, and then the successful conclusions.<br/><br/>Ex-football player, Jim Brown, is superb. The Army was segregated in 1944, and Telly Savalas asks ""Do we have to eat with n*****s?"" and then a riot ensues. We keep waiting for Jim Brown to run. When is he going to run? Finally, he gets to run, blowing up the Krauts. Sort of a reprise to Jesse Owens, showing up the Nazis at the Berlin Olympics.<br/><br/>I never miss a chance to see this film, every time it is run on TV."
"lee_eisenberg","9","1","3","16 July 2008"," twelve cool men
","With the Vietnam War in full swing in 1967, they released a movie about WWII that took a comedic/bleak approach. ""The Dirty Dozen"" strikes the perfect pitch between zany humor and cynicism: these twelve men are on death row for crimes like rape and murder...and they're getting trained to kill more people! If they succeed, then they might get lighter sentences; if they die in action...well, that's that. Previous WWII-themed films had focused exclusively on the war - with no cynicism - but this one alludes to the Vietnam War while also dealing occasionally with racism.<br/><br/>Part of the movie's strength is the characters. In my opinion, Maj. John Reisman (Lee Marvin) takes a back seat to the assembled group. Among the dozen are religious bigot Archer Maggot (Telly Savalas), former officer Joseph Wladislaw (Charles Bronson) and Samson Posey (Clint Walker), who acts nearly catatonic. But probably the neatest is sassy Victor Franko (John Cassavetes), with his line ""You slob! You slob!""; it must have been fun to film that! One can certainly see this as a precursor to movies like ""M*A*S*H"" (and both movies star Donald Sutherland) and ""Catch-22"". It certainly remains worth seeing in this day and age. Also starring Ernest Borgnine, Jim Brown, Richard Jaeckel, George Kennedy, Trini Lopez, Ralph Meeker, Robert Ryan, Robert Webber and Tom Busby.<br/><br/>PS: in 1998, the surviving cast members (Ernest Borgnine, Jim Brown, George Kennedy and Clint Walker) lent their voices to the movie ""Small Soldiers"" as the soldiers."
"classicsoncall","8","1","3","25 May 2008"," ""Killing generals could get to be a habit with me.""
","Wow, it's forty years since this film was made, and forty years since I last saw it. I've been revisiting some of the pictures I initially saw upon their original theatrical release in order to see how my impression of the movie might have changed over time. ""The Dirty Dozen"" still holds up as a strong war time drama, made most compelling for me by the way Major Reisman (Lee Marvin) reads each of his 'recruits' in order to mold them into a cohesive unit. In fact it's the first third of the picture that I enjoy the most, as the major characters are introduced and we get to know just enough about each to understand how their motivations might be exploited. John Cassavetes' portrayal of Victor Franko may have been the most complex on the surface, but Telly Savalas had an unusual assignment in the character of Archer Maggott. Although couched in religious extremism, I think the character went beyond that into a complex moral ambiguity. It was the kind of character that could have been the subject of a picture all by itself.<br/><br/>The casting surprise, if you grew up in the 1960's, had to do with Trini Lopez as the soldier Jimenez. Until this picture, my only recollection of Lopez would be as a singer with some upbeat singles hits like ""If I Had a Hammer"" and ""Lemon Tree"". I'm curious as to how he was selected for a part in this picture, since the other main characters were already fairly well established as actors (Marvin, Savalas, Bronson, George Kennedy), or on the rise (Donald Sutherland, Jim Brown). To his credit, Lopez did a fairly good job for the limited role he had.<br/><br/>What I couldn't quite understand was why the Robert Ryan character, Colonel Breed, wound up at odds with Major Reisman and the Dozen. He was aware from the start that Reisman would be training his men in secrecy for a behind the lines mission, so it didn't seem logical to me that he would try to thwart it's progress. It was mentioned earlier that Reisman and Breed didn't see eye to eye based on a former association, but still, the new objective for which Reisman was training his men was for the good of the war effort.<br/><br/>I've read with interest a number of the negative comments on the picture regarding the method of executing the mission via gasoline and explosives. I don't recall how that scenario was reviewed back in the late Sixties, but it seems we've come so far in terms of political correctness over the last forty years that there seems to be something to offend someone in every picture since, including cartoons. For my part, war is a dirty business where political correctness doesn't apply. Hitler didn't seem too concerned about incinerating women and children along with Jewish men as part of his ethnic cleansing program. If anything, the picture absolutely left out any hint of the savagery and brutality of Nazi officers, but I didn't read any complaints about that. Interesting.<br/><br/>Also interesting is the point that the fictionalized events of the story were set BEFORE America's entry into the European Theater with the Allied D-Day landing at Normandy. It's easy to overlook that fact while the movie goes through it's paces, as the viewer's memory tends to recall events and battles of World War II that hadn't occurred yet relative to the story being told."

","A great film, a bunch of criminal misfits tossed together by an even more wayward officer, Reismann (Lee Marvin) helped by a great cast, some fine moments, with the onus on them gaining freedom in exchange for going on a suicidal mission to obliterate German officers in the D-Day invasion area. Some great, strong roles by the likes of Telly Savalas as a criminal misogynist, maggot, and humour in places - IDMB has put some of the locations on here for filming. I lived where pinkley 'inspected' the troops, a former RAF base, now a housing estate, and visited the village of Aldbury. Also, Little Gaddesden where the 'Marston Tyne' Military Prison was(Now Ashridge Business college). But can anyone tell me where the actual 'chateau' was built - must have been a non-descript field nearby I suppose, but would like to know. A good film, Maggot I think had the best 'perverted' part in aspects of his character. It makes you wonder did the military ever do anything like this?

","***CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!*** The Dirty dozen is a movie whose name I've often heard yet never had the pleasure of seeing. Lee Marvin did a superb job leading the cast in their tale of teamwork and heroism, and I feel the cast was well selected. Even better, unlike the war movies of today which focus entirely on the battles and killing, The Dirty Dozen spends well over half the film on character development and building the relationships between the cast. And when they finally do get to the fighting it isn't just repetitive waves of enemies that are unrealistically held off by twelve men. Instead it portrays the actual aspects of war where the good guys are human and die. Though only 3 of the group survived, the deaths of the men aren't in vain. Many of them would have died had they refused to take part in the mission, though by dying in battle they gave their lives for their country and earned back the honor they lost through their crimes. The only reason I don't give this a 10 out of 10 is that the story began lagging slightly towards the middle, prior to their part in the war games. But overall, this is one of the best films ever created."

","The first time I saw this movie, The Dirty Dozen,in Spain in 1967, there was a 1955 or 1956 Chevy station wagon parked in front of the airfield headquarters building. It was painted olive drab and may have had U.S.Army painted on the door. Anyway, it has been about 40 years since I saw it. And it has not been in any of the later copies. Did anyone else catch that? Also, didn't Telly Savales come back in a later movie in Major Reisner's role with a new dirty dozen to basically do the dame thing all over again? Was he jealous of Lee Marvin having the lead role? All remakes of this original film have been less than as entertaining as the original. Like the Magnificent Seven most of the actors are no longer with us."

","** HERE BE SPOILERS **<br/><br/>Recap: Maj. Reisman (Marvin) is given the assignment to train twelve convicted men, either to death or very long sentences, for a covert mission it to occupied France. He is not very happy about it and the twelve convicted men are not thrilled either. There are a lot of suspicion and disbelief among the undisciplined convicts. So first Reisman has to put himself in respect, then bring the group together and at last train them to kill. Progress is slow, and Reisman's superiors are starting to lose patience. The group has to prove themselves in a war game. If they fail, they go back to prison. If they succeed they will be sent into real war were failure is much more fatal...<br/><br/>Comments: First, it is a stellar cast. Marvin, Borgnine, Bronson, Savalas, Sutherland, López and Cassavetes. Unfortunately everyone is playing tough guys so there is very little emotions present. It feels like there are much more potential in a cast like this than what is shown here. The story is good, the idea brilliant. However it is a little too long, and I did get a little bored with just the tough guy thing. No change of pace or perspective that might have felt fresh now and then. There are a few witty lines that produce a smile now and then. The war game episode is the best as it is not too long in itself. The final battle is unfortunately too long. And it is annoying that most of the soldiers seem to forget both training and common sense (for example, while trying to be sneaky, don't run upright. Or when being shot at, don't stand upright.) Still it is somewhat of a classic. Give it a try...<br/><br/>6/10"

","Refreshingly devoid of heroism(while remaining gleefully knee-deep in sensationalism), this movie honestly surprised me with it's depth. Lee Marvin is a marvel as a tough Army major assigned to whip a bunch of violent Army felons into shape for a covert mission in German territory. John Cassavetes and Charles Bronson, both smoldering, anchor the charismatic cast of convicts(half of whom remain rather anonymous, unfortunately), and Telly Savalas adds an addled charm as the psychopathic Pvt.Maggett even though his character's story arc is somewhat mishandled down the stretch. The film is rollicking at times but it remains clear-eyed throughout, and revels in the coldness of armed conflict as opposed to cheap dramatics it could have plumbed out of such a familiar story."

","Major John Reisman is an unconventional US Army officer and he has been given a very unconventional mission. He is to lead a force made up of twelve army convicts and attack a château in France where senior German officers regularly meet. These twelve men haven't been convicted of minor crimes; most of them have been sentenced to hang and the others have a long time in prison in front of them. They are told that they is a good chance that they won't survive but if they perform well they will be offered an amnesty. Before they can proceed with the mission they must be moulded into a unit rather than twelve individuals looking out for themselves. Then they will have to prove themselves to sceptical senior officers. If they fail at any point they will return to face their sentences. Eventually they are ready and the Germans won't know what hit them!<br/><br/>This is a classic 'Boys' Own Adventure' type of war film; the story is relatively simple but effective. There is plenty of humour as the team gradually bond; especially when they are getting the better of the officious Colonel Breed and the scenes in France are genuinely exciting and it soon becomes clear that they won't all be returning home. The cast does a fine job; most notably Lee Marvin, who is great as Major Reisman; Charles Bronson, who plays the German-speaking Joseph Wladislaw and Telly Savalas, who is particularly disturbing as Archer Maggott a murderous rapist who believes he is doing God's work. The rest of the cast, which includes some familiar faces are good too. If you are looking for gritty realism this may disappoint but if you want a great bunch of characters, a touch of humour all leading up to an explosive finale you should love it."

The Training went on as Reisman whipped those malcontents into shape as they proved they could handle any mission thrown their way from War Games to actual war time the Dirty Dozen was prepped and ready for action.

People thought the studio system was broken and needed fixing, by films such as 'Easy Rider'? THIS, along with other fine Aldrich works from this period, age a lot better and hold up much finer today than Dennis Hopper's so-called 'masterpiece' and its ilk."
"Leofwine_draca","9","1","4","25 June 2016"," Classic war movie
","This classic war caper starts off as a human drama - laced with comedy - before moving into action territory, where a surprising amount of pathos creeps in as the initially unstoppable dozen are picked off one by one by the Nazi enemy. The all-star cast, involved direction from Robert Aldrich and the high budget make this one to watch, as long as you forget about those insipid television movie sequels which followed in the '80s.<br/><br/>Just about every actor on screen impresses, the following in particular: Charles Bronson, his usual stony-faced self as the dozen's most courageous and heroic member; John Cassavetes as an edgy, dangerous prisoner who comes through in the end; Telly Savalas as an uncontrollable rapist and murderer who can't contain himself; Donald Sutherland as a young recruit who has no idea what he's in for; and Clint Walker as a strong man with a heart. Plus, Lee Marvin is superb in the lead role as the gruff but caring major, Ernest Borgnine enjoys himself in a cameo as the major general, cult fans will enjoy the presence of George Kennedy in a minor role, while Richard Jaeckal and Robert Ryan have strong supporting roles. It's unusual for nobody to put a foot wrong with the quantity of actors here.<br/><br/>Although it lasts for a long time - nearly two and a half hours, to be exact - THE DIRTY DOZEN (so called because of their refusal to wash or shave) never becomes boring. The training scenes which take up the first hour and a half are inspired, unpredictable and very entertaining, with the ensemble cast acting their socks off and trading great dialogue with one enough. There is enough comedy to make this work for even non-action fans. The final hour, which sees the dreaded mission - an assault on a German château - begin, is gripping stuff, with plenty of explosions and shooting to keep action fans happy, plus a fair smattering of thrills and suspense for those looking for something deeper. THE DIRTY DOZEN is an unpredictable, brilliant movie which simply HAS to be see by all war film fans."

I noticed that most people who viewed this film LOVED it, but there were also several who DAMNED it. These few individuals are what I commonly refer to as ""imbeciles,"" people who think of themselves as actual movie critics, but with the mental sensibilities of the brain dead. For example, someone who thought it was ""terrible"" because it was ""inaccurate and over the top."" Yes, it was. It's a movie, Einstein, not an historical record. Then another genius criticized the film for singling out the ""Christian soldier"" (Telly Savalas) as the psychopath as a direct threat against good Christians everywhere. Well, I'm a Christian, and I thought this decision was as valid as any other choice, particularly since there were far more Christian fanatics in the sixties than Muslims or Budddhists, wouldn't you agree? Calling someone a 'Christian soldier' is the ultimate oxymoron, in of itself! Another goofball accused the Jim Brown character as dressing up as a Nazi, further underlining the glaring inaccuracies of some of these wholly negative comments. In conclusion, this film was created solely as entertainment, not to be taken as seriously as films like ""All Quiet On The Western Front"" or ""Paths Of Glory.

"jzappa","10","1","4","3 November 2011"," Inglorious as Ever
","This out-of-the-box milestone in the American war genre kicks off on the edge of pure malevolence, the hanging of a pitiable, groveling military prisoner, pleading for mercy. Witnessing the execution is Lee Marvin's Major Reisman, who appears inflexibly distanced, but we soon find that this is in part a subterfuge. His presence at the hanging was somehow an infliction by his arch-rival ex-commander, Robert Ryan's Colonel Breed, who always finds new ways to make Reisman suffer quietly. The sole power mitigating these adversaries is Ernest Borgnine's competent but equally stubborn General Worden, who gives Reisman the newest in a string of patience-testing duties: Pending D-Day, Reisman is to head a squad of twelve soldiers to a remote French estate where various eminent German officers will be socializing to exterminate a key share of the Nazi pecking order just early enough to render the Germans powerless facing invasion. Desperate enough, and Reisman understands. The predicament is that his eponymous dozen are to be amassed from the lines of military detainees, condemned for murder or other appalling offenses.<br/><br/>So even before he ushers a platoon into its virtually guaranteed slaughter, Reisman must train that group from twelve brutal psychos, who are a colorful balance of archetypes: the honorable sort fallen into damnable circumstances, Charles Bronson's glacial Wladislaw; the livewire fueled by rancor and bitterness, John Cassavetes' Franko; Trini Lopez's pleasant Chicano Jimenez; Jim Brown's the self-protective black man Jefferson; Donald Sutherland's amiable dunce Pinkley; and Telly Savalas' smiling lunatic Maggott, whom God tells to slay loose women.<br/><br/>Deceptively formal, the movie smites into three quite clear-cut acts: In the first, we Reisman gather our crew of outcasts and swiftly learn that, to make good troopers of them, he must crack their angry spirits. In the second, the crew, having solidified under Reisman's authority, learns to collaborate implicitly and be a relentless force; in the third, they carry out their blood-spattered onslaught on the château. The dramatic tension crescendos, and so does the film's dissonant pitch. Indeed, the emotional arc divides into thirds, too, starting with the bleak and dishonorable introduction. That callous hanging supplies the threat over what ensues, whether it's the glare of utter hatred in the characters' eyes, or Reisman's unequivocally distant method of psychologically tormenting his underlings. The final act eschews implied horror for in-your-face brutality.<br/><br/>Aldrich, whose career beyond this film unfortunately hasn't much endured in the collective awareness, was one of those directors who was bold enough to gaze, undaunted, at the butchery his characters' behavior produced, and his staging of the climactic carnage is utterly unfeeling, truly one of the most acidic reminders of the battlefield's absolute amorality I've ever seen: There are no good and bad sides anymore. But there is definitely still camaraderie, as each character casualty feels both outrageously unexpected and excruciatingly protracted. Aldrich's unique, subversive vision is the prevailing influence on Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds, both portraying a massacre in which Nazis are annihilated in a manner that assumes distinctive visual ricochets of the Holocaust. It is, frankly, a very delicious war movie, bobbing and weaving sharply through one of its decade's most atonal screenplays, commandeered by one of the very finest directors of Hollywood's transitional phase.<br/><br/>But what of the mid-section, considerably the most protracted? All in all, the stage during which the Dozen begin to faithfully rally as an efficient brotherhood foreshadows not the bravado of its blood-doused culmination, but the terrain of Hogan's Heroes. The disposition of this innermost tier is emphatically that of Dude, Chance and Colorado making music in the jail, or Cool Hand Luke winning the respect of Dragline and his posse. Reviewing their grand imminent mission smacks of the cheerful bluster of a caper movie. There's an extensive sequence in which Reisman proves to Reed the efficacy of his men with a cunning war game that, aside from being thrilling in its own right, makes us laugh audaciously somewhat like when Duke and the other M*A*S*H boys uncover the shower tent to prove Hot Lips Houlihan's a true blonde.<br/><br/>The movie swings so very brusquely from blustery bit of cockamamie entertainment about mischief makers in war to revolting, spirit-demolishing picture of men dying in a genuinely throttling finale, with deftly unseen transition, brought off by Aldrich's harshly resourceful directorial style, and an astoundingly choice dramatis personae. Does Reisman need the weather-beaten apathy that Marvin brings to him, or does it just look like it because Marvin's personification of those ideas is so naturally graven? Likewise, the very corporal look of many other players fortifies the distillate of each character in fast-sketch, for instance Borgnine's bloated, beleaguered Worden, and Bronson's swarthy, pensive Wladislaw.<br/><br/>The first two hours are such a good-humored model of the Hollywood system fermenting a grim yet unchallenging war film. But Aldrich and his writers deliberately elicit that heavy sudden swing into capricious mayhem as a way of pulling the rug out from under the emblematic spirited combat picture. By bringing its curt climactic setback full circle to the grisliness of the beginning was able to be concocted into a willful and lasting bushwhack."

","Robert Aldrich directs ""The Dirty Dozen"", an intentionally morbid and sadistic war film which attempts to run WW2 era combat iconography through a certain Vietnam Era prism.<br/><br/>And so in Aldrich's hands, Allied soldiers become a band of murderers, rapists, racists, criminals and thugs, who outsmart their foes with underhanded methods and embark on a mission to ruthlessly slaughter both unarmed Nazis and German civilians, all of whom are caged within a European château. <br/><br/>At its best, the film forces you to reassess typical WW2 ""boys adventures"" (""The Great Escape"", ""Where Eagles Dare"", ""The Guns of Navarone"" etc), with several uncomfortable passages involving a near-demonic Telly Savales and the cold slaughter of German officials. But despite its typical early 60's ""anti establishment"", ""anti military"", ""anti government"", ""anti religion"", ""pseudo nihilistic"", ""anti everything"" stance, and its vein of anarchic, oddball humour, ""The Dirty Dozen"" ultimately functions along the same lines as more conservative WW2 adventures. Our criminal heroes are too handsome, too endearing, we too heavily identify with them, and their last act slaughter becomes a moment of redemption rather than condemnation. In short, like his later war film, ""Too Late The Hero"", the mythology Aldrich hopes to desanctify here remains sanctified.<br/><br/>""The Dirty Dozen's"" held up better than most of its big budget ""men on a mission"" siblings. Actors Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson, Ernest Borgine and John Cassavetes in particular do nothing but dispense memorable moments. Still, the film's ultimate worth boils down to how much irony you attribute to Aldrich's macho bloodiness and glorification of war crimes. <br/><br/>8/10 – Worth one viewing. For similar fare, see the counterculture war-comedy, ""Kelly's Heroes"". See too Cox's ""Walker"" and Pontecorvo's ""Burn!""."

The same tactics are used today by the CIA and various military as in Navy Seals, Marine Recon, Green Beret and Special Forces. War is about winning not etiquette or necessarily fair play.

"pcernea-1","10","1","6","10 February 2016"," Not A Real War Movie, But A Perfect One
","When I was 10 I went to Romania over the summer (even though I would've rather been in America) right before communism fell. Predictably, there wasn't much variety in the offerings on TV. But sometimes they would show older movies in the evening, probably because those were perceived as having less political impact. This was my exposure to ""The Dirty Dozen"", and what a fond memory. I'd always wanted to see that movie again, and recently re-watched it in full at age 31.<br/><br/>Although dated, I still have to describe it as a perfect film. That is, the only criticism I could level at this film is that the dialogue seems a bit hokey by today's standards. But that's made up for by excellent character acting (at least from the leads: Lee Marvin, Charles Bronson) with a dignity but also a restraint you rarely if ever see in today's movies. Now let's talk about the movie itself. Lee Marvin plays an American major in WW2 Britain who has to turn 12 felons into a commando unit and lead them to infiltrate a château occupied by Nazi generals, who are to be killed.<br/><br/>When I saw this as a kid, I thought it was an extremely cool war movie. Seeing it as an adult, it's clear that most of the events could never happen in real life, and it's meant more as a fantasy. For instance, Lee Marvin is a rebel, who resents having a straight-laced Colonel poking around his business. So at some point he fires a machine gun in the direction of the Colonel. Of course he would get imprisoned for that, maybe sentenced to death. And he hires prostitutes for the soldiers. Maybe that could happen in real life, but it seems to me both an act of compassion for men who are about to die (who are forced to live a monastic lifestyle even as they sacrifice themselves) as well as an indictment by the filmmaker of the way women are often treated as objects in times of war.<br/><br/>That's the beauty of this movie: the heroes are no angels--yet it never moralistically bashes you in the head with that fact. In particular, Lee Marvin's Major is simultaneously the most heroic and the most brutal/cold-blooded character in the film. He's heroic because he does what he needs to do to discipline his men into commandos, in a manner that's sometimes tough, though never sadistic. His brutality becomes apparent in the climax, possibly one of the most thought-provoking action scenes a WWII movie. We think of the Nazis as monstrous serial killers, but here the Major's mission is to actually murder generals, rather than taking them as POWs. This is an expedient solution, yet it's a war crime, and wouldn't have been done as such either by the Allies or the Nazis. It's relevant to keep in mind that most Nazi generals were not convicted as war criminals, though many probably turned a blind eye to much that was going on.<br/><br/>After a lot of fighting, the Major traps not only the generals, but also the women who were with them, in a bomb shelter, and maniacally pours grenades and gasoline through the vents, to set the château ablaze. He, however, had let the French go (could he not have also released the German women?) I think this scene might be an allegory for the fire-bombing of Dresden. What's so compelling is that, as he keeps taking time to pour more gasoline, more and more of his team keep getting sniped. He does not take on the responsibility of setting off the blaze himself, but delegates that duty to one of his men, who then gets sniped.<br/><br/>All in all: completely exciting and action-packed. Impossible to describe in this brief blurb. Well worth watching!"
"BoomerDT","10","1","6","11 June 2015"," Preposterous plot-but an incredibly entertaining movie
","Understand this: in WW2 (and today) there was no shortage of elite, well-trained and disciplined commandos willing to risk life and limb to go on suicidal missions. So under no circumstance would it be necessary to send a dozen men from a military prison, who were either condemned to execution or sentenced to lengthy prison term at hard labor, on a mission to go behind enemy lines on the eve of DDay to try and kill as many officers as possible of the German high command, enjoying R&R in a French château.<br/><br/>However, this contrived premise becomes the hook that elevates TDD above another WW2 action movie. I actually find the first 2/3 of the movie dealing with the assembly of the unit and how Lee Marvin as Maj. Reisman trains them to be a crack and cohesive combat unit more interesting than the actual mission. It's an excellent cast. Marvin was at his peak, having recently had a couple brilliant roles, 1 dramatic as an alcoholic in ""Ship of Fools"" and the other as a drunken gunfighter in the comedy, ""Cat Ballou."" In TDD Marvin gets to do his tough guy personification again, but he shows a wonderful touch of wryly delivering comedic lines. TDD has a superb cast playing the Army brass and the prisoners. Ernest Borgnine gives a good low key performance as the general who concocted this plan, as does George Kennedy as his aide. Robert Ryan is the arrogant and pompous Col. Breed who despises Maj. Reisman. Richard Jaeckel gives another top notch performance as the MP Sgt who has to assist Reisman in keeping order, while the vastly underrated Ralph Meeker has a great bit as an Army shrink who analyzes the misfits.<br/><br/>At the heart of this are the ""Dozen"" the convicts who will be expected to pull of this mission or die trying to even have a shot at clemency. Actually for the audience we only really get to know 6 of them. Bronson and Clint Walker were good soldiers who ended up on death row, Bronson after he fragged a cowardly officer and Walker after he lost his temper and killed a man with a punch. Football great Jim Brown made his initial movie appearance, waiting to die after killing a racist who wanted to castrate him. His adversary among the prisoners becomes Telly Savalas as Pvt. Maggot, truly a psychotic and racist killer. Donald Sutherland gives a good comedic bit as a rather dim-witted soldier, while the great John Cassavetes delivers perhaps the stand out performance of the 12 as Franco, a low level ex-Chicago mobster, sentenced to death after a penny ante holdup went astray. Franco ends up becoming sort of the ex post facto leader of the 12 as they eventually become an efficient killing machine.<br/><br/>One of those flicks that is fun to continually watch, if nothing else for one of the truly great movie casts of all time."

","For a World War II film, this is much more unconventional than most, because this is one of the only ones with rebelling soldiers in an army. Basically, Major Reisman (Paint Your Wagon's Lee Marvin) has a bad attitude problem is assigned to a military base holding 12 prisoners, all facing death or long terms. His job is to train them to obey him and fight for a dangerous and suicidal mission into German territory. It takes them a while to cooperate and behave, but after some mucking around and some strict consequences explained, Reisman convinces them to help him. The first check up Reisman took their side and held the Colonel and other officers up, and then a test operation sees the boys steal a military hospital jeep, but the next one is for real. Learning a rhyme about how to invade the German mansion, they prepare for the real mission to kill all German soldiers. In the end, only one of the ""Dirty Dozen"" survives, but they will all be remembered for losing their lives fighting for their country, and the survivors probably got credit too. Also starring The Flight of the Phoenix's Ernest Borgnine as General Worden, The Great Escape's Charles Bronson as Joseph Wladislaw, Mars Attacks!'s Jim Brown as Robert Jefferson, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated John Cassavetes as Victor Franko, Richard Jaeckel as Sergeant Bowren, Cool Hand Luke's George Kennedy as Major Max Armbruster, Trini López as Pedro Jiminez, Ralph Meeker as Captain Stuart Kinder, Robert Ryan as Col.

"filipemanuelneto","6","0","1","2 May 2020"," An action film set in wartime, with enjoyable touches of humour.
","This film, set in the World War II, is an adventure in which a group of twelve American soldiers, chosen among those convicted of several military crimes, is trained and sent on a suicide mission behind German lines, in occupied France, to kill as many German officers as possible in a castle that was used as a place of rest and recreation. It is an engaging but long film, and I think it has some problems, as the preparation and training of these soldiers occupies more than half of the film's leght and the operation itself is placed without much detail or attention, when compared to the trainings.<br/><br/>The film is directed by Robert Aldrich, and it is his first work that I have seen, but it seems good enough. The question I mentioned above, about the difference between the time spent showing the trainings and the time spent with the military action, was something that he could have solved. One thing, for example, in which the film does not spend a minute of celluloid is the return or evacuation of the survival soldiers. What compensates these flaws is the light and well-placed humour and the action, always present in one way or another.<br/><br/>The cast is one of the most interesting things here. In addition to Lee Marvin, a veteran of cowboy or soldier movies, we have other famous ""tough guys"" like Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine, Clint Walker, Telly Savalas (in one of the most complex roles in the film, a fanatical religious freak) and Donald Sutherland. John Cassavetes has one of the most central roles in the plot and is simply excellent, as is Charles Bronson. Its the ""tough squad"" of cinema assembled in a film loaded with testosterone and masculinity. Everyone does a good job, they are good actors in the genre they are used to, and they do not disappoint the public. However, people looking for something intellectual or psychologically profound may prefer to see something else.<br/><br/>Technically, the film seems to me quite regular. A somewhat dated cinematography, the state of the art when the film was made, good special, visual and sound effects, costumes and sets according to the time (as far as I could tell, an expert in old military material maybe more skilful than me) and a suitable soundtrack, but it doesn't stand out."

It seems as if everybody--of the guy persuasion--has seen this great, great Robert Aldrich movie.<br/><br/>It's so ugly and perverse and the very thought of the good guys herding Nazis and their women into the basement of a château in order to drop grenades down the ventilators and then incinerate them is enough to make anyone who is seeing it for the first time let out an OMG (or something a bit more masculine).

This is the pure tough-guy movie. The convicts are rapists and murderers, their commander (Lee Marvin) is an insubordinate malcontent, and it takes almost no time for Aldrich to start converting you into big fans of the rapists, murderers, and malcontents. <br/><br/>The message is simple--War is a crime, so why not use criminals?<br/><br/>But the viewers, for the most part, never get to that deep-think; instead, they just groove to the turning of convicts into what they were supposed to be, soldiers.<br/><br/>And there's that scene that makes everyone in the audience who has ever wanted to witch-slap his boss laugh out loud, when Marvin stops prissy General Robert Ryan from dry-shaving John Cassavetes by firing a burst from his machine gun as a final/only warning. <br/><br/>Take that, authority!<br/><br/>Come to think of it, this is the sort of story that teenagers probably loved.

After completing vigorous training, the Major will lead the ""dirty dozen"" in a daring attack on a French château which is being used as a German base. They must kill as many Nazi officers as possible so the third Reich will be plunged into chaos on the eve of the D-day landings. However, Reisman is at odds with his superiors, General Worden and Colonel Breed, a factor that threatens to place the mission in jeopardy...<br/><br/>Robert Aldrich does it again with this spectacular action epic. A real classic with a somewhat contemporary feel, The Dirty Dozen is everything today's actioners should be. As noted by another reviewer it is very comic book-esque, a statement echoed by myself. It has fine characters, each embodied by masterful acting talent and the narrative itself comprises of several engaging scenarios which build to a huge action sequence. Granite edged Lee Marvin excels in the lead as the cynical Major Reisman. This character has more in common with the rough and ready dozen than he does with the clean cut bureaucrats who assign him to the mission. Whilst not half as critical of the military as Aldrich's previous war movie Attack!, the aforementioned plot device is cleverly exploited so as to take subtle shots at the establishment. The Dirty Dozen also contains a restrained anti-war message, which may or may not go over the head of you as the viewer. Anyway as I was saying about performances, Ernest Borgnine also acquitted himself well as General Worden, as did Robert Ryan as Colonel Breed. A group of better actors couldn't have been selected to make up the dozen. We have the brilliant John Cassavetes, the always reliable Charles Bronson and everybody's favourite Greek, Telly Savalas. Jim Brown brings his energetic skill as a professional footballer to the role of Jefferson and George Kennedy and Richard Jaeckel were equally impressive as regular soldiers. There is a fine chemistry between the characters and the script contains some great and indeed very quotable dialogue. Apart from the climax, the movie has two highlights, the inspection of Colonel Breed's troops and the dozen proving their worth by capturing Colonel Breed and his staff during a war games exercise.<br/><br/>The explosive assault on the château is preceded by a gripping infiltration sequence which adds a tense air to the final half hour of the film. Epic in style, the climatic battle is just as taut as it is exhilarating. The entire sequence is constructed in a truly professional manor which removes the corniness present in the action scenes of so many other war movies. Aldrich gets plenty of mileage from the thunderous special effects, the château seems to be built to scale which makes for chilling realism when it is blown up. The machine guns discharge their bullets at such an extreme rate and there are some fantastic stunts too! <br/><br/>Blazing a new trail in it's genre, The Dirty Dozen redefines the war movie whilst alluding to the angst of 60s America. It would also be responsible for the birth of an amazing slice of cinema, the combat flick. 10/10"

","Lee Marvin stars as ""Major Reisman"" who has displeased his superiors so much that he is put in charge of a secret mission to parachute behind enemy lines to kill German officers vacationing at a château in France. If that wasn't bad enough, all of his soldiers are hardened criminals of the worst sort who are coerced by the chance that they may be given a parole. Now as implausible as this movie really is I must admit that it offers plenty of entertainment value due in large part to an all-star cast which includes Charles Bronson (as ""Joseph Wladislaw""), Clint Walker (""Samson Posey""), Jim Brown (""Robert Jefferson""), Donald Sutherland (""Vernon Pinkley""), Ernest Borgnine (""General Worden""), George Kennedy (""Major Max Armbruster"") along with the aforementioned Lee Marvin. Yet with all of these mentioned I thought Telly Savalas deserved special recognition for his performance as the psychotic pervert ""Archer Maggott"" which really stood out. In any case, this was a big movie back in the 60's and those who might be interested in this type of film should definitely check it out. I rate it as definitely above average."
"bowmanblue","9","0","4","1 December 2014"," Dozens of reasons to watch this film
","Well, maybe not 'dozens,' but here's a few at least...<br/><br/>1. It's a war movie which doesn't really contain an awful lot of 'war' stuff, meaning that fans of the genre will appreciate it as much as those who aren't into the Second World War 2. The stellar cast. Okay, so some of the twelve prisoners conscripted into Lee Marvin's secret task force aren't that memorable, but there are plenty who are... Charles Bronson and Telly Savalis to name but two. 3. Naturally, a great cast produces great performances. There's no room for a 'weakest link' here. 4. Everyone roots for the 'antihero.' And here we not only have twelve convicted felons to cheer on, but also their leader – the allegedly pure Lee Marvin – is also as prone to 'rule-breaking' as his new charges 5. Black humour. Yes, there may be a war on, but there are a handful of light-hearted moments dotted about here and there that to lighten the tone enough. 6. It's epic. The two hours it runs for don't feel like it. 7. It doesn't pull any punches. As I said... there is a war on and you may find yourself grinning one minute before being completely horrified by the level of brutality that transpired during the historical period. 8. One hell of a tense finale – when the mission comes, it's worth the wait. You'll be on the edge of your seat as you cheer all your newfound antiheros on.<br/><br/>Basically, 'The Dirty Dozen' is a war film that's more akin to simply being put in the 'action' bracket, rather than classed as a straight 'war film.' The mission never actually happened. This film is total fiction. But there's always that feeling at the back of your mind regarding how, although it never transpired, it probably very well nearly did.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a war film fan to enjoy this, just enjoy a mismatched bunch of rag-tag antiheros, working together (and sometimes against each other!) on a mission to kill Nazis."

","Before I talk about Dirty Dozen, I'll mention that the first time I knew anything about it was when I was 14, during a conversation in the Michael Moore film Canadian Bacon where they ran through the cast: Lee Marvin, Ernest Borgnine, Charles Bronson, John Cassavettes, Telly Savalas, Jim Brown and (ahem) Trini Lopez. What a blessing to live in a world where you can become aware of great movies by watching other films.<br/><br/>Lee Marvin stars as an out of favour Major who gets given the most bat sh-t crazy assignment in the history of war films: take 12 military prisoners looking at either the death penalty or an interminably long jail sentence, train them into a unit and take them on a suicide mission behind enemy lines. Before they get there though, they will need to learn obedience and discipline, navigate their way around a suspicious Colonel and compete in a war games exercise.<br/><br/>That this plot works owes much to a great script, ably performed by a superb cast. While Bronson and Marvin are the stars on duty, special mention must be given to John Cassavettes, who is absolutely superb as the abrasive, ill-fated Franko. Of those not already mentioned at the top we also have Robert Ryan, Clint Walker, Donald Sutherland, Richard Jaeckel and Ralph Meeker along for this most fun of rides.<br/><br/>The film tells a simple story in a straight line narrative, relying on the action and dialogue for its success. Much of the personality present in the characters come from the actors playing them, with the well paced script moving the story along too quickly for the expositional dialogue we see in many films today. This however does not cheapen either the characters or the story. The actors are too good to allow that. It has its brutal moments, but is pleasingly devoid of blood amidst the violence.<br/><br/>There was at one stage rumours of a remake, but why bother? With action, actors and storytelling as good as this, you don't need an update for accessibility to modern audiences.<br/><br/>I've said more than once that John Wayne films are a gift. The Dirty Dozen can sit proudly beside any of the Duke's films as one of the premier examples of cast driven action in American cinema."

The dozen includes Charles Bronson, Jim Brown, John Cassavetes, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland, Robert Ryan, George Kennedy among others.<br/><br/>The action takes awhile to get started.

A couple of the members of the dozen ask the Major if he was sure he wanted them to do it and he told them to do it. So the soldiers were just following orders, which doesn't make it right. Keep in mind that their original mission was to kill as many high-ranking officers at the château as possible to pave the way for a successful D-Day operation, so that's precisely what they did.

","This movie was made twenty years before I was born an even though I had heard of this title I never saw the film, not even in passing. I thought I must have seen it on TV sometime but no I was wrong. Having just seen it recently I can honestly say it is brilliant. Turning a group of convicts into a trained militia, sending them off to do battle with the Nazis in advance of the D-Day landings depicts the cruelty of war & the chance to start a new life post war. <br/><br/>It is fascinating to see Americans in this period. Not knowing much about American colloquialism this gives a new more down to earth feel of what it was like back then. Gone are the days of the Cowboys and now even the criminals are being called up for duty. The interactions between Major Reisman the protagonist who is ordered to train this rabble are very amusing. One example of this which sums up the situation the convicts find themselves is this dialogue<br/><br/>Wladislaw (Reading the paper) He was going over the hill. My outfit was pinned down by the worst crossfire you ever saw. Half of them bleeding to death. And this lover took off like a rabbit. . .. . .with the medical supplies on his back. The only way to stop him was to shoot him. Anyhow, he had it coming.<br/><br/>Major Reisman: Yeah. But you only made one mistake,<br/><br/>Wladislaw: huh?<br/><br/>Major Reisman: (Leaving the room) Guard.<br/><br/>Major Reisman: You let somebody see you do it. <br/><br/>Just like Wladislaw the Polish American officer the other criminals are also bitter against the military authority. Victor Franco the Chicago petty mobster, Posey the Apache, Jimenez the Mexican, Robert Jefferson an African American who believes the white court deliberating convicted him. Not forgetting the actual mad man ""Maggot"". The other cast of lesser criminals that form this motley crew must work and fight as a team. Major Resiman is accompanied by Sgt Bowren in this task <br/><br/>The most likable character is Vernon Pickely a weak minded crowd pleaser with his service being required to impersonate a general on the orders of Major Reisman which is a court martial offense of itself. The one sleazy moment in the film is when the men must meet the women. This film shows how the criminals have the determination to win by breaking the rules while the Colonels and Captains are restricted by arrogance."

","""The Dirty Dozen"" moves ensemble war movies a few giants strides in the direction of ""M*A*S*H"" (1970). Zany march music plays as the anti-heroes gallivant around causing an almost uncomfortable amount of chaos. The movie is darkly comedic, irreverent, and strangely gruesome. The characterizations are cliché and the plot is predictable from the outset, but it is fun to see actors like Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas in full madcap mode. Still, ""The Dirty Dozen"" doesn't do enough to distinguish itself among 1960s war films. We'd had World War II romps before that were richer in emotion and loftier in tone, like ""The Great Escape"" (1963), and ""M*A*S*H"" would soon go to in the opposite direction to illustrate the insanity of war. ""The Dirty Dozen"" is caught in between and is perhaps chiefly interesting as a stepping stone."

The amount of bad reviews really surprised me and can only have come from people that have no sense of the history of how WWII started. Yes it was a tragic time in the world. Yes there was carnage, death, all the NASTY things that come from war. But hey the Allies won and if you don't like that aspect, then don't watch. It is said ""to the victors belong the spoils.""

I look at WWII films as embellishing the times, celebrating the victory, honoring the men and women who paid the highest sacrifice to bring peace to the world again.

","An old WW II film, but still one of the best war movies I've ever seen. The all-time ensemble cast helps, the film has just the right amount of humour and action mixed in and the pacing is actually pretty decent with a clear three act structure. Nowadays the idea of putting together a ragtag bunch of misfits and giving them an almost impossible task to complete is nothing new. We have seen it in The Expendables, we have seen it in the Inglourious Basterds, we have seen it in the Armageddon, but this film predates all of those and is actually one of the better adaptations of the said idea. All the team members have clear identities, especially the key members all have amazing actors to play them and they have genuine chemistry. So, if the characters and the plot work, then what doesn't work? Well, while the plot itself holds up pretty decently, the premise of the film is a bit far-fetched. The mission the dirty dozen is given is one that isn't really suited to their expertise and isn't anything that couldn't have been handled by the real Special Ops. It would have made a bit more sense had the dozen had a common theme between themselves. Perhaps they all could have been former commandos or perhaps demolition experts. Now they were just inmates. But, I'm nitpicking here, as it doesn't really take away from the film. This film is more about the characters and the action.

","As it says above, an all time classic.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film, where have you been?<br/><br/>To be honest, I don't know where to start with this one, great novel, great screenplay, great actors, great performances, and well put together by the techie staff.<br/><br/>That says it all, a great film, from a great premise.<br/><br/>The only sad note is that a few of the participants are no longer with us, although others still are, and are still making films.<br/><br/>This is in my all time top twenty, maybe even my top ten.<br/><br/>A very strong 9/10"

","If you look at the elements in this movie, you'll see that all the prerequisites for the modern 'summer action movie' are all here.  This is the great-great-grandfather to Con Air, The Rock, and Tomb Raider.<br/><br/>1. You have your politically-correct (IE: multi-racial) group of criminals (in Hollywood terms, they are the 'tough guys' that sell the most tickets') that are somehow more 'human' than the authoritarian figures that have enslaved them for a purpose.<br/><br/>2. You have your paper-thin enemy with two options open to them: shoot or die.  Guess which one is performed the most?<br/><br/>3. There is the obligatory bond of kinship that arises during times of war as the men learn that they are all rapists, murderers, thieves, vandals, and basket cases--sorry, too much of Breakfast Club influence on the ol' critic here.<br/><br/>4. After nearly two hours of babbling (typical Bruckheimer tough talk), the plot works its way towards the final fireworks.  I will praise the DoP for his work in making a prototype for hundreds to follow, but the sound and editing otherwise are terrible.  Low standards for a movie like this.<br/><br/>Overall, interesting for history buffs attempting to trace the roots of the genre, but modern filmgoers will be turned off by its *lack* of action.  3 out of 5 stars."

","Lee Marvin heads an all-star cast in a very rugged, humorous, exciting and entertaining film wherein his mission is to train THE DIRTY DOZEN (a ragged bunch of misfits slated for the hangman's noose unless they opt to join him in his mission).<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent in a variety of interesting roles--and the only underwritten roles without any depth are left to Robert Ryan and Ernest Borgnine as rather colorless military officers.<br/><br/>Outstanding characterizations are offered by Telly Savalas, Richard Jaeckel, Clint Walker, Charles Bronson, Jim Brown and Donald Sutherland. The best scenes are the rigorous training the men are forced to undergo before assigned to their real mission. Given the length of this little war epic, they could have eliminated the training exercise prank in which the men defeat another battalion and instead cut right to the chase which is the climactic mission to destroy a Nazi fortress and its inhabitants.<br/><br/>Action galore and some well developed humor along the way. Robert Aldrich keeps a firm hand on the direction but could have whittled the whole thing down to a more reasonable length. Still, it never bores and Lee Marvin, in the central role, commands the screen all the time."

","MY RATING- 8.1<br/><br/>This was a blockbuster about 12 murderers who have the chance to redeem theirselves training hard to destroy a nazi castle. Their briefing man and chief is the tough major Lee Marvin. I absolutely love his scenes with John Cassavetes! The mov is really thrilling, not only the training part but also that brilliant climax of the attack to the castle. We actually struggle as they in the hard training sequences. With an all star cast- Ernest Borgnine, Robert Ryan, Charles Bronson, Donald Sutherland, George Kennedy and a little and brilliant performance by Telly Savalas. Well, I adore war movs, but also commandos type, like this one and the castle part looks like the game Commandos."

","Robert Aldrich really outdoes himself with this movie. He put together an all star cast that gave a great performance! Lee Marvin is tasked to mold a bunch of army prisoners into a crack team. Their mission is to infiltrate a chateau in France where high ranking German officers take leave. These army prisoners are the worst of the worst. Telly Savalas is the craziest of the bunch as Arthur Maggot (fitting name). Lee Marvin must convince these prisoners that it would be in their best interest to listen to what he has to say. He makes it known that if they are successful with the mission, they wlll be givin pardons, but if they mess up, they go back to prison to await the execution of their sentences. Charles Bronson gives probably one of his best performances in this movie. Donald Sutherland also fit in as a rather odd character. He plays an even better one in ""Kelly's Heroes"" (Oddball). As it turns out, the group is succesful in its mission, and there is only one survivor from the original dozen, (Bronson). A Very good movie that I would reccommend to anyone."

","""The Dirty Dozen"" must be one of Ted Turner's favorite movies since the picture seems to run endlessly on WTBS or TNT. It is a fun movie to watch, all the way through.  Everyone knows the premise so there's no reason to repeat it here.<br/><br/>Great movies need two things---a great story and great acting.  Plausible or not, ""Dozen""'s story is highly entertaining and it has many riveting moments, right from the start with the hanging of one of the prisoners (too bad for him that Lee Marvin shows up too late to include him for the mission!).  Marvin is the center of the movie and he carries a lot of credibility, being a wounded WWII veteran himself.  ""Dozen"" is an important movie if only because it was the screen debuts for both Jim Brown and Donald Sutherland.  If there was another WWII movie before this one which depicted a black soldier as a hero, I haven't seen it and it is interesting to note that, of the prisoners, Brown's character is the only one who truly doesn't deserve the punishment that he's awaiting, having killed in self-defense. Donald Sutherland doesn't have a lot to do in this movie but his gaunt, moronic Pinckney gives the movie some comic relief, particularly where he gets to impersonate a general inspecting crack paratroopers.<br/><br/>Most of the ""Dozen"" don't get a lot to do in this movie---just too many characters and not enough time to develop them (sort of like how the Wally Schirra character was given almost no lines in ""The Right Stuff"").  An ensemble piece like this usually means that there's a lot of competition going on amongst the cast and John Cassavettes and Telly Savalas stand out as Franco, the urban hoodlum, and Maggett, the psychotic rapist.  Savalas has the harder part, playing a truly rotten and despicable character who has absolutely no redeeming qualities.  You're not unhappy when Maggett is killed later on but you have to admire how Savalas deftly handles the part---I say deftly because this type of role could've typecast him forever if he hadn't played it just right."

","Another glossy jingoistic World War movie, protaganized by hard-assed tough-nosed soldiers. The 'Dirty Dozen' in this case refers to a group of criminals morphed into an elite fighting squad by a selfish, short-sighted army brass. These criminals, traitorous malconents through and through, get suddenly sprung from hard time and death sentences with a promise from a desperate US military. The army has volunteered these strapping young lads to see through a suicide mission of the highest import. Face overwhelming odds and conquer a French castle armed to the teeth and stocked with elite german officers. No problem, echoes our unshaven group of malcontents. Lee Marvin plays the passive-aggressive, jaded to the point of constipation Major in charge of this heroic fiasco. Of course tempers flare and rams butt horns, but in the end up becomes down and the condemned men ultimately prove heroic. No suprises - things blow up, recruits brawl, sacrifices are made in the vague name of duty. And capping this illustrious tale of anti-pacifism is the US flag, waving bloodily in the smoky sky for all to see."

","This movie not only has a great cast (resulting in great acting)but a plausible plot. It was unique how they mixed the humor in with the story. This is by far my #1 movie of all time. If you can see this movie, see it! You might not like it at first, but I guarantee that you'll love it after a while. The only con is that it's 2 1/2 hours long, but you'll be enjoying the movie, so you won't notice."
"yenlo","8","0","2","6 October 1999"," Entertaining war flick.
","This picture shouldn't be taken seriously as a war film but does entertain. A good cast headed up by Lee Marvin in the role he's probably most remembered for. (even though he won an Oscar for Cat Ballou) A group of American G.I. convicts are offered a way out of their sentences if they volunteer for a somewhat suicide mission. They of course agree and the film highlights their training with at first reluctance and apprehension about each other and their leader Major Reisman.<br/><br/> Eventually they bond as best they can and go on their mission. Who makes it who doesn't? What helps keep the film going is that the locations constantly keep changing. From the prison compound to the training site to an Army base to a War game location to the mission location itself. No it's not the greatest war film ever but it is one that's always great to watch."
