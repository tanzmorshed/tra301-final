"Infofreak","Null","357","404","24 October 2002"," Tarantino's sleeper. An underrated gem of a movie.
","Many people were disappointed with 'Jackie Brown' when it was first released as it didn't live up to their expectations created by the more flamboyant 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I admit that I was one of those disappointed fans. But as the years have gone by I have come to appreciate this movie more and more, and if you deal with what it IS and not what you thought it was going to be, you'll see that it is an underrated gem of a movie. 'Jackie Brown' is much more character driven and leisurely plotted than Tarantino's previous two movies. I haven't read the Elmore Leonard novel on which it was based so I can't tell whether this was a conscious decision by Tarantino himself, or it's because of the source material, but it might be a stumbling block for those with MTV-style attention spans. 1970s crime movie buffs will find it much easier going. The big names in the cast like De Niro, Jackson and Fonda are all very good, but the real standout performances in this movie are by 70s blaxploitation icon Pam Grier ('Coffy', 'Foxy Brown', 'Black Mama White Mama',etc.etc.) and a revelatory one from Robert Forster. Forster back in the day showed plenty of promise in movies like 'Medium Cool' but quickly found himself stuck in b-grade exploitation movies like 'Vigilante' and 'Alligator'. Fun stuff, but hardly Oscar material. Max Cherry is the best role he has ever been given, and he is superb in it. The fascinating thing about 'Jackie Brown' for me is that Tarantino's critics accuse him of making shallow and violent self-consciously hip crime films, but the central story of this movie concerns an inter-racial Middle Aged romance, something I haven't seen done in a believable or realistic fashion by Hollywood before. By doing this so well Tarantino shows he has much more depth, and is a much more interesting and braver film maker than his more acclaimed contemporaries. 'Jackie Brown' is a fine movie that hopefully one day will get the kudos it deserves. Don't overlook this one just because it isn't 'Pulp Fiction The Next Generation'!"
"pianoman904","10","152","171","15 June 2008"," Personally, I find it to be Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece
","Sometimes a movie requires more than one viewing. The first time I sat down to watch Jackie Brown, I wasn't so impressed. I didn't hate the movie, but I didn't love it either. I thought it was decent. The second time I watched it, I knew the plot already so I really got to indulge in the characters of the film. And thats exactly what the film is, it's a character piece.<br/><br/>Those of you who expect an energetic, stylized, violent, comic book-esque film like Pulp Fiction will not get that from this movie. Its a lot more tamed, and to say the least realistic. I love Pulp Fiction, its one of my all time favorite movies. But I doubt in the real world there would be two hit men in matching black and white suits. The scenarios of that movie, while fun and totally entertaining, aren't too realistic. Jackie Brown on the other hand has totally real characters that don't come off as too over the top.<br/><br/>All the actors in the movie are superb.The lead is played by actress Pam Grier who nails the role. Tarantino again shows you don't need an a-list actor to carry a movie. Grier plays Jackie Brown, an airline stuartess in her 40s. Samuel L. Jackson plays Ordell Robbie, a gun dealer who uses Jackie to bring him in money from Mexico. Robert DeNiro (in a smaller role for such a big actor) plays Louis, Ordell's friend who recent got out of jail. Bridget Fonda plays Melanie, a ""blonde haired surfer girl"" who lives with Ordell. Michael Keaton (my all time favorite actor)plays ATF agent Ray Nicollette who wants to take down Ordell. And Robert Forster plays Max Cherry, a bail bonds man. Without giving too much away, all of these characters in one way or another are all after $500,000 of Ordell's money. Every character in this movie is great and unique in their own way. But for me, Robert Forster steals the show. Max Cherry is without a doubt my favorite character in all of Quentin Tarantino's movies.<br/><br/>To some people, this movie is just a crime/heist movie. But to me there is something quite beautiful to this movie. After a few viewings of the film, you will notice that underneath it all, this movie is really about two people. Jackie Brown and Max Cherry. Two people who are middle aged, lonely, and tired of their dead end jobs. Two people that meet in a very unlikely way. Two people that together figure out a way to steal $500,000 and get away with it. Take this movie however you want it. But to me, thats the heart of the movie, and thats why the movie works so well.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Jackie Brown is not a graphic crime story like Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction that preceded it. Nor is it a stylized revenge saga like Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2 that followed it. Instead it is a stand alone film. A wonderfully acted character study. And for me, an absolute gem of a film. It's Quentin Tarantino's underrated MASTERPIECE."

","Contrary to Pulp Fiction which had a very unusual editing and flashy situations, Jackie Brown focuses more on characters that are basically humans with very focused problems, for instance getting older which is an eminent theme tackled in the film. No one's evil in all this. They all have interestingly real personalities and I felt strangely comfortable watching them talk, eat, kill and argue with each other. Tarantino is an excellent storyteller and I wish I could write dialogues as interesting as his. The film flows with a slower pace than Pulp, with all it's many streched takes and lenghty scenes, but by doing so leaves us more time to grasp the characters with all their differences. A more mature Tarantino. Still loving what he does. And he said it himself before the film came out: ""This one is at a lower volume then 'Pulp.' It's not an epic, it's not an opera. It's a character study."""
"bob the moo","Null","172","205","1 February 2004"," Less showy than Pulp, but a more mature story that is just as enjoyable
","Jackie Brown is a 44 year old air hostess who also acts as a money carrier for her boss, gun dealer Ordell Robbie.  When one of Ordell's other employee's is caught he is forced to kill him, however, before he can get to him the employee tells the police about Jackie and they pick her up.  With Jackie facing jail or being killed by Ordell she strikes a deal with both the police and him to bring in a large stash of money.  However to help her retirement she plans to play the game to her own ends.<br/><br/>Coming as a follow up to both Dogs and Pulp, this film was going to be the `greatest movie ever made' or it was going to be met with a critical response that seems to be a bit negative.  It was the hype and hyperbole around anything baring the name Tarantino that perhaps was giving every film he did higher and higher standards to meet, it is wasn't Jackie Brown that was met in this way it would have been the next film, or the next one. However the reviews were mostly good, but it did get some unfair reviews from critics who expected this to continue the upward trend.  In a way I believe that this film did show Tarantino's growth as a director.<br/><br/>Where Pulp Fiction was dizzying in it's style and pace, Jackie Brown is much more of a mature, balanced film that is satisfying in a more traditional sense that the design of Pulp.  Developed from a Leonard novel, the plot is a solid crime thriller with a good plot that still gives room for Tarantino to do some time shifting as he reveals some key scenes from different perspectives to allow us to see the bigger picture.  As a story it fills the rather generous running time pretty well and is enjoyable throughout.<br/><br/>The film is still full of Tarantinoisms for the fans - the heavy soundtrack, the pop culture references, the witty, slick dialogue.  However where the film stands out is that the characters are actually better than in his previous films where they never really went beyond the story and dialogue. Here not only are they better but they also include well-written female parts!  While some of the characters are as good as they need to be within the confines of the basic crime story, it is in Jackie and Max where Tarantino has grown up a bit - although in fairness this was an adaptation rather than his own script, but he still manages them better than some of his own thin characters.<br/><br/>Following the praise for Pulp and Tarantino's ability to rejuvenate careers, he must have had no problem cherry picking for this role.  Grier gives a great performance and should be grateful for the role in an industry that generally ignores middle-aged women (not to mention black women!).  The only thing surprising about her is how poorly she has taken this big lead role and used it to take her career on.  Her performance embraces her age and uses it well, but it is Forster who gives the standout performance here. Not an actor many will be aware of apart from this film, he got an Oscar nomination for this and I think he deserved it.  His performance is very low-key and quite moving - I think I will appreciate his work here more as I get older.  Jackson does what is expected of him and has no real character, but his energy and skill are there to see.  De Niro plays a little against type and is an interesting, but underused character.  Fonda is really, really sexy and has some good lines while the rest of the cast do good work in small roles with people like Keaton, Tucker and Bowen in there.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoy this film and can understand why it will never be loved to the extent that Pulp was and is.  However to me this is a more satisfying film with an enjoyable plot and a more traditional delivery.  The development of actual good characters beyond snappy dialogue is what impressed me the most and it sadden me to see him regress about a decade into style without substance with Kill Bill Vol. One."
"rlac66","8","111","131","22 October 2001"," Solid film, never a dull moment, great characters
","Although different than some of Tarantino's more violent precursors,  such as ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""True Romance"" this is an excellent film. Where it lacks in violence however, the film makes up for in language earning it an ""R"" rating in the US. In certain scenes, I thought it Tarantino went to far with the explicit language and it seemed awkward and artificial, but that does not cast a shadow of over what I thought was an otherwise fantastic film. The editing and directing is excellent. There is good character development of the main characters, yet there is not one scene where the movie drags throughout its entire 150 minutes. I couldn't tear myself away from this movie until the very end.<br/><br/>Especially enjoyable is the performance by Robert Forster whose character I thought was outstanding. Max Cherry, played by Forster, is a tempered bail bondsman who cautiously handles his unscrupulous clients. One day he is approached by Ordell Robbie, played by Samuel L. Jackson, to post a bond for Jackie Brown, a middle aged flight attendant for a low cost airline who gets caught smuggling Ordell's fortune in Mexico into the US. The initial meeting between Jackie and Max sets up a relationship between these two characters on both professional and personal level and that changes Max from a methodical and business man to almost an innocent young boy with a crush. The last scene in the movie between these two characters is absolutely brilliant.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film and it's fun to watch Tarantino mature as a director. The little extras littered throughout the film such as ""Chick with Guns"", the fabulous locations such as the Cockatoo Inn, and the excellent characters make this film well worth a view."

","Being a huge fan of Tarantinos earlier efforts Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction expectations were of course high. Especially since Jackie Brown is based on the Elmore Leonard novel ""Rum Punch"". And Elmore Leonards stories usually fit the big screen very well, they are actually one of the rare occasions where i usually prefer the film to the novel.<br/><br/>Tarantino sets a different mood here compared to the more frantic and violent Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. This is more of a slow crime story that focuses more on being cool than being shocking. I think this movie works very well despite the slow pace which seems to put a lot of people off. Mainly i think it works because the actors are all giving it their best (the casting is also excellent) while Tarantino seems to handle the whole story more gently than in Pulp Fiction. He doesn't stress it, he doesn't run the risk of over-doing the ""cool"" parts. The end result is enjoyable but a lot more somber than what you're used to from Tarantino.<br/><br/>All in all i feel this movie is underrated. It's enjoyable, well made and stylish. Recommended to those not demanding all movies to head on at breakneck speed. I rate it 7/10."
"fsalvemini","9","89","106","19 July 2005"," Wtg Q...
","When I first heard the name of Q's next movie, Jackie Brown, I figured this would be a remake of a 70's Pam Grier blaxploitation flick (i.e- Foxy Brown). I quickly learned that this was actually an ode to the legendary Pam Grier! Loaded with possibly the best and deepest cast since True Romance, and very similar in many ways, this movie delivers on all levels. Like T.R., a combination of road trip movie (this time airborne), gangsters, comedy, druggy/pimp story, and love story molds itself into a great story. A fantastic revival for Robert Forster- who'd never been awarded the shot he deserved, as Max Cherry, our star and hero of this film. Robert's been historically type cast as a gumshoe cop in numerous roles- Mulholland Drive, South Beach, Rear Window, Me, Myself Irene, but really breaks out in this opportunity to portray a character with actual personality,integrity, wit, and passions. Hail to Robert! Fantastic deliveries from Michael Keaton who revives the Ray Nicolette character seen in Out of Sight, Bridget Fonda's transformation as the stoner surfer girl, DeNiro as the shifty ex-con, Samuel J as the untrustworthy Ordell, and most impressively the one scene delivery of Chris Tucker- with the famous improvised line 'You sneak up on a Nigga with this sh#t!'... The screen translation of Elmore Leonard's Florida based Rum Punch is very interesting- from the blonde bimboish Jackie Burke, to the sexy 40ish black Jackie Brown, worked very nicely. Q hits another home run, as expected!"
"tnrcooper","10","22","24","17 December 2013"," Pam Grier!
","What a film! Amazing ensemble, serpentine plot, all based on an Elmore Leonard novel. I enjoyed the film when it first came out but I didn't appreciate its complexity and the caliber of its acting as I did when I saw it the other day. <br/><br/>A tired airline stewardess (Pam Grier as the eponymous character) sees a slim window through which she could escape to a more leisurely life. However, she will have to steal money from a nasty small-time arms dealer and convince the Feds she is trying to help them get the dealer. Can she make it work? On her side is bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) who, we think, might want to squeeze out that window with her. <br/><br/>However, she has to outwit the venal Ordell Robbie (Sam Jackson) who we see is not the nicest guy in the world. Robbie is assisted by the dim-witted pothead ex-con Louis (Robert DeNiro) and his possibly-smarter-than-she-looks snow bunny Melanie (Bridge Fonda). <br/><br/>On the other is the law, in the person of Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) and Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton). She has to convince the Feds she is complying with the terms of her agreement with them and she has to convince Ordell that she is not scamming him. It's a hell of a balance. Can she do it? <br/><br/>Great music, typically a-bit-too-clever dialogue as one might expect from Tarantino. Tarantino features LA's grittiness in a way that those of us Angelenos who know that the Southland isn't all Beverly Hills and Hollywood really appreciate. The acting is fantastic. You've never seen Robert DeNiro act like this. He's dopey with a lot of repressed anger. DeNiro gets the essence of a conflicted ex-con. Robert Forster is competent and confident. The chemistry he has with Grier is smoldering. Sam Jackson eats up the screen in his scenes. It's like shooting fish in a barrel for him. <br/><br/>Pam Grier is phenomenal as Jackie Brown. You don't know just how honest Jackie is but you have sympathy for her from the get-go. Grier makes her gorgeous, smart, hard-working, sexy, confident, and diligent. It really is a shame that she hasn't had another role even APPROACHING one of this richness. It truly is a great role though and Pam Grier delivers in spades."
"MovieAddict2016","Null","138","175","2 April 2004"," Quentin strikes again.
","Where does a director go after making two colossal worldwide hits?<br/><br/>""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) and ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) were two of the greatest movies ever made, and they launched director Quentin Tarantino into the realm of Mainstream Hollywood Director. Most of the time, a director faced with this reality will sink into a slew of really bad movies, but so far Tarantino has been either extremely lucky or extremely talented - his third feature film, although lacking in the brutality of its predecessors, contains just as much wit. Based upon the Elmore Leonard novel ""Rum Punch,"" it's packed with the clever dialogue that Leonard is known for in his writing. It's also got a good amount of style, too. It's not a typical Tarantino movie, but is that necessarily a bad thing? In this particular instance, no.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight stewardess forced into running jobs for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), a ruthless criminal who has no respect for life - or death, for that matter. However, during one of her smuggling efforts, a couple of FBI Agents (including Michael Keaton) nab her and offer her a deal: If she helps them get Ordell, she will be let free from custody. The Feds do not know who Ordell is, but they know he exists, and that is where Jackie comes in. She reluctantly agrees to participate in their sting operation, but all is not what it seems. And when $500,000 dollars disappears from his retirement fund, Ordell stops, thinks, and arrives upon the conclusion that we all anticipate with glee: Jackie Brown did it.<br/><br/>His partner in crime, Louis (the wonderful Robert De Niro), also decides to double-cross Ordell, with the help of a sexy blonde ditz named Melanie (Bridget Fonda), The movie's twisting plot line and intersecting story lines is very reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction,"" and De Niro's underrated performance is a real stand-out. The movie's quite well made and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Don't misinterpret what I'm saying. This is no ""Reservoir Dogs,"" nor does it want to be. It's not in the same vein as Tarantino's other movies, at least not at a superficial level. However, it is extremely entertaining, helped along by a great cast and a terrific script. The only difference here is that Tarantino did not come up with everything by himself. He adapted the screenplay from another source, something he usually doesn't do. But there's also a little-known fact that Roger Avary co-wrote some of ""Dogs"" and ""Fiction"" with Tarantino, as well as sparked the idea for some of his films. Here, Quentin adapts Leonard's novel and does justice. People who say it isn't as good as his other movies because it's recycled obviously don't know what they're talking about.<br/><br/>Tarantino started out as a video store clerk, and is the movie buff's filmmaker. Not only does Tarantino share a deep passion for films, but he also knows what most of the real movie enthusiasts want. He has yet to disappoint me with any of his directorial efforts. His own life story would make an interesting movie, and indeed it did with ""True Romance,"" partially based on Tarantino's own self-image of himself. (A geek working at a comic book store falls in love and goes off of an adventure into a new realm -- in Tarantino's own case, it was film-making. For Clarence, from ""True Romance,"" it was drugs and murder.)<br/><br/>Tarantino has a flair for raw energy in all of his films, and ""Jackie Brown"" is no exception. The movie is bursting at its edges, packed with wild antics and the occasional fierce brutality. The movie was criticized by Tarantino's die-hard fans for being too different from his other films. However, the mistake of many directors is to repeat the same formulas over and over again. One must at least give Tarantino credit for trying new things in each of his films. If anything, the only thing that Tarantino likes to insert into all his films is a large source of energy. And is that a bad thing?<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars."
"donuthaters12","10","14","16","7 January 2014"," A Great Heist Film That Is Currently Under-Appreciated
","I see Tarantino's three films in the 90's, not including Four Rooms, as a crime trilogy of sorts, and Jackie Brown is the one that is considered to be the most underrated or by others as the weakest of Tarantino's catalog. I never really had high hopes for this film, because for one it just doesn't have that wit and charm that Pulp Fiction has or the unique style that was demonstrated with Reservoir Dogs. I have now seen this film a couple of times and even from my first viewing I thought this film was great and got even better the subsequent times I came around to it.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is definitely a left turn from Tarantino's films as it wasn't an original idea but rather he adapted Elmore Leonard's novel, other notable work include Out Of Sight and 3:10 To Yuma. This choice of not adapting an original story is strange but it doesn't matter anymore after you have seen it, because it's still an entertaining film. I haven't read the source material but I have read reports that this film adapts the novel accurately and that Leonard's novel is filled with dialogue. This film indeed has that element, which works in favor of Tarantino as he has a complete understanding of how to make dialogue look and sound interesting. This may be dismissed by many due to the fact that it lacks the style and charm that was found on his previous two films, the film instead takes a conventional approach to it's storytelling but personally this isn't really an issue for me as the story is still entertaining to watch unfold and Tarantino doesn't completely lose his touch with this film. True, the film relies on the story in developing it's characters rather than having them spill out words that collectively will shape their personalities, but Tarantino's dialogue and style isn't the star of the film but rather the motivations and intentions of the characters.<br/><br/>Looking at Quentin Tarantino's career, his films differ from one another and the director is starting to walk the same lines as Kubrick in not repeating oneself. Jackie Brown is the director's heist film and he has achieved in not grounding the film on the same style and level as the other heist films it is now compared to. The film may not scream out Tarantino but it does at the very least experiment. The heist itself was a genius in execution, how difficult it must be to have us see the same heist and not feel repetitive and tiresome. There are also moments in the film where it uses a split screen showing two moments at the same time, and the film also has unusual choices of transitions. This is the first time we get to see Tarantino's ability to let the audience gain introspection of the characters.<br/><br/>In order to get that dark and gritty style that the film needed, Tarantino opted for a change in cinematographer and hired Guillermo Navarro. Navarro is now known as a frequent collaborator with Guillermo Del Toro and those films usually have this murky black tone to it and the credit goes to Navarro's photography. This is also one of the main reasons that it doesn't have that look that is prevalent on the director's previous two films. Jackie Brown's look is definitely one of the reasons that the film has personality and it does allow us to perceive the story with seriousness that it demands. The film's dark tone does lose that humor that Tarantino was known for but that aspect isn't truly necessary here to engage the audience, though there are moments where it does get you laughing.<br/><br/>Again, Tarantino stays away from the traditional film score and fills the film up with musical nuggets that works perfectly with the scene. The previous two films touches on tracks within the Rock N' Roll and Pop genre, while here he chooses tracks within R&B genre. These tracks have so much soul in them and it does in a way throwback to the classic films that Pam Grier was in. Though I do wonder if the film would be improved using an original score, even if it retains that quality that the soundtracks give but I guess we'll never know.<br/><br/>The film's cast includes a return of Samuel L. Jackson and a number of stars who are known to have lost their touch, in particular Pam Grier. Honestly, I have yet to see a film that Grier is in but after this film, it proves that she has acting chops and that she brings great personality in a role that it's hard to not keep your eyes off her. Grier should have been nominated for Best Leading Actress at the Oscars that year but that is just my personal opinion. The rest of the cast were great with notable stand outs like Robert Forster and Bridget Fonda. Forster plays it more casually but not being near the borderline of laziness, while Fonda brings the sex to the role and she was able to bring the immaturity and bratiness that the role needed. Keaton and De Niro are a bit underused and their characters doesn't really have more to them that I could grasp on to. Jackson on the other hand still brings his usual style that was also found on Pulp Fiction but he changes it enough that it doesn't feel like he is repeating himself.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is an entertaining crime-heist film that definitely needs much more attention. I personally felt that this film is much stronger than Reservoir Dogs but it doesn't capture the greatness that Pulp Fiction was able to give off, regardless of it's stellar cast, amazing music, excellent cinematography, and a story that had me locked on to until the end of the film."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","17","20","24 July 2008"," Tarantino's best film, a tremendously entertaining thriller
","Quentin Tarantino takes on Elmore Leonard? At first look not such a good idea but coming to ""Jackie Brown"" several years after its more or less lukewarm initial reception (released after so-called masterpiece ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the inventive and infectious ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Jackie Brown"" was seen as something of a disappointment) and being able to assess it without putting in context of Tarantino's filmography, ""Jackie Brown"" is surprising.<br/><br/>It is, without question, Tarantino's most mature and complete work to date as a director. Mature in the sense that Tarantino here is not preoccupied with 'homages', references, style (not too much, at least), or indulging himself in his fantasies. Tarantino, for once, is primarily a storyteller, and the approach works stunningly well. ""Jackie Brown"" is a fantastically entertaining crime thriller that not only does justice to Leonard's source material, but in some senses improves on it (admittedly, the novel this is based on is hardly his best work). The cast is a dream for this sort of movie, and contains what is as of 2008 Robert De Niro's last truly memorable performance, the music fits perfectly, the atmosphere created is the sort you can lose yourself in for the running time of the film (which feels significantly shorter than it is), and the screenplay, with its witty exchanges, striking characters, and plentiful plot twists, keeps the viewer more than entertained. This is a truly engaging film.<br/><br/>Tarantino movies do it for me. I don't think he's one of the greatest directors of all time or anything, but he is a talented director with the capacity to make tremendously entertaining films. While many would prefer him to do films like ""Kill Bill"" I think ""Jackie Brown"" is a far better representation of his talent. He's certainly not completely out of his element here, there's plenty of 70's retro cool in this film, but thankfully it is contained and kept from going overboard.<br/><br/>Expect another ""Pulp Fiction"" and disappointment is an understandable reaction, but if you go into this with an open mind and expect nothing in particular you might just find that ""Jackie Brown"" is not only Tarantino's best but one of the most entertaining films of the 90's.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"Paranoid_Android","Null","82","117","8 April 2000"," Tarantino sees off the backlash
","Quentin Tarantino is clearly finding it difficult to follow the phenomenal success of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", which made him the hottest writer-director of his generation.  In the six years since then this is the only time that he has returned to the directors chair.  ""Jackie Brown"" - his ""difficult third film"" - seems to be his response to criticism of his first two films that he could only make movies about other movies, but not real life.  He cleverly anticipates the backlash by adapting a tightly plotted, character driven Elmore Leonard novel, still set in his familiar world of LA low-lives, but keeping to a minimum his trademark comic-book violence and pop-culture references, while emphasising the novels more mature themes - such as ageing and the feeling of time running out for the middle-aged characters.  The result is a slick, interesting, if slightly draggy thriller, which ultimately lacks the freshness and audaciousness of those earlier films.<br/><br/>Tarantino still has his maverick streak though, as displayed in his trusting of Pam Grier to carry the entire movie.  The casting of a middle-aged black actress with no box-office clout in the lead role can't have been easy in an industry notorious for it's scant regard for actresses after they reach 30. You can bet that the studios would have at least insisted on the safety of a Sharon Stone or a Demi Moore.  But Tarantino, as he did when casting Travolta, stuck to his gut-instinct, and once again it proved an inspired choice.  Grier, bringing with her the memories of her 70's blackploitation movies, gives a convincingly tough, wise and sympathetic performance.<br/><br/>Actors love to work with Tarantino because the roles he gives them will be invariably jucier than usual.  That is once again the case here, although the casting isn't quite as inspired as it was in ""Dogs"" or ""Pulp"" (or ""True Romance"").  Samuel L. Jackson is reliably good - if hardly stretched - as an unscrupulous hustler who is not as smart as he thinks he is, and Bridget Fonda has fun as his conniving beach babe girlfriend.  Robert Forster jumps at the chance to play a role with depth after years in made-for-tv hell. Robert De Niro though, despite providing some amusing moments, is disappointingly wasted as Jackson's dim-witted partner.<br/><br/>At times this feels like just another thriller, but every now and then Tarantino reminds you what all the fuss was about.  Jackson's brutal (off-screen) dispatching of Chris Tucker in the boot of a car, as the camera slowly cranes up into the sky, is masterfully conceived and a scene, which is subtly built up to, involving a teasing Fonda and a p*****-off De Niro is as unexpected and as shocking as anything Tarantino has done before.  By refusing to make a Pulp Fiction 2, Tarantino may have missed out on some easy money, but this film has enough to suggest that he will be more than just a flash in the pan."
"paul2001sw-1","8","78","115","10 January 2005"," Tarantino grows up
","Quentin Tarantino follow up to the hysterical response generated by his suitably hysterical first two movies was 'Jackie Brown', an altogether more restrained film that garnered a somewhat more restrained set of reviews. Perhaps the relative lack of impact made by this film explains his subsequent return to extremes with 'Kill Bill'. But in some ways this is a shame, as there's a lot to enjoy in 'Jackie Brown', particularly in the universally first rate performances the director manages to get out of his distinguished cast. Robert Forster is wise and weary as a middle-aged bail bondsman, Samuel L. Jackson plays a criminal with all of the menace and none of the charm of his character in 'Pulp Fiction', while Bridget Fonda and a (cast against type) Robert de Niro are entertaining as a pair of useless crack-heads. Best of all is former blaxploitation star Pam Grier in the title role, combining human warmth and coolness under fire with considerable charm. The generic Ellmore Leanard plot is ultimately not quite as clever as it promises to be, and as as ever with Tarantino, both tone and taste are sometimes questionable: the early sequence 'Women Who Love Guns' is very funny, but it's quite unclear whether it's intended as satire or celebration. Nonetheless, once one adds in a typically splendid soundtrack, everything adds up to a movie far above the average crime thriller, and for all the breathtaking invention of his other movies, it's enough to make one wish that Tarantino didn't usually feel the need to try so very hard."
"GuntherHuanes","8","5","5","10 May 2020"," Entertaining and exciting thriller that keeps you hooked during its 160 minutes
","Tarantino once said that Jackie Brown was a film that was most enjoyed the second or third time you saw it and I must admit that I agree now. This is an entertaining and exciting thriller that achieves the goal of keeping you hooked during its 160 minutes, with an intelligent and very well executed screenplay.<br/><br/>The film managed to hook my attention from start to finish, but in order to follow the tangled story without being confused I had leave unnoticed a few details that I only got the second time I saw it. These types of films in which the viewer can overlook certain important details, and that require subsequent scenes of explanation, in my opinion, remove subtlety from the story. However, although I did not feel this with Jackie Brown, since Tarantino knew how to provide the amount of information necessary to keep us informed and intrigued at the same time, the way certain information and some facts were revealed to us did not completely convince me.<br/><br/>Leaving aside the treatment of some transitions between scenes, which I think could have worked better, technically the feature film is quite solid. I loved the use of the colors yellow, red and blue in the photography and the costume desing, as well as the choice of music, since I feel that they complied with giving personality and a very particular tone to the film. Likewise, despite not having read the novel, the adaptation seemed great to me. The way Tarantino decides to develop the story and the way in which the motivations of the characters make sense, result in natural and slightly forced acts. The scenes that serve to explain what is happening, as I mentioned lines above, could have been better narrated, but this does not remove suspense or emotion from the plot.Likewise, the direction was well executed with interesting panning camera movements that take you from one character to another, and recurring closed shots that fulfill concentrating our attention on the actors and their dialogues. Except for a couple of scenes involving Ordell and Beaumont (Chris Tucker) and which I consider to be very well accomplished, the overall direction is not outstanding.<br/><br/>Another element of the film worth mentioning is the acting. Pam Grier, the protagonist, gives an excellent performance that allowed her to participate in important awards that season. It's worth mentioning that this character was intended exclusively for her after Quentin Tarantino was impressed with her talent on a previous audition. In the same way, we have a Samuel L. Jackson showing one of the best performances I've seen of him so far. Jackson manages to blend perfectly with his character and dialogues, taking him from being a fun and friendly subject to a true and desperate psychopath. Although for me it is he who should have had an Oscar nomination for his performance in this film, it was Robert Foster who ended up obtaining it with his excellent work playing Max. Recall that at that time Robert Foster was going through a career decline so he accepted, without hesitation, when Tarantino specifically sought him out for this role. Finally, the film shows us some solid Robert De Niro, Michael Keaton and Bridget Fonda who I think did a great job in the scenes where they worked.<br/><br/>Finally, Tarantino confessed that he feared that Elmore Leonard, the writer of the novel, would hate the film, but the author ended up later revealing to him that it was possibly one of the best scripts he had read. I don't know if that's the case for me, but Jackie Brown is definitely a film that, although not perfect, is very well written, has an entertaining and compelling story, and is excellently performed. Whether you are a Tarantino fan or not, it is a movie that I definitely recommend watching."
"johnmbale","9","8","9","18 July 2006"," Jackie Brown is some lady.
","Jackie Brown works well thanks to a great cast and Tarantino's mastery of cinema technique. As Jackie Pam Grier almost steals the show but Jackson and DeNiro are strong support. The plot is a complex bit of double crossing, when Jackie finds herself trapped by the police to give up her dangerous associate in order to gain freedom. It flows along punctuated by extreme closeups, long tracking shots (that would do credit to Orson Welles) driven at times by pop music. All of which Tarantino manages very well. In the end the direction takes a lot of credit for the success of this thriller in the wake of Pulp Fiction. The violence is understated by comparison, but all the more shocking because of this. Well done."
"albrechtcm","10","10","12","28 November 2018"," One of the Best Movies ever made
","I've never been a big fan of Mr. Tarantino's movies, but when I viewed Jackie Brown I was smitten.
I've been watching movies since talkies were in their infancy, through all the westerns and detective movies that kids like to ""grown up"" films, and I believe I've seen most of the best ones.
But Jackie Brown is a film that has it all. Adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel, Mr. Tarantino has developed it into a sparkling tale featuring characters that are at once likeable and detestable.
I don't want to go into the plot because it may reveal too much, and I'd rather talk about the characters.
Samuel L. Jackson as Ordell Robbie is a casual, fun-loving guy who deals in illegal arms. He's all that but at the same time as ruthless as any mobster we've ever seen on the screen.
Bridget Fonda is perfect as Melanie, an addicted bit of eye-candy who lounges about the house keeping Mr. Jackson company and doing little things such as answer the phone or bring him a drink.
Robert De Niro in one of his finest performances is dull ex-con Louis Gara. He's just out of prison. Mr. Jackson allows to stay with him for a while mostly for the extra company. Mr. De Niro doesn't have to say or do much to show us he's dull, possible has a fried brain from drugs. It shows in his eyes. They're dull and we know he's now quite all here. What we don't at first know is that he has a very short fuse. That's probably why he was in prison.
Tiny Lister doesn't actually do much. He finds people for Max Cherry. If we skipped bail we wouldn't want him to come after us. We can see in his posture that he's serious.
Robert Forster is Max Cherry, a bail bondsman who's tired, getting old and just wants to retire. But when the phone rings, he's all business.
Michael Keaton stands out as a jaunty agent who's out to get Mr. Jackson but the real star that puts this film over the top is Pam Grier.
She's Jackie Brown, a middle-aged single woman working for a second-rate airline. She just wants to get enough money together for the future. Flying out of the country enables her to pick up gun money to bring to Mr. Jackson.
Everyone in this ensemble cast is so perfect and some of the scenes are at once a jolt, yet at the same time inevitable, that one viewing is simply not enough. Nor are two. This is an amazing of artful direction."
"xTapoutx","8","10","12","8 June 2006"," Solid film, brilliant script
","Once again, Quentin Tarantino proves why he is arguably the best screen writer in Hollywood. Although the story behind Jackie Brown was adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel, Tarantino uses the already existing characters to his advantage, capitalizing on their traits to and personalities to spew forth Tarnatino-like dialogue. This is the type of crime film that should please any fan of the genre: it's very detailed, possesses excellent dialogue, and has an intricate plot that makes sitting through the 2 1/2 hr. film well worth the wait. Jackie Brown is a gritty, straightforward film that packs a punch and is highly recommended."
"FilmOtaku","7","21","29","6 August 2005"," Decent, but don't expect a Pulp Fiction sequel
","""Jackie Brown"", the 1997 film starring Pam Grier as the title character, a flight attendant who smuggles cash into the country for a shady associate, Ordell (Jackson) is the third film directed by Quentin Tarantino. When Jackie is tagged by the feds, (played by Keaton and Michael Bowen) she is willing to give up Ordell because she has a plan of her own. Meanwhile, Ordell has proved himself to be a pretty nasty character, killing associates without even a hint of betrayal, so to say that Jackie is walking a tightrope is an understatement. Rounding out the cast is Robert Forster as Max Cherry, Jackie's bail bondsman hired by Ordell when Jackie is initially arrested by the feds, and eventual love interest, Robert DeNiro as Louis, an associate of Ordell's who is fresh out of jail and about to buy in on one of Ordell's gun selling schemes and Bridget Fonda as Melanie, one of Ordell's women, and object of both fascination and irritation for Louis.<br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" features many ""Tarantinoisms"" that we have come to expect from his films; slick cinematography, a soundtrack that is perfect for the film (in this case, 1970's R&B) a rich cast of eccentric characters, a solid amount of violence and even more profanity. If there was a Tarantino film that DIDN'T include these elements, I would be disappointed. As John Travolta was dug up to star in ""Pulp Fiction"", Tarantino resurrects two 1970's actors, Robert Forster and Pam Grier, and both prove once again that there are few contemporary directors around who have better gut instincts and an eye for casting than he. Although there could have been many other bigger name, safer choices that would have jumped to be in Tarantino's perceived follow-up to ""Fiction"", the film geek once again proves that he knows best. Grier is absolutely luminous, and looks at least 10 years younger than her actual age. Better than that, she is sexy, spunky and knows what she wants. The supporting cast is also excellent, and while it's definitely film geeky to admit it, like the actors who appear in the ensemble films of Paul Thomas Anderson or Wes Anderson, I always admire the cast of Tarantino's film because while they may not have a large or prestigious role in the film, they are always juicy characters that are sometimes played against type. I loved seeing Michael Keaton as a hard-faced, leather jacket clad fed, and Robert DeNiro, who can chew scenery better than a lot is fantastic as the quiet, shlubby and slobby sidekick.<br/><br/>Anyone who approached ""Jackie Brown"" looking for a Pulp Fiction sequel was probably either somewhat disappointed or, like me, encouraged that Tarantino can not only do flashy, but can spin a good story as well. And perhaps even more importantly, he wasn't a two-trick pony with the inspired films ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"". While I have mixed feelings about Tarantino the man, (I am endeared to his almost autistic-knowledge of film and his inherent film geekiness, but I am both fascinated and repelled by his almost constant hysteria and, particularly in the infancy of his fame, his inability to turn down an acting job or engage in ceaseless self-promotion) I certainly count him among my favorite directors and anytime he releases a film, it's an event. Before seeing his latest releases, ""Kill Bill Vol. 1 & Vol. 2"" I lamented that he possibly took too much time off between projects, but after seeing ""Vol. 1"" I quickly reconsidered, saying that if he is going to consistently put out superior product, he can take as much time as he wants.<br/><br/>And that is why I look at ""Jackie Brown"", a film that wasn't quite as stellar or lauded as his others with a certain amount of fondness, because it is a great piece of work, without all of the flash, bells and whistles of its predecessor. Knowing that a ""Pulp Fiction 2"" would be an instant hit, Tarantino decided to go in a different direction, and it's that willingness to take a chance, even if it's not a huge leap, that makes me appreciate it that much more. It's probably my least favorite Tarantino film, but even my least favorite Tarantino film garners a better rating than 80% of contemporary cinema. Even Tarantino fans that I know let this film go under their radar, so if you are in the same boat, seek this one out; it is well worth it. 7/10 --Shelly"

","Jackie Brown-1997-Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forester, Robert Deniro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Michael Bowen, Chris Tucker, Tiny Lister, Aimmie Graham and Sid Haig.<br/><br/>I'll go over the plot and then review it. Ordell Robbie(Jackson) is an illegal arms seller. One of his aquaintences Beaumont Livingston(Tucker) was put in jail for carrying a machine gun that he bought from Ordell. Ordell goes to Max Cherry (Forester) and gets a 10,000 dollar bond to get Beaumont out of jail. After getting him out, Ordell pays Beaumont a visit and kills him. <br/><br/>Later.....while walking in the airport parking lot from her job as a stewardess, Jackie Brown(Grier) is stopped by two FBI agents Mark Dargas(Bowen) and Ray Nicholette(Keaton). They check her bags and we soon figure out that Beaumont told everything to get out of going to jail. Jackie is Ordell's money runner for the guns he sells. Unfortunately, in the money bag for him, the buyer had slipped in some cocaine for Ordell and Jackie goes to jail. Ordell goes back to Max and has him move the 10,000 dollars from Beaumont to Jackie. Max drives her to her house and is beginning to fall for her. Ordell goes to Jackies house to try to kill her, but Jackie stole Max's gun and protects herself. This all spirals into fooling Ordell out of 40,000 dollars.<br/><br/>My review: 9 out of 10. Robert Deniro and Bridget Fonda were excellent together as Ordell's friend and girlfriend. Keaton has a gem role that's small but important. Grier and Forester are in their best roles ever and Jackson is good as always. This movie is not fast paced but has so much interesting dialogue that makes up for it. Tarantino knew what he was doing.<br/><br/>R for language, some brief bloody violence, drug content and a brief scene of sexuality(between Deniro and Fonda)"
"utgard14","8","9","11","29 October 2015"," One of my favorite Tarantino movies
","Jackie Brown is considered by many (myself included) to be one of Quentin Tarantino's best films and also one of his most under-appreciated. There's love for it but it isn't met with the same reverence as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, or the same enthusiasm as his genre homages that followed. But it should be more widely praised as it's an exceptional movie. The direction is wonderful, the soundtrack is fun, and the script is full of memorable dialogue, as you would expect from Tarantino. The cast is terrific, led by '70s legend Pam Grier in her ""comeback"" role and Robert Forster in an understated performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar nomination. Every scene with Grier and Forster, separately or together, is a treat. As fun as Sam Jackson is, these two are what hold the film together and make it so enjoyable to watch over and over. For his part, Jackson does what you expect him to do. He's foul-mouthed and funny but still very menacing when he needs to be. Robert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda both offer amusing support. Chris Tucker has a brief but funny appearance. The movie has a lot of humor. That's one of the main things that makes it so enjoyable to watch over and over. It's a great film that probably holds more appeal to non-Tarantino fans than most of his movies do."

Meanwhile Ordell asks the fifty-six year-old Max Cherry (Robert Forster), who runs a bail bond business, to release Jackie Brown with the intention of eliminating her. Jackie suspects of Ordell's intention and plots a complicate confidence game with Max to steal half a million dollar from Ordell. <br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" is another great movie by Quentin Tarantino. The story of a sophisticated swindle shows the return of Pam Grier to a lead role and Robert Forster in an important role. The scene in the department store is original, with different perspectives of the same event.

"christopher-underwood","10","4","4","2 September 2019"," what a pleasure it is to watch something as wonderful as this
","Having recently watched the glorious and faultless Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood (twice) it seemed apposite to re-watch my previous favourite Tarantino movie and see how it compares. And what a pleasure it is to watch something as wonderful as this after so many average films. Splendidly plotted, thanks to a large extent to the original Elmore Leonard book, Rum Punch, this traverses its considerable length with ease and panache. Once more I am struck just what fantastic performances QT seems to obtain. Pam Grier gives the performance of a lifetime (better even than her tremendous 1974 Foxy Brown turn) and she seems to grow in stature and presence as the film progresses. Robert Forster is perfect and a great balancing element between some towering and competing personalities. Robert DeNiro, of whom I am no great fan, here, surely gives his greatest ever performance and even Bridget Fonda is really good, bare feet and wiggly toes and all. Overall this may turn out to outlive the wonder of the latest film but for me, though this is still a stupendous film with great acting and good jokes it didn't have that 'makes me smile' factor the new film seems to have, for me anyway."

Yeah. That's right. I'm saying it. This movie is great and doesn't deserve to be relegated to second tier Tarantino status.<br/><br/>When I popped the movie in, I was expecting to have to write a review saying ""hey, I know this movie is widely regarded as a lesser film but I still kinda like it,"" all the while trying not to act sheepish about it but, after watching it again this afternoon, I can definitely say that this is one of my favorite Quentin Tarantino films.<br/><br/>Now I am not going to get too into the weeds about what I love about this film except to say that those same old themes which I always seem to come back to, growing older, time moving on, and identity are all there teeming under the surface of this taught crime thriller.<br/><br/>Sure, the swear count isn't as high as Tarantino's other works, and neither is the violence by a long shot but if that's enough to make us lose sight of how brilliantly directed this film is then maybe we ought to admit we just like Tarantino because he is a violent director and we just don't like him so much when he isn't splitting heads and carving symbols into people's foreheads.<br/><br/>I for one find this to be among my favorites because of the slower pacing which makes the stakes for these characters seem real and true. This isn't a film where violence is played for laughs. Violence is fast. Bang! Over. Dead body on the ground. A life that was now is not.<br/><br/>The fear of death and growing old loom large in this movie as everyone plays a game for keeps knowing that they either win or die."
"Randall Good","9","4","4","3 August 1998"," The most underrated film of 1997.
","A lot of people don't realize why Pulp Fiction was such a great movie.  It excelled in two areas:  characters and story.  Both were great.  Jackie Brown has fascinating, well-defined characters who scheme and plot and think and act like real people.  I could watch them all day.  The plot is labyrinthine, twisted, satisfying, and genuine.  These are real people using their brains to try to pull something off.  Brains are what matter most in this film.  Tarantino--for all his hype--is a great director because he writes great, realistic characters and he's a terrific storyteller.  This film has all of these elements.  It's a great film."

","Mr. Hipp has it all wrong.  Completely different from ""Pulp"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"" Quentin crafts yet another brilliant movie with its own unique style. A delightful game of watching the characters move the plot along and not vice versa, ""Jackie Brown"" may be more mainstream than his other films, but it's just as delightful to watch unfold.  One of the best of 1997."
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","6","7","8 August 2008"," An excellent, low-key character study with the usual Tarantino quirks
","Arguably director Quentin Tarantino's greatest film, and his third straight masterpiece in a row following the creative success of Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), with his firm grasp of character, narrative and dramatic involvement at something approaching a career best. Unlike the first two films aforementioned, Jackie Brown (1997) is something an obvious step-back from the hip dialog, cool violence and narrative experimentation of his more characteristic work; with a mostly straight story placing the emphasis on the dynamics of the central characters and the continual themes of middle-age hopelessness and the need for fulfilment; all of which seems fairly radical when looked at within the context of Tarantino's career as a whole, and in particular his two most recent films, Kill Bill (2003-2004) and Death Proof (2007). Unlike the more self-aware, post-modern self-reference of those particular films, Jackie Brown is an entirely low-key affair; built around an outstanding central performance from Pam Grier and an accomplished ensemble cast that compliments the character of Jackie - as well as the theme of people living off past glories - with Tarantino capturing the action with a restraint and intelligence that many of his detractors might conveniently choose to overlook.<br/><br/>As ever with Tarantino, the writing is intelligent enough to support both the mechanics of the plot and the reliance on character interaction, with a lot of the film simply being supported by the complicated relationships between the characters and the downtime that occurs during the more obvious moments of exposition; with the two strands coming together on a number of occasions to show these characters as fully-formed, complicated human beings trying to do right, when all along tormented by the need to succeed. There's also Tarantino's great use of colour and composition - still entirely low-key but completely suited to the subject matter - the always great use of music to both establish a mood and set the tone for the characters, and an incredibly complicated final act that dips into the territory of Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950), albeit, with the director's always interesting use of long takes and intricate tracking-shots. The handling of the central theme of the film, of middle-aged characters looking back to the past and seeing only the defeat of their later lives, is brilliantly conveyed by the casting of actors considered forgotten or ""washed up""; with the central performance of Grier as the still sassy Jackie Brown being matched by the performance of Robert Forster as proto-love interest Max Cherry, or De Niro as the past-it career criminal, itself a sly reference perhaps to De Niro's own drop in quality over the last fifteen years.<br/><br/>There's also fine support from Tarantino regular Samuel L. Jackson, as well as Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Michael Bowen, Tommy Lister and a cameo by former ""blacksploitation"" icon Sid Haig. Without question, Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature picture to date; not only in the sense that it's characters are more seasoned, beat-up and worn down than those found in the previous two films, but in the intelligent and thoughtful way that the film has been put together. True, there's nothing here that is as radical or as iconic as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, with the gunplay and sporadic bursts of violence having been toned down to a bare minimum; but regardless, the film still fizzles and pops with an energy and enthusiasm that makes Tarantino's work so original and worthwhile. What we have here is an honest look at criminal characters that is as real and unglamorous as you could possibly get, with the dialog enriching and complimenting these characters, as opposed to defining them, and the film-making sensibilities of the director capturing the essence of the story, without overwhelming it."
"StayPuft003","9","6","7","7 June 2006"," Very good
","I do not understand why this movie is not noticed among the movie world. If I were to ask somebody who directed Jackie Brown, I do not think they would be able to tell me. This movie, although not nearly as action packed as Pulp Fiction, has great dialogue and at times can be very humorous. The soundtrack is arguably Tarantino's best (And he knows his music) and the characters are well rounded and unique. Although some people feel like the ending is bad and in some ways ruins the movie, I felt as if it were the perfect fit for a movie like this. Also, each character seems to get their own scene to show off both the actor's talents and the way the character acts compared to those around them. ElmoreLeonard's writing mixed with Tarantino's attitude make this movie a sure 10/10 and it is enjoyable, if not more enjoyable, every time I see it. Tarantino knew his material, and turned it into one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br/><br/>It might take a second viewing to truly appreciate it. If you don't focus so much on the plot, which is phenomenal, the second time around and focus on the amazing dialogue, you will see what makes this movie a true gem."

They're not like a lot of movie characters that seem so unreal you are unable imagine beyond the confines of the movie. These people are smart, clever, and capable of showing real emotion.

","This film has a great start and a very memorable opening sequence. Our main character is on an airport track and is going forward on a conveyor belt set to a great tune. Fantastic use of the camera and a great song to go along with it, but then once you get to the movie, beyond the stylized and interesting opening, the film starts to slow down and goes on for 2 1/2 it didn't need to.<br/><br/>The thing that defines the film from Tarantino's other work is that is not his own creation (or his own ripoff of someone else's creation) but a legitimate adaption of a novel. Tarantino's style was never that conventional and when you see him working within conventional cofines, which is sort of what this is, despite being a vibrant-feeling piece, his whole style just doesn't work and he can't acomodate proper pacing. Tarantino's style is suited to fast-pased thrillers or just things told of out of sequence. When he tells a character-driven crime story in a rather linear matter, his very superfluous direction and writing ends up chugging the whole thing down, when it should be either speeding the thing up or directing more so its focus. The opening is more in line with his type of films, but once it gets into relationships and more complex elements of story and character, the thing just kind of drags.<br/><br/>It's got so much good in it, with great acting and great dialouge, but Tarantino just doesn't pace it right cause he can't handle a story of this type and the movie ends up feeling a bit boring, by the time you're finished. Still, though, it's got so much good in it, that it's not necessarily a bad way to spend an afternoon but maybe there'll be a point, where you wish it were it over, when there's probably still a good amount to go."

This movie has all of this in spades, with amazingly fleshed out characters such as the bored, middle aged and directionless two central characters who form a silent romantic bond with each other (Jackie Brown and Max Cherry), the sleazy, cowardly, cunning drug dealer Ordell, his smart-ass girl Melanie, his ex-con friend Lewis, whose laid-back characteristics conceal a fearsome dark side and troublesome detective Ray.<br/><br/>The dialogue again works wonders throughout the movie, the acting is pitch-perfect across the board, with Pam Grier, Samuel L Jackson and Robert De Niro being as great as you'd expect them to be, and Robert Forster and Bridget Fonda delivering career best performances and the movie has some amazing sequences, my favourite being the sequence filmed from three different viewpoints, followed by the sequence that involves a promise of waffles and chicken and a car boot (no spoilers for either). And the plot also builds to an fantastic and logical conclusion.<br/><br/>In conclusion, let me sum it up for you. If you like Tarantino movies for their OTT violence and OTT characters, you probably won't like this movie. However, if you like Tarantino movies for their wonderfully realistic dialogue and amazingly charming or detestable characters, then you'll love this movie."
"Tweekums","9","5","6","13 May 2016"," Tarantino's third film
","Gun dealer Ordell Robbie has half a million dollars; the problem is that the money is in Mexico and he needs it moved to Los Angeles. To this end stewardess Jackie Brown is bringing it in $50,000 at a time; all is going well until she is arrested with the money and a small quantity of cocaine. Ordell goes to bail bondsman Max Cherry and gets her out of jail if he is to use her to get the rest of the money out of Mexico the police will have to let Jackie return to work. To persuade them she tells them that she will help them get Ordell is she playing them, Ordell or both?.<br/><br/>This, Quentin Tarantino's third film, feels different to his others despite the familiar themes; this is probably because it is based on a book by Elmore Leonard rather than being an original story. This is not a problem though; it is the sort of film Tarantino's fans should enjoy but also one that can be enjoyed by those who are less keen on his other works. The story manages to be tense and at times shocking but it also has moments of humour. The cast does a fine job; Pam Greer is great as the eponymous Jackie Brown and Samuel Jackson is equally good as Ordell; a character who is more likable than one might expect given that he is a murderer and a gun smuggler. They are ably supported by a cast that includes Robert De Nero, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton and Robert Forster. Overall I'd say this is well worth watching; assuming you aren't put off by the amount of swearing."
"cartesianthought","9","5","6","22 December 2015"," The movie that got me into movies.
","For all the stupid misogynistic blaxploitation films Pam Grier starred in, Jackie Brown is an intelligent film (homage to the genre) that gives her a role worthy of her talent. Being old and tired of working as a flight attendant, she sees an opportunity to swindle a weapon's dealer out of $500,000. <br/><br/>It shows a lot of restraint for a Tarantino film: it's easily his least violent work and there's more effort to tell an actual mature story than ever. There's only a little bit of out-of-ordering sequence, but it comes together in a memorably well done heist scene. It runs a little bit on the long side, but it feels like a full experience. While having genuinely good storytelling, instead of being purely dramatic, it takes the unique route of being satire. The serious and comedic elements add to each other rather than take away. One of Tarantino's underrated ones for sure."
"carbuff","10","5","6","11 May 2015"," Tarantino's best work in my opinion.
","I saw this a long, long time ago and another watching has just confirmed my viewpoint. I'm going to risk being a total heretic here, but I think that this is really Tarantino's best film ever (and, yes, that includes Pulp Fiction). <br/><br/>First, there is violence in the film, but it is not a nonstop bloodbath, which turns me off. <br/><br/>Second it has a very tight plot with some unexpected twists. <br/><br/>Finally, all of the actors without exception give really strong performances. <br/><br/>A really well-executed story which doesn't seem nearly as long as it is because it just keeps moving along."
"funkyfry","7","5","6","11 August 2006"," Unlike other Tarantino film, better on second viewing
","I first saw this movie on opening night and was somewhat disappointed. I think in retrospect that I was expecting too much the same thing I got from ""Pulp Fiction"". Specifically I was disappointed that Sam Jackson and Robert Deniro's characters were such small time criminals and just not ""badass"" enough. I thought it was kind of a waste of their talents. Thinking about it now, I realize why would you want to see Deniro and Jackson repeat previous performances? Tarantino did something new with them in this film and they both turned in very interesting performances that are better than the vast majority of their work in film since.<br/><br/>Just in general, I really think this is the best Tarantino film I've seen except ""Reservoir Dogs"". Why? Because the characters are more real and the plot/story is more focused. I love the performances he got out of Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Both of them are fantastic actors who really were wasted through most of the 80s and 90s until Quentin came along and basically rescued him, like he did for Travolta. Except Forster and Grier are way better than Travolta, and turn in excellent and nuanced performances here. The chemistry between them is perfect.<br/><br/>A few tangential comments. The music is good, as usual, the first time I saw it I felt it was a bit forced. But I realize now that it was part of the ""verite"" effect he was going after. Having the characters interact with the music makes the music seem a bit more obtrusive, but it also makes the film seem more real.<br/><br/>There is a lot of good character work in this film too. Keaton is great as a youngish cop, the ""nice guy"" in the routine. Fonda shines as a slutty stoner, the type of girl who makes fun of her boyfriend to his friends when he's not there, as if that would make them seem more appealing or sophisticated. In fact there is a very nice kind of ""dovetailing"" effect where you really don't notice the difference between the performances of the ""stars"" and the ""character actors"". The ""stars"" (Forster, Grier, Jackson) get to do basically just an expanded version of character work, and it makes for an even more seamless film than ""Pulp Fiction"" which at times feels bogged down by the weight of its stars.<br/><br/>All in all, a good story with good actors makes for a good film, if a bit slow in the end when we have to see the ""heist"" from multiple viewpoints despite its predictability."
"Nexus94","7","5","6","23 July 2006"," A solid, character driven movie
","When we insert our Quentin Tarantino movie into the machine, we expect to be bombarded with action, and perhaps sex. If this is what you're looking for, you may walk away disappointed. While this film does not provide a gun shot or beating around every corner, or breasts every few scenes, it does provide us with an intricate look inside a half dozen interesting characters. Don't get me wrong, it packs a mean punch compared to the average flick, just perhaps more mature and talkative compared to the average QT thriller. I personally commend Quentin for swaying off his action crammed image and simply telling an interesting story with a few sporadic gun shots here and there. Unless you can't stay seated without action in almost every scene, I would recommend this flick be seen."
"Annie_Taswegian","10","8","11","22 December 2017"," My favourite Tarantino movie
","For me, the most watchable one of his movies. Great characters, fantastic soundtrack, and a really good story. I don't think there's a misstep anywhere."
"quakex-925-959388","10","6","8","14 July 2017"," My Favourite Movie of all Time
","What's amazing to me about this movie, is that it managed to fully captivate my attention, despite the fact that I generally don't like drama movies, and have ADD. Usually I need horror films with jump scares, or high action films with lots of loud fighting to keep my attention. But in some mysterious way, the director of this film made even the slowest most non eventful parts incredibly interesting to me.<br/><br/>In all, I can't think of a single scene that didn't deserve to be in the movie. There are some rare parts that don't seem entirely essential to the story to me. But those parts are still great just on their own, and would stand on their own as short films.<br/><br/>One thing that really makes this movie unique for me is the strength of its female lead protagonist. Strong aggressive female characters in other movies almost always feel forced to me. Like they are trying too hard to be seen as respectable leaders, but actually just come off as jerks. I don't think I am sexist, but I might be on some subconscious level. However, the actor playing Jackie Brown plays the part of an aggressive strong protagonist like a natural. The fact that she is a woman taking on an authoritative and strong role, against violent and strong men, didn't stand out to me at all during the movie. It all felt natural. Jackie still comes off as a nice likable woman, and not a jerk at all. <br/><br/>If I were forced to come up with just one criticism, it would be that it wasn't long enough. The story is completed by the end, in a satisfying way. But I cared so much about the characters that I wanted to keep seeing more of their lives, even if it was not eventful."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","6","8","7 February 2016"," Booyah!
","Coming as it did after critical darlings ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", it's perhaps not surprising that Quentin Tarantino's next film failed to - at the time - scale those giddy heights. Yet on reflection these days, when viewing Tarantino's career over twenty years later, it's one of his tightest works.<br/><br/>Working from master pulper Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch"", Tarantino had a concrete base from which to build on, which he does with aplomb. Cleaving close to the spirit of Leonard, ""Jackie Brown"" is rich with glorious chatter, each conversation either pings with a biting hard ass edge, or alternatively deconstructing the vagaries of the human condition.<br/><br/>Oh for sure this is a talky pic, but nothing is ever twee or pointless, for it's a film that pays rich rewards to those prepared to fully grasp the characters on show, to be aware that all is building towards the final third. It's then here where the story brings about its stings, with a complex operation cloaked in double crosses and evasive captures, of violence and more...<br/><br/>There's a wonderful portion of the story that sees Tarantino play the same sequence out from different character perspectives, but this is not self indulgency. Tarantino reins himself in, not letting stylisations detract from the characters we are so heavily involved with. His other triumph is bringing Pam Grier and Robert Forster to the fore, who both deliver terrific performances. It's through these pair, with their deft characterisations, where Jackie Brown is most poignant and purposeful.<br/><br/>Is it a case of ""Jackie Brown"" being undervalued in Tarantino's armoury? Perhaps it is? For it's ageless, holding up as a piece of intelligent work of note, and well worth revisiting by anyone who hasn't seen it since it was first released. 9/10"
"kluseba","6","6","8","24 July 2013"," Authentic and well acted but it drags on for far too long
","Quentin Tarantino is a man between genius and madness who has created some of the best movies ever but also a few true Fails in my opinion. ""Jackie Brown"" is just between both extremes for me and is maybe his most unspectacular film to date.<br/><br/>On the positive side, this movie is Tarantino's most organic one until now. The characters are more credible than usual, the dialogues aren't all too over the top and the story line is quite easy to follow. The movie includes no special effects, shock moments or unexpected twists and feels surprisingly down to earth for a Quentin Tarantino movie. From that point of view, it's a quite unique movie from him. The acting is authentic and very well done. Pam Grier plays an attractive and intelligent lady in her forties who starts the movie as a victim just to become the one who plays with each other character around her. Samuel L. Jackson does a convincing role as superficial but not dumb gangster. Robert Forster plays a bondsman and smart gentleman with a lot of charisma as well. He's the actor I somehow like the most in this movie. In addition to the movie's authentic mood and the great acting, the soundtrack is as always quite convincing as well and introduces us to many great Afroamerican musicians. I must though admit that I preferred by far the soundtracks of other Tarantino movies such as ""Kill Bill"" or ""Django Unchained"" for example.<br/><br/>On the other side, the movie definitely has its lengths as many Tarantino movies. There are some more or less important endless dialogues that should have been shortened in my opinion. This movie would have just been fine with a running time between ninety and one-hundred-five minutes in my opinion. Apart of that, the story is not only down to earth but also quite unspectacular and there isn't that much going on in two hours and a half. The movie feels a little bit too simple at some points. Apart of the acting, the movie lacks of a true highlight. The killing scenes are really unspectacular and you don't see very much. It's the same thing for one single and quite boring sex scene. The movie is supposed to have a few humorous moments but they really aren't all that memorable. The showdown in the mall also lacks tension. It shows us the same scene from three different views which gets quite redundant. The only truly gripping moments in this movie are the first E encounter between Pam Grier and Samuel L. Jackson in her apartment and the scene when Robert Forster and Samuel L. Jackson go to the Office of the bondsman. <br/><br/>In the end, this film could have been a standout movie in Tranatino's career because it's quite different from what he usually does. The film though fails from that point of view and drags on far too long and turns out to be quite unspectacular or even boring at some points. It all feels more like a theatre play where convincing dialogues by solid actors matter but not much more. I have seen far worse but also far better movies and I would only recommend this flick to die hard fans of Quentin Tarantino's works."
"Steffi_P","9","6","8","20 February 2012"," ""Didn't I blow your mind this time?""
","These days, when a director becomes a household name, there's a pressure on them to live up to their established reputation. If the formula changes the fans don't take it well. This is at least partly thanks to the auteur theory, which tends to value a director's work on its consistency rather than the actual quality of each movie. After his revolutionary hit Pulp Fiction, his follow-up Jackie Brown was not exactly a flop, but its reception among critiques, awards ceremonies and the general chitchat of Tarantino aficionados was somewhat lukewarm compared to the raging success of Pulp Fiction. What was wrong?<br/><br/>Jackie Brown differs from previous Tarantino projects in that it is adapted from a novel, rather than being an original screenplay straight from the director's brain (albeit filtered through his many cinematic influences). It contains rather less of the dialogue-for-dialogue's sake that was so integral to the appeal of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, so no ""Royale with Cheese"" business here. It still has plenty of cracking dialogue in pursuit of plot though, and scenes such as Lewis trying to explain what went wrong with the switch are glowing examples of Tarantino's black humour. Overall it's a finely constructed thing, a nod towards the lovers-in-crime sub-genre of film noir as much as it is a stylistic homage to blaxploitation. And perhaps it's those romantic undertones and the slightly more low-key violence that put off many of the less broadminded Tarantino admirers.<br/><br/>Always something of a minimalist behind the camera, Tarantino's visual style here is at its most simple. Like a Sergio Leone picture, every scene basically boils down to a stand-off between two characters. Tarantino mostly eschews camera movement, just giving us stripped-down shots of people glaring at each other. Of course some may miss the more flamboyant touches that could be seen in his earlier movies, but for the sake of story and character, he is better without them. Special mention must be made of the music in Jackie Brown. Tarantino is of course known for his use of popular music soundtracks, but here it is more apt and co-ordinated than ever. The opening sequence is perfectly timed to ""Across 110th Street"", the aching melody and lyrics setting the tone of the whole movie as Pam Grier strides along to the beat. At other times the soundtrack is even witty, as when Robert Forster steps out of the changing room. Tarantino should try making a musical one day. It'd be amazing.<br/><br/>The simplicity of Tarantino's approach has given more prominence to the cast. Blaxploitation star Pam Grier here gets her most significant role in years, slotting into Tarantino-world with ease and confidence. She has a lot of silences – her refusal to answer when she's asked if the envelope can be searched, the long close-up of her while Michael Bowen interrogates her offscreen – but she constantly acts through them, subtle reactions flickering across her face. Crucially she has the necessary strength of character to make us believe she would stand up to cops and gangsters. Other honourable mentions must also go to Robert De Niro, bringing presence to his small part, and his unlikely but fruitful pairing with Bridget Fonda, who matches him for comical delivery.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown clearly lacks the superficial pizazz and deconstructed narrative that wowed everyone in Pulp Fiction, but in its place there is a clear, strong story arc and a slightly more human, emotional slant. To my mind that's more than a fair exchange. But perhaps it's most helpful not to consider what it is or is not in comparison to its predecessor. Jackie Brown is an excellent movie in its own right."
"moonspinner55","7","7","10","4 May 2006"," Tough-talking but surprisingly low-keyed Tarantino curiosity...
","Quentin Tarantino's much-anticipated return to film-making following ""Pulp Fiction"" is an intriguing character-drama about a cool-headed flight attendant in cahoots with a merciless gunrunner who ends up playing both sides of the law to save herself from going to jail. From Elmore Leonard's book ""Rum Punch"", and full of punch-drunk people, dreamers, and low-life scuzzies with cockeyed, crazy ambitions. Great acting by nearly everyone (particularly Robert Forster as Pam Grier's bail-bondsman), but in the end it does feel a little thin--especially as the plot is stretched out too long. Tarantino's technical dazzle is certainly in place, but there's possibly too much exposition for the film to really hit the bull's-eye. Hot soundtrack, lots of funny/scary moments courtesy of the auteur, and some fine conversational dialogue, as when Grier tells Forster about her record collection: ""I was gonna buy a CD player, but I didn't feel like starting over."" *** from ****"

","I was really pleasantly surprised by this Tarantino crime drama. Thinking back to the days of its original release, I don't remember much enthusiasm for this film. Yet, having watched it for the first time last night, I thought it was fantastic! It contained many of those retro Tarantino tricks that I love - the '70's soundtrack; the unexpected cuts and fades; the tricks with the time-line. The characters were fantastically portrayed for the most part - Samuel L. Jackson is a genius in this film as is DeNiro in his very understated role. In fact, this DeNiro character is unlike most others I can think of and in that sense, is sort of a relief. And Robert Forster captures the essence of Max the bail bondsman perfectly. This film lacks some of the wild pace and excessive violence of other Tarantino films. I find that a bit of a relief, too. The plot twists are interesting and bottom line is - this movie is a lot of fun. Heartily recommended."

","First of all I am one big Tarantino fan always have been. Most people have criticized this movie as being his worst movie. That couldn't be further from the truth. Quentin takes Elmore Leonars novel Rum Punch and turns it into an amazingly cool film. Pam Grier is as foxy as she was in Foxy Brown and Samuel L. Jackson is a really good bad ass. Quentin gives this story is own spin with a great adaptation of the book and outstanding direction. Robert Forster gives a great performance as a bail bonds agent named Max Cherry. His performance actually surprised me considering he wasn't in much before this. The best actor in this film is by far Samuel L. Jackson, his character Ordell is perfect for him. I might even say that he is better in this than in Pulp Fiction. I think this movie is a great, foxy, cool mystery that deserves much more attention then it has received. I suggest this movie to all you Tarantino fans out there."
"GreenHammer","7","10","16","12 June 2005"," Good Movie, but is not praised with Tarantino's other work for a reason...
","After Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction you knew that this was going to be over-hyped and expectations far too high. Tarantino had a lot to live up to get this movie to compare with the other two, and although he fails, Jackie Brown is still an above average movie.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is Tarantino Light, and avoids much of the flash and violence of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. This isn't a bad thing because the movie decides to exchange flash and flair for character development. This wouldn't be a bad thing if anyone outside of the two main characters were very interesting. Jackie and Max are both well fleshed out real characters who the audience feels they get to know and care for.<br/><br/>Grier and Forster bring great skill to their performances of Jackie and Max and the rest of the cast is acceptable as well. The one possible exception is DeNiro (gasp!) although his character really has nothing to go with. That brings me to one of the films faults, it spends too much time with Samuel L Jackson, Robert DeNiro, and Bridget Fonda especially in the first half hour. There characters are one note, and not very funny even though they seem to be there mostly for comic relief. Jacksons character is interesting but his shtick tires on you after the first great scene with the women who love guns.<br/><br/>Tarantino's direction in the movie is quite good. Its easily the best thing in the movie. There is an interesting mix of trademark Tarantino shots, long takes, and some nice long shots and tracking shots. Unfortunately some of the shots seem to be more so for the sake of being ""cool"" than anything else.<br/><br/>Overall the film is an above average film, that seemed to get ripped apart because it was under extreme scrutiny. Overall this movie is about ***/****."

Y'know? Quentin Tarantino has made a lot of great films, and this one is right up there with his best. It has all of his trademarks - a fantastic cast, snappy dialogue, creative story-telling, excellent pace, a retro/cool soundtrack, and several ""big"" moments. It also has a nearly perfect level of discipline and restraint, which make it that much better. Love Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Robert Forster, and Bridget Fonda in this.

"lukem-52760","10","2","2","22 August 2019"," TARANTINO'S TRUE MASTERPIECE & ROBERT FORSTER IS OUTSTANDING!!!
","Jackie Brown is an absolutely BRILLIANT Crime Thriller, Tarantino created a gripping, intelligent, exciting, funny & totally entertaining piece of pulp cinema & my personal favourite Tarantino film, This crime Thriller is right up there with his other classic films ""Reservoir dogs"" & ""Pulp fiction"" the 90's were the best for Tarantino's genius.
The pairing of B-movie & low rent films of the past legends Pam Grier & Robert Forster is phenomenal, it's PERFECT casting so thank you mr. Tarantino for bringing back two of the underrated greats of past cinema, the whole movie relies on the romantic chemistry between ""Grier & Forster"" & it's completely perfect.
Just the nice scenes of these two veteran actors together sitting & having Coffee & chatting are such comforting scenes, the way Max looks at Jackie when he's at her apartment & she puts on some music, beautiful touching & natural character moments, Tarantino is a genius at this, just letting you hang out with the characters & become comfortable with them like you would with real friends, Tarantino gave us a real gift with JACKIE BROWN!!!!<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is a character piece as well as his true masterpiece, Tarantino has put interesting characters on screen & gets the viewer to hang out with them & it becomes a comfort seeing these great characters again each time you watch it & that's incredible.
From the amazing opening scene with the Awesome song playing ""Accross 110th street"" it's one of the Coolest films ever made, easily the best Tarantino film in my opinion!!!
Also the look & cinematography is gorgeous this is superb film making at it's best!!!!
The dark humour is hilarious & the dialogue is witty,smart,humorous & great.
Samuel l Jackson is fantastic & gives one of his best performances!!!
Robert Forster is truly Mesmerising on screen, easily one of the greatest performances in cinema history!!!
Jackie Brown has become my favourite Tarantino movie & that's mainly due to the incredible performance from ""ROBERT FORSTER"" & this movie introduced me to him & made me a fan of his & got me searching out his back catalogue of his movie career, Forster has such a great screen presence as an actor,
He is rugged world weary & full of heart but
he's got a sadness in his eyes & a rugged natural Coolness, he puts a depth into his characters, a seriousness that makes him so interesting to watch, he's truly one of the best actors in the history of Cinema in my opinion!!!
Max Cherry is one of my favourite movie characters ever, Max is the type of world weary-seen it all & survived it all kind of guy you would want as a friend, he's wise & smart & a good man.
Forster always gives a solid performance even if he has a small role in a Little B-movie, there's a richness to the veteran actor on screen that can't be matched!!!
Forster is the kind of blue collar ""working actor"" who turns up in lots of movie's, mainly B-movies & low rent Thrillers but is always very good no matter what small role he may have had, he's like the great ""Tom Atkins"" in that respect or even the excellent ""Robert Davi"" as each guy is a good solid character actor on screen & brings their own unique acting style & screen presence & that's why these guys have huge ""cult following"" later in their careers, the ""cult status"" is for cool dudes like these & ""Robert forster"" is easily one of the best out there!!!<br/><br/>""Brown"" is not a blood-soaked ultra violent film like ""Fiction"" or ""dogs"" it's a slower paced character driven drama-thriller with a beautiful heartwarming centre, that centre is the two ageing & lonely unlikely kind of couple in ""Jackie Brown"" & ""Max Cherry"", it's the heart of this crime caper.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown has definitely become a favourite of mine now (It's entered my all time top 20 films list) ""Brown"" grew on me the most as i used to like it & always loved pam & forster in it but i used to think this was Tarantino's most boring film, but hey i was only a teen then so i couldn't understand the richness of the characters & the excellent story telling until i was older & now it's my favourite of his movies!!!
I rediscovered the genius of ""Jackie Brown"" & fell in love with it.<br/><br/>The heart of this gripping crime Thriller is the sweet unsaid love story of Jackie Brown & Max Cherry, it unfolds beautifully & never fully blossoms but it's there.<br/><br/>The cast & performances are truly fantastic here in Jackie Brown, i mean we have the legendary Pam Grier, Robert De niro, Samuel l Jackson, Bridget Fonder, Michael Keaton & Robert forster!!!
This is a standout ensemble cast & Pam & forster give the greatest performances of both their careers!!!<br/><br/>Max Cherry (Forster) is my favourite character from the universe of Tarantino, i think ""roberts"" performance is one of the greatest in cinema history & he got a nomination!!!
I'm thankful for ""Tarantino"" introducing Robert forster & Pam Grier to me with this film, this film also resurrected Forsters career & got him the attention he deserves as a respected veteran actor.
Pam Grier is TRULY outstanding as ""Jackie Brown"" she gives the film a higher feel of quality & her BRILLIANT performance is mesmerising, she made an incredible lead along with ""Forster"" & it's the best I've ever seen her.<br/><br/>The music is beautiful throughout & the scenes are crafted with a special song thats specific to that moment, it's Tarantino's genius again at work.
Jacke Brown is a fantastic movie & is as good as pulp fiction & reservoir dogs & that's how great a filmmaker Tarantino is!!!
Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of all time.
Reservoir dogs 10/10
Pulp fiction 10/10
Jackie Brown 10/10
His 90's films are still the best, big Nostalgia for Tarantino & the 90s.
So sad to hear about the passing of one of my favourite actors ever ""Robert Forster"" R.I.P to one of the greats, an actor so full of passion & heart, the type of ""Real"" working man actor we don't see anymore, i will continue to see him everytime i watch his OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE as Max Cherry in ""Jackie Brown"""

But Jackie Brown has none of those things. If another director had made this movie then people would probably go on saying that it was good and it had a good story and so on. But Tarantino knows what he's all about (I'm sure) and he knows what his fans like, once again fast tempo and violence. Plus a great soundtrack. Making this movie wasn't so smart. But I hope he'll continue with the cool movie making, cause he really knows how, and that we will see more of his greatest movies in the future. Thumbs down for Jackie Brown, but thumbs up for the coolest dude on earth."

","From popular director Tarantino comes this overlong adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch"". It appears Tarantino has attempted to make the film as clever and as in-depth as the original material. Yet in trying to include so much, he has stretched this pic too far.<br/><br/>Far too much time is spent on characterisation (probably the entire first hour). The plot therefore, is neglected until it is too late for Tarantino to gain our interest. By the time he starts compiling the narrative, we have tuned out. Our director was too hung up on his amazing characters and what they had to say (a Tarantino weakness which served him well in ""Pulp Fiction""), and his introductions went on too long.<br/><br/>Tarantino fave Samuel L. Jackson is his usual enigmatic self, but is in serious danger of being typecast. Richard Forster's subtle performance is far more effective, and Pam Grier is solid. Good support from Robert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda.<br/><br/>The funky soundtrack helped, but Tarantino's over indulgence did not.

","(89%) If ever there was ever a movie that needs to been seen more than once, then this is it. Of all Quentin's films this has the keenest attention to character, as unlike a lot of movies that have hardly one dimension to the main role, this gives a past, a present, and a future to almost the entire line up, as this is as much Ordell's (Jackson) or Max's (Forster) movie as it is Jackie's (Grier). I can understand why there's a few people out there that don't really like this entry as after the tough and memorable ""Reservoir dogs"", and the brilliant vibrancy of ""Pulp fiction"" many movie goers were expecting yet more again, and what they got was a hugely talky, slower paced piece that didn't feel like it was getting anywhere soon. But this is something that grows on you the more you watch it, as I must have seen it about four times now and I pick up new things I hadn't even noticed because there's just so much to it. It really is something you can watch every 18-20 months on a cycle. Performance wise this is quite brilliant, nobody is making up the numbers, everyone is on top form, and even though Grier is known as an exploitation star she has always been a good actress, and here she is faultlessly natural. Of all Tarantino's movies, this is the one to buy and keep forever."

","Jackie Brown is a crowning stylistic achievement that merges the 90s crime film with the low-budget exploitation films of the 70s. That sounds like it could be the kind of kitsch that Tarantino's next couple of films would fall into, but here it works beautifully, and seems like a perfectly natural style to make a film in. It's old school without ever being old-fashioned.<br/><br/>The story is fairly complex, revolving around a money-exporting operation and the small fry that get caught up in it and then decide to go into business for themselves. Pam Grier is a likable heroine, and it's quite refreshing to see a middle-aged black woman in the starring role, but it's Robert Forster as her bail bondsman partner that really steals the show. He makes me want to watch a TV show about bailing people out of jail, which is something that never would have occurred to me before.<br/><br/>In the end, there isn't a lot of significance to this story or the way it's told: it's just a very well-done crime film with a fantastic cast, a knowing but not excessive sense of humour, and some charming music. Everything fits together more or less perfectly, and though it's almost 150 minutes it doesn't drag. Not a life-changer, but it can make for a very good afternoon."

You think that a movie that last for 150min. would be boring without action was wrong.

","Like other Quentin Tarantino films, Jackie Brown has more than its fair share of deadly violence. Although you may think that Pam Grier and Sam Jackson are the film's stars, this movie is all about Tarantino's angle of vision into worlds most of us know nothing about (and wouldn't care for if we did). It is clever, elevates criminals, laughs at the police and kills characters off at regular intervals. Unlike some of his later movies, Jackie Brown lags at times -- and some of its scenes (Pam Grier strolling and then running to make it to the flight gate on time) are overly lengthy. I suppose you'd have to say that Grier is the star of this film because the plot really does revolve around her but Sam Jackson outshines her (in my opinion)."

","This is one of the movies in my DVD collection that I haven't watched too many times but whenever I see it, I really enjoy it. It hasn't got the attention-grabbing scenes or famed dialogue of Tarantino's previous efforts, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but I rate this film at least as highly as I do his others. The plot's good and keeps you interested and it's refreshing to see a movie whose main characters are middle-aged and trying to come to terms with getting older. The cast is pretty much flawless - Jackson is as reliable as ever, De Niro turns in one of his best performances of the last ten years, Grier is really good in the title role and, based on his work here, I've no idea how Forster didn't become a much bigger star back in the 70s. The soundtrack, as you would expect from Tarantino, is spot-on too. What also struck me about the film is how accomplished the technical side of it is, particularly the camera-work and editing. The late 90s was a good time for adaptations of Elmore Leonard's novels, with Get Shorty and Out of Sight being released in that period as well. However, as much as I like those two movies, I think Jackie Brown might be the best of the bunch."

Ordell Robbie was the strongest character in my opinion because he was so versatile. He could be a stone-cold killer one minute, and a laughing, joking, funny guy the next.

","The Book Rum Punch by Elmore Lenoard was completely different than this movie. The best things Tarrantino did was switch the location from South Florida/Cayman Islands to L.A./Cabo and switch the lead character Jackie Burke from a blonde 40ish white woman to a 40ish black lady Jackie Brown. When you read the book its confusing why Lenoard made the lead character white because the story flow isn't that good. Tarrantino also removed a couple other sidelines from the book which all in all made the movie much better than the book. Pam Grier in a way brings elements of all her 1970s characters into Jackie which if you liked her early work you'll love this. Jackie in many ways is sort of like Foxy Brown over 40 and out of options but still with her brain. Ordell played by Samuel Jackson underestimates Jackie and it costs him big."
"movieguy1021","10","7","13","25 May 2004"," Jackie Brown: 8/10
","Expectations ruin movies. I was talking to my brother about Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to Pulp Fiction. He said the movie ""bombed"" because people didn't think it was as good as Pulp Fiction and made less money. Although many were disappointed that it didn't rise to Pulp-like statue, and that it didn't make as much money as it (less than 20%), but does that automatically make Jackie Brown a terrible movie? No. On the contrary, it's a nice departure from the frenzied pace of Pulp, and shows Tarantino's growth in this medium.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight attendant at a small airline. She works in transferring money via the airline, but soon she is caught. In order to reduce, or eliminate her sentence, she helps the police get Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), an arms dealer, put away. However, with the help of bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), she starts to play both sides like a modern-day Yojimbo. Plus, Robert De Niro using a large bong!<br/><br/>Tarantino takes a breather between Pulp and the Kill Bill movies here with a (for the most part) nonviolent drama. It's slow, but it's refreshing. In the age of quick cuts and techno music that's overused, it's good to see a film like this. The pace is slow, sometimes too slow for its own good, but it never gets boring or tedious. The movie does have a few stylish flairs, but it looks low budget, and feels low budget. This movie seems normal-none of the wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am dialogue that made Pulp so famous. There's almost no memorable dialogue in Jackie Brown, but does that mean that it's a terrible movie? According to many people, yes. In my opinion, no.<br/><br/>The thing is, although Jackie is about 20 minutes too long, it's entertaining throughout. The script, based on Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch, keeps our interests throughout, mainly because of Pam Grier. Her endearing work makes the movie worth watching. Her no-holds-barred attitude in the movie makes it continually interesting. Jackson puts in an average show-nothing can top Jules Winnfield. De Niro looks like he's doing a favor for a friend-or Tarantino just wanted him in the movie. But chronically stoned Melanie (Bridget Fonda) put in a good job. The acting's not as good as previous Tarantinos, but for the most part, it's good.<br/><br/>So, let me sum up everything I've said. Jackie Brown is an entertaining, long (by about 20 minutes), and enjoyable movie. See it.<br/><br/>My rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Rated R for strong language, some violence, drug use and sexuality."
"spmact","6","6","11","27 May 2019"," I was mislead by all the glowing reviews here
","This is the only Tarantino movie I hadn't seen because I hadn't heard much about it, so I thought I should remedy that. I liked every other one, except Death Proof, so I thought there was a good chance I'd like this too, especially after seeing all the glowing reviews on IMDB.
I don't need lots of blood and violence to enjoy a movie, but good writing, editing and tension have always been a Tarantino mainstay that I've enjoyed. Sadly, this didn't seem to have any of those. It's also way too long, at 2.5 hours. It should have been a 1.5hr movie. There's so much unnecessary filler that goes nowhere, which Tarantino calls ""hang out"" scenes. I could have used much less of them.
Instead of dragging things on like the movie did, I'll just list my pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros:
-Pam Grier, Samuel L Jackson and Robert Forster are great in this
-Nice soundtrack<br/><br/>Cons:
-Drags on a lot with a lot of dialogue scenes that seem interesting at first but ultimately made me tired of all the slow pacing
-De Niro was wasted on this. His character wasn't interesting at all
-Story was OK but not really that compelling<br/><br/>If you like the ""typical"" Tarantino movie, don't come in expecting the same quality. If you want something different than his other movies and don't mind slow pacing, you might enjoy this."
"Roly_Savage","6","6","11","15 October 2003"," not as good as other tarrantio's
","It was always going to be a hard act to follow classics like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and unfortunately Jackie Brown doesn't deliver to the standards set be Tarantinos previous efforts.  Whilst this is an enjoyable, whilst slow paced movie, it doesn't hit the viewer on the same level and actually left me slightly disappointed.  This does not, however, mean that you shouldn't see this film, whether you are a Tarantino fan or not.  It may be better viewed if you are not an enthusiastic fan of the director.<br/><br/>
Based on Elmore Leonards novel Rum Punch, the movie strays away from the book, so much as changing the colour of the lead to black.  Pam Grier does a good job of playing the forty something caught up in money laundering and Samuel L Jackson delivers a great performance as Ordell, but the film unfortunately fails to grip the audience, and unlike Pulp and Dogs, this is not a film you will want to watch over and over again.<br/><br/>BEST ACTOR: SAM JACKSON is funny, witty and truly scary as Ordell.  BEST ACTRESS:  PAM GRIER was perfectly cast as Jackie and fits in perfectly. BEST SCENE:  The three different views of the money exchange is one of Tarantinos best set pieces.  BEST QUOTE: 'Wanna F&$k?', from Bridget Fonda is very sexy.<br/><br/>OVERALL: 7/10"

","In Tarantino's screenplay for ""True Romance"" the main character, Clarance says: ""Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those a**holes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books."" Unsurprisingly, that line didn't make it into Tony Scott's movie. About five years ago I tried to read the book that Tarantino turned into Jackie Brown, but lost the will to finish it. And I don't think I would have lasted the 2.5 hours of the movie if I hadn't kept telling myself that it was made by the Emperor of all things post-modern.<br/><br/>The problem is this: it's Tarantino without the gimmicks, without the shocks, without the over-cool sense of style. And if you take away all that, there ain't too much left. His comic-book characters just don't stand up to prelonged bouts of soul searching realism. I just got plain bored listening to a bunch of low-lives waffle on about themselves. If this is the way Tarantino sees himself going, he's just gonna end up as a poor-man's Scorcese.<br/><br/>The danger always was that Tarantino would start to take himself seriously after Pulp Fiction. He's tried to show us that beneath the funny guy, there's a real talent trying to get out - but I'm afraid it turned out to be just a nurd all the time."

Pam Grier may be the worst actress I have ever had the displeasure of watching. Quentin Tarintino is an amazing writer/director, unfortunately this is by far the worst movie he has made.

"son_of_cheese_messiah","4","6","12","5 July 2010"," Jackie Boring
","The primary reason to watch this is to see Pam Grier as an unapologetically normal looking middle aged woman who is still sexy. Also the soundtrack is very cool and worth seeking out.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Tarantino's cinematic fingerprints are very much in evidence, although used to very little effect. We get a foretaste of this at the start when Samuel L Jackson, as gun-runner Ordell Robbie, delivers a characteristically Tarantinoesque rambling monologue replete with obscenities and copious use of the N-word. Nothing we have not heard before with greater urgency in films like Pulp Fiction. This opening section, however, has good potential, in particular when Ordell bails a friend out of jail only to mysteriously kill him. The suspense is immediately dissipated in meandering scenes that go nowhere. We have to wait over an hour, an hour filled with more Tarantino long-winded speeches, before anything interesting happens again.<br/><br/>The plot is far too slender to withstand the weight and pretentiousness that Tarantino places upon it. When the switch comes, about 2 hours in, it is shot with the director's usual aplomb, from 3 different points of view. Fair enough (and this is the high point of the film aesthetically) but the actual plotting at this point is poor. We are to believe that a) the feds will allow their mark to into a changing room without keeping any sort of tabs on her. b) that the bondsman, who is known to the villains, will be in plain sight. This may be due to the source material which I've never read, but in the film it comes across as being contrived.<br/><br/>Yet more meandering sequences bring us to the finale which is very anti-climactic. And after that, a long ending sequence. I was watching it with a friend and he bailed out after 1 and a half hours. I felt like doing the same."
"JohnSeal","4","6","12","22 June 2005"," Typical Tarantino
","One day, Quentin Tarantino may learn that it simply isn't enough to consistently, repetitively, and egregiously recreate classic scenes from better films in order to pad his resume. That day's a long way off, though, and at least Jackie Brown avoids the stylistic overkill of Pulp Fiction. It also helps to have Pam Grier in its lead role--though Grier was never a good actress, she has matured admirably and holds her own throughout this bloated tribute to the black action genre. The film looks good, but of course is burdened by QT's typically horrendous, wise-cracking screenplay, written, pretentiously, 'for the screen', according to the end credits. And here's a question I'd like to see addressed: why is it Quentin feels the need to use the 'n' word over and over and over and over again in the first reel, but then drops it like a hot potato for the balance of the film? If Tarantino were a true 'wigga' he'd shamelessly promote this pejorative for the film's full 154 minute running time: instead it disappears and its mysterious and sudden absence leaves one with the distinct impression that the Weinsteins decided enough was enough after the first three dozen reiterations. I'm one person who never bought into the theory that the word was appropriate under ANY circumstances, and it's certainly offensive to have a hyperactive, naughty cinema schoolboy like QT use it the way he uses it: with reckless and careless abandon.<br/><br/>Other points of interest: Jackie Brown takes Martin Scorsese's reliance on pop music to the extreme, but of course QT lacks the subtle touch of prime Scorsese and slathers on too much too often. The film lacks an original score and, unsurprisingly, repackages cool old songs as hip accoutrements for Tarantino to pin onto his retro chic bowling shirt. That's obvious from scene 1, as Bobby Womack's sublime Across 110th Street is appropriated as Jackie Brown's theme song. It is, however, a treat to see Sid Haig in a straight role as a judge. Overall, though, I'm shocked that so many IMDb reviews imply that this lazy piece of film-making is somehow 'underrated' when it's racked up a plus 7 score from IMDb voters. Hopefully my '4' will help bring a tiny sliver of balance to the force."

It seems so authentic and rightly so, the actors and actresses and the good writing in it make it just the right amount of intensiveness and also builds the characters, Max Cherry who was nominated for Grammy for this is a great example. When he buys a copy of the Delfonics you knew he was in love. How Jackie Brown plays everyone her realism and occasional Mother F Word Please made you so amazed by her. The plot twist at the end is perfect and Ordell Robbie is one of my favorite Samuel L Jackson Characters!

","Taken out of Tarantino context, this film is, well....excellent. Tarantino has grown up. He has cut back on his espresso and made a much more even paced, mainstream (realistic) movie. Unfortunately this maturity hasn't boded well with some of his hyped up fan base. Since Jackie Brown doesn't reflect his previous frantic, disjointed style, it hasn't done as well as expected, or hyped. And that is too bad! The characters in this movie have much more depth than say a Vincent Vega or a Larry Dimmick. They are portrayed excellently by the cast. I had little regard for Pam Grier or Robert Forster before this movie. I now highly respect both of these individuals as actors, and anticipate watching all of their subsequent films. Quite a few critics have panned this movie as being too slow and or missing the mark. I agree with the slow part, but that is not all bad. Certainly, when you compare a Ferrari (Pulp Fiction) to a Rolls Royce (Jackie Brown) you will have some critical words regarding speed. However, that should not take away from the Rolls.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is a great movie. Yes, I said great. The soundtrack is right on. Sam Jackson does an excellent job portraying Ordell Robbie, a totally different character from Jules Winnfield. He is very convincing as a dumb, small times arms dealer wannabe. Forster is excellent (his AA nomination was a testament), and what can I say about Pam Grier! I love that lady after this movie. <br/><br/>I highly recommend Jackie Brown to anyone.

They are good all and eccentric in a way but they are not really memorable. Especially the main character Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is disappointing. She isn't really strong enough as a character to carry this entire movie. Real main character of the movie to me was Samuel L. Jackson but why oh why did you had to wear that odd looking pony-tail Sam? Character that I truly liked was Robert De Niro's. He plays a sort of loser role like you wouldn't expect from him in a movie like this. The rest of the character aren't really strong or interesting enough to carry this entire movie.<br/><br/>Really strongest element of the movie is the brilliantly written script that once again is filled with some typical Tarantino elements and twists. Yes, the ending might had been a bit weak and perhaps disappointing but no it did not ruined the movie for me. I still enjoyed this movie, it just wasn't as good as I had hoped for. It was kind of like the movie ""Out of Sight"" by Steven Soderbergh which has a kind of similar build-up-style and story, it comes very close at times but it never quite takes the cake.<br/><br/>Still a perfectly watchable, mostly fun movie but still you're better of watching Tarantino's other work.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

Perhaps he did way too much coke before doing this? I dunno. He had some good ideas, but he just couldn't deliver. There was one scene that worked for me. The exchange between Samuel Jackson and Chris Tucker. That was nice. It had some edgy realism that took you to another level. Some pure American street jive that portrayed hoods or gangsters, showing the gritty underbelly of America. And if Tarantino went that harsh realistic route it may have been a good movie; an interesting departure for Tarantino. But unfortunately after that scene it simply fell apart. He tried to do too much. The worst scene was the one in the mall where you had three different takes on one scene. A complete waste of time because it was a useless scene to begin with. If that isn't self gratuitous I don't know what is. And DeNiro. Man was he embarrassing! I don't think that was his fault. What the hell kind of character was that?? For such an accomplished actor too. On the other hand you give Pam Grier the lead? Bad choice QT. <br/><br/>Oh well, you can forgive Tarantino for this one. Every director has a stink bomb. And considering he has done 'Resevoir Dogs', 'Pulp Fiction', 'Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2', and wrote 'Natural Born Killers' and 'True Romance' (all brilliant films), he has plenty of room to mess up."

","Initially I was thinking the movie was realistically slow (too slow for today's criteria which I personally like), then the plot seemed that it was not leading anywhere (boredom at maximum). Then at some point, the movie was starting to become a bit more ""interesting"", slowly, up to the end.<br/><br/>After I saw the movie I was thinking: Now what's the point to see some bad guys-losers who kill each other, because they are either afraid or frustrated? Is it worth 2 1/2 hours of my life to watch them?<br/><br/>This movie is promoting violence in a sneaky way: It makes you like a character which seems good, then he commits a crime, just because he is a bit afraid or frustrated!<br/><br/>And what's that all about ""Jackie Brown"", the title of the movie and the over-promotion of the character like she was some sort of national or local hero or diva? That was at least naive and bad from a cinematic perspective and from an ethics perspective too.<br/><br/>Conclusion: No, it doesn't worth 2 1/2 hours from my and your life.

Well, you get neither.<br/><br/>The directing isn't bad and acting is OK, but nothing great here. This is not one of those films that you play on DVD over and over again just to replay some cool scenes. There is no sense to make this kind of little above average ""realistic"" dramas if your name is Quentin Tarantino. The man has a very special talent for creating pulp stories with pulp characters. Tarantino should be proud of that and stick with his talents.<br/><br/>Same goes for Kill Bill. Great Tarantino flicks(Reservoir, Pulp + Romance) are not about action, not about drama, they are all about cool characters with cool dialogue. Jackie Brown is not a great Tarantino film - it's not even a great genre film. Just an above average crime drama.

","""AK-47: when you absolutely, positively gotta kill every mutha**ckah in the room- accept no substitutes!"" Hearing the distinct pitch to Samuel L. Jackson's voice with that as one of the first and most memorable lines got me hooked into this film. However, it isn't the standard Tarantino-istic roller-coaster ride filled with ultra-bloody, sexist (to some degree like 'Reservoir Dogs'), and hip elements as his previous ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" had. This one feels different as if one of his buddies directed this instead and he took all the credit (which wouldn't surprise me either). For one thing, it is very slow-paced in storytelling in seventies traditional style. Even the title in the opening sequence has a Roger Corman-feel to it, but the film never seems to get over second gear. The acting and dialogue are commendable, and because of that, we seem to watch and empathize with fleshed-out, human characters. Each character seems to inhibit their own syntex (way and manner of speaking) from Jackie to Ordell, Louis to Melanie, Max and Winston, etc.<br/><br/>I was so excited to see this film in late 1997 (but of course, my date wanted to see ""Titanic"" instead), but then heard a few weeks later that it wasn't really that good. So I missed it in the theaters and saw it on anti-climactic video, but I'm glad I did. The film seems to be overpraised at times-- being that it was a fair film, but it wasn't all that good! Now that QT's delivered us with crap like ""Kill Bill 1&2"" (highly overrated to the point being where it's unsettling that your 60-year-old mother-in-law likes it and you don't), this movie seems to mystify me. Like the moments before the storm. I caught it again on IFC last night and I watched about 2/3 of it, secretly I was hoping that there would be something that I missed that would fit nicely in the end. Didn't happen, though. But when Samuel was yelling at DeNiro for blasting Bridget Fonda, I was suddenly interested again. The heist was good, but once again, the pacing kept this film back from being any better.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that Q.T. has shown a different style of film-making in him which I never thought existed. There's finally some degree of maturity in him, where I thought he would be a forever Generation X hack that would only be capable of conjuring movies like ""True Romance"" or what have you. This was once marqueed as a late show on Saturday nights for a while after it's release once upon a time. I wouldn't stay up after midnight on a Saturday to watch this-- more appropriate to view on a Wednesday afternoon double-feature (like what they used to do back in the seventies)."

"seymourblack-1","8","4","8","29 November 2017"," Slick, Witty & Highly Entertaining
","It's slick, witty and highly entertaining, but this money-spinning crime thriller's greatest asset is its colourful characters who, between them, take the art of deception to extraordinary heights. The plot inevitably gets convoluted by all its double-crosses, schemes and scams and the dialogue is wonderfully sharp and realistic. There's also a great deal of dark humour to enjoy and of course, the top class performances provided by the movie's exceptional cast.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is a flight attendant who works for a Mexican airline and tops up her modest income by smuggling cash into the United States for L.A. gun dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L Jackson). Her luck runs out one day when she gets arrested by ATF Agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and LAPD Detective Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) who had been tipped off about her activities by another of Ordell's couriers called Beaumont Livingstone (Chris Tucker). After being arrested, Beaumont had provided information to avoid doing time in prison but later, after being bailed out by Ordell, was shot and killed by his old boss. When Ordell arranges bail for Jackie, her prospects suddenly don't look too good.<br/><br/>Max Cherry (Robert Forster) is the bail bondsman that Ordell had used to arrange the releases of both Beaumont and Jackie and when he meets Jackie, he instantly falls in love with her. When Ordell comes around to Jackie's place with the intention of killing her, she talks him out of it by suggesting a plan which would enable her to bring back from Mexico, all the money that he'd stashed away ($500,000) during his gun-dealing career. Ordell agrees to Jackie's plan and devises a way in which she could pass the money to his young mistress, Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda). She then goes ahead and makes a deal with Nicolette which would enable him to arrest Ordell and recover the $500,000.<br/><br/>Jackie tells Max about her plan to con both Ordell and the cops so that she can make off with the money and he readily agrees to help. Everyone involved then knows that in order to achieve the outcomes that they want, the elaborate plan devised to transfer the money to Melanie will need to be carried out perfectly.<br/><br/>Pam Grier is believable as the 44-year-old who, through having a criminal record, had been reduced to working for a third-rate airline and being very poorly paid. She conveys Jackie's combination of toughness and vulnerability really well and is a compelling presence throughout the entire movie. Samuel L Jackson is superb as the ruthless gun dealer and Robert Forster, in his Oscar Nominated performance, makes the bail bondsman a surprisingly sympathetic character. Bridget Fonda and Robert De Niro also do well in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino, whose screenplay is based on Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch"", directs the whole movie with some style and particularly excels during the sequence in which Ordell's money goes through the various exchanges needed in order for it to eventually be collected by Melanie. The soundtrack is also marvellous both because of the quality of the music and also the way in which it evokes the 1970s so well."

That said, it still retains many of his unique writing and directing features that have created such a large fanbase over the years.
All in all, a concrete and coherent story of mischief, crafty schemes, punchy dialogue and well-delivered closure, Jackie Brown has rightfully achieved classic status and its many virtues keep it entirely watchable, more than 20 years after its initial release."
"Screen_Blitz","5","2","3","23 May 2016"," Light and weaker than Quentin Tarantino's other works
","When many hear the name Quentin Tarantino, odds are they are thinking of something of a masterpiece or at least something close to such. It's very difficult to deny this director has a God-given talent in filmmaking and storytelling, and the accolades he's achieved in his past twenty years of his career. This is not to say he's immune to some duds. Though his director has not yet been subject to any cinematic failures, a few of his works have proved to be less memorable and more shallow than others. Jackie Brown, a film following the success of the highly acclaimed masterpiece 'Pulp Fiction', feels less of Tarantino's style and much less excitement than his other works. Pam Grier plays the titular character, a middle-aged flight attendant who's tasked by arms dealer Ordell Robbie (played by Samuel L. Jackson) to smuggle $10,000,000 from Mexico to Los Angeles. When she's unexpectedly caught and arrested by two FBI agents (played by Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen) in attempt to smuggle a million dollars worth of cocaine in her purse, she is sentenced to prison but is ultimately released when she makes a deal with the agents to capture and arrest Ordell. Upon learning of Ordell's sinister plot, Jackie acquires the help of business fund manager Max Cherry (played by Robert Forster) to steal $1,000,000 from Ordell.<br/><br/>Quentin Tarantino follows relatively the same style of filmmaking similar to his other works including the non-linear storytelling and interconnected story lines but manages to cut back on the over-the-top graphic violence that he's often known for, watering it down what feels like PG level in comparison. The film offers a plot that pays homages to 70s blaxploitation flicks. While there is plenty of substance to be experienced, the plot supplements little excitement and conveys at an unnecessarily slow pace, clocking at a 152 runtime that feels more like three hours. Without any sort of suspense or thrills to offer, the plot conceives a rather lack of tension. Quentin Tarantino is known for generating some of the most clever stories on film, particularly what we brought to 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. Unfortunately, much of the excitement conceived in those films is abandoned here. Luckily, there are a few twists and surprises sprinkled throughout that at least present some redeeming quality. The aspect in which the film greatly succeeds however, is building up strong character development along with some talented acting from an above-average cast. Pam Grief shows off an convince vibe as Jackie Brown. It may stand inside the Oscar range but there's no denying her performance shines. Samuel L. Jackson, returning to the Tarantino fare from 'Pulp Fiction' is good as ever, adopting his typical boldface personality. Robert Forster also comes off as impressive with his performance. The biggest disappointment though, is Robert De Niro who plays Samuel L. Jackson's sidekick and is decidedly underused for what could have been a compelling role for an actor like him.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown doesn't quite scale the ladder like Quentin Tarantino's other films but there is some smarts to be experienced in what is a worthy effort by Tarantino, even if it doesn't succeed at a narrative scale. Those who are Tarantino fans are recommended to watch this, everyone else though will most likely to left with a shortage of entertainment."

","Jackie Brown (1997): Dir: Quentin Tarantino / Cast: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda: Quentin Tarantino's much awaited followup to Pulp Fiction. Pam Grier plays an airline stewardess caught with cash and narcotics. Robert Forster plays the bail bonds person who bails her out. Samuel L. Jackson sells weapons and put up the cash to bail her out so to eliminate her. She is forced to cooperate with police as well as survive against the sadistic nature of Jackson. One flaw is its finding humour in death, such as a sudden shooting scene in a parking lot. The solution seems to be death or corruption and it sometimes unfavorably distracts but perhaps there is no choice. Combines dark humour and violence but is also clever with wonderful dialogue and a conclusion that places Grier in a tight situation. Quentin Tarantino has fun with a bag switch sequences shown from many perspectives. Grier is all attitude and brains yet always recognizing the consequences that linger. Jackson delivers a gritty performance while Forster brings sincerity and bluntness while also falling for his client. Robert De Niro plays Jackson's sleazy sidekick whose intellect is tested to negative effect. Bridget Fonda is amusing as a dope smoking beach bunny residing with Jackson. Crime caper about trust and survival and playing one factor off of another. Score: 9 / 10"
"staven600","10","2","3","31 January 2016"," Effortlessly entertaining
","It's been a while since I first watched this film, back in the days of my adolescent Tarantino obsession which had watching Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs every second day. I saw Jackie Brown around that time, and loved it back then too, although it wasn't as striking as Pulp Fiction I really sank into it. Watching it again recently I remember why - it's one of the most chill films ever; a crime comedy that doesn't go for drama or or spectacular set pieces, set mostly in bars and apartments, with a brilliant seventies funk and soul soundtrack, comprised almost entirely of conversation that's great to listen to in that Tarantino-esque way while also continually feeding the story and character development, which all centres around money exchange with multiple players looking for a slice of the pie, from Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson, brilliantly paranoid), an arms dealer who enjoys his shaky persona as a slick, smooth criminal too much, to titular character Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) who wants to get out of working for him and live life before getting old, to her bail bondsman turned lover Max Cherry (Robert Forster) who also feels himself getting on in years, to ambitious cop Ray (Michael Keaton) who wants to put Ordell away, and finally Louis (Robert De Niro), a broken down loser just out of jail who schemes with Ordell's stoner girlfriend Melanie (Bridget Fonda) to steal the money for themselves. <br/><br/>A simple story but it's the characters that make it, and they're all likable in their own ways, all funny or interesting, all with great scenes. Tarantino's trademark stylisation is at it's most chill, and it works, it all feels very laid back. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments and quietly funny moments that have to be seen, bolstered by the subtle performances. It all adds up to one of the most entertaining crime films ever."
"bh_tafe3","8","2","3","27 January 2016"," Elmore Leonard meets blaxploitation
","I'll start with a confession. When I first saw this movie I was 16 years old, I had no idea about Foxy Brown and the only film I'd ever seen Pam Grier in was Escape from LA, where she played a trans-gender character. The names on the marquee I was interested in were Quentin Tarantino, Michael Keaton and Samuel L Jackson. That's what brought me here. Elmore Leonard I knew as the writer of Get Shorty, but he was hardly a name I was looking to follow around, unthinkable in hindsight given that he was the author who wrote the Pulpy novels that three of the best flicks of the 90s (this, Get Shorty and Out of Sight) were based on, but I was 16 and there was no smart phones with google apps on them to find this stuff out. We didn't even have DVD special features to learn this kind of stuff kids. Hell, we didn't really have DVDs in any meaningful way, so give me a break to start with, OK? <br/><br/>In a lot of ways this is my favourite Tarantino film to watch, not because it's his best, but because it's the one that seems the least like a Tarantino film. The story, not just the characters, are given time and room to flow and there's a certain feel to this film and the performances given by the main cast that is tangibly different to any other work he has done before or since. Jackie Brown seems to be a lot more similar to Get Shorty and Out of Sight stylistically than it does Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. It's fascinating to see a Director like Tarantino adapt someone else's work and make a high quality film.<br/><br/>Pam Grier stars as the Jackie Brown of the title (a superb performance that carries the entire film), a flight attendant for a South American airline smuggling money into the country for gun runner Ordell Robbie (Samuel L Jackson). Unfortunately for Jackie, another one of Ordell's smugglers Beaumont Livingstone (Chris Tucker before Rush Hour) gets arrested and rats her out. For his sins, Beaumont is executed by Ordell. Jackie is then arrested at the airport by Ray Nicolette, (Michael Keaton), who I assume is an FBI agent due to a funny cameo Keaton makes as the same character in Out of Sight, and Detective Mark Dugas (Michael Bowen), who want her to wear a wire and help them get Ordell. Aided by bail bondsman Max Sherry (Robert Forster, superb, Oscar nominated) Jackie hatches a plan they might just get her out of this alive while Ordell has some funny scenes with his stoner associate Louis Gara (Robert de Niro in a pitch perfect stoner haze) and equally stoner girlfriend Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda). It all comes together into a satisfying final act with Jackie outsmarting the lot of them.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown doesn't try too hard to emulate Tarantino's earlier successes, but he does still play to his strengths, eliciting strong performances from a stellar cast. Grier and Forster were never this good again, while Fonda has rarely been this fun to watch ever. De Niro and Keaton effortlessly capture their roles, while Jackson's nuanced, sometimes menacing, performance is one of the triumphs of the film. He's said since that this was his favourite role in a Tarantino film, and it's easy to see why. <br/><br/>Well, there you have it. I've always enjoyed this film for its story, its strong performances and just its whole feel. Its a great companion piece for the equally excellent Out of Sight and another reminder of just how good it was to be a film fan in the mid-late 90s."
"RNMorton","9","2","3","1 October 2015"," Pure Quentin
","Well, I guess actually with a good dose of Elmore thrown in. This is my favorite Quentin movie (of the ones I've seen) and in some ways it seems his most deliberately ""mainstream"" type film, almost cheesy at points. Pulp Fiction is a little too bizarre for even me, I loved moments of Grindhouse and Bastards but the whole didn't work as well. Pam Grier is the stewardess mule for evil gun runner Jackson, she gets stopped by goofy fed agent Keaton and needs the services of bail bondsman Forster. Add De Niro as a recently sprung con and Fonda as Samuel's ""secretary"" and you have a lot of talent to work with. Grier is appropriately tough, and the scene with De Niro and Fonda in the parking lot is hysterical in its own sick way. But I think the movie is stolen by Forster, who gives an Oscar caliber performance as the deadpan, stoic Max Cherry. This film is worth watching for his performance alone."
"blakiepeterson","10","2","3","29 July 2015"," An Absolutely Brilliant Character Piece
","Look at Jackie Brown talk. Look at they way she's the fuel behind the conversation, a driving force one intellectual level above her verbal opponent. How, when in trouble, she doesn't collapse under pressure — instead, she, cigarette in hand, talks from the side of her mouth with striking sass, at once condescending and commanding. How she can merely lift an eyebrow in sly disdain and scare the sh-t out of the person sitting across from her. She's tough. She's smart. She's sexy. She's  Jackie Brown.<br/><br/>To most, Pam Grier is an action heroine, a Coffy, a Foxy Brown, or a Friday Foster; she's the Queen of Blaxploitation — hell, she is the blaxploitation movie. But she's a cult favorite, a black Angelina Jolie of an era forgotten by most. And after the subgenre ended in the late 1970s, things changed for the leading lady. Most movie executives had no idea what to do with her (too resilient to be tossed aside as a meager love interest, too arousing to convince as a matronly, sexless authority figure), so she spent the majority of the '80s and '90s philandering around in thankless supporting roles that could hardly capture her brassy appeal. <br/><br/>So Hallelujah Quentin Tarantino noticed her past highs while working as a video store clerk before he became the boy wonder of the independent movie: giving her the role of a lifetime, ""Jackie Brown"" is the movie Pam Grier was born to star in. Not cheap, not badly written, not supported by a bundle of terrible actors, not hastily directed, she no longer is the best thing in a bad movie (a characteristic most of her best films kept in their chest pocket for everyone to see); she's the best thing in a great movie, and by 1997, it was about time.<br/><br/>In ""Jackie Brown"", Grier is as badass as Coffy ever was, but she's also quite a bit wiser, a tough cookie all grown up. Jackie is 44-years-old, a stewardess for the worst airline in America, and makes a disappointing salary of $16,000 a year. She's had trouble with the law before, but in her middle-age she's become much more methodical about her criminal actions, preferring to keep things low-key enough to keep herself happy and the cops oblivious. Currently, she acts as a smuggler for Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), a corrupted arms dealer so closely monitored by the ATF that he's forced to work with an odd assortment of runners for the sake of keeping business afloat.<br/><br/>Things turn sour one day when, en route to work, Jackie is stopped by a couple of ATF agents, who find Ordell's dirty money and a few ounces of hard drugs in her handbag. She spends the next few days is prison, eventually finding bail through Max Cherry (Robert Forster), a worn-out bondsman. Following her release, the ATF presents her with two options: she can either (1) avoid jail time and direct them to one of Ordell's schemes by acting as a courier once again or (2) go directly back to her jail cell and forget that they ever offered her such a deal. The scrappy Jackie chooses option one, but she's never been one satisfied working alongside the law or following the orders of a street smart but academically winded guns dealer. So she comes up with her own plan: double-cross both parties (telling the heat she's going to betray Ordell,, telling Ordell she's going to betray the heat), run away with $500,000, and buy a one-way ticket to Spain and start life anew, with lavishness.<br/><br/>Whereas all of Tarantino's films deal with violence as part of the aesthetic, ""Jackie Brown"" trades pulp fervor for insanely sharp exchanges of dialogue, the only carnage occurring offscreen while the characters size each other up and entertain us with their canny games of one-oneupmanship. Much of his mainstream success depends on the ruthlessly funny intrigue of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill"", but look closely — while not so tongue-in-cheek, the cunning ""Jackie Brown"" quite possibly delivers his finest screenplay, so endlessly amusing that there are a number of moments that call for near inescapable applause. The climactic money exchange, conceived in the same style as 1956's ""The Killing"", is so ingeniously drawn that I found myself laughing in delight, not because so much of it's humorous (which a lot of it is), but in disbelief. Call Tarantino an idiot savant of the cinema all you want — but he's brilliant.<br/><br/>Equally brilliant is the accomplished cast — with no obvious supporting characters, the performers are of equivalent importance in pushing the lustrous plot forward. Grier is a sensation as the titular character, a victorious combination of sexy and too da-n tired; Jackson is as threatening as he is inexplicably winsome. Forster provides an amiable straight man who loves Jackie too much for his own good, De Niro is lucrative as Ordell's dim-witted, raging partner-in-crime, and Bridget Fonda, who gives the most uproarious supporting performance (in a movie of unlimited uproarious supporting performances), is hilarious as Ordell's pot-smoking, surfer-girl mistress.<br/><br/>It's less grandiose than Tarantino's other movies, but ""Jackie Brown"" is a masterpiece nonetheless, with a screenplay dressed to kill and a leading lady ready to smack all the Julianne Moores and Sandra Bullocks out of the picture and provide a leading lady to be reckoned with. If you're as smitten with the film as I am, you'll know what I mean when I say I never wanted it to end."
"Leofwine_draca","7","2","3","4 March 2011"," The forgotten one
","Out of all the films in Tarantino's career as director, JACKIE BROWN is the one people are least likely to have seen. This may be because it's the director's most subtle and relaxed movie, and also the only one in which the material he directs isn't his own; instead this is an adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel. This doesn't mean it's at all bad, and in actual fact it's entertaining to watch Tarantino try something different for a change.<br/><br/>Of course, his trademarks are still apparent for the fans. The dialogue is as zippy and frenetic as ever, and the characters the usual bunch of double-crossing low-lifes you'd expect to see in RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION. There's a huge set-piece late on in which takes place in a shopping mall that manages to be just as entertaining as the chop-em-up showdown of KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 even if the on-screen events are more laid back.<br/><br/>As with every other Tarantino movie I've seen (all of 'em, with the exception of DEATH PROOF), the cast is remarkable for its breadth and daring. Once again, Tarantino isn't afraid to pick forgotten or non A-list types as central characters. When he incorporates A-listers, like De Niro here, he does an about turn and casts them against type. It pays off. De Niro is hilarious as a no-good hoodlum and seems to be loving the chance to play something other than a slick mob boss.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, we get cult favourite Robert Forster (ALLIGATOR) who gives what I think is his best ever performance; Michael Keaton, playing a pretty weird/wired cop; Bridget Fonda as a stoner; Chris Tucker, not annoying for once; Samuel L. Jackson as a cold-blooded, almost reptilian character and, of course, Pam Grier. While I appreciate Grier's iconic status - I've seen a fair few of the '70s flicks that made her famous - I don't think she's quite the actress that Tarantino hoped for when casting her, but she's adequate at least. Add in a Sid Haig cameo and there you have it: a typically offbeat, original and enjoyable Tarantino outing with a cast to die for."
"tieman64","Null","2","3","9 December 2009"," Smooth Criminal
","Based on an Elmore Leonard novel, Quintin Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"" stars Pam Grier as a sassy flight attendant who attempts to evade both criminals and the law. The film was released in 1997, two years after another Leonard adaptation (""Get Shorty""). <br/><br/>Though it was brushed aside in 1997, ""Brown's"" reputation has grown over the years, thanks largely to the way it avoids Tarantino's more annoying tendencies. The film lacks the rapid-fire dialogue, narrative gymnastics and bloody violence of Tarantino's previous two films, and is generally more sedate and easy going. The film's also far less cartoonish than Tarantino's other flicks, perhaps thanks to its central characters, played by Robert Forster and Pam Grier. They're a charming couple, both in their late 40s or early 50s, and lend the film a certain gravitas. They also strike up an interesting relationship which, though it never quite turns romantic, sizzles nevertheless.<br/><br/>Restraint, then, separates ""Jackie Brown"" from Tarantino's other pictures. The director gives his characters room to breath, fills his film with quieter moments, deaths and murders aren't taken as lightly as is usual, his characters aren't as self-consciously hip and Grier and Forster exude a kind of world-weary disillusionment, both quieter and wiser than the motormouths typical of Tarantino-land. Indeed, one can easily imagine a Humphrey Bogart or a late career Robert Mitchum in the film's Robert Forster role.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, there are a lot of ""homages"" here. Tarantino inserts nods to ""Black Mamma White Mamma"", ""Vampyros Lesbos"" and ""Bucktown"", and turns the hero of Leonard's novel from a blonde Caucasian to an African American woman called Jackie Brown, a nod to Pam Grier's blaxploitation classic, ""Foxy Brown"". One song used, ""Longtime Woman"", was itself sung by Grier, and is a nod to ""The Big Doll House"", a 1971 film in which she starred.<br/><br/>Many know that ""Brown's"" opening shot, in which Bobby Momack's ""Across 110th Street"" plays while Grier rides a moving walk-way, is a raging rip-off of ""The Graduate's"" opening shot, but it's also ripped right out of the 1972 crime drama ""Across 110th Street"", which is itself the name of a song by Bobby Momack, whom Pam Grier sang back-up for before she began her career in film. In truth, the film is packed with scenes and moments cribbed from other films – the best moments from ""Pulp Fiction"" also reappear here, Travolta and Thurman becoming Gier and Forster - but there's also a certain gravity here that Tarantino's other films lack. ""Jackie Brown's"" a tale of unrequited love, a sad romance, and a film about desperate people trying to survive. As Momack's song attests, the film's packed with characters ""trying to get out of the ghetto alive"", ""doing whatever they have to do to survive"". Smooth.<br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" ends with a heist which is shown to the audience from three different points of view. This feels very gimmicky, as no real ""shocking"" or ""interesting"" new bits of information are revealed to us by the time we reach the third pass; the alert viewer has already predicted how the heist goes down midway into the second ""point of view"" sequence. Still, the film is packed with lots of little ""reveals"" which do work brilliantly. These reveals range from the subtle (Ordell's ""hot women on the side"" is really a battered addict) to the obvious (Jackie pocket's a gun etc). The film then closes on a close up of Grier's face. It's a face Tarantino adores, and one which he manages to elevate above postmodern fetish object. This is in contrast to his next film, ""Kill Bill"", in which his women once again feel more like dolls, reference points and signposts.<br/><br/>8.5/10 – Slight, but perhaps also some kind of pulp masterpiece. Worth three viewings."

","""Jackie Brown"", based on the novel ""Rum Punch"" by Elmore Leonard, was Quentin Tarantino's hotly anticipated follow-up to ""Pulp Fiction"". It met with generally favorable reviews but is today overshadowed by much of Tarantino's other output.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the title character, a middle-aged stewardess (Pam Grier) who gets caught transporting illicit cash for her arms-dealer boss (Samuel L. Jackson). As a result, the authorities coerce her into aiding them. However, she soon hatches a plan for a complex con that will satisfy her legal obligation while also fattening her pocket with some of her employer's ill-gotten funds.<br/><br/>The script, while adapted from someone else's work, has much of the usual Tarantino style. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the film gets bogged down somewhat by the sheer complexity of the scam that Jackie is trying to perpetrate. It takes a lot of time and exposition to set up the caper and in the end the film has little to offer beyond the superficial plot. That being said, Tarantino does manage to fit a fair amount of character development into the film's two and a half hours.<br/><br/>The cast gets high marks. Samuel L. Jackson delivered a performance that was every bit as good as his turn in ""Pulp Fiction"". Both Pam Grier and Robert Forster had their careers rejuvenated by their assured performances in prominent roles. Robert De Niro doesn't spend much time in the spotlight here but his performance is marked with nuance and skill. The rest of the support is solid too, especially Chris Tucker in a small but entertaining role.<br/><br/>Naturally, Tarantino's direction is top-notch. While I can't recall any particular visuals that stood out the overall presentation was carefully considered and well executed. Tarantino also displays his penchant for savvy soundtrack choices, this time using a number of R&B gems with a dash of sixties rock for variety.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, the film's relative lack of action and convoluted plot make it a little less compelling than other Tarantino offerings. It's still a cool flick but don't expect something on par with ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction""."

","Tarantino's follow-up to Pulp Fiction is a bit too ambitious to be a really enjoyable experience. There are individual moments that are priceless but all in all I was a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>Things that work: Robert De Niro's performance as the world's dumbest criminal, Louis Gara. It is almost as if De Niro's part could have been played by Sylvester Stallone. In fact, De Niro and Stallone shared screen time in another '97 movie, Cop Land, where De Niro has a hilarious monologue belittling Stallone about just how dumb Stallone's character is. Funny coincidence, no? Samuel L. Jackson's chilling performance as Robbie. Gone are the humour that Jackson brought to his dread-locked philosophy spouting gangster in Pulp Fiction (still the mother of all Tarantino films), and say hello to a character that is almost as ruthless as Tony Montana. Jackson is steely cool.<br/><br/>Things that should have worked but don't: Michael Keaton's character (usually one of my favorite actors, even in Herbie - Fully Loaded he is brilliant). Boring, because no character with high morals are any fun in Tarantino's movies.<br/><br/>The same can be said about Pam Grier's and Robert Forster's parts. Although, Grier is certainly one of the hottest looking actors she too is no fun to watch. The romance between her and Forster is nice but nothing more? The best part: Bridget Fonda as perpetually stoned Valley girl. Brad Pitt's performance in True Romance comes to mind when watching her. And check out the sex scene between her and De Niro. Priceless.<br/><br/>Oh, I almost forgot. Tarantino chooses to stay behind the camera this time. Does this redeem the movie in some way. Yes, and no. Tarantino is the worst actor imaginable but his ramblings are sorely missed because it gives his movies a feeling of joy. Here is a man who made his dreams come true and when you see him on screen, you can tell that he has a marvelous time."

","Jackie Brown deserves more credit than it often gets...<br/><br/>If anything, it proves that Tarantino has a real knack for filmmaking, and that he isnt some indie fluke who made a couple masterpieces and then went downhill. What weve got here is a real piece of work. A film that is provacotive and entertaining, a film that features solid performances and skilled directing. Jackie Brown embodies the essence of a great film, and I will still stand by the claim I made when I first say the picture: If this came out before Pulp Fiction, in 1994, JACKIE would be viewed as Quentin's masterpiece.<br/><br/>But of course as we all know, it followed in the wake of the Pulp madness, and that was perhaps the films death knell. To out-do Pulp would be impossible - it is the greatest film ever made, but I dont think Tarantino was trying to make a film that out did it, I think he was trying to make a film that he would enjoy if he happened to catch it at the cinema back in the 70's. Its fun and it moves at a more methodical pace than its two predecessors (Pulp and Reservoir Dogs), but dont be fooled, its still chock full of brilliant dialogue and inspired segments. Keaton turns in a great performance here, and it just goes to show that he is incredibly underrated. Robert Forster brings a dose of charming reality to the film and he brings a warm and comfortable presence to his charecter. Pam Grier approaches her role as Jackie with the same detached yet confident ""cool"" that made her a legend in stuff like ""Coffy"". She's great, and she really keeps you glued to her every move. DeNiro is DeNiro - he is a classic actor and this shows why. He can do it all. Honestly I this is his best work since Raging Bull.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is great, dont be told otherwise. Its an excellent contribution to the film world and should be viewed with a little more distance from the Pulp Fiction madness."

"davidmvining","10","1","1","25 November 2019"," A steady burn
","My first viewing of Jackie Brown, years ago, confused me. I was expecting time jumps, and I kept asking myself when things were happening. I was trying to rearrange a movie that needed to rearranging.<br/><br/>I mention that uninteresting anecdote because it speaks to the interesting, slightly out of step, place Jackie Brown holds in Quentin Tarantino's whole filmography. People threw the word ""mature"" a lot at Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood as though Tarantino had never calmed down before, but Jackie Brown is the work of a filmmaker in complete control of his craft and coolly telling a story. It's a very mature work, and it's only his third film.<br/><br/>A small-time gunrunner living in Los Angeles named Ordell Robbie is suddenly having a bit of a problem with his business. One of his employees, Beaumont, has been picked up for a gun charge which, combined with his parole, could lead to ten years in jail. Ordell understands Beaumont's character, uses Max Cherry, a bail bondsman to get Beaumont out of jail, and then proceeds to kill him. Ordell's instinct about Beaumont's character was completely correct, though, for Beaumont had given up a slice of Ordell's business by naming Jackie Brown as Ordell's gopher.<br/><br/>Jackie is a middle-aged black woman who works for one of the worst airlines in America as a stewardess. She supplements her income by sneaking things in from Mexico for Ordell, mostly money. Because Beaumont gave her name, the ATF is ready to meet her when she lands in Los Angeles. Ordell gets her out of prison using Max Cherry again, and Max picks Jackie up from prison and is immediately smitten by her.<br/><br/>Jackie knows that Ordell will view her the same way that he viewing Beaumont, and she's terrified, but she's also smart. She knows that he's going to come to kill her, but she also figures out a way to get herself out of the situation. She proposes a plan to him to get his stash of cash out of Mexico. He has limited options around this, so he accepts. She then plays both Ordell and the ATF against each other while she plans on keeping the money for herself.<br/><br/>What follows is a delightfully twisty game of cat and mouse as Jackie ropes in Max to help her deceive both the ATF and Ordell. The whole game is played with Tarantino's classic ability to spin dialogue and his actors' abilities to sell it. Chris Tucker, apparently, told Tarantino that he would usually just say whatever he wanted in place of scripted lines, but he was going to say Tarantino's dialogue verbatim because he liked it so much. There are scenes, as in every Tarantino movie, of people just sitting around talking. This isn't merely indulgence on Tarantino's part, it's important character work that gets the audience in deeper into the world. Melanie isn't just some beach bimbo, she's a well defined beach bimbo so that when she starts egging on Louis after the big trade off (for real this time), it makes perfect sense. We know the entirety of her relationship with Louis, so we understand that she's the kind of person to egg him on and that Louis is also the kind of guy who's got bottle up rage that could come out at any moment. It makes the moment that Louis shoots Melanie both more shocking and more expected and inevitable than it otherwise would have been.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole is that kind of low-key fun. The action of the film is around moving shopping bags under changing room doors. The handful of gunshots are shown with little blood and seem incidental to the action at hand. The characters are intelligent and talk to each other in ways that are both believable and move things forward at the same time.<br/><br/>It's a steady burn of a movie, and a wonderful addition to Tarantino's body of work."

That is not to say there is no violence in the movie, there is, but there are only four deaths and you don't really see anything.<br/><br/>Pam Grier is a joy, Samuel Jackson is great at delivering Tarantino dialogue. Michael Keaton is as great as he always is, as is Robert De Niro (but I'm not sure I could see Sly in the role, especially the scenes in the mall) but it's Robert Forster who was Oscar nominated. Personally, I think Grier should have been too.<br/><br/>I like how Grier was cast in this, and certain changes were made (Her name in the novel was Jackie Burke and she was white) The director thought she was the best person for the role, so she got it, like with Morgan Freeman in The Shawdhank Redemption, he was supposed to be a white, red haired Irish guy, but Freeman was the best for the role.<br/><br/>One thing I will never understand is why Max does not leave with her at the end.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown grossed $39 million dollars (against a $12 million budget) at the domestic box office."

","That rarity of Tarantino films, more character than gore. <br/><br/>Who would have ever thought it possible?<br/><br/>The only reason Jackie Brown works, and works quite well, is that it's based on a novel by the late Elmore Leonard. Now, Leonard could go pretty medieval in his novels, but his characters always felt like real people, good 'uns and bad. The language coming out of their mouths sounded real. <br/><br/>I saw Jackie Brown some 15 years ago, about the same time I saw Out of Sight, based on another Leonard work, and I thought the two made great bookends. They seemed to honor Elmore Leonard. Seeing the movies made me want to read more Leonard novels. <br/><br/>Imagine my surprise when I found out that the Charles Bronson flick, Mr. Majestyk, was one of his. I love that movie, and it made me love it more.<br/><br/>15 years after my viewing Jackie Brown, the story itself is pretty much gone, but I do recall that it was suspenseful, had interesting folks doing bad and not-so-bad things, and even had a smidgen of humor that didn't depend on John Travolta hitting a chuckhole and blowing some poor doofus' head off.<br/><br/>I have not seen the Django thing or Kill Thrill Bill, 1-47, or Inglorious Remakes or the recent Hateful Hatful. If I want to participate in Tarantino's pornographic horror shows, I guess I should watch more, but why would I want to? He hit his high point with the film version of a pretty good crime novel, and all we can do now is bring a mop to the theatre to push around the blood sloshing off the screen.<br/><br/>Gag."

","I remember that Jackie Brown was on television once. I didn't watch it, but I remember seeing a short trailer or something. <br/><br/>The story of Jackie Brown is well written for sure, but it feels like something is missing. The story works well and it thrilling and intriguing. I haven't read the original novel, but the fault lies either in the novel and story itself or Tarantino's ability to adapt the novel for screen. Not that it is a big problem, not every story can be extremely unique and one of a kind stories - the most important thing is that the story works. One weakness for the story is that for a moment in the beginning it alienates the audience, when they don't know the whole idea yet, and they are just trying to follow. Now it's easy to catch up and things do become much clearer, but for a moment there the viewer might not have a clue on what's going on - especially when they haven't read a summary or anything. <br/><br/>Jackie Brown is also an interesting character, considering that for a moment you have no idea who she is lying to and whose side she is on. The only thing you can count on is that this whole thing better be good for her. And Pam Grier, oh my god, I think I am in love with her. She's an amazing actress and so beautiful. <br/><br/>I love the music in this movie. Makes me think of some extravagant 70's police show.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is a very clever film.

","While not necessarily his best, Jackie Brown is easily the most mature, most complete, film Quentin Tarantino has made till date. No other Tarantino film can match Jackie Brown's storytelling, character development and realism. The movie accentuates Tarantino's love not only for cult/obscure films and pulp fiction novels but also for the forgotten movie stars.<br/><br/>By handpicking two washed out actors like Pam Grier and Robert Forster to play the major parts in Jackie Brown, Tarantino, a self- confessed admirer of both of theirs work, took a huge big but his faith in them didn't go unrewarded as both deliver superb performances with Forster even getting his first Academy Award nomination. <br/><br/>The memorable performances of Grier and Forster are well backed up by the rest of the cast: Samuel L. Jackson once again plays an N- word loving hit-man to a tee, only this time it is more repugnant than Pulp Fiction. Michael Keaton plays an ATF agent with his usual frenzy. Robert De Niro effortlessly essays the part of a sociopathic ex-convict. And Bridget Fonda skillfully plays a drugged-addict moll. Rarely does anyone miss a keynote. <br/><br/>Tarantino's brilliant choice of stock music further adds to the movie's experience. The direction and editing is absolutely top notch.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","7 May 2015"," Perhaps the most subtle movie from Tarantino
","I don't think Tarantino has ever directed a movie with less gunfights, blood and gore, which is by no means a bad thing. Jackie Brown is more style than action, but it's still unerringly Tarantino. Everything from the music to the dialogue to the characters is pure him. It's simply more of a thriller instead of an action film.<br/><br/>The eponymous Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is an airline stewardess who, as means to make more money, smuggles drugs and cash for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), a fairly successful drug lord. A deal goes sour and Jackie needs to do one last big job for Ordell to preserve her life. Things get complicated when a bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) develops feelings for Jackie. The rest is great conversations, intriguing characters, style, class, some violence and a really good criminal masterplan. Tarantino in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Neither Grier or Forster had acted in a leading role for a long time before this film and this movie helped revitalize their careers. And not undeservedly so. Grier especially is phenomenal in her role and this movie is considered to be one of the best action/thriller films with a female protagonist. She's resourceful, tough as nails and quick on her feet, but she's also way in over her head, but making it work for her. Great character, one of Tarantino's best.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is largely a con job film, so I shall say no more in fear of spoiling it for you, but trust me when I say that it's well worth a watch, whether you are a fan of Tarantino or not."
"lucasversantvoort","8","1","1","6 May 2015"," A tad underrated
","Jackie Brown is the kind of movie I could easily watch several times and one I find superior to Tarantino's debut Reservoir Dogs, in terms of replay value if nothing else. The story is complex (though not as complicatedly told as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction) and the characters actually feel like characters.<br/><br/>The main characters are: Jackie Brown, a middle-aged woman who works for Ordell Robbie, an arms dealer; Melanie and Louis, his 'helpers' and last, but not least, Max who becomes Jackie's bail bondsman. Jackie is caught for smuggling money for Ordell. She has to decide whether to help the cops and risk being killed by Ordell or spend time in jail – an unpromising situation for a middle-aged, black woman, as Jackie is well aware of. She is bailed out through Ordell by Max, who falls in love with her. She then thinks of a plan to fool Ordell, his friends and the cops and still walk away with the money, but she needs Max's help.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why I consider Jackie Brown to be better than Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs is because of the way a sub-theme regarding women is handled throughout the story. While on the surface the movie appears to be a straightforward heist flick, underneath lies a theme regarding women and the men in their lives who desperately want to maintain the upper hand, the position of dominant power. And I'm not talking' female empowerment à la Kill Bill It isn't a coincidence that the strongest female character in the movie is also the one the movie is named after. Jackie Brown, played by Pam Grier, seems to be the dupe and plaything of the FBI and others, but she eventually outsmarts them all. On the other hand, males like Ordell and Louis try to keep their cool and stay on top of things, but to no avail. Take the opening scene for instance. Melanie tells Louis that Ordell merely repeats things he heard about guns. This means that Ordell wants to desperately sound like an expert on his craft and thus maintain an air of superiority. Jackson's performance, while not anything new for him, reflects this well, coming across as someone who desires to be The Boss in every way, but has difficulty in doing so. This can also be seen in the disrespectful and futile way he tries to boss Melanie around. Futile, not only because Melanie outsmarts Ordell, but also tries to betray him, despite perhaps our immediate assumption that she would be incapable of this because of her looks. Louis stays mostly silent, because he's got little to say, eventually preferring to just get high. Towards the end of the film, Louis and Melanie, with what they believe is a bag full of money, walk out of the shopping mall with Louis forgetting where he parked his car. This causes Melanie to belittle him. Louis does the only thing he can think of in a desperate attempt to save his frightened, little ego and shoots Melanie.<br/><br/>Males failing to maintain control can also be seen in other things, little things. Ordell tells others several times that the police try to scare suspects with longer than usual prison sentences, basically telling them to man up. However, when Jackie Brown tells Ordell she told the police how she's working for him despite the fact they basically already knew this (Jackie asks the police ""Besides, why else would an ATF man be after him?""), Ordell freaks out, negating his own 'masculine' Way of Life.<br/><br/>One would be right by saying that this is basically a 'female empowerment' film, but the great thing is that it isn't obviously so. There's no needless moral overtones or a moment when the Big Message is spelled out for us, which would of course suck all the fun out it. Now, one is able to both enjoy the film and the 'female empowerment' angle, without feeling like they're being 'taught something'.<br/><br/>Overall, Jackie Brown isn't as playful with storytelling and fun as Pulp Fiction, but it is better and more maturely written than Reservoir Dogs. It's a shame this movie had such unfairly high expectations after Pulp Fiction, because I think it cost this film and Tarantino someBrownie points. Pun intended, I regret nothing"

It's still definitely a crime film but one can see the disappointment in those people who wanted more of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction-like levels of intensity and narrative.

","For many years, this was the big one - the one that got away. As much as I enjoy Tarantino's movies, this one never really seemed to bother me much and so I was happy to give it a miss. I even bought it on DVD and traded it before I watched it. So using the benefits of a Sky+ box, I could finally give it a fair hearing but after all this time and given the fact that it is the follow-up to one of my favourite films of all time, could it really hope to compete? <br/><br/>Taking his cue from riffing off other genres, ""Jackie Brown"" is Tarantino's take of Seventies blaxploitation and introduces us to airline stewardess Jackie (Pam Grier), who should be doing better but finds herself increasingly held back by past mistakes. Her other source of income is running money for arms dealer Ordell (Samuel L Jackson) but things are about to take a turn for the worst. After being busted by ATF agent Nicolette (Michael Keaton), Jackie finds herself caught up in their plan to catch Ordell or face a long stretch behind bars. Trouble is, anyone double-crossing Ordell ends up dead pretty quick. But Jackie is a resourceful woman and begins making plans of her own, possibly involving her bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster)...<br/><br/>There is technically nothing wrong with ""Jackie Brown"". Performances are universally brilliant - even Chris Tucker's brief appearance isn't annoying - and almost as good as the funk and soul mix of the soundtrack featuring legends like Bobby Womack, the Delfonics and Randy Crawford. The soundtrack, you expect to be faultless in a Tarantino flick but his usual antics of playing with the chronology are kept to a strict minimum which means any who didn't get ""Pulp Fiction"" will not be confused by the plot here. The story, based on an Elmore Leonard novel, has the usual twists and turns but ultimately doesn't offer too much in the way of surprises which felt a little disappointing. But in truth, this is a great crime movie with brilliant performances and all to a fantastic soundtrack. What's not to like? <br/><br/>Well, Tarantino's films have a reputation for being close to the edge, for pushing boundaries and taking things to the extreme but ""Jackie Brown"" is none of this things. It feels too safe by Tarantino's standards as if he's afraid of offending anyone and as a result, it lacks the usual zing and verve of his other films. And while it keeps the Seventies vibe going, I never personally felt it was a blaxploitation tribute as strongly as ""Pulp Fiction"" paid homage to crime thrillers. I wanted to be gripped but I only stuck with it for fear of losing the plot. It's an easy film to admire but a difficult one to love and to be honest, I just didn't feel the magic."

","After a ground-breaking, eye-opening success like Pulp Fiction, any director would feel pressured to make a film that establishes them as a genuine talent rather than a flash in the pan. I'm not sure that is what Quentin Tarantino attempted to do with Jackie Brown, but he makes it work in every way possible. As his only film not originally written but based on an Elmore Leonard novel, the film has a very novel-like structure. There are also quite a bit of main players, to a degree even more so than Pulp Fiction because here they are part of the intricate and complex plot rather than supporting characters thrown in for some enjoyable banter.<br/><br/>It is interesting to see the evolution of Tarantino's ability to direct a film between Pulp Fiction and this. One feels like a young, up and coming director full of ambition and energy, ready to show the world what he can do. The other is much more restrained, professional and interested in the deeper realms of these characters. Indeed, throughout his career it is obvious that Tarantino's gifts lie with dialogue and characters; for him they go hand-in-hand.<br/><br/>To go along with that is a terrific cast. Pam Grier, an icon of the blaxploitation films of the 1970s, looks tired and weary of the cards life has dealt her as the title character, a flight attendant who gets mixed up with smuggling money and the ATF, putting her in a position she would rather not be in but understands the long-term significance. Samuel L. Jackson gives perhaps the best performance as Odell, a mean, driven criminal willing to go to any lengths to ensure his status. Robert Forster revived his career as Max Cherry, a bail bondsman with a lot in common with Jackie and willing to help her out. However, my personal favorite must be the great Robert De Niro as Louis, a former cell mate of Odell who is more than a little unable to work his way back into society after being released from prison. The way De Niro plays the character so subtly stupid and ignorant is both hilarious and shocking to watch.<br/><br/>Of course, with any Tarantino film, the plot doesn't matter so much as who's in it. The film is long but never boring as he winds up this intricate story of crossing and double-crossing all while sneaking in scenes contemplating heavier themes like age and life's direction. This is certainly a film that will catch people by surprise, especially Tarantino fans who loved Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The classic Tarantino signs are here, but there's also a lot more under the surface."
"kurciasbezdalas","10","1","1","19 October 2008"," A must see for crime movies fans
","This film is pretty different from previous two Quentin Tarantino's films but it's good in it's own way. If you liked Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and expecting this movie to be similar with those two, you may be disappointed. This movie is pretty different but has a better plot and that's what I liked about it. Actually I saw this film before watching Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and those two movies appeared a little disappointing to me because I was expecting to see something like in Jackie Brown. So like I said the plot was good and another thing that I liked about this movie was Robert Forster's character which was very realistic, especially when he's at work. Other cast did a great job too like Pam Grier or Samuel L. Jackson. Like all Tarantino's movies this one also has a rich soundtrack and some interesting dialogs so it's actually not that different from previous films."
"mr_popcorn","8","1","1","10 September 2008"," MC's take on ""Jackie Brown""
","Jackie Brown: ""Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waiting on people almost 20 years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothing to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that sht is scarier than Ordell."" <br/><br/>Jackie Brown is the name of a flight attendant who gets caught smuggling her boss' gun money on the airline she works for. Luckily for her, the Fed Ray Nicolet and the LA Cop Mark Dargus decide to team up in order to arrest the arms dealer she works for, whose name they don't even know. Here's when she has to choose one way: tell Nicolet and Dargus about Ordell Robbie (the arms dealer) and get her freedom -except that if Ordell suspects you're talking about him, you're dead- or keep her mouth shut and do some time. That's when she meets Max Cherry -her bail bondsman-, a late fifties, recently separated, burnt-out man, who falls in love with her. Then Jackie comes up with a plan to play the Feds off against Ordell and the guys he works with -Louis Gara and Melanie Ralston, among others- and walk off with their money. But she needs Max's help. No one is going to stand in the way of his million dollar payoff...<br/><br/>I liked Quentin Tarantino better when he's borrowing concepts and ideas from other films and making it uniquely his own. Just kidding. I still dig this film even though there's no flashy editing and the style is lesser than the substance. I don't know, I guess QT's magic works better if he's homaging movies after movies (ie, Kill Bill 1 and 2, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction) This time around, Tarantino worked his way around an engaging script, a stellar cast and amazing acting courtesy of lead Pam Grier as the titular character, Samuel L. Jackson as Ordell and believe it or not, Chris Tucker's performance was hilariously amazing. Even though his character never did see the end of the film, jousting cuss words with Samuel L. Jackson is no easy feat. John Travolta's Vincent Vega was annihilated by Jules' ""Superfly TNT, the Guns of Navarone!"" and even the snakes pised their pants with Sam's ""I'm tired of this motherfn snakes on this motherfn plane!"" Like in any other film by Quentin Tarantino, the script is more than amazing. It was engaging, satisfying and genuine. From the quirky one liners to Samuel L. Jackson's holier than thou cussing, this film is as real as you can get. Real characters dealing with real situations with real outcomes.<br/><br/>People who bash Quentin a lot should learn a thing or two from this film. He's not all that copycat director you make him to be. He's just a guy who's seen a lot of films during his video store clerk days and loved it so he pays tribute to it by making films. This one however is a step out his usual norm and I must say, he still nailed it. This is why QT is one of my favorite directors out there."

","Recently I've become a huge fan of Tarantino, and this was one of the 2 movies of his I hadn't seen(can't find the other one) so I rented it. I loved Samuel L Jackson in his role and De Niro was funny. The plot was unique, sometimes confusing, and barely ever boring. Samuel L Jackson does a great job as a gun merchant who will stop at nothing to reach $1,000,000, and this movie just shows why he is one of my favorite actors. De Niro is quiet, but for some reason I found him really funny. No, this movie is no Pulp Fiction, but to me that's kind of a dumb remark, it means nothing besides this movie is not one of the greatest movies of all time(which you should not expect out of it), which is perfectly fine.

","Tarantino does a good job with Jackie Brown. There is action, some plot twists with cool music, quality directing and editing. I had only one problem. I recently saw Out of Sight (another film based on an Elmore Leonard novel) which was equally good in all these areas but had a much more interesting and unusual story.<br/><br/>With its routine plot, Jackie Brown never left me in suspense or surprised me but I still enjoyed it. I owe this to its fine performances. Pam Greer is solid in the title role as the victim calling the shots. Samuel Jackson is terrific but may I suggest please lose the strange hair (which seemed left over from Deep Space Nine). But my favorite performance is by Robert Forster. He is tough and street wise but surprisingly he is not macho at all. Other supporting roles by Michael Keaton and Bridget Fonda were just fine. The actors left me very pleased with Jackie Brown but besides that, the movie is just ok."
"Vincent-5","Null","1","1","24 October 1998"," An infinitely enjoyable experience.
","Despite the negative criticism this film has received, and claims that the shine has gone off Quentin Tarantino, Jackie Brown is still head and shoulders above most of what the movie business has to offer. As Tarantino said, the movie is not supposed to be an epic, rather a character study. It does not have the class and brilliance of Pulp Fiction, and the suspense of True Romance or Reservoir Dogs. The storyline in itself is nothing original. Yet what Jackie Brown has is amazingly real charachters and dialogue, interesting Tarantino situations and a stellar cast who perform it all to perfection. Samuel L. Jackson is awesome as a street-wise gunrunner - he won the best actor award at Cannes. Bridget Fonda is is dynamite as his stoned house-mate. Robert Forster received an Oscar nomination  for his role - perhaps the most natural, human performance I have ever seen, free from any Hollywood gloss. Robert DeNiro plays an unusual role for him - a quiet charachter, but plays it  to absolute perfection. Finally, Pam Grier is a sensation, a fresh face on the screen. All characters are complex and enticing. The movie is long, but you can hardly want it to end because it's a joy to watch."

Pam Grier gets the cool wisecracking role which used to belong to Bogart once: ""too cool for school"" (as Ordell says). AND she's 44, AND she announces as much, AND she's still sexy as hell.. My role-model for the week, if not the year! It helps that Jackson is a worthy opponent and a thoroughly charismatic ""villain"" - in the end the film does come down to a rather classic ""flawed hero(ine) v. attractive baddie"" story, but that's part of the fun. Everyone else puts in good performances, and Forster looks like Leonard Cohen, who really ought to be an actor. Great. I didn't find it long even in a very uncomfortable cinema."

"RJW-2","Null","1","1","25 September 1998"," A very different Tarantino
","If you were to take this film, and compare it to Tarantino's earlier work, you'd never guess they came from the same director. Sure, some similarities exist (the hip dialogue, the time juxtaposition, etc.), but those are just petty details, and they've been ripped off innumerable times since. This movie came from a very different place. It's certainly a more mature work, but I wouldn't call it better. Part of what made Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs so compelling was that you had the feeling they were the work of a mad genius. Anything could, and did, happen. Jackie Brown is far more pedestrian. It is by no means boring, but that same adrenaline rush that came along with, well, Uma Thurman's adrenaline rush, just isn't here. I suppose that's what Quentin was shooting for: a more subdued character piece. He would have been tarred and feathered had he made Pulp Fiction 2, so I expected a different direction. I admire him for trying something new, and on many levels he succeeded. The romance between Max and Jackie is beautifully handled and portrayed, never feeling forced or sappy. Jackie Brown called for a more relaxed pace, and it is delivered. But its director is perhaps the reigning master of cinematic chaos, and all of that energy is (wisely) held in. Let's hope Tarantino's next project allows him to really let loose, so he can do what he does best: blow our minds."
"cofemug","Null","1","1","30 August 1998"," Great Movie!
","I loved this movie, but then I loved everything else Tarentino has had his hands in.  I loved True Romance and Natural Born Kilers, especially the courtroom scene, which was all his.  This movie is not typical Tarantino because it was based on a book not written by Tarantino.  It was based on a book by Elmore Leonard orginally called Rum Punch.  Elmore Leonard is another master of the dialogue, and he should be credited for much of the story and dialogue.  The movie dragged because it was a copy of the book, only missing a few scenes.  I loved the way the movie was done, and it was fabulous.  I love Elmore Leonard and Tarantino.  The dialogue between the two was almost perfect.  However, I think that Tarantino fans of his first two films should not see this expecting the same type of fare.  This is Leonard-land, and it is a glorious place."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","4","9","4 September 2004"," Tame ending, and a less gratuitous than Tarantino's other films
","Some would call this a tamer/toned down version of Pulp Fiction... I don't know. I guess it is, but the film is also more devoid of Tarantino's style than any of his other work. The non-linear time-line would be the prime example of this; it's only used in a handful of scenes, rather than the one thing that keeps the film going, as is the case with one or two of his other films(Reservoir Dogs, arguably Pulp Fiction). The film has much less violence, sex and drugs than any of his other films as well, which, together with the non-linear time-line, is Tarantino's trademark. However, in some ways, it lifted the film above expectations of the standard Tarantino production; instead of sitting there, waiting for some shocking violence, I actually payed attention to the story, which is more than what I can say for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction(Kill Bill managed to juggle both things, Tarantino's style and a good, interesting plot perfectly, which is partly why I like it more). The problem with the plot, however, is that it's so damn confusing... if you don't pay perfect attention every single second of the way, you'll miss something. Normally, this would rate high with me, as I like films where it pays off to pay attention... only, this one doesn't. It doesn't pay off to pay attention, because the one reason there is to watch the movie, is to enjoy Tarantino's unique style, which, as I mentioned before, is not as present here as it is in his other movies. The ending is a anti-climax, and a powerful one, since it gives you exactly the ending you expect from the very start of the film, and you realize that you've just spent two and a half hours, watching something that ended exactly the way you knew it would end. Pulp Fiction ended unexpectedly, both in time and situation. Kill Bill had a great twist, at the end of each part/volume. Even Reservoir Dogs had a better ending than this. The plot is a pretty good, but a little too predictable, and it has almost as bad a pace as Pulp Fiction; the thing that kept me watching was my enjoyment of Tarantino's style and the fact that I wasn't as confused by it as I was by Pulp Fiction. The predictability might have something to do with me having seen so many other Tarantino's films, but it still should have surprised me more; all of his other films surprised me, some more than others, but all surprised me at some point or another. The characters are well-written, like with most of Tarantino's other work. The dialog is also about as good as Tarantino's other films. The soundtrack is also pretty good, but it's inferior to his other films, in my opinion. The actors are all well-cast. Hmmm... what else... I don't know, all in all, it's just a typical Tarantino film, with the twist that it's in several ways different from, uh, the typical Tarantino film. That's pretty much it. If you're into Tarantino's style, you'll enjoy it, but you have to love his films and style to really love it. I recommend it to fans of Tarantino, who are up for a slightly different film from what he usually does. 7/10"

","Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, but based on Elmore Leonard's 1995 bestseller Rum Punch, the ridiculously too-long Jackie Brown is like Pulp Fiction on a weight-reduction plan.  Gone are all the fattening calories like long-winded, witty dialogue, ultra-violence, street-humor, over-the-top character development and good roles for everyone (`Tiny' Lister, Chris Tucker and Robert DeNiro play stock characters with next-to-nothing to do).<br/><br/>Let's just say the best thing about Jackie Brown is... well, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), a hard-up stewardess who supplements her meager income by smuggling cash into the US for a gunrunner named Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson).  Grier, the blaxploitation she-god of 70s tough-cookie flicks, barely misses a step, proving she belongs back on the silver-screen amidst Julia Roberts and Sigourney Weaver.  But Jackson, on the other hand -- I found myself caring less and less about his near-unexciting character!<br/><br/>Crime goes unpunished until Jackie is nabbed by ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and LA detective Mark Dargus (Michael Bowman), at which point a cat-and-mouse caper begins.  The cops pressure Jackie to help bring down Ordell, threatening prison if she refuses (Ordell wants to kill her before she does). So, with the help of sympathetic bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), Jackie launches a foolishly daring plan.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Jackie Brown is that Tarentino made a film with `real' salt-of-the-earth characters  the kind of conspiring people you see in local bars who live right around the corner.  Unfortunately, most `real' people we know are boring and limp; certainly less-than-dynamic.  And that's not why we love Tarentino, it's why we love film-makers like John Sayles. But Tarentino himself set us up for this fall  two sensational films followed by an ordinary film?  Let's hope Tarentino has got a heavy brand of cork and rubber in his next bat when he steps up to the plate again -- I'd hate to think of him as a two-trick pony!  <br/><br/>At least there wasn't a chase-scene to end the film."

","""One of her brothers was a bad outlaw..."" It was satisfying to see Jackie Brown on a big-screen, finally, as I had originally meant to see it when it came out in 1997. It also was fitting that the print of the film screened hadn't been updated or changed since 97, so there were parts that looked scratched and worn - ironically a Grindhouse-looking print for a QT movie that is the least Grindhouse-like movie he's made. The violence here, one of the things that people expect in his movies, is toned down; only once, when a particular character is killed in a car is it bloody or really shocking. The other few kills in the movie are off-screen or far away. That doesn't mean they don't have an impact - if anything, you feel it a bit more due to it popping out.<br/><br/>The whole movie carries restraint to it, but this is a good thing. Tarantino isn't concerned so much with plot- though it has a kickin'-good yarn spun by Elmore Leonard to work off from - but with the characters, hanging out with them (he's said that it's ""his"" Rio Bravo - just chilling out with some guys who happen to be in a story with some danger and action to it, but more-so talking about what will happen and seeing how the dominoes fall).<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed this time, after seeing the film so many times I've lost count (though it's less than the number of lost-count-times than Pulp Fiction, more than Reservoir Dogs), is how masterful Samuel L. Jackson is here. This may be my favorite performance from him, or at least the most he's given per capita seeming to do so little, as he exudes a brooding, intelligent menace for Ordell, a guy who is, if one has to pigeon-hole him, the 'villain' of the story. But he also epitomizes the gangster-style of the Wu-Tang song 'CREAM' (""Cash rules everything around me, cream, get the money, dolla dolla bill y'all"") and is serious as a heart attack about it.<br/><br/>And yet he's not someone I outright hate as a villain or detest; he's like a cool-ass mother*****' snake who gets done what he had to get done, and is on top of everything until he isn't. Jackson makes the guy look cool, though dangerous, and he has especially great scenes in the final 20 minutes of the film where his ponytail hair is let down all like a crazy samurai and he gives his threats in a hushed tone to Robert Forster in the car. Really excellent work.<br/><br/>Also reminded again: Pam Grier in a red dress. Oooh. Just saying."

","When first hearing of this title, you would of expected another Pulp Fiction. Sadly here you;re very mistaken. You've been very short changed I'm afraid. Working from Elmore Leonard's novel, Quentin must of been self conscious in his telling of this nothing impressive tale. There's hardly any Tarantino humor or VIOLENCE. We have a few stretched out scenes, wasted ones, of little significance, ones that take place in Jackson's Venice beach apartment. We can tell he's held back here, as if to honor or not disrespect crime author, Leonard's book. Pam Grier playing the title, one of the many great performances, is a 44 year old black woman trying to make ends meat, by earning her undeserved share of money made off selling guns, that her boss, Ordell Robbie sells. Jackson is fun to watch in this, playing bad good, in reverse to the much gentler and reserved teacher he played in 187. When Grier is arrested by the feds, she has her own way of snaking out of it, outwitting authorities, while hatching a plan to rip off Ordeal. You gotta admire the courage and strength of the character, but the storytelling just seems to be prolonged. There's not many surprises in the thriller department either. We know what each character wants, whether he/she is good or bad. They're an open book. Deniro was fun to watch as as ex parolee friend of Jackson, who lags around in Jackson's apartment with skinny bikini bodied pot smoking Mel (Fonda). Her murder in the car park was a shock. On the whole Jackie Brown was a bitter disappointment when seeing it in the cinema. This disappointing feature almost had me wondering if I was in the right cinema. I enjoyed it more second time around on video, but this Tarantino flick is a two an hour flick that could of easily been told in 90 minutes. It's just a prolonged story with a lot of flat, not much happening scenes. If Tarantino did it his way, minus Leonard's' influence, we would of had a better movie."
"MartinHafer","8","3","7","13 February 2011"," It's very good--too bad it's a bit overwhelmed by the director's other films of the era.
","There are already a ton of reviews for this film, so I'll try to be brief. This is the last film directed by Quentin Tarantino that have to see (as of 2/11), as I've seen all the other films he helmed. This is surprising, actually, as I love most of his films and I really love blacksploitation movies--and this film would seem to combine the two. That's because the film Pam Grier--a lady who made a name for herself in the early to mid-1970s blackspoitation genre. However, after seeing the film it really seemed like a Taratino film from start to finish and, aside from the presence of Grier, had nothing to do with blacksploitation. Now to me, this was a bit of a disappointment--as I really wanted to see the over-the-top crazy action for which Grier was famous in the 1970s--in such films as ""Coffey"" and ""Foxy Brown"". This film, while violent, is much more refined than these earlier films...and I would have loved to have seen more of this sort of action.<br/><br/>Grier plays the title character--a lady who uses her job as a flight attendant to bring in money to the country to Samuel L. Jackson--who plays a guy who deals in illegal guns. When the authorities catch her, she has the choice to either play their game or go to prison--but she decides on a third course of action no one else anticipated.<br/><br/>In addition to Grier and Jackson, there are a lot of other interesting characters in the film. To me, the most interesting is the laconic guy played by Robert Forster--a bailbondsman who is instantly taken with Jackie. He's older but handsome--and I appreciate that the whole interracial aspect of their relationship is never really discussed or exploited--they are just two people. Also of some interest is the violent guy played by Robert DiNero (imagine that!) and the rather annoying (deliberately so) character played by Bridget Fonda (in a nice change of pace).<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good film but also one that can easily get overlooked because some of the director's other films before and after were so memorable (and simply better). Following ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and preceding ""Kill Bill"" was tough and by comparison ""Jackie Brown"" is an inferior film--though one its own it's a very good film--one that is still well worth seeing provided you like violent films. To me, it lacks the style and uniqueness of these other films...but it's still quite good.<br/><br/>By way, there are alternate spellings for blacksploitation--also commonly written as 'blaxsploitation'. So don't write to me about the correct spelling. Enjoy."

","Quentin Tarantino`s third movie is not in the same class as his previous two(Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction). The movie is about Jackie Brown, a stewardess, who gets caught smuggling. The movie doesn`t have the good characters and cool dialogue seen in Tarantino`s others films, and is therefore nowhere near as good as his previous films.  The amount of violence has also decreased dramatically since Pulp Fiction, and violence is one of the main ingredients in Tarantino`s movies.

"jzappa","10","2","4","3 December 2006"," Two of the World's Greatest Writers Join Forces
","Quentin Tarantino is one of the few filmmakers that will adapt a novel by a popular and well- received veteran novelist like Elmore Leonard, whose books are famous for not being adapted into very good movies, twist it into a blaxploitation homage, change the settings and a few things about the characters, and make it the best adaptation ever made of that author's work...save for Out of Sight, of course. Tarantino has that way of charmingly ruffling up other people's work and making it his own and somehow getting us to love it. Jackie Brown is wonderful.<br/><br/>This is inarguably Quentin's least appreciated film. This is something like saying the Holy Spirit is not as appreciated as the Father and the Son, because all of his films are appreciated. They're looked at by incredible amounts of people as ingenious, groundbreaking cinema. However, Jackie Brown is not mentioned as often, it's not quoted constantly, it doesn't have a following, and it's not on IMDb's Top 250, where Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and the Kill Bills have their places. I think it deserves more recognition than it gets. l think that the reason it's his least appreciated film is frankly because it's not soaked in blood and it's a battle wits more than weapons. Even though I love blood-soaked gorefests, highlights of such a kind of film being those other four Tarantino films, I think it's awfully shallow to expect such a narrow criteria from such a brilliant filmmaker like him, leaving his other efforts in the shadows. Jackie Brown has a lot to offer: One of the finest ensemble casts I've ever seen, Tarantino's trademark salt-of-the-earth dialogue (""Beaumont ain't got a doin'- time kind of disposition...""), a roller-coaster rush of a soundtrack including forcibly head-bobbing 1970s funk with unforgettable highlights like Bobby Womack's Across 110th Street and The Brothers Johnson's Strawberry Letter #23, and a clever con game that is slowly unraveled.<br/><br/>Jackson ignites the screen with his infectious and eternally memorable portrayal of Ordell Robie, the perfect opposite to his Jules Winnfield. He's an eccentric who doesn't realize it, a nearly laughable pseudo-badass-businessman exterior, but with a cold-hearted interior quietly ahead of everyone else, a clever double-sided mastermind.<br/><br/>Grier naturally gives off that down-home, unsophisticated streetwise woman-trying-to- make-it feeling in the movie's title heroine, especially early on when we're just coming to know her as a character and she's not saying much, tired from nights spent in jail, just wanting a drink and a smoke and to go home, but knowing something about her situation isn't adding up. We learn to love her not just as a badass black chick in a suit with a gun, but as a middle-aged woman trying to cling to that semblance of a life she has and taking such risks to beat the odds.<br/><br/>One surprise in Jackie Brown is the presence of Robert De Niro. It seems appropriate that Tarantino, someone who so embraces the crime genre and having done so much with Harvey Keitel, should cast De Niro as a seasoned career scumbag, the staple of his tremendous career. The surprise is that he plays the character down, which is so rare for him to do. Usually, De Niro takes a character and plays him up, making him a bigger, tougher, more brazen and bombastic character, sometimes just a little bit and sometimes a lot. Jackie Brown is a departure from the majority of his other work. His character shares a lot of the same traits as most of De Niro's other tough guys and crooks, but his disposition is so different. It makes this one of his most intriguing performances.<br/><br/>Those who've overlooked this gem, buried in all the hype of Tarantino's other classics, you're really really missing out."

","Jackie Brown is the first Quentin Tarantino movie I ever saw, and I loved it. In my opinion, Tarantino is one of the best crime directors around today, along with Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma. Jackie Brown is an excellent movie all-round, with an all-star cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda etc. <br/><br/>However, theactors who really stole the show were Pam Greir and Robert Forster.With this being their second collaboration together, Greir and Forsterare the perfect duo in the movie's web of deceit and betrayal. The script and directing by Quentin Tarantino are amazing, with lots of crisp dialogue in Tarantino fashion. I'm disappointed that this Tarantino classic isn't among the IMDb Top 250 like all his other works, because this movie certainly deserves it.<br/><br/>Overall, a must-see movie for both fans of Quentin Tarantino and lovers of a good, original crime flick."
"butterfinger","Null","2","4","23 November 2004"," QT's Best--SPOILERS
","Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's opera. Most critics and audiences were disappointed by the film, expecting another one of QT's bloodbath exercises.<br/><br/>I can't understand how a clever, empty style-fest like Pulp Fiction could've been praised as a masterpiece while others are actually disappointed to see that Tarantino has decided to slow down and focus on his characters. Here we have the same play on old 70's gangster clichés as in Pulp and Reservoir Dogs. However, it is done with depth (which critics didn't notice), flow (which bored critics), and refinement (which really made critics mad). I'm sad to say that those who are expecting Pam Grier to whip out a shotgun and preach the Bible will be disappointed. Here we have a story about what happens to gangsters in their old age, when they get worn out by an intense profession. That's not all it is about; each character in the ensemble has his own story. Grier, as Jackie Brown, is scared about the future, with a lousy job as an airline stewardess and a drug charge hanging over her head; she is also getting old and fears that her 'foxy brown' image might be wearing thin. Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) is a gun dealer who wants to retire, but is such a megalomaniac that few of his friends actually trust him; the odds of him ever being able to comfortably settle down are slim to none. He is also concerned about his partner, Louis (Robert De Niro), who just got out of the joint and seems to have lost the street-smarts (and even the regular smarts) that he had before he went away. Bridget Fonda is Melanie, Ordell's mistress of sorts, whose life has slowed down; she spends her time doing drugs, watching TV, and scheming against Ordell. Max Cherry (Robert Forster) is a by-the-book bail bondsman who is fifty-six years old and is thinking about getting into a scheme with Jackie. <br/><br/>The only main character without too much depth is Ray Nicolette (played by Michael Keaton, who plays the same character in Steven Soderbergh's dazzling Out of Sight); Michael Keaton plays him memorably though. Grier gives a triumphantly good performance, blending her 70's funky (albeit tacky) style and wonderful charisma with great classic melodrama. Robert Forster is just as good in a subtler and more poignant performance; what is most likable about his character is that the two main reasons he starts thinking about scheming against Ordell with Jackie is that (a.) he loves her and (b.) he wants to get his young genre-cool back. Samuel L. Jackson drops his flashiness-for-the-sake-of-flashiness from Pulp Fiction and plays a sad, lonely man in a world filled with friends who hate his guts. He wants to trick everyone into thinking that he is Jules, from Pulp, and tries to justify his life in front of others. But, in the end, he is a toothless rat, threatening others in a feeble and desperate tone of voice. <br/><br/>De Niro and Fonda are both funny in a relationship that turns for the worse and ends in a way that reminds us how fickle a life the crook can lead, one where relationships can shift on the whim of one's viscera. Spike Lee and others were infuriated by Tarantino's constant use of the n-word in the film, mostly by Samuel L. Jackson. This criticism misses the point of what QT is trying to do: degrade the n-word. The characters use it, and re-use, until it is drained of its terrible power. It is the kind of wonderful liberation that a nihilist like Spike Lee could never understand. Based on Rum Punch by Elmore Leonard, Jackie Brown is packed with twists and with characters discussing their next betrayal to the extent that we are never sure who is being lied to. But each twist means something to each character, which makes the film great. Tarantino is famous for his dialogue, yet his dialogue is not the kind of clever crook-talk that someone like David Mamet delivers; it is funny without the characters knowing that it is funny (the kind of funny that Elmore Leonard has always loved). Tarantino is really an old-fashioned gangster filmmaker, like Raoul Walsh, who doesn't rely on clever lines as much as casual cheer (such as the scene in Walsh's The Roaring Twenties in which James Cagney stuffs a cigar in someone's mouth). He has a love for cynical movies in a humanistic and joyful way that makes him rise above the filmmakers he loves. He cares about every character in Jackie Brown and is sad when one gets killed."
"joe_d_o","Null","2","4","27 October 2004"," surprising
","I saw Jackie Brown last nite for the first time and was quite surprised. It was unlike any other QT film and very good. Unfortunately, for me, the first QT film I saw was Pulp Fiction which I admired, but never really liked. I thought it was a bit overblown and wanted to shoot some of the characters to shut them up! And I found it gratuitously violent and gross.<br/><br/>That being said, I've since seen Reservoir Dogs, KB I & 2, and this and my opinion of QT has greatly risen. In fact, I even like Pulp Fiction more! I found Reservoir Dogs to be the early masterpiece...the leaner, cleaner Pulp Fiction without all the bloat. <br/><br/>So I was quite surprised at how sweet and empathetic Jackie Brown was. As in all his movies, all the actors are superb. The movie is a bit long, but it is also very generous with its story and with the actors. I think actors must love working for him. The script is smart, clever, insightful, and talky in an entertaining and not annoying way. <br/><br/>I found Pam Grier to be wonderful and Robert Forster to be a revelation. If your heart isn't broken for him at the end of the movie, then you aren't human. He is so decent and yes, lovable, in a tough-ass film-noir dick way. Samuel Jackson is great (where'd he get that hair! and goatee...according to IMDb, he thought up his look). Bridget Fonda and Robert DiNiro were funny. Michael Keaton was great though his role was small. <br/><br/>The denouement was masterfully paced and plotted, with typical QT time-lapses and jumping back and forward again in the action. <br/><br/>And the final scene between Pam Grier and Robert Forster, was as I said heartbreaking, as well as real. It is unusual that QT should have such compassion for such middle-aged washed-up losers looking for another stab at meaning and doing it right in their fucked up lives.<br/><br/>Also loved the scene between DiNiro and Jackson, when DiNiro in his incoherent stoned way is trying to tell Jackson that he did indeed shoot Bridget Fonda! Classic QT.<br/><br/>I give this film a 8.5 out of 10 (a few points off for because it could have been edited).<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, and if I forgot to mention, the music is da bomb! I had the soundtrack for years before I saw the movie, and I just loved it. It was great to see it now and see where the songs fit in and the dialogue. Loved the scene when they're all going to the mall at the end, and DiNiro's car is playing Midnight Confession, and Forster's car is playing the Delfonics, Didn't I Blow Your Mind (a song that desperately needed re-discovery, thank you Quentin), and Jackie's car is playing Streetlife! QT is BRILLIANT when it comes to use of music in his films and soundtracks. And of course, the scene when Robert Forster first meets Jackie as he's bailing her out, and QT plays Natural High. <br/><br/>Great, great film!"

","Jackie Brown was not a bad movie, but just a disappointment, since I was expecting so much more from a Quentin Tarantino movie.  The movie still had the same style to it as all of Tarantino's other films, but the movie was a lot different and not as enjoyable as Tarantino's other films.  Of course, this movie was based on a novel, so Tarantino didn't write it, he just wrote the script.  The story is too drawn out, but the acting and directing are excellent, and there are a few very cool scenes that make the movie worth while.  Sam Jackson plays a very funny part, and it was fun to see Robert De Niro in a Tarantino film.  Both actors, as always, played their roles very well.  It was a treat to see Michael Keaton in the film, as well as Chris Tucker.  I'd rate Jackie Brown right beneath Kill Bill Vol. 2 as far as Quentin Tarantino films go.  This was not a bad movie, just a little disappointing and too drawn out.  If you rented the movie, you might want to watch it half at a time so that you won't get bored out of your mind during certain scenes.  Seven stars out of ten."
"kida_fish","8","2","4","23 August 2003"," QUINTESSENTIAL TARANTINO
","Honestly, this movie doesn't match the brilliance of its predecessor, PULP FICTION. However, this movie is still a Quentin Tarantino flick. Great directors have their own style: their movies may fall into particular rubrics, but they have a unique identity of their own, creating a different blend of movies, confirming rigidly to their specific style. Quentin Tarantino has his own way of directing and conceptualizing his movies, and JACKIE BROWN, has all the sine qua nons of a trademark Quentin' movie.<br/><br/>To begin with, the combination of American & African-American gangster pair still continues on from its predecessor. Even this pair of gangsters (Robert De Niro and Samuel L Jackson) is as ruthless and unemotional as the pair (Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta) in PULP FICTION, in executing gory killings. The plot is pretty simple: A female flight attendant, working hand-in-glove with an arms dealer tries to trick him and loot him of his own money. Within the execution of the plot, one is bombarded with the quintessential Tarantino': great dirty' dialogues, brilliant retro music, (instead of using background scores, Quentin uses songs) detached & controlled butcherly violence, and of course, the bohemian funny nature of the characters. <br/><br/>Though pretty much in the same lines as PULP FICTION, JACKIE BROWN isn't as inane and mindless as its precursor. Far from his 1994 attempt, which is a classic, Quentin's 1997 attempt, though not in the ranks of PULP FICTION, is still a fantastically made Tarantino' flick.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Continuing on with my revisit of Quentin Tarantino's back catalogue lands us on ""Jackie Brown"", the least Tarantino feeling movies he's done.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is an airline hostess who's caught transporting money back from Mexico for LA gun dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L Jackson). Trying to stay out of Jail, she cuts a deal with ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) to catch Ordell with the money in return for her immunity. But knowing that Ordell is a dangerous man she comes up with another plan, to keep his money for herself, but that plan requires the co-operation of bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster).<br/><br/>That feeling that this isn't really a Tarantino movie is hard to shake. Partialy, I think it's because despite only being three films in, he already had a preferred cast of collaborators, a repertory theatre if you like, but ""Jackie Brown"" has a cast of actors he was using for the first time, and then mostly wouldn't use again. It also doesn't sound like a Tarantino film, the dialogue is rarely as snappy as in the previous two films, I'm not sure , but I wonder if that's because he's adapting the Elmore Leonard book and isn't quite as free as he otherwise would be to write what he likes. The use of music is different too, it's quieter and relegated to real times you would hear music, car radios, in stores and bars. It looks like a Tarantino film though, in terms of shot choice and Sally Menke's editing.<br/><br/>None of that goes to say that the film isn't good, or even great. It's a lengthy character driven twisty thriller. The performances are generally pretty good, although I don't much care for De Niro's lazy mumbling turn as one of Robbie's friends. But whenever Grier, Jackson or Robert Forster are on screen it really shines. Despite its length it flies by fairly quickly and arrives at a satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>I was hoping to have the experience that others appear to have had with ""Jackie Brown"" and rediscovered this as the underappreciated classic and becoming their favourite Tarantino film - unfortunately, though I really liked the film, I still don't feel that way about it."

The film has many rather good performances, most notably Pam Grier as Jackie Brown herself, as well as Robert Forster and Robert De Niro. The film is very humorous, and its setting is less glamorous than other Tarantino films, but it certainly is a fresh and unique perspective. It's soundtrack is very good, and the films cinematography is quite interesting. The film's biggest flaw however, is its slow nature and pacing throughout. It proves to keep its head enough to be mildly entertaining, but the film does have its share of dull moments scattered throughout. The writing is decent for the most part, but at times feels a little too drawn out, and takes away from the interesting nature it has going for it.

All the while, Ordell seems to have some tricks up his sleeve (keeping Jackie and the audience well on the edge of their seat) while a fresh plan is hatched for another smuggling. It's the only film Quentin has brought to the screen based off a separate original source, based on the book 'Rum Punch' by Elmore Leonard, and as far as I'm aware it's a very faithful adaptation produced beautifully for the big screen, keeping Tarantino's glorious style well in tact. It cemented Jackson as the ultimate actor to deliver the distinctive dialogue. The entire cast are amazing and despite its impressive 2 hours and 30 minutes length, I could've happily sat and watched these characters for longer. Pam Grier creates a career defining role and she shines so brightly here; a great screen presence.

One day she is caught and the agents offer her a deal in order to apprehend Robbie. Robbie, however, is onto the threat and tries to have Brown eliminated. What follows is a dangerous game of bluff, deceit and betrayal.""<br/><br/>REVIEW:
Recently watched Jackie Brown which is an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1992 novel Rum Punch. It is the only feature-length film that Tarantino has adapted from a previous work. It was hilarious, goofy and the overall humor was used pretty well, it was mostly a regular crime drama. Some people might claim it to be Tarantino's weakest or second weakest film but I don't think that's really the case here. In my opinion this was Tarantino's one of the most realistic and grounded work, the characters felt real and almost believable. Although the direction was great but didn't really liked the adapted screenplay, the whole narrative seemed lackluster but it's presentation somewhat made it better. Some sequences felt incomplete as if something was missing. It would've be alot better if some of the areas of the plot would've been explored more. It was less Tarantino-ish rather it felt like more of a regular crime drama with little to no violence / gore which imo was a great idea as it was somewhat different and showcased QT's potentials even more. It mainly focused on the characters rather than the plot itself. The characters were written really well and were acted even better. Subtle and realistic acting is one of the reasons to watch this movie. A combination of Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson & Robert De Niro really worked their charm in bringing the best out of their characters especially Pam Grier, definitely a topnotch performance, really loved her character. And secondly I thought QT's used Samuel L. Jackson's character really well and the way Jackson acted it was something admirable, it was a memorable antagonist.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown will surely grow on you and you may have to watch certain parts more than once to grasp it but it all comes together in the last hour but they didn't really handled the thrill and suspense of the film that accurately as at times it felt sluggish but maybe it was because the runtime was a bit long. Also wasn't really satisfied with the ending, I mean it was good and all but it could've been alot more interesting and convincing than it was. Cinematography was good but the camerawork was even better. Another notable thing was the color palette, it provided a grim and eye catching look to the movie. The soundtracks really had a Tarantino-esque vibe and they synced pretty well with the whole universe and vibe of the film.<br/><br/>Overall the movie had a few shortcomings but mostly subjective depending upon person to person. Finally I'd say the film was a different experience as far as QT's filmography goes and one might consider it as an underrated flick. It was an enjoyable, funny and a hilarious ride. If you're looking for a movie to enjoy and lighten the mood then definitely go for it. Not a masterpiece but definitely a great movie.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: 8/10"

This movie has a charming 50's-70's L.A. flair about it thanks to the settings, costumes, props and music.<br/><br/>The last 53 minutes were very thrilling. I had a lot of possible outcomes in my mind which is something I love in a movie. Bravo Tarantino & Co. Good one!"

"tdrish","7","0","0","10 January 2020"," Better then I expected
","Jackie Brown is better then I expected, however, I have to question all the praise that it's gotten even after all these years. Granted, its well crafted, its pretty solid, I liked how the stories inter weaved into sort of a slick, mystery paced thriller, but there's just a few things that brought down the rating for me. Let's start with the length of the movie. Did they really need to drag this out to a two and half hour movie? The answer, quite simply, is NO. This could have been wrapped up an hour and 45 minutes tops, and still have been a great movie. Jackie Brown is pretty much set in 70's style, and the setting for the time line is spot on excellent. The story sort of bops from one thing to the other, but its cleverly interlaced, almost feels like a tailor flawlessly sewing the film together, into an intricate, crime spree plot that keeps the viewer watching. Again! Some of the things that brought down the rating. Did they have to use the word over 30 times. Nope! Maybe they could have uttered it 3, 5 times tops. Still would have been a great movie. I understand this is the way people talked in the 70's, however, I strongly suspect that Tarantino abused the priviledge, given his history I would call a rap sheet, now if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, but I really don't believe I am. He purposely goes for the over the top feel of it all, and Jackie Brown is no exception to almost all of his movies. Some scenes are prolonged, stretched out....for example, a scene finds a man singing the same song over and over in his car, for no reason at all. There's a scene where a woman wipes her dirty feet on a wine glass.....now, I have to question why all these scenes are there, for no reason at all, and yet the reason is all too clear: It's just an excuse to beef up the time. Period. Why, I may ask, when your film would have been fine if you removed all the fat and just left the meat. Many viewers may overlook or justify all these scenes, but I myself have to question it. Altogether, this is a film that examines the ""make you or break you"" for one person in general, and the outcome that affects the many people around her. It kept my attention, it kept my watching.....but I just have to question that it got this much praise. It was good, but it wasn't that good. I'm going to give Jackie Brown 7 out of 10 stars. Worth a look? Absolutely. Many will disagree with my review, and I'm perfectly okay with that. There's other reviews that can deter your attention from what I'm pointing out. Use them freely."

","There was good acting, decent development of the main characters and an interesting plot however the film went on for far too long, making it very boring at times, given its rather simple plot. 90 minutes would suit it better than 150 minutes so it was overdrawn by something like one hour. Tarantino has an inclination for needlessly long conversations in his films.<br/><br/>Also be aware that the scene towards the end of the film in the Billingsley department store was taken three times but it was all about the same events involving the same persons though from a different perspective so don't get confused."

","Jackie Brown is a movie with a handful of really interesting and original characters backed by strong performances by pretty much every actor and actress is the film. Jackie Brown is the focal point of the film, portrayed through a solid performance by Pam Grier. Her character is likable yet a little erratic and you are never quite sure which side she's on.<br/><br/>The dialogue is prime Tarantino and turns what may be a dull scene in some films into a captivating, unpredictable one. The plot also plays out in classic Tarantino fashion: a handful of strong-willed characters are drawn into a messy situation involving a large sum of money; then there's a whole lot of build up leading to a final bloody showdown (although not quite as bloody as most of his other films). Although the plot is intriguing and keeps the viewer entertained, it does feel like it was drawn out a little longer than it could have been. The story probably could have told within a movie under two hours instead of the two and a half hour run time. However, it still is a solid film that any action or Tarantino fan needs to see. 7.5/10"

","Rarely mentioned by anyone as their favourite Tarantino film I found very little wrong with this at all to be quite honest, except possibly the runtime which is arguably the most unjust of his film career but still walks the fine line of not becoming too long and unwelcoming. The character of Jackie Brown is as you'd expect the main highlight of the film with Grier delivering an excellent performance amongst a number of others. De Niro is somehow practically sidelined by his fellow stars and Jackson really thrives as he does in any role he's had under Tarantino and steals the show with some of the greatest quotes of his individual career. The plot is as complex as you'd imagine and is as thrilling as Reservoir dogs and dare I say it pulp fiction, filled with twists and turns, double crosses and solid action leading towards an explosive climax and slightly somber end. Its hard to argue its the best of his works but if you're wanting something a little different and slightly more toned down compared to the 8 other films he's made, I'd highly recommend this"

","In many ways this film is typical but also atypical Tarantino. Nothing in the film is anything outside the realm of possibility for pre-Jackie Brown Tarantino but it's much different than his previous work. For one, the narrative is mostly linear or at least relatively linear. This compounded with the fact that the plot isn't as dense as his other work makes for a much easier story to follow. Some of the details do become a bit muddled but it isn't a serious problem. The film is defined by its characters moreso than its plot. The characters make the movie more engaging than the plot does, in my opinion. The characters are great. They're entertaining but it's not quite enough to carry the film up to the quality of its predecessors, for me."

","Jackie Brown is the only Tarantino movie - so far - based on a previous work, the book Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch. Inspired by Coffy and Foxy Brown - just look at that poster - and starring Pam Grier and Robert Forster, who hadn't had lead roles in years. Although Tarantino took liberties with the novel, Leonard loved the screenplay, saying that not only was it the best adaption of his work, but the best screenplay he'd ever read.<br/><br/>Grier had been considered for Pulp Fiction, but didn't expect Tarantino to call her back after that film was such a success. When she showed up to read for the part, Tarantino had posters of her films all over his office. That wasn't to impress her - the auteur just loved her movies that much.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown (Grier) is flight attendant for a Mexican airline who makes extra money smuggling for Ordell Robbie (Samuel Jackson), a gun runner and ne'er do well. Ordell is being watched by ATF agent Ray Nicholette (Michael Keaton, who plays the same role in Out of Sight)and LAPD detective Mark Dargus, who intercept Jackie as she returns to the US.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, one of Odell's couriers, Beaumont Livingston (Chris Tucker) is arrested and needs bailed out before he becomes an informant. Odell pays Max Cherry (Forster) for the bond, then puts Livingston in a car trunk and kills him.<br/><br/>Jackie's in jail now, which leads Odell to think she'll rat on him. He pays Max for her bond as well and the gruff older bondsman immediately falls for her. Odell comes to her house with murder on his mind, but Jackie has taken Max's gun and they make a deal - she'll pretend to help the cops while smuggling $550,000 of his money so that he can finally retire.<br/><br/>Odell's partners on this deal are his live-in girl Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda) - it's unsure if they are ever truly lovers - and his former cellmate Louis Gara (Robert De Niro). Melanie is based on Candice Rialson, the 1970's actress who was in Pets, Chatterbox!, Moonshine County Express and so many more.<br/><br/>The law has a sting to catch Odell, but Jackie plans on double crossing everyone, bringing Max in on the scam.<br/><br/>What follows is a Rashomon like accounting of each person's role in events that follow at the Del Amo Fashion Center, leaving just about everyone dead. Odell tries to take out Max and Jackie, but he's led into a trap by the ATF and killed, too. That leaves our heroine, ready to leave the country with just a goodbye kiss for Max Cherry, who isn't so sure he should stay behind.<br/><br/>This movie was pretty controversial - and still is - for the thirty-eight n-bombs thrown throughout its story. Spike Lee went as far to complain to Harvey Weinstein and Lawrence Bender, concerned that the director was ""infatuated with that word."" But Tarantino saw differently saying, ""the minute any word has that much power, as far as I'm concerned, everyone on the planet should scream it. No word deserves that much power."" Samuel L. Jackson, who has worked with Lee, defended Tarantino.<br/><br/>I kind of love that Sid Haig shows up to play a judge in this movie. I don't know that he's ever been on that side of the law before.<br/><br/>As for the characters, Louis and Ordell first appeared in Elmore Leonard's novel The Switch. It's a story about them kidnapping a millionaire's wife, only to discover he doesn't want her back. In the book Rum Punch, they complain that a movie producer stole their idea and made Ruthless People."

The story had Jackie trying to find a way to get her life back together by getting money as a way of living better. I will say that Sam Jackson was great in the film as Otto since this marked his second collaboration with Quentin and later on for the popular diagnosis unchained. It Also features stellar performances from Robert deniro and Michael Jackson,bit even features Chris tucker in a rather hilarious cameo. It is a film that developed a cult following worthy of viewing,"

The movie is so stylish, so good, and has the most fleeting of all characteristics...it so, so COOL. It is a lot slower than a normal Tarantino flick, and will never be recognized as an all-time great flick, but I really thought it was fantastic. I saw it 17 years after it was released for the first time, upon my best friend's recommendation, and I was not disappointed. If you come in expected a repeat of Pulp Fiction with Pam Grier as a stand-in, you will not be happy. But, if you come in with an open mind, and ready to have fun, you're in for a treat. This movie has more depth, more substance, and has more one-liners that you and your friends will repeat than any other Tarantino flick. Give it a chance, don't look at it as a Pulp Fiction II, and you will be very happy...because this movie is the Webster's definition of a Soul Train line; it is SOOO, SOOO cool.

","I have never seen a Quentin Taratino movie that I have yet hated. All his movies are filled with witty dialog, a great cast, and a well-written script. That is no exception for this movie, Jackie Brown. This wonderful film is actually one of his underrated films. When people talk Quentin, they always talk about Pulp Fiction or Inglourious Basterds never this film. This is a gritty crime film that is actually worth watching just for the dialog alone.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is about how six different people could end up with a lot of money if they are the first to get it. We have a shady gun salesman, a lonely jail bond guy, a no-nonsense airline clerk, a coke-happy girl, an honest cop, and another shady guy just released from jail after serving time for bank robbery.<br/><br/>What is always good about Quentin is that he knows how to cast his movies. That proves to be no exception here. I just loved the main cast and their personalities. If I had to choose, I would have picked Samuel L. Jackson as my favorite character in this film. I'm happy to say that this film also resurrected Pam Grier's career and got Robert Forster recognized by the Academy.<br/><br/>Overall, this is almost the perfect Quentin film. It has the well-written dialog and the great chemistry between the actors. This film reminded me of Pulp Fiction style-wise, but it has a whole new tone to it. I rate this film 9/10."

","Although I'm a Tarantino fan since his second film's bloody pulp through the Germanic villains of his last, going back to his six coloured dogs and forward again to Beatrix Kiddo, I've always looked at Jackie Brown with a certain unease. Like this was the black sheep on Tarantino's family. As to be fair, I decided to give it another shot, after all, Quentin has been trying hard enough. He probably deserves it.<br/><br/>The initial frames make me think immediately that this movie has grown old, fast. This is not an old movie.

In other words, if life gives you lemons, you work as a cash courier back and forth Mexico for a badass gun runner (Ordell Robbie, played by Samuel L. Jackson). In one of these trips, she is caught.

","Although not one of QT's most talked about works, Jackie Brown is Tarantino at his best. Everything about this movie works. From the start, with it's long following shot of Pam Grier walking along in her Flight Attendants uniform, Jackie Brown is primarily character driven. It doesn't seek to be action or fantasy orientated, it's not gung-ho or overly clever and there are no mystery sub plots where the viewer has to wait for the end for the pieces to be tied together, (although there is some beautifully crafted surprises along the way). It's just a great character driven ""book"" brought to life by the master of dialogue rich films. Sure it's violent in places, it's an homage to the blaxploitation films of American urban 70's low life after all, but throughout, it's theme is simply what happens to Jackie. A hard working but lonely, although still beautiful middle aged woman who's life has inexplicably passed her by and her attempt to augment her low wage and raise her low self esteem with some easy ill-gotten gains, the police investigation into what happens after and an unlikely but very believable mixed race pseudo-romance with a white bail bondsman. What intricacies there are to the plot, features incredible supporting roles from Robert De Niro, Brigit Fonda and Samuel Jackson amongst others. All of whom are exceptional here.<br/><br/>The musical score throughout is perfect (as always with QT) and in the end, the ultimate pay off being that although Jackie Brown gets away with it and the bad guys are gone, her crime means that she has to walk away (well drive away) from her chance of happiness.<br/><br/>Great film, great cast, great score and great fun.

"moviestar26","Null","0","0","26 July 2011"," Tarantino's honest contribution to Noir
","Quentin Tarantino is a force that can't be reckoned with. When I was at grad school I discovered his movies and became an instant fan. I truly appreciated his understanding and perception of cinema. His individual style has been very unique from the beginning. Not many directors have managed to replicate or plagarise his work at all. Many have made Tarantino esque movies, but they have never lived up to becoming a huge success. His vision has been shared many times with Robert Rodriguez, with whom he has made joint collaborations. It has almost seemed like Tarantino has a patented license for all his works. <br/><br/>Since his debut feature 'my best friend's birthday', it was evident that had talent not only as a write but also as a director. His first big feature 'Reservoir dogs' set his career in to motion from the outset. 'Pulp Fiction' later followed which won multiple awards. Many have regarded it as one of the best movies of all time. Unfortunately the recent 'Inglorious Basteards' didn't receive my approval. But I understood that he enjoys to experiment with different genres of movies. I'm eagerly awaiting his next venture 'Django'. <br/><br/>'Jackie Brown' is his third directed movie. And it follows in the traditional crime and gangster theme. Upon viewing this feature it is evident that it was his tribute to the 70s blaxploitation cinema. Movies such as 'Superfly' and 'Snatch' still create echos to this day on. And Tarantino has given his offering. He has also incorporated his witty humour. The movie also helped to relaunch Pam Grier's movie career. Many still remember her from the 70's movie 'Coffy' and 'Foxy Brown'. Her portrayal of the bad revenge seeking woman is still very memorable to some. However she doesn't exactly get chance to relive those moments due to the different nature of this movie. This is an adaptation of Elmore Leanord's novel 'Rum Punch'. Tarantino has changed the location from Florida to California. The novel also had a blonde white woman as it's central character. He has cleverly managed to alter a few elements of the novel while still maintaining it's authenticity. <br/><br/>The movie doesn't fall in to one category immediately. There is a atmosphere of noir as well as crime elements. The central theme involves a pair of cops that intend on apprehending a gun runner with the help of a flight attendant. She has a choice whether or not to cooperate. Not giving assistance means spending a few years in prison due to possession of illegal drugs. I fell that this is the closest that Tarantino could come to making a noir movie. Many of the conventional noir aspects exist, right from the double crosses to the deceitful female characters. And the main theme surrounding cash and deception is at the top of the list here. However one of the most common elements such as extra marital affair scenario does not exist. Every character is very well depicted and each contribute positively to the plot. <br/><br/>SPOILERS Ordell (Samuel Jackson) is a gun runner who profits from selling unlicensed and unregistered firearms. One day a associate of his is arrested by the authorities. Ordell approaches a bails bondsman Max Cherry (Roberty Forster) to get the young guy's bail. But his real intention is to murder him so that he doesn't say anything to the police that would place his life in jeopardy. Ordell is reunited with his old accomplice De Niro and also has a female woman Melanie (Bridget Fonda) to help out with the odd jobs occasionally. Meanwhile a flight attendant Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is stopped by two cops to be checked and searched. They discover a sachet of cocaine and a few bundles of hard cash. She delivers money to Ordell through her airline flights. And is asked to cooperate with the authorities to bring Ordell to justice otherwise spending a few years behind bars. She accepts and the plan is to apprehend him after a cash delivery is to be made. However Jackie has plans of her own and decides to keep the money and share it with Max, but the authorities will be unaware of this. Meanwhile Melanie become devious too as she wishes to take the money also. Unfortunately all does not go as planned and Melanie is shot by De Niro. The money was taken by Max and after Ordell discovers about this from De Niro, he is killed too. Jackie and the cops devise a plan again, this time to get Ordell to come for the money and so they can make the move on him. END OF SPOILERS <br/><br/>With a running time of 2 hours 30 minutes the movie does seem pretty heavy going. But Tarantino has incorporated all the small detail from the novel so there is nothing lacking. I found that there was a dramatic atmosphere absent in the movie. One scene progresses to the next at a steady pace, But the sheer quality is at the surprising moments, for example De Niro's death scene. The director makes many scenes effective even without the use of a background score. The 70's soundtrack compliments many scenes nicely. Clearly this is an example of substance over style as Tarantino has concentrated on narrating a story rather than just throwing style in our faces. While viewing the movie I had a strange thought that this felt like a combination of two movies put together. 'Bound' and 'Pulp Fiction' came to mind instantly. The money scenario from Bound and the undercover cop from Reservoir dogs.<br/><br/>I could not help but noticing that Bridget Fonda, De Niro and Samuel L Jackson's characters were lacking common sense to a small extent in their roles. They weren't capable of achieving their intentions like they should have."

","Most Tarantino fans agree that Pulp Fiction is Tarantino's greatest work, due to its wackiness and over the top violence and humour. I won't disagree there, but Jackie Brown another of Tarantino's films is just as good personally. Yes it is lacking some things in Pulp Fiction, more in order to make space for a more entwining storyline and also to interlink characters more. Jackie Brown is about a 44 year old stewardess Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) who is caught by the ATF and law enforcement ferrying cash for a Los Angeles based gun dealer Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) who is making a killing in profits selling all kinds of guns to very sour and dangerous people. <br/><br/>She is given a choice; help the authorities nail Ordell or face hard serious jail-time and here begins her story. She chooses to nail Ordell for the cops, in exchange for no prison time and immunity. Beginning her sting, to let the cops catch Ordell with his hands on the money she begins to hatch her own plan of taking Ordell's $500,000 dollars for herself. Alike to Pulp Fiction we see the spanning storyline from different perspectives and viewpoints of those of Jackie, Ordell, and even the lower characters of the world including a Bail-Bondsman and a newly released con friend of Ordell's.<br/><br/>Tarantino makes us in the end root for Jackie Brown to get her hands on Ordell's money, as we being to like her and understand her predicament due to Ordell's activities. We see him as a cowardly brutal businessman who in the end would rather shoot one of his people dead, than allow them to live and risk prison. Tarantino shoots Jackie Brown alike to how he shot Pulp Fiction, with very gritty environments and set-pieces, moving from one to another to piece in another character's story.<br/><br/>The violence isn't regular, but when it comes along its just right to get across the scene like when Ordell shoots dead one of his own people when they risk a big prison sentence, or when Robert De Niro's character flips out shooting dead Ordell's annoying girlfriend. These scenes are quickly shot, and you are taken to another character's point of view.<br/><br/>Maybe Jackie Brown to some hardcore die-hard Tarantino fans is not his best work but to some its one of his best, alongside Pulp Fiction. The cast is great, with searing performances from Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson and even Robert De Niro in supporting roles, however one that even surprised me was Robert Forster's performance as the bail bondsman who gets close to Jackie Brown and helps her swindle the $500,000 from under Ordell's nose. His performance was quite good, and at a point almost stole the show from Samuel L. Jackson. Jackie Brown is a great film in Tarantino's long run of works."

","The more times I see this movie the more I like it. To me, that is the trademark of a truly exceptional director. Quentin Tarentino hits another grand slam with ""Jackie Brown"" and homage to the ""Blackspotation"" movies of the 1970's. I really like this movie! The cast is fantastic, not one weak performance in any of the characters, Pam Grier is in top form in the tittle role and comes across as nothing but genuine. Samuel L. Jackson, as always, gives a mesmerizing performance as Ordell. Supporting players Robert DeNiro and Brige Fonda, are spot on. As for Robert Forrester, Man, I have never scene him give a better performance. He hits just the right tone as Max Cherry. The dialoge, as always in a Tarentino film, keeps you enthralled from beginning to end. One of my favorite scene has to be when Ordell,( Sam Jackson), has just shot Beuamont and is showing him to Lewis, (DeNiro), Here is A sample of the dialog. ""Who' that"" ""Thats Beuamont"" ""Who's Beamont? ""An Employee that I had to let go."" Love it! Quentin Tarentino does not churn out a movie every year or every two years. He is a master craftsmen, who like Stanley Kubrick, makes a movie when he finds something that interests him. I think that Tarentino will go on for decades to come and not amass large numbers of films but will leave a body of treasured gems. Mr. Tarentino, I salute you sir, To me you are on the same level of Stanley Kubrick! You take all the time you want, I know I will not be disappointed."
"Mr_Censored","9","0","0","2 November 2009"," Taratino's Coming of Age
","""Jackie Brown,"" Quentin Tarantino's third feature length film, finds the writer/director at perhaps his most straight-forward and mature. While he rejects the notion that he is maturing as a film-maker in an interview featured on the DVD, it is quite obvious that the man who created such cult classics as ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" was out to prove he wasn't merely a one-trick pony, and it paid off in one of his most character driven and rewarding efforts to date.<br/><br/>Adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel, ""Rum Punch,"" ""Jackie Brown"" is the story of an aging stewardess (Pam Grier) in trouble with the law who concocts a scheme to rip off an arms dealer (Samuel L. Jackson) of a cool $500,000. She of course needs the help of a bail bondsman (Robert Forster) whose midlife crisis takes a backseat to the crush he develops for her. On the surface, it appears to be just another heist film, but underneath all the layers, at its core, ""Jackie Brown"" is an unlikely love story from probably the last director you'd expect. While the job and the way it's carried out is a big part of the film, Tarantino knows well enough to allow his characters ample time to breathe, making it the sort of film where you forget for a while who you're watching and simply appreciate the unique personalities they bring to life.<br/><br/>It also helps, of course, that the film is filled to brim with a great cast of old and new, obscure and respectable. Robert De Niro has perhaps one of the most entertaining roles as an ex-con who keeps to himself, silently observing and judging the world he is getting reacquainted with. Bridget Fonda plays Samuel L. Jackson's sex-pot/pot-head surfer girl girlfriend with a dry sense of humor that bounces well off of De Niro's stone-cold demeanor. Grier and Forster, who were both dragged from the depths of obscurity only to find their careers slightly revitalized for the film are both in top form and go a long way in driving home the human nature of the plot. Michael Keaton, playing an ATF agent who would later appear as the same character in 1998's ""Out of Sight,"" is perhaps one of the film's greatest surprises, as he is in turns quirky and overly confident, while being clueless all the while.<br/><br/>While fans of Tarantino's more notorious fare will have a hard time seeing the brilliance of ""Jackie Brown,"" it's a film that will no doubt please the palate of the viewer who craves rich characters, natural pacing and an engrossing plot, not to mention a killer soundtrack. Out of all of Tarantino's work, this is the one that is the most grounded in reality and, aside from Forster's Oscar nomination, deserved much more acclaim and credit than it was given. In a way, this is the cult classic in Tarantino's league of cult classics, and a film that certainly holds up time and time again."
"Red-Barracuda","10","0","0","7 August 2009"," Tarantino's difficult 3rd movie
","After the unforgettable twin strike that was Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino did the only sensible thing he could and that was to make a solid third film. He couldn't possibly top his first two movies so, instead, made a less flashy character driven crime flick. Furthermore, he reigned in his style more by basing his film on another source (Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch) as opposed to another of his original screenplays, although admittedly much of the dialogue has been rewritten by Tarantino; the story, however, remains much the same. What emerges is the most mature work in the director's career. It isn't as good as the more personal Dogs or Fiction but it's definitely an excellent crime movie and a great adaption of the book.<br/><br/>Elmore Leonard's books are full of snappy dialogue and cool characters. They are prime material for a director like Tarantino, and so it proves here. Samuel Jackson returns from his star-making turn in Pulp Fiction to take on the role of Ordell, the charismatic gun dealer. He is ably supported by Robert De Niro in a very unglamorous role as Ordell's sidekick and Brigitte Fonda as his waster girlfriend. But the movie possibly belongs to the two less famous performers Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Both are sensational, contributing multi-layered performances. Where Forster gives the movie its heart, Grier is its driving force. It could be argued that the film as a whole is Tarantino's tribute to Pam Grier and the blaxploitation film genre. Grier certainly justifies QT's adulation and delivers the goods. It's also a great and unusual thing to see a relationship between a middle-aged man and woman being the core of a film directed by a hip young film-maker, or any film-maker for that matter.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed Tarantino's work since this movie, Jackie Brown proves that he can make a movie with more substance and character depth. While it may not have the sheer dynamism and fresh invention of his first two movies, it does feel more satisfying that the Kill Bills and Death Proof. I think it would be a good thing for QT to revert back to this style of film-making approach in the future, as the movies about movies approach that he has subsequently adopted can surely only end up at a dead end. Where nowadays he frequently lifts soundtracks from other films, and as a result takes you out of the movie, in his first three films he constructed his soundtracks from 60's and 70's pop songs; and this approach worked much better as this music was not solely associated with other films. Although in the case of Jackie Brown the music is sometimes taken from 70's blaxploitation films, it still doesn't seem quite so obvious. Jackie Brown comes recommended for fans of both Tarantino and crime thrillers in general. Like the book it may not have the greatest plot but its characters are well-drawn and well acted by the excellent cast. A very satisfying movie overall."

","Although it was different from the typical Quentin Tarantino movie, I'd say, Jackie Brown gave Quentin another of what I'd call a success. As always Quentin Tarantino had a great cinematography and an astonishing cast. I think the best scene is after when Jackie (Pam Grier) had been taken in and questioned by the F.B.I. Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) who had known Jackie from business, had approached and entered her house wearing the same gloves and holding the same gun that he used to kill his former client who he had bailed out of prison, just so he could get rid of him. The way the screen had the thick black line in the middle of the screen showing that the bond bailsman getting home to realise Jackie was borrowing his gun.<br/><br/>Ofcoarse the only other scene that met the standard of that one was the end when Jackie had organised the F.B.I agent (Michael Keaton) to hide in the back while Ordell walked into the trap; Jackie lying. Claiming that he had a gun. So the only witness who would testify was shot on the spot. Jackie Brown is a very good movie, definitely worth buying."

But I digress... The character portrayals in Jackie Brown were very believable. Not as hip or memorable as in other Tarrantino movies, but enjoyable nonetheless. The movie was too long, but the time flies right by. The only thing I didn't understand was why did Max go back to the bondsmen business after he decided to get out of it?

","Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight attendant, who is legitimately employed, and earns $16,000/yr, and works a second job by delivering money (over $10,000) to Samuel L. Jackson, who is an arms dealer, with a ""crack ho"" beach bunny, portrayed by Bridget Fonda.  Jackie Brown might not be your average flight attendant; she is a convicted felon, busted for carrying drugs for her husband, and in her current profession, she smuggles and delivers money to Ordell Robbie (Jackson).  Eventually, she gets busted (for carrying $50,000 and possession of cocaine), but this is just the beginning. The portrayal of Ordell Robbie is another reference to the innovator, who engages in illegitimate sub rosa goals to achieve success, much like Al Capone and Meyer Lansky. The real-life criminals like Capone or Lansky is similar to the portrayals of the fictional characters Tony Montana (Scarface), Nino Brown (New Jack City), Dylan Malone (Catch Me If You Can), or the kid from Fresh (1994).    <br/><br/>Jackie Brown might be the only Quentin Tarantino flick that stands alone from his other films, like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.  One thing that I noticed was that the recurring alumni (e.g. Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, and Tarantino himself) weren't casted.  Samuel L. Jackson was the only Tarantino alumni that was in the film, but he did another breakthrough by casting Hollywood has-beens (e.g. Robert Forester, Pam Grier, Sid Haig, and Michael Bowen) from 70s and 80s films and TV shows (e.g. Sharky's Machine, Across 110th Street, Detroit 9000, Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, Mean Streets, martial arts classics, and numerous 1970's-era blaxploitation films).  Maybe it was the videos that Tarantino might have viewed while being employed as a video store clerk back in the 1980s.  <br/><br/>She has a choice of serving time, or cooperate with the cops, to bring down Ordell Robbie.  Excellent plot twists, especially when Robbie threatens Max Cherry (Robert Forester) in his Cadillac.  Lots of cameos in this Tarantino flick, like Chris Tucker (who ends up killed in the trunk of an Oldsmobile), and Aimee Graham (Heather Graham's younger sister) as a sales lady in a department store.  She REALLY looks like a clone of her sister from Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, without the shagadelic attitude!  Another thing that I noticed was the Tarantino trademark of 70s music, especially R & B/funkadelic tunes like Across 110th Street (Bobby Womack), Didn't You Blow Your Mind This Time (The Delfonics), and Street Life (Randy Crawford)."

","I've seen this one over ten times; gets better with age. Superb acting from the entire cast, especially from Jackson. He turns the scumbag Ordell Robbie into an even more complex character than Tarantino had in mind when he wrote the screenplay. It's a  brilliant characterization of a 'bad guy' who is not stereotypical and has intelligence. How do you hold your own when acting with a genius like Jackson? Just ask Robert Forster, who gave life to Max Cherry and was equally as phenomenal. Either one of them could and should have won an Oscar for their performances, in a better world where awards are given for quality and not media blitzes and popularity.  Keaton, De Niro, and Fonda have less to do, but they knew that going in and do similarly fantastic jobs, while never showing off in their understated roles. Grier, on the other hand, while demonstrating that she can hold her own amongst such heavyweights, simply can't handle the grilling scenes in the ATF offices. She doesn't have the acting skill to get it on with Keaton in an believable manner. Overall, she did fine, and didn't embarrass herself. This is one of the most enjoyable movies in the last 20 years, with a wonderful soundtrack whcih contributes to the genuine 70's feel. It's flawless, unless you're of the opinion that these characters are generally uninteresting losers, but with this kind of acting it just doesn't matter. My favorite scene is the one near the end in which Ordell tells Max a few important things in the car before heading into the bond office for the final rendezvous. This scene is two of the best in full gear..and no voices are ever raised in that fake, unbelievable 'I'm a great actor so I'm gonna yell my lines!' style. I've seen some negative comments here on IMDB for this flick, most poorly written and comparing it negatively to Pulp Fiction. Jackie Brown is the better movie, but Pulp will always be a favorite with the Tarantino fans because of not only it's brilliance but also the graphic violence and shocking scenes. People who crave this sort of stuff, and consequently put down a relatively quiet film like Jackie, are merely conditioned products of society. They thrive on fodder and garbage, and they have no idea how to interpret a movie without extremely graphic violence, especially from a director known for those qualities. It bores their tiny minds and they trip all over themselves to shout how unsuccessful the film was. Apparently, once a director makes a successful film, he is supposed to repeat himself infinitely to satisfy these mental midgets, and cannot do anything in a different style. I would venture to say that someone who disses Jackie Brown (or Eyes Wide Shut) is not worth your time arguing with; they wouldn't know quality in a film if it bit them in a certain place. Let them have their Hanks and Spielberg films, since they crave manipulation so much; we'll our Jackie Browns and stay away from them."

","This surprising adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch marked a new phase in Quentin Tarantino's career. Without the agile rhythm, the nervous and accelerated edition nor the comic and brutal characters that consecrated his previous works, Tarantino delivers a contained film, centered in the excellent cast's performance (led by two veteran actors who, although famous during the seventies, were in frank decadence, Pam Grier and Robert Forster).Robert De Niro is excellent as a cruel and merciless murderer, and in spite of having few lines and time on the screen, he should have been reminded by the Academy for this performance (the scene in which he kills Bridget Fonda is memorable) . The same can be said about Samuel L. Jackson, who plays with generous doses of humor and meanness the dangerous trafficker.

","In the fall of 1994 ""Pulp Fiction"" became an overnight sensation. Critics all over hailed it as an American masterpiece--an instant classic that generated so much excitement that it immediately spawned a generation of Tarantinos and Tarantinites in its wake.  In order to understand this phenomenon we need to turn our attention to the current state of the American cinema and compared it with the last three decades.  In the seventies the American cinema enjoyed what is arguably its golden years when it produced such masterpieces as ""McCabe & Mrs Miller"", ""The Godfather"", ""Badlands"", ""Chinatown"", ""The Godfather II"", ""The Conversation"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Nashville"", and ""Manhattan"".  In the eighties the number of masterpieces dwindled to just three films.  Apart from ""Raging Bull"" the best films were also the most underrated: ""Cutter's Way"" and ""Dangerous Liaisons"".  In the nineties the American cinema declined so precipitously that the closest thing to a masterpiece, if any, was arguably Robert Altman's ""The Player"". So when ""Pulp Fiction"" opened it was not difficult to see why the public readily embraced it as a masterpiece. It was as if the American pride was at stake and that Tarantino was perhaps the man who could restore the  public's faith in the cinema again.  Does Tarantino really deserved this kind of attention?  Maybe.  But is he a major talent?  I think not.  Tarantino's talent is somewhat suspect when one considers just how much of his own ""Reservoir Dogs"" resembles Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire"".  Was this homage or just plain theft?  In ""Pulp Fiction"" the main characters end up pointing their pistols at each other in close proximity. This classic gun-toting mexican standoff was of course gleefully appropriated from John Woo--another favorite of the director's.<br/><br/>In ""Jackie Brown"" Tarantino, this time, turns his attention on Pam Grier and the black exploitation cinema of the seventies.  But the end result of what he hopes is hip and soulful feels more like a white man's attempt to ape the moves and rhythms of someone black. Soul train on film it is not.  ""Jackie Brown"" is rhythmless, sluggish, and shapeless.  It is evident that he needs a more disciplined editor to trim the excess fat.<br/><br/>It is not that Tarantino is without talent.  He certainly has a good ear for street gutter and writes dialogue that is appropriately foul, abrasive, and wickedly funny.  But Tarantino's fondness for the lowlives, the B movies that he grew up on, is pure pulp not art no matter how good his craft is. His ludicrous screenplay for ""From Dusk to Dawn"" clearly suggests that what he truly loves is trash--which is enough to make one wonder if there is more to ""Pulp Fiction"" than all the clever chatter about redemption and the like. To put it another way, Tarantino is less than the artist he purports to be: he is a shrewd trickster, a consummate showman who is only too eager to dazzle us with his bag of tricks.  Consider the scene in which the bag of money is switched in ""Jackie Brown"".  Tarantino offers us three different viewpoints of this sequence but adds nothing significant to what we already know.  It is an editing ""trick"" he had learned so well in ""Pulp Fiction"". But when the smoke clears it is unlikely that anyone will be gullible enough to believe that the LAPD would not arrive early to prepare their sting operation.  It is the audience who will be left holding the bag.  There is no doubt that when  a man of Tarantino's talent decides to aim this low you can bet that he will surely hit his mark."

","Right off the bat I'm making one prediction about this film, and that is that a lot of hard core Tarantino fans are going to be disappointed with Jackie Brown. Why you may well ask, well simple, it's not very Tarantino like. That is to say that Jackie Brown is much more of an understated film in terms of violence, language and pop references than any of his previous work, and because of this restraint it may be somewhat of a shock to the system for those expecting another Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction or even True Romance.<br/><br/>That is not to say that this is a bad film in any way, it is in fact a very good crime thriller, very well adapted (from the Elmore Leonard novel 'Rum Punch') and directed by Tarantino, and contains some very good lead performances, especially Jackson and Grier. In fact if any film shows that Tarantino isn't just a flash in the pan, and is in fact a very good director in his own right even stripped of his usual violence and dialogue trademarks then this is it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, and it has to be said, Jackie Brown could have benefited greatly from touch more Tarantino-like visceral impact in a couple of it's key scenes, because as it stands what the film really lacks above all is a sense of impact, and without that the film never seems to hit it's peak, so all in all what the viewer is left with is a very good film, but also the feeling that with a couple of slight adjustments it could have been perhaps a really great one.<br/><br/>As for the acting Samuel L. Jackson and Pam Grier as already mentioned are both superb, while Robert Deniro, Bridget Fonda, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Michael Bowen and Chris Tucker all give good, solid performances. In fact in terms of acting I'd go so far as to say that no-one puts a single foot wrong. <br/><br/>Definitely recommended to anyone in search of a good, solid crime thriller, just don't expect the usual Tarantino and you shouldn't be disappointed.<br/><br/>

He shoots the same crucial scene from the perspective of three different characters.  His camera work is as bright and creative as usual.  But for the most part he takes his time.

","Quentin Tarantino finally knocks the ball out of the park. Widely seen as a ""disappointment""--or a ""raunchy doodle,"" as Time's Richard Corliss put it--on the time of its release, JACKIE BROWN now looks like one of the key movies of the decade, an alternately wrenching and thrillingly lowdown work wrought out of real feeling. If a seance could summon the spirits of Jack Hill, Howard Hawks and Don Siegel, this is the picture they'd make. Amplifying all Tarantino's skills--stunningly insightful casting, indelible dialogue, a mastery of oddly static yet lustrous compositions--while shearing all his adolescent, in-joky flaws, JACKIE BROWN is like a 1973 drive-in movie that's as heartbreaking as VERTIGO. Only Tarantino would have seen the potential for trashy allure and crazy comedy in Bridget Fonda, and the performance of Robert Forster as the melancholy bailbondsman Max Cherry--simple as a Noh play, all information relayed through his impassive, age-worn face--ranks among the finest of recent times. Sadly, in 1997, only Roger Ebert and Film Comment's Kent Jones really got this one; a little while later, the near-meeting of Forster and Pam Grier seems a thousand times more harrowing than those teenagers who die on that yacht."

First things first there were two good points about this film, Forster, who was rightly honoured with his Oscar nomination, and the soundtrack, with the very excellent Bobby Womack song, ""Across 110th Street"".  Jackie Brown would have benefited from being about an hour shorter as this might have forced Tarantino into cutting the dross from his script, of which there was much. Jackie Brown was a disappointment after Pulp Fiction and especially Reservoir Dogs, both scripts were notable for their punchy and fast moving dialogue, which occasionally reared its head but was soon suffocated by the ramblings of the characters.  Pam Grier does not have the acting skills to carry such a picture, she tried but ultimately failed.  Samuel L. Jackson was sufficiently asinine but I have to question whether he really fitted the part and De Niro's talents were certainly wasted."

It's also very relaxed especially the Mall scenes which just flow along showing the final coup from each perspective.  Pam Grier playing JB was sensational - a woman with great attitude but seemingly vulnerable and damn sexy.  What I loved about the relationship between JB and Max Cherry, the bailbondsman, was the way Tarantino chose to develop it i.e. just using the way they looked at each other, songs in the background. In fact the music used in this film is superb and expresses exactly the mood that Tarantino wants to convey at any moment or maybe it's the music that creates the mood.

Tarantino is not afraid to let his characters just 'be'.  Nothing much happens in the first hour of the film plot wise, he just introduces us to the characters.  And what a great collection of characters they are, superbly acted by an unlikely cast mix.  Robert De Niro having a smaller part than B-Movie star Robert Forster?

","""Jackie Brown"" was the first Tarantino film I ever saw. I saw it on an edited for television thing, so a lot of it was cut out. I also remembered I didn't enjoy it. I thought it was boring and dull to watch. But then I watched ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". They are in my top five favorite films of all time. So I decided to give ""Jackie Brown"" another try. It must have been because it was edited or something. I loved it the second time.<br/><br/>     Tarantino has always had a great deal of respect for actors. This is obvious because of all of his films. The casting of John Travolta was a stroke of genious. Hollywood had long given up on him, but Quentin new no one could be Vincent Vega quite like he could. And he was right. And now in this, the casting of Pam Grier, one of the pioneering blaxploitation stars of the early 70's, now to star as an aging gangster. That was casting genious.<br/><br/>     There is a moment in ""Jackie Brown"" that I find incredible. It is not a talking scene, or violent scene. It is the scene where Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) is sitting in a car with Robert De Niro. Ordell is so mad about an issue (I'll never tell) a vain just bulges out of his head. It is so creepy and Samuel L. Jackson proves why he is one of the greatest actors out there right now. The intensity in his eyes is so real and powerful.<br/><br/>     I am also a huge fan of the scene that is shown three times. To anyone who hasn't seen the film, that might not sound right. But believe me it works so well, it is scary. Amazing directing by Tarantino.<br/><br/>     I cannot reccomend this film enough.

","This is a truly brilliant film. It is hard to know where to start in praising it. I enjoyed Pulp Fiction, but this was in a whole other league - the gangster movie done from the point of view of an ageing black woman. What a stroke of genius! So I will go through what I loved about it:<br/><br/>music - Tarentino knows exactly what to play and when. The Delfonics track just tells you Max has fallen in love with Jackie. Also, Jackie lip synching to Street Life at the end - both incredibly affirming about how strong this woman is, yet you realise also that she's still alone..<br/><br/>mood - again, wonderful. It has the excitement of the money swap, but also wonderful slow scenes - especially those between Max and Jackie. The gentle kiss at the end - what a heartbreaker!I loved the whole 70s feel to the decor, cars, and even the choice of drinks - vodka and orange<br/><br/>theme - how unusual to see a perceptive commentary on growing older and wiser in a film about gangsters. Clothes - Jackie just looks 'too cool for school' in that suit.<br/><br/>Humour -it was also dead funny, in an unnerving kind of way. The usual Tarentino instant classic quote dialogue.<br/><br/>Pam Grier - makes an excellent sassy heroine, to place alongside those Sex and the city girls or Bridget Jones (book version obviously!) in the girl power canon, but she is far more affecting - she really has lived on the wrong side of the tracks for so long, and reading between the lines, that pilot husband of hers was a right (insert rude word here that imdb editor would not allow!)To answer the question, what do I think Jackie is doing now that one of the comments posed, well I hope she loved her trip to Spain, and was able to come back to the States, pick up her vinyls, take Max out for a slap up dinner, and then move to Brazil and party all night with men half her age. Although it would have been a happier ending if her and Max had got it on, it is all the more romantically bitter sweet that they didn't - and so they never should!"
"JawsOfJosh","9","0","0","23 May 2001"," The true Tarantino masterpiece; delivered deftly
","Who could predict that Quentin Tarantino would shrink the filmmaking skills he displayed in ""Pulp Fiction"" - arguably the most influential film of the 1990's - by releasing the decaffinated masterpiece ""Jackie Brown""?  This is simply his best film yet.  Sure, Q-Heads were expecting another wild ""Pulp"" ride, but Tarantino is too savvy to repeat himself.  Set in L.A. in 1995, the eternally sexy Pam Grier stars in the title role; a struggling, middle-age flight attendant who earns extra income as a cash courier for Ordell Robbie, a loathsome gun dealer (portrayed with usual excellence by Samuel L. Jackson).  Michael Keaton - in an unusually dry but great performance - is an ATF agent who intercepts one of Jackie's deliveries and threatens her with prison if she doesn't agree to help catch Ordell in action.  Reluctantly serving as an open ear for Jackie's fears is Robert Forster as Max Cherry, her bail bondsman.  Meanwhile, Ordell is coordinating one last transaction with his newly paroled partner, Louis Gara, played with stone-faced reticence by Robert De Niro.  Unknown to Ordell, his last big deal is the one Jackie is banking on to help catch him, get herself out of trouble, and fatten her wallet with half-a-million dollars in the process.<br/><br/>This is clearly Tarantino's most realized film, and it took guts for him to adapt an Elmore Leonard crime novel (Leonard has cited ""Jackie Brown"" as his favorite film adaptation).  After all, like Scorsese, crime is his cinematic canvas.  The film doesn't serve solely as another crime epic from Tarantino, but it doubles as his valentine to blaxploitation movies.  It's so evident in the slow, 70's style pacing, obviously Tarantino's favorite era of filmmaking - once you take away the cell phones & pagers the settings, cars, music, and wardrobe smack of the 70's completely.  Casting blaxploitation queen Pam Grier was an obvious hint, as well as the fact that half the music in the film was lifted directly from Pam Grier's 1973 classic ""Coffy"" (Tarantino also used blaxploitation regular Sig Haig in a cameo as Jackie's judge).  Like Scorsese's crime films, as well as in ""Pulp Fiction"", themes of redemption are abound.  However, in this film there is a heavy regard towards aging.  Jackie's fears throughout the film center heavily on adversities she's overcome that would be nullified if she doesn't pull herself out of this mess alive.  A question she asks early on in the film - ""How do you feel about getting old?"" - seems to be running over in her mind the entire time.<br/><br/>I've saved the best part for last.  The best element of this film has got to be the performance of Robert Forster.  He, without a doubt(!), steals the film as the world-weary Max Cherry.  Max knows all too well of life's trappings & pitfalls, but still tries to get ahead when possible, never forsaking the straight & narrow.  Only Burt Reynolds' performance in ""Boogie Nights"" could rival Forster's for best performance of 1997.  Probably the best scene in the film is the morning coffee table scene where Max & Jackie share their feelings on growing old.  It is a slow scene, played out to wonderfully lingering effect by Tarantino and I cherish his desire to focus on this couple every time I see it.  Not to spotlight Forster alone, the entire cast is wonderful.  This may be Jackson's most malevolent character ever, and De Niro never seems to bore us despite him looking comatose throughout the entire film.  Bridget Fonda is quite sexy as Ordell's dense, pot-smoking surfer girl, and the brief appearance of Chris Tucker brings uncomfortable laughter.  The soundtrack, Tarantino's usual stew of funk, country, R&B and surf music, is his best ever - a complex mix of styles. Maybe people were turned off by this film because of its lack of visceral impulses.  An ""art-house popcorn"" movie it ain't!  This is a grown-up movie, for ADULTS.  The 2 1/2 hour length may test some viewers, particularly given it's so dialogue driven while you're expecting ear-slicing, adrenaline-shooting, finger-chopping fun.  But, if you're willing to give Tarantino your due patience and accept his proposed journey, you'll be rewarded with a great story and  masterful performances.  Tarantino's best film."

","Pam Grier and I must be about the same age, because the characters she has played in each of the last three decades personified qualities I was developing at the same time.

'Nuff said.  It all catches up with you in your forties, though.  If you live long enough, you are ready for a career change at this age.

I was not able to see the film in the theatre, but I meant to because I understood that many of the characters were, well, dealing with the issues of middle age.  Mind you, my issues differered from theirs, but the transition was there. I brought all this to viewing the VHS of Jackie Brown last night, finally.  To me, the preposterous, yet dangerous, characters drove the convoluted plot right to the end of this 150-minute feature film. Jackie is the calm, yet urgent sun around which all characters spin like planets and moons. And what happens to each is up to them.

","I saw Jackie Brown when it came out in Dutch theatres in the summer of 1998. I didn't come back to it until last weekend and what I saw was a much better movie than I remembered.<br/><br/>We're living in times of quick-fix; easy answers; rages; and getting (and wanting) predictability (in the movies). Director Quentin Tarantino has been treated rather superficial. When he raised interest with Reservoir Dogs and proved he wasn't a one hit wonder with Pulp Fiction, books were written on him as if he already could look back on a thirty year career in the movies. And when his new film Jackie Brown came out, not only people were disappointed, they said that Tarantino was already on his way down. Boy, we sure love (NEED) to label people, don't we? Why wait with writing a person's epitaph until he or she is dead?<br/><br/>Lets take a look at some of the criticisms on Jackie Brown: It lacks the comic book look of Pulp Fiction; it lacks the action of Pulp Fiction; it lacks the humor of Pulp Fiction, it lacks the grandness of Pulp Fiction; it lacks the great dialogue of Pulp Fiction. Wow, people sure expected a Pulp Fiction 2, now, didn't they? The only way these people could have been pleased was by showing them Pulp Fiction again when they paid admission for Jackie Brown. Another complaint from a lot of people: They could have told the same story in an hour and a half. Sigh. Gee, people, a lot of you out there are really stuck to a certain way of watching movies and being confronted with the same kind of storytelling, aren't you? A lot of you out there don't want to experience something new or different. You want to get what you expected, even if it means the same old superficial, predictable thing. Jackie Brown isn't about the story. The story is an alibi to look at a bunch of interesting people. In the end, there IS a crime to be solved, but Tarantino takes his time to work things up to the climax. Normally, a crime movie uses its characters as pawns that are placed and re-placed on the board. Everything that happens has got to do with the plot (or the old romantic or comic subplot). Not here. We get to watch people. We get to listen to people. We stay with them for quite a while, watching them as they have a drink in a bar; are shopping for CD's; or talk about themselves; we slowly start to fear that isn't going to happen to people who are falling love with each other. We really slow down to look at them. We sometimes stay close on a character's face when he or she is silently thinking. In one scene, Max comes to jackie to collect his stolen gun. We already know that he has a crush on her, so we figure: they screw and we cut to next scene, going on with the plot. No. Jackie sits Max down, makes coffee for him, puts on her favorite album and they talk. They talk about getting old, about not have gotten out of life what they hoped or expected. Tarantino isn't trying to make the dialogue cool. But it's interesting and well-acted. In another scene, bikini bombshell Melanie and Louis are left alone by Ordell. We expect sex, and, indeed, they do have sex, but not before they have chit-chatted and talked about their pasts in a natural, unconstrained manner. Is that grandness per se? A change is always for the better? No. But it DOES work here, causing a double whammy. Tarantino did a new take on pulp fiction with his movie of the same name. Here, he tries to do his take on a genre that is usually driven by action and plot. Tarantino lets it be driven by characters. It works because Tarantino is a great director. It works because tarantino loves these people and makes the audience care about them too.<br/><br/>Some folks say deNiro('s talent) is wasted, as he spends most of the film hanging on a couch with a dumb expression on his face. But look what happens in the finale. His character Louis may have started to come off as a harmless log; we discover that he can't function when under stress and the transformation from a seemingly harmless guy to a extremely dangerous looking individual who you'd better not say one more word to, is flabbergasting and yet totally believable. Would this have worked with a lesser actor? Louis not only changes drastically near the end but he is also responsible for the<br/><br/>most shocking thing that happens in this film. This shock gains impact from the fact that we spend so much time with this character acting harmless and even sort of pathetic. Another great example. Tarantino can't be labelled; his characters can't be labelled. Not until the end.<br/><br/>I love Jackie Brown. I also love the film of the same name. Quentin, you rock, man.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."

I have seen all his other films like Resevior Dogs, Unlucky Romance, Kill Bill 1 and 2, Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds etc. Though I knew Jackie Brown was different that it wasn't as violent hence the 15 certificate and that there was more deeper characterisation and plot development, which isn't what QT does I was still intrigued and was looking forward to my weekly film lecture at uni as this was the film that was screening.<br/><br/>It pains me to give this such a low rating. Yes there is some great dialogue with superb music and the acting is great with some moments of comic relief but it's far too long! I didn't necessarily expect action all the way through but there was barely anything. All there was just talking, rambling all the characters and going into to deep analysis about them when there didn't need to be.<br/><br/>The plot was simple but Tarantinio just drags it out. I don't mind deeper character development but there has to be a balance. This dosen't have it. The usual sparkle and pace we have come to expect from Tarantino was gone from this film, but thankfully since with Inglorious Basterds, which I loved, he has reverted back to his original formula.<br/><br/>It's a brave attempt by QT to make a different type of film and it can work but not in this case and by the end I came out just not caring about any of the characters and what happened to them and it's a pity with such a star cast of Robert De Niro, Samuel L Jackson and Brigit Fonda that they were wasted.<br/><br/>But despite this setback for QT he's still a superb director whose allowed one little slip up.

","Jackie Brown (1997)<br/><br/>Tarantino's films are so dependably well made--well written, acted, directed, filmed, and with great music--it's hard to not like them in the most sensual way, with our eyes and ears. Jackie Brown has everything going for it, including a straight up crime plot with some great, logical twists. The woman playing Jackie Brown is Pam Grier, the real deal, famous for early 1970s blaxploitation films, and of course included not only for her great presence, but for her ties to the scene the Tarantino was trying to recreate.<br/><br/>Then there is Robert Forster, as amazing as Samuel Jackson, and with a more difficult part (playing a bondsman who is lowkey and subtle, next to Jackson's bad guy cool guy gunrunner). The two cops (including Michael Keaton) are great, and Robert De Niro has a small, steady role as well. If there is any one weak actor it's Bridget Fonda, and her role is to be exactly the kind of shallow, selfish person she portrays, so maybe that works, too. <br/><br/>Does the movie transport you and sweep you in? Absolutely. Do you care about what happens to all these believable characters? Not entirely, but mostly. There is a sense of style of substance, of plot over character development here. And even the nature of the plot, mostly hinging on some money that has to exchange hands, is almost too simple for such a long movie. <br/><br/>Yet, some of the most delicious, moving moments are just when the camera lingers on someone's face, and a reaction is slowly coming out, and it takes so long you can't stand it. This is what makes great movies, and Tarantino really has a feel for how to make the scenario really get under your skin, not through shock (the violence here is mostly out of view) but through a manipulation of the medium, the photographer and editing. I think you could study Jackie Brown the way people study Pulp Fiction to see how a contemporary film can be made. Certainly the series of versions of the same scene in the clothing store near the end, each from a different viewpoint is textbook stuff. And effective."
"Coventry","9","2","5","30 September 2008"," Different kind of masterpiece from Tarantino.
","Okay, I have to admit I was one of those people who called ""Jackie Brown"" a bad movie around the time of its release. I thought it was overlong, uninteresting, dull and not nearly containing enough violence and spectacular gimmicks. That has changed with a couple of repeated viewings over the years. Admittedly ""Jackie Brown"" is an unusual film at first, especially when you expect to see another ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"", but Tarantino's versatile brilliance still quickly shows through the staggering dialogs and masterful character drawings. The script is an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel called ""Rum Punch""  and a very faithful one, I've heard  but the elaboration of the characters and creating the atmosphere of coolness is pure and genuine Tarantino. He squeezes the most out of his already super-talented cast members and, for once, also indicates the viewer right from the start that this will be a slow-paced and story-driven type of thriller this time. I'm usually not a fan of long movies but the two and a half hours of Jackie Brown always literally fly by, since it's a joy and pleasure to observe Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Michael Keaton and all the other cast members in the roles of their lives. Jackie Brown is a middle-aged airline stewardess working for a lousy minimum wage and making some extra cash on the side by smuggling for the relentless gun trader Ordell Robbie. When she gets caught, she and the charming bail bounder Max Cherry develop a plan where they play Ordell and his criminal posse against the tough cops led by special agent Ray Nicolette. Trust me, the plot is far more convoluted and extended than this and it's definitely worth discovering the details for yourself if you haven't already. Many fans and internet sources state that ""Jackie Brown"" is one giant homage to the ""Blaxploitation"" trend of the early 70's. Well, it's true... but only partially. The smooth atmosphere (with the awesome soul soundtrack) and decorative elements are definitely heavily influenced by this particular cinema trend (and of course the casting of Pam Grier and Sid Haig as well), but the actual story is far too sober and even too mature to be Blaxploitation. Tarantino for once didn't deliver a rough and provocatively violent film, but this different type of approach is definitely rewarding since he managed to make a different type of masterpiece: one with heart, beauty, intellect and passion."
"gabrielle-witherspoon","10","2","5","21 February 2007"," They Were All ""Too Cool For School""
","I loved this movie and I have watched it many times, and each time I got something different out of it.<br/><br/>Why is everyone trying to pigeonhole Quentin Tarantino? Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown are two entirely different movies - why should one be like the other? Is Quentin supposed to bask in the critical acclaim his past movies received for the rest of his life? Part of the creative process is doing something new and different.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the acting was superb and Robert DeNiro's performance was deliberately understated. Louis came off as a dim-witted ex-con but his character showed why he shouldn't be underestimated. Louis's facial expressions spoke volumes and indicated that he was not a man to be trifled with - you could sense the dangerous, lethal aspects of his personality simmering beneath the surface. The warning look he gave Melanie in the department store when he told her to stay put, should have told her that he was capable of snapping if provoked. That is what makes Robert DeNiro a master actor - he doesn't have to say anything to command our attention, he just becomes his character and lets his talent speak for itself.<br/><br/>Another commenter on IMDb stated that Louis was turned on by Melanie's wiggling toes. Louis wasn't ""turned on,"" he was grossed out and didn't want one of her nasty toes to touch the rim of his glass. You notice how quickly he snatched his drink away to make sure that didn't happen. Louis seemed to observe the people around him closely and never seemed to quite trust everything they said or did. He didn't like it that Melanie had no loyalty to her friends and was shrewd enough to realize she would turn against him just like she did Ordell. She was just another little bimbo to get high with and use for sex. He used her, not the other way around. A man who is attracted to a woman doesn't blow her away like a piece of garbage because she is getting on his nerves. Like Ordell said, ""Couldn't you just hit her?"" <br/><br/>The actual ""sting"" wasn't that clever and they tried to make it seem more complicated than it had to be. They were exchanging a bag of money in the fitting room for heaven's sake. They were acting as if it were a high stakes caper, or they were double agents who were putting their lives in danger by smuggling incriminating documents to the CIA or another government agency.<br/><br/>The realistic ""down home"" feel of the movie was great and you actually felt that you were sitting in the Cockatoo lounge listening in on Jackie and Ordell when they were talking at the bar - or chatting casually with Jackie and Max over coffee in her apartment. It was a comfortable and familiar scene and one to which we could easily relate.<br/><br/>The musical score was perfect and showed that Quentin Tarantino really did ""get it right"" and knew exactly what he was going for with the feel of this movie. Perhaps he is conceited, but the man is talented and he knows it. I enjoyed this movie much better than some of his other films because it didn't rely on extreme violence to hold the audience's attention and gave us credit for having enough intelligence to appreciate the dialog and the slower pace of the story. Some of us know the type of dumb country girl with a ghetto name similar to ""Sheronda"" who will believe anything a city slicker tells her. We know that there are plenty of real life blond, slutty junkie chicks who think they are smart, sexy and clever only to wind up strung out, beaten up or dead because they were naive little posers in the first place.<br/><br/>I'm not really a Samuel Jackson fan but I was wrong - the man is in the master class with DeNiro, Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, etc. Who else could have played Ordell Robbie so convincingly? The clothes, the ponytail, the chain smoking, the ghetto grammar, the profanity, the lying, murderous persona that was Ordell Robbie - simply brilliant. When he was in the car with Louis just after he discovered that he had been tricked out of his money, I could feel how enraged he was and I knew he was going to get rid of Louis for being such an incompetent fool. If Louis hadn't told Ordell that he saw Max Cherry in the dress department, he might not have ended up dead. Did you notice that Ordell shot him in the stomach and chest just like Louis did Melanie? I was a little bothered by the fact that Ordell said ""motherf**ker"" in almost every sentence he uttered. It smacked of overkill to me.<br/><br/>I thought Chris Tucker's small part proved the old theatrical adage, ""there are no small parts."" You didn't know whether to laugh or cry over his indignation over being asked to get into a dirty car trunk and you knew that Ordell was tricking him so that he could dispose of him later. He looked like a silly, low-level criminal wannabe (the wild, kinky hairstyle as if he had just gotten out of bed to answer the door and the cheap tee-shirt (light blue in the front and dark blue in the back)),who had just gotten out of jail and was gullible enough to believe Ordell's promise of ""ten minutes"" in the trunk until they arrived in Korea Town, and a tasty meal at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles later."
"rmax304823","8","2","5","3 November 2004"," Nicely Crafted.
","SPOILERS.<br/><br/>A true original, and the director's best.<br/><br/>The influence of Quentin Tarrantino is ubiquitous and obvious, and I'm not sure that's entirely a good thing. Every popular style, no matter how original, prompts imitation until originality becomes cliché. Look at what happened to Hitchcock. I won't bother to spell out the ingredients of this particular style except to mention in passing cross-racial aggregations, plenty of obscenities, crime, diversionary discussions of things like hamburgers, unexpected explosions of blood, and an underlying feeling that what ought to be tragic is really ridiculously funny.<br/><br/>All of those ingredient can be found in ""Jackie Brown,"" a very well executed (and complicated) crime story. The acting has to be good, and it is. Samuel Jackson is outstanding as a ghetto-type gun broker worried about his half million dollars. What a job he does! He switches from cool to threatening in a second. And when he is exasperated, which is about half the time, his eyes pop in disbelief and his voice cracks and toggles into the upper register like a coloratura soprano's.<br/><br/>Everyone else is equally good, although their roles may not call for that kind of razzle dazzle. Robert Forster hasn't been seen often on the screen lately. He's introduced here in a kind of crabwise manner in a part that at first seems like it may be nothing more than a featured bit. He'd make a good utility player. <br/><br/>Pamela Greer is simply fine. She glides between standard English and ghetto register with ease. She's not the staggering beauty that she was in the 1960s but her age is put to good use in this film, savvy but warm. If anyone sounds like a professional actor reciting lines, it's Bridget Fonda, but that's okay because she's supposed to be a hedonistic airhead and besides her long tan legs make up for any real deficiency.<br/><br/>The story itself is kind of intricate, possibly more than it needed to be. The director leaves out a few linking scenes that might have reduced any confusion we feel about what's going on. As it is, I lost track of the money sometimes amid the comings and goings. No wonder Michael Keaton, my co-star in ""The Squeeze,"" was left scratching his head.<br/><br/>And if the direction is a bit derivative, it at least respects the viewer without indulging the genius of the director himself. There is one scene that is seen at different times from three separate points of view, but the tactic is used to clarify the events. Basically the plot unfolds logically, with just enough time taken to explore some of the principal characters.<br/><br/>You'll probably enjoy it."

I thought, well maybe it was very involved, but it was the most slow moving, drawn out, movie I've ever seen.  The only good thing in that movie was Samuel L. Jackson's performance.  Maybe I had too high of expectations for it, considering it was made by the same guy who made Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  I don't recommend this movie but if you feel you must watch it, go into it with low expectations."

","Tarantino's quirky characters and dialog can carry a film only so far. An interesting story with characters one cares about is missing here. Samuel L. Jackson does a decent imitation of his character in Pulp Fiction but lacks a John Travolta to play off of. Pam Grier is impressive looking but doesn't have the acting chops to carry a film. Robert Forester is solid but his character is a dullard. The main setting, a generic shopping mall, is as interesting as the mall in which I originally saw the film. And someone tell Tarantino if you're going to depict a scene from 3 different viewpoints, make sure the scene is worthy watching in the first place."

Pam Grier is an adequate actress, but I didn't think she was as hot looking as the camera seemed to think she was.  I'm not sure why people call this a ""character study"", but I think it means that since the plot is so boring, the only thing the film has to offer is interesting characters.  The big pay-off I was expecting after two hours of development was a complete disappointment.  I'm also tired of Quentin's technique of writing ""hip, street-wise"" dialogue, which consists of using the word ""nigger"" liberally.  On the plus side, Samual Jackson was fantastic.  His performance alone is probably the only reason I would recommend this film to anyone.  Five out of ten."

In a film with such talents as Sam Jackson, Bridget Fonda, Robert DeNiro and Michael Keaton, the vast majority of the scenery is chewed by the least charismatic actors. To make matters worse, Forster and Grier had next to zero chemistry.<br/><br/>Pace was too slow, exacerbated by long, pointless steadicam walk-alongs that did nothing for the story. Ditto for the numerous long-take, single camera scenes. It just seemed to muzzle the performances. It was nearly painful to watch at times.<br/><br/>There were some good scenes with Fonda, Deniro, and Jackson, but they were few and far between.<br/><br/>I tried to like it when it came out, mainly because I like QT, and I probably overrated it at the time, basically rooting for it, and QT.

","There a great deal in Jackie Brown (JB) that has the potential to warm the cockles of a movie-lover's heart.<br/><br/>First, it's simply a well, well constructed flick. If you love solid filmic storytelling, you'll marvel at the conception and execution.<br/><br/>There's a kind of built-in wonderment at the release of JB relative to Tarantino's earlier work. It doesn't pack the same kind of punch as Dogs or Pulp. But the punch it *does* pack is no less significant... and the contrast is appreciated.<br/><br/>The characters are fantastic studies in character. In a nutshell, JB is (among other things) a kaleidoscopic bestiary of sociopathy. I don't think it's a spoiler to advise that, as you take stock of these various nuances and degrees of criminal mind, you should cast your net very widely: Perhaps only the cops come anywhere near to being truly morally clean--remember that as you're watching the concluding action.<br/><br/>Tarantino's penchant for dusting off and deploying yesteryear's faces is very well served in JB. Forster is an absolute delight.<br/><br/>Speaking of cutting edge casting, Tarantino's against-type and subtle direction of heavy-hitters like DeNiro and Tucker (especially the former) is a joy to see. DeNiro takes direction humbly and very well to create a truly DUMB persona. Louis is loyal, dutiful, not-without some moments of rugged sagacity... but slathered over it all is a translucent sauce of unfortunate, dogged dimness. And it's all nicely integrated in a superb character and narrative mix.<br/><br/>And there's more! I could go on! But I won't.

","Tarantino is able to make great movies no matter what, and this movie is another testament to why I love this guys movies. Sure, he isn't entirely original, but his movies are entertaining, and you don't need to understand such hopelessly trivial ""deep"" themes to understand. The reason you should watch movies is the entertainment value, that's what matters so much. Themes are there in real life, so you really don't need them in movies. Sure, themes and social commentary make good movies, but liking movies even though they have a lack of meaning doesn't (of course, it helps to know, however, many mindless movies are actually more boring than movies with subtle meaning). Just to be sure, Jackie Brown is a bit restrained but still has the Tarantino trademarks that we all know and love.<br/><br/>Bridget Fonda is so absolutely perfect as gun-runner Samuel L. Jackson's sassy ""surfer chick"" that you are convinced that this is who Bridget Fonda really is. Robert De Niro was given a long leash in his portrayal of a dim-witted, recently-paroled bank robber (not exactly a typecast for him... and he nails it. And the other characters that spice up the plot are all well-formed and well-acted. But it's the improbable relationship between Jackie and Max that grabs you and won't let you go. Like a swirling, cool, evening fog by the waterfront on a steamy, summer evening, it is hard to define and even harder to grasp, but you know you like it. Music and dialogue carry this movie and are the two ingredients that make it such a pleasure to take in. The film's been described as ""slow-moving,"" but people who say that don't realize that the pace is purposefully done slow so one can enjoy each characters' interactions. Sam Jackson's character, for as messed up as he is, is a piece of art. Charismatic dialogue. Jackie Brown is the Tarantino film that mostly goes over lot's of people's heads, but it is no less entertaining in many ways (although it's not as good as Pulp Fiction, obviously). Don't be fooled by Jackie Brown's different approach and black sheep persona of the Tarantino canon, it's just one of his charms that his movies seem to be black sheeps when compared to certain others. In any case, ignoring this fine work would be kind of futile.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","21 December 2015"," Not Bad At All But Not As Magical As Quentin Tarantino's Finest Works Either
","The third feature film by Quentin Tarantino is also his first to be adapted from a pre-existing material instead of his self-written screenplay, and while it manages to work as his homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s, Jackie Brown unfortunately lacks the flamboyance & kinetic wit of Reservoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction and is one of Tarantino's less impressive works.<br/><br/>The story of Jackie Brown is set in Los Angeles & follows its titular character, a middle-aged woman who works as a flight attendant for a small Mexican airline and earns a little extra by smuggling money for an arms dealer. Caught in the act by federal agents, she refuses to cut any deal with them and instead concocts a devious plan to get away from the mess she put herself in.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, Jackie Brown carries an entirely different feel when compared to his earlier works and isn't as stylish & fancy as one expects a Tarantino film to be. The story is character driven but the scripted characters themselves lack an interesting dimension. Nevertheless, the plot is consistently moving, the twists are expertly executed & it is entertaining for the most part.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Jackie Brown features a wonderful cast in Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda & Robert De Niro, with Grier & Forster impressing the most in what turned out to be a career-resurrecting work for both of them plus their chemistry is pretty much on the spot as well. Jackson dominates the screen with another terrific performance while De Niro is a natural in the role of a bum.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Jackie Brown takes a slightly conventional route with its storytelling, is crafted in a restrained manner, and although it packs in usual Tarantino's trademarks, much of its presence is low-key in comparison to his past works. Lacking the charisma, vibrance plus his patented blend of violence & humour yet offering a solid thriller that works far better when accepted as a separate entity from Tarantino's then-established forte, Jackie Brown isn't disappointing but it isn't as magical as his best works either."
"Maladjusted_1","8","1","2","18 July 2015"," Tarantino awards 'Jackie Brown' an often foregone human element.
","'Jackie Brown' quickly became one of my favourite Tarantino films, and my satisfaction with the title began in the first scene, with a stylish set of opening credits, accompanied by Bobby Womack's wonderful 'Across 110th Street'. Pam Grier as the eponymous character delivers a brilliant, very convincing performance as a middle-aged flight attendant caught by the police with a bag of cocaine and a dubious amount of money. Jackie must then consider her options. The film boasts a surprisingly strong performance by Samuel L. Jackson, who seems to – and I know how strange this sounds – outperform Robert De Niro in places. Of course, the film benefits from the presence of the 'Taxi Driver' icon, but De Niro's performance is a little underwhelming. I'm choosing to attribute that to the writing of his character, though – which brings me on to my next point. One thing that has often deterred me from Tarantino's films is how cartoonlike his creations sometimes seem. I couldn't invest in the characters of 'True Romance', and I couldn't see 'Reservoir Dogs' as anything other than bizarre. Tarantino's world is inhabited by some unforgettable but not-quite-believable characters: Marsellus Wallace, O-Ren Ishii and Alabama Whitman are all examples of this. Pam Grier's Jackie Brown, however, is very believable, very ordinary and very human. This is where I think Tarantino made the right choice, as her fellow characters Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) and Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) would be a little too ""caricature"" in their own world. As Jackie Brown is the most normal aspect of 'Jackie Brown', she serves as a relatable reference point, allowing the desperation of her situation to really sink in. Standing at two and a half hours, the film teeters on the edge of losing momentum in several places, but it is consistently salvaged by some unexpected development, intelligent scene or well- placed soundtrack. The editing in 'Jackie Brown' is commendable, and it is shrewder than the editing in many other Tarantino films, not feeling at all arbitrary. There is one scene (or one series of scenes) which employs multiple-perspective editing excellently, and this scene remains the highlight of the film. I think that 'Jackie Brown' is Tarantino at his best, and I was consistently impressed."
"Hey_Sweden","8","1","2","21 May 2015"," Pam is STILL the Queen!
","One of Quentin Tarantino's more mature outings, this is an engaging adaptation of the novel ""Rum Punch"" by Elmore Leonard. The filmmaker shows a typically masterful way of telling a story, except that, because he's working from someone else's source material, there's less self-indulgence on his part. He assembled one hell of an impressive cast here, and as usual his choice of music is pretty damn eclectic. ""Jackie Brown"" is an awfully long, seemingly unwieldy film at approximately two hours and 35 minutes, but it's always hip, and funny, and entertaining.<br/><br/>Blaxploitation goddess Pam Grier got a long overdue comeback vehicle here, playing the title role. Jackie is an ageing flight attendant who also couriers money for gun running lowlife Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). Soon, she's caught in the act, and does an amazing job of manipulating both the detectives (Michael Bowen, Michael Keaton) on her case and Robbie himself, all in the name of keeping herself out of jail and on the job.<br/><br/>Pam is a treat to watch, playing this very smart and very savvy person whom you just can't help but like. Also getting one of his best roles in ages is Robert Forster, as the lovestruck bail bondsman Max Cherry who's intrigued by her situation. The scenes with Pam and Forster are among the best in the film. Jackson is a lot of fun as the flamboyant criminal. The excellent ensemble extends to Robert De Niro, as Ordell's not too bright associate Louis, and Bridget Fonda, as the conniving surfer girl Melanie. Chris Tucker, LisaGay Hamilton, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, Hattie Winston, and Aimee Graham co-star; it's especially delicious seeing Sid Haig, Pam's long ago co-star in exploitation features of the 1970s, cast as a judge.<br/><br/>You know you're in for some good times when the opening credits are accompanied by Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street"". The cinematography by Guillermo Navarro and editing by Sally Menke are first rate. Although the pace is rather deliberate, things get more interesting towards the end as Tarantino shows climactic events occurring from a few different perspectives.<br/><br/>Although Tarantino films often tend to get quite violent in an operatic sort of way, the violence here is more restrained, which may make ""Jackie Brown"" more accessible to people who ordinarily might find the directors' work somewhat off putting.<br/><br/>This is a rock solid picture, one that's well worth seeing.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

She gets caught up in a huge arms deal and decides to risk everything to help herself other than anyone else.<br/><br/>The movie is quite slow going. There is not a great deal of action in it, but the character building is brilliant. A lot of time is spent getting to know the characters and dialogue. That is one thing I love about Quentin Tarantino﻿s movies. The man really knows how to build a character. The dialogue in all of his movies is what makes him stand out from everyone else. This is one of the reasons why he is one of the best.<br/><br/>Another thing that is really good with this movie and a lot of Tarantinos films is the soundtrack. I read that he bases his films around the soundtracks, and this has some classic songs throughout.<br/><br/>Even though there is not a lot of action, you can't help be get drawn into the story and trying to guess what Jackies next movie is. All the way through the film I was trying to guess what she was doing and who she was actually helping. It is a good film to keep you thinking.<br/><br/>The casting was fantastic. Every single actor did a great job in this movie and they all deserve some credit. Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert DeNiro, Bridget Fonda & Michael Keaton star in this movie. It was also a nice surprise to see a young Chris Tucker and also Sid Haig appear too.<br/><br/>The main thing I noticed from this film compared to most of Tarantinos others was the lack of violence. There were not many scenes where the violence was high. This is a very subtle film but runs very smoothly and very enjoyable.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga does a nigga a favor, then, BAM!, hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gots to be that kinda nigga.""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"The-Sarkologist","6","1","2","13 March 2013"," A Tarantino Movie I almost forgot about
","What make's Quentin Tarrentino films so popular? I don't really know. I have only seen Pulp Fiction and this film as well as a few others that he has been involved in but not particularly directed. The thing with the two Tarrentino movies that I have seen is that he likes to have static conversations between two characters that don't really go anywhere. This was the case in Pulp-Fiction, with the scene in the restaurant being quite dull. In Jackie Brown, it was mostly with the conversations between DeNiro and Fonda that fell into this category.<br/><br/>What sets this movie apart though is the way Tarrentino constructs a number of characters and brings them all together; this is what is similar between this movie, Pulp Fiction, and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. In Jackie Brown, we have Ormond (Samuel L. Jackson), the gun dealer and his friend Mel (Bridgette Fonda). Then there is Robert DeNiro, who plays Ormond's friend that has just got out of gaol and is bunking with Mel. Jackie Brown is an airline hostess that brings money back from Mexico to Ormond, and there is Max, her bailbondsman. Finally there are the two cops that are trying to catch Ormond.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie all of these characters are linked, so it is not that similar with Pulp Fiction and Lock Stock for the characters in those movie do not begin linked. The thing about this movie is the way each of the characters are trying to play each other to walk out with half a million dollars. Jackie Brown is facing gaol so she tells the cops everything, but because Ormond is likely to kill her, she tells him everything and arranges that he gets his money past all of the cops. Instead, Jackie and Max want the money for themselves so they plan to slip the money away under Ormond's and the police's nose. The police, even though tempted by the money, simply want to see Ormond in gaol.<br/><br/>Ormond is an interesting character because we are shown many sides to him. At first he seems cool and confident and in control. He bails out one of his associates and kills him because he might leak information to the police. He does the killings himself so that he knows that the job is done, and he commits the murders so that he will not be found out. When talking about guns and selling them, he appears very knowledgeable. Yet Mel reveals a completely different side to him. She claims that Ormond is stupid and only repeats what he hears. He has no idea about guns and only repeats what other people tell him. Even though he deals with his associate, it is too late as his associate has already told the cops everything they need to know.<br/><br/>Mel is a very unflattering character. I say this because all she does is smoke dope, watch television, and have sex. She has no sense of shame or responsibility nor does she respect other people. This is seen clearly when she constantly mouths off to DeNiro's character as they are walking out of the shopping centre. The thing that puts me off about this movie and about Mel in particular is she cheapens sex and cheapens women. She wonders around in shorts and a bikini, and sometimes doesn't even have shorts on. The guys she hangs around treat her as a slave, yet even though she resents it, she still welcomes it. The one thing about the character, and this comes from Ormond's mouth, is that she is consistent. He does not trust her, but he does trust her to be herself.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is a movie about playing people against each other. It is a movie that develops characters, though sometimes over excessively which drags the movie out to its length. There are certain points in which character development can go to, and I feel that Jackie Brown takes it a bit too far. Even though, it is still the type of movie that I enjoy, though I do not praise Tarantino's directing skill because I don't think it is any different from most others."

","Mesmerized once more by the style, technicalities & wit that Tarantino injects into his movies and characters which create a riveting & entertaining experience for us. <br/><br/>Unfortunately much like Scorsese's Casino, Jackie Brown too was destined to be overshadowed by it's predecessor, Pulp Fiction!

"MartinTeller","8","1","2","4 January 2012"," Jackie Brown (1997)
","This feels like a mellow breather between the sensation of PULP FICTION and the epic KILL BILL. It doesn't really push a lot of boundaries, or crackle with snappy monologue, or provide much tension or action. It's a bit on the slow side and except for the title character, the personalities aren't especially memorable. But it's still a good movie with some style. I hadn't seen it in a long time and had forgotten most of it, so I enjoyed getting wrapped up in the story all over again. Pam Grier is terrific, and although I rarely think about him, I realized that I always like seeing Michael Keaton at work. Maybe this is too ""P.C."" of me (never mind how much I hate that term) but I do feel a little uneasy about how comfortable Tarantino is with the n-word. I don't think having Samuel L. Jackson say it or being a blaxploitation aficionado necessarily makes it okay. I guess I have this image of QT thinking he's being ""real"" or ""edgy"" or something by sprinkling it so liberally throughout his scripts. But perhaps I'm just projecting. It's a nitpicky complaint, anyway. While the film doesn't reach the dizzying heights of Tarantino firing on all cylinders, it's one I like watching more than RESERVOIR DOGS."

","Jackie Brown...<br/><br/>I never heard about this movie until i saw a file posted for ""imdb's 20th anniversary"", it was something about the top underrated movies. I saw it in a good position, around 7, and i asked myself : ""What is this movie ?"".

I mean, Quentin T. is known to make people having a good time with some incredibly quotes, scenes, characters or screenplay, but all of them were not as good as usual.

","After Pulp Fiction, Tarantino was solid gold. Much like Peter Bogdanovich before him, it seemed like everything he touched was gold. However, he did something that even the biggest Tarantino fans won't quite forgive him for: Jackie Brown. This film, unlike Pulp Fiction, is not so inventive, is slow paced, the characters are much less interesting and apart from a few interesting moments, the film just drags on. However, it is just another version of Pulp Fiction. While it would have been wiser to changing style completely, Jackie brown showed the world that he was human, and that perhaps his success had limited his abilities. Much like Bogdanovich.<br/><br/>""Jackie can tell me any story that comes into her pretty little head, just so long as at the end of that story she hands me my motherfucking money."""

"johnnyboyz","9","1","2","29 September 2008"," Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, it actually didn't but it couldn't have come closer.
","Tarantino is quoted to have said, when asked about his follow up to Pulp Fiction which caused shock waves throughout the industry and how he would match it, that he knew he couldn't go over Pulp Fiction; so he went under it. In Jackie Brown, Tarantino pulled off from that very sentence what he set out to do. The film is a quite simplistic and laid back experience for most of the time, only branching off at certain points with that distinct flair Tarantino brings to his films when it needs to. This is most evident during the actual trading of bags in the shopping mall, something Tarantino announces is about to happen with a title card and a cheeky fourth wall breaking comment: 'For real this time'.<br/><br/>But leading up to this heist or exchange or whatever is a thoroughly rewarding and distinct journey littered with realism; menace; great dialogue; great acting and individual personas for each of the characters. Given that Tarantino includes characters in Jackie Brown of the stoner, surfer bimbo and flight attendant variety and for him to make them come across as anything but the clichés and caricatures we have become to associate with them is a triumph in itself. Part of this is down to casting; having De Niro play Louis, a bank robber recently out of jail and addicted to drugs is one thing but resisting casting a young man in the role and resisting having him talkative and naïve in that 'stoner' caricature we could all associate with him is another. If anything, Louis could take the drugs to keep him calm since the instant we see him spending long amounts of time away from the pad and away from the drugs, he becomes very irritable and somewhat dangerous.<br/><br/>Then you have the other 'types' that could so easily have been typecast but people like ATF enforcer Ray Nicolette (Keaton) is more than a typical policeman or agent with a badge and an ego, he wants to help Jackie and at certain points wants to get to know her whilst carrying a certain quirkiness attributed to Keaton's approach to the character. So if Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were all about breaking down stereotypes in a well worn genre then Jackie Brown is the continuation of this, albeit on a lower scale. The film could fall into crime, possibly even neo-noir and quite possibly romance. There are some blurry lines as to who is playing the protagonist in the noir-inspired sense as bail bondsman Max Cherry (Forster) could clearly be given the 'down on his luck' lead role and Jackie the femme fatale or Cherry could simply be labelled an ally and Jackie (who's equally down on her luck) is the anti-hero playing everyone off against each other. The film is named Jackie Brown after all, but if we can learn anything from the final scene and garner anything from the film overall then it's feasible Max is the best and most interesting character.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is perhaps the most conventional of Tarantino's films; certainly at the time and certainly with hindsight also. It adopts a straight and linear path that only become complicated when it branches off to show its several primary characters' actions. In terms of manipulating the linear passage of things, Jackie Brown rarely toys with formula until it is absolutely necessary to drop the viewer into chaos of the mind as they frantically backtrack and work out who's where and why they might be. This is done during the most important scene in the film and feels like the climactic heist as everything comes together and fits into place but really, Tarantino is using it as a set up for the bigger picture; the attempted acquiring of a gun runner.<br/><br/>At the core of the film is a strong female character and how often can you come away saying there is such a thing in a film that contains gun runners; stoners and could quite feasibly fall into the noir genre? Incidentally when Max first sees Jackie, played by Pam Grier, leaving the jail house his look is constructed around the gaze theory but one thing I noticed that may be deliberate by Tarantino is that she isn't fetishised or presented in an objective fashion. This is down to two things; firstly Tarantino places her about two dozen feet away from the watching Max and secondly, given the dystopian locale of the jail house we've previously been presented with, Jackie has this aura about her that does not demand an attractive labelling. She is a mess, with scraggly hair; well worn clothes; air miles under her belt for that particular day and generally unglamorous.<br/><br/>Following her brush with death at the hands of gunrunner Ordell Robbie (Jackson), who is equally brilliantly set up in all his ruthless glory, the film divulges into the seedy world of apartments bought with blood money, malls, mall car parks and police station offices. The splashes of Tarantino are evident in random flashes of violence; eventual non-linear story telling and a mock cartoon bird's eye view of a flight from Mexico to America. The soundtrack of light, mellow love songs adds a depth to Jackie Brown as Max gently eases his way into feeling for the woman as the meetings escalate between the two. The manner in which each character is fleshed out in their own retrospect's and the efficiency of most scenes involving Jackson's Ordell Robbie as well as Cherry's gradual relationship with Brown are some of the reasons Jackie Brown goes down as and will remain as one of my favourite films."
"Stampsfightclub","8","1","2","16 July 2008"," Slow moving crime drama, not as much action as Pulp Fiction
","In Tarantino's third film, Pam Grier stars as Jackie Brown, who is arrested for bringing illegal money into the country which ultimately takes her into a case involving one of her close friends, gun dealer Ordell (Jackson).<br/><br/>Once again covering the crime genre, Tarantino brings the characters and plot to life with cutting edge direction, and specific writing in a great portrayal of the crime world.<br/><br/>A lot of crime films focus upon action and car chases at every possible opportunity but this crime drama exploits the more specific details of what gun dealers and police are like with the unnecessary action. In admiring the realism of this concept, it does last for the entire film with hardly any action and can trail off waiting for something big to happen.<br/><br/>This may be off putting for many action viewers but the direction, script, dialogue and characters are good enough to give that little extra to put this film right up with Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent by all involved. I particularly enjoyed De Niro's (Raging Bull) performance, in perhaps an underrated role for the legendary actor. Samuel L Jackson is again good, but not as powerful as he was in his Oscar nominated role in Pulp Fiction. His character is intriguing to watch and develop as the film progresses into a more personal stage, but with the lack of action and suspense, the characters sometimes end up being a bit dull, all except for De Niro and Grier, who are the stars of the show.<br/><br/>Grier takes centre stage as the air hostess who is under the spotlight from everyone in this film and Brown's actions and skillful planning are a joy to watch and the zest in her actions make up for the lack of suspense and action.<br/><br/>Not Tarantino's best film, but nevertheless great portrayal of real life crime with a good sophisticated plot that will keep viewers intrigued t the very end."

I re-watched it and re-watched it again and realized that it wasn't supposed to be like Reservoir Dogs nor Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's most ""real"" film. Real in the way that it handles very true-to-life characters in a complex and well-written crime plot. Unlike Reservoir Dogs, which focused more on the violence; and Pulp Fiction, which had more cartoonish elements to it.<br/><br/>As far as story goes, this is Tarantino's best. A very interesting, appropriately paced crime story that makes you think and pay real attention to understand all the details of what's going on.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, superb. Every cast member does a brilliant job portraying these fantastic characters. Pam Grier and Sam Jackon have great chemistry, Robert Forster is amazing playing a low-key regular man, De Niro is very good and funny, and Bridget Fonda and Michael Keaton are great as well.<br/><br/>The direction is good. I wouldn't call it Tarantino's best directing job (that'd be Pulp Fiction) but it's a very good work that shows quality.<br/><br/>Overall, Jackie Brown is a very good film, and I mean the word very. Perhaps Tarantino's most underrated, but a great film with a great story and great characters."
"mario_c","8","1","2","8 April 2008"," It's not a masterpiece, but it's a great work!
","JACKIE BROWN is, like PULP FICTION, a movie written and directed by Tarantino, or by other words a work that completely came out of his mind. If there're plenty differences between these films there're also some similarities, starting by the criminal world background, Samuel L Jackson and the character done by him. However the differences are bigger. JACKIE BROWN might not be so brightly like PULP FICTION but it is a great movie full of suspense and twists.<br/><br/>The characters are all well conceived and all of them sustain and give an extra strength to the plot. I appreciated especially three acting jobs: The one by Samuel L Jackson, which does one more time the role type he does best; Pam Grier, which plays the main role (JACKIE BROWN), and does a magnificent work playing a strong and intelligent woman that can deceive everyone and ends fulfilling her goal; and Robert De Niro role, LOUIS GARA, which is not a very important to this movie, but I appreciated it because I think he does a character with a different personality from what I'm used to watch in other movies. Here, he's silent and nervous and almost seems like a ""poor little devil"" thief <br/><br/>I think Tarantino did a great job one more time. It's not a masterpiece like PULP FICTION but it's a very good film."

","""Jackie Brown"" was released in the holidays of 1997 where a lot of people were expecting to see another Quentin Tarantino masterpiece, but were left short of luck by the bad press and the long timing compared to the ninety minute ""Reservoir Dogs"" or the wild kinetic one-hundred fifty four minutes ""Pulp Fiction."" It was slumped due to the fact that the film came out on Oscar season where the majority of critics and fans were cheering for ""Titanic"", ""As Good as it Gets"", ""Good Will Hunting"", ""The Full Monty"", and ""L.A. Confidential."" Not to mention the comparisons of Pulp Fiction and seeing how there was no point besides the fact that Tarantino resurrected a few actors (Pam Grier, Robert Forester) and making references to pop culture along with having dead songs back to life.<br/><br/>Pam Grier plays the title role in which she's an airline flight attendant for one of the most crappiest airport corporations in the world while still making a living. She gets caught up in a scandal after gun dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) kills a criminal who was connected with Jackie along with possession of drugs and fifty-thousand dollars in an envelope. Ordell bails her out and has plans with Jackie on her not to talk to any cops before she gets popped.<br/><br/>Other characters include Max Cherry (Robert Forester) a bail bonds man who not only sees Ordell nearly everyday of his life, but has a small attraction with Jackie Brown. Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) just got out of jail after doing time for a bank robbery where he finds Ordell's mistress Melenie (Bridget Fonda) to be a pain in the ass. Michael Bowen and Michael Keaton play the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) cops who want to protect Jackie, but Keaton's character shows more coolness.<br/><br/>Though this film isn't Quentin's strongest movie, it somehow manages to be entertainable to most fans. Some scenes make you laugh while other scenes will probably have you either guessing what will happen next to each character."

That I feel that was over looked from the audience who saw this movie and thusly I feel did not give it the type of review that it deserved. This movie can't be rushed or crammed because for me Jackie Brown is a character study from person to person , we are given time to analyse each character to and to see them for what they really are. Everything in this movie is form following function and that can be told from Tarintino's heavy study on the lingo used by the characters and not to mention the soundtrack and settings which just add homage to the genre. This movie is different from what others might expect from QT , but it really has to be followed closely and appreciated as we get to see him stretch out his wings further into the artistic world of directing. Having said that I feel that Jackie Brown may not be for everyone because not everyone will understand it will probably require than one viewing but if you can get through that then trust me you might really get to see it for what it really is.<br/><br/>JACKIE BROWN : 8.6 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>THIS Christmas , SANTA'S GOT A BRAND NEW BAG..."

But pretty soon I found it was taking me to lots of interesting places, all of them with the same name - Character.<br/><br/>Each of these characters have problems with which we can empathise. There's a crook with a Walter Mitty complex, and another crook who's burned-out and clearly losing it. There's a bored blonde moll with too much spare time who has taken to drugs as a fillip. There's a bail-bonds-man just getting along and getting older, doing his job without much thought to anything else. And then there's Jackie Brown: an air-hostess metaphorically on her last flight. She's 44, middle-aged, and putting on weight. She's also an unintentional mule for Walter Mitty and, consequently, a stooge for the police.<br/><br/>This movie weaves an engaging little fabric of trust and deceit, hope and disappointment, success and failure. Even at their worst, there is something about each character that commends them to your affections. They're just getting by on the term that life has made for them.<br/><br/>There is murder. And it's as sudden, needless and brutal enough to bear the Tarantino stamp. But in the end it doesn't detract from the character study that is the basic premise of this movie. Those who die were clearly doomed anyway. You knew that. Whilst those who survive are enriched by their passing, literally and metaphorically.<br/><br/>I needn't name the players; they're all listed elsewhere. But each one does a thoroughly sterling job in their role. And if ever proof were wanting that we need more older women on screen - here it is.<br/><br/>This movie is a worthy distraction from Tarentino's usual formula of graphic crudity and violence. It signal's an ability to do a great deal more with people than the things for which he is so rightly famous. The man possesses subtlety. And I, for one, would welcome more."

Robert Forster and Keaton in particular stand out in their supporting roles. Jackson gives his usual consistent performance as the villain of the piece but one thing that really Irked me about This film is the number of time Samuel L mentions the N-word. Here we must be talking treble figures and in this instance I found it really annoying and unnecessary. Pam Grier gets the lead role and makes a commendable fist of it. De Niro gets in on the act as a low-life career criminal-scumbag type character but we don't see much of him, ditto Bridget Fonda who is mostly seen lounging around her apartment in a bikini smoking weed.<br/><br/>Good marks for an elaborate & original storyline and well-executed script throughout.

","Quentin Tarantino's third movie is his first literary adaptation, based on a novel written by his favorite author, Elmore Leonard (QT was actually offered the chance to direct another Leonard story, Get Shorty, which would have been perfect for him). The movie is Jackie Brown, and it's Tarantino's most mature effort so far (N.B. By ""most mature"" I don't mean ""best"", as I still prefer Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, particularly Volume 2), with real characters who feel real emotions and speak as they would in real life (the trademark speeches are awesome, but honestly, who talks like that at home?).<br/><br/>At the center of the story is Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), an air hostess who also works for gangster Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). She gets caught by two federal agents (Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen) who force her to cooperate if she wants to keep her job. A new who-gets-what game is about to start...<br/><br/>As usual with Tarantino, a lot of the movie's strength lies in the writing: the realistic dialogue is a joy for the ear, and in terms of plot structure, every single character is important, from Keaton's cop to Chris Tucker's unlucky crook, and no one is there to merely serve the script; they're all interesting, human beings we will remember. And the actors who bring those people to life are extraordinary: former blaxploitation star Grier is of course the best, and her character's romance with bail bondsman Max Cherry (the Oscar-nominated Robert Forster) is one of the most convincing ever filmed. In the villain department, Sam Jackson shines as gun expert Ordell (""AK-47. When you got to absolutely, positively kill every motherf**ker in the room, accept no substitutes.""), and Robert De Niro (cast against type) makes a believable sidekick.<br/><br/>Not as weird, innovative and fascinating as QT's other works, but absolutely, positively worth watching."

It doesn't grab your attention like his previous two films, and that's because here he slows down so as to draw more detailed characters. He's abetted by the actors, who turn in rich, flavourful performances, including Robert De Niro, who makes his character goofy and very funny.<br/><br/>There are only two things holding this movie back. This is the first time Tarantino isn't doing his own thing - it's an adaptation, and this seems to have led him to be a little too self-conscious in terms of style. Also, the film could afford to be ten-fifteen minutes shorter."

","Jackie Brown (Quentin Tarantino's third movie) is a movie that grows on you. I tried to watch this for the first time expecting another wildly violent Tarantino flick. After an hour, I was bored. Well, I gave it a second chance and a few viewings later, I've come to a conclusion: I love this movie.<br/><br/>The plot is based on an Elmore Leonard novel called Rum Punch. The plot is way too complicated to explain here in full detail. Basically it is about an aging bailbondsman (Robert Forster) bored with his dead end job who helps smuggler Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) frame her boss and run off with his money. After she is arrested, her boss, Ordell Robbie, (an arms dealer played by Samuel L. Jackson) bails her out with the intention of using her for one last job and then killing her. Jackie Brown, however, has other plans. There are also a bunch of interesting subplots involving the cops (Micheal Keaton in particular) and Ordell's not-too-bright accomplices,(Rovert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda) who plan to keep the money for themselves and kill Ordell. The excellent plot is combined with Tarantino's trendy dialogue to help develop the great cast of characters. The movie moves along at a slow pace, so you have to be patient when watching it. If you are expecting a ""typical"" QT flick, you will hate it. It does not use any gratuitous violence (there is some violence, but it is realistically portrayed) or weird gimmicks such as Japanese anime. The plot focuses on just one character, who is not only likable but a good person, not a murderer like in Dogs or Fiction. The performances were excellent, Pam Grier convinced me as Jackie Brown and Sam Jackson is a great villain. There was also a great supporting cast. The soundtrack was awesome too, its a lot of 70s soul/funk...not a genre I'm familiar with, since I'm an 80s baby, but I loved it in the context of the movie. This is the most underrated of Tarantino's movies and my favorite."

","Three years after the huge success of the pop-culture phenomenon ""Pulp Fiction"", Quentin Taratino serves up a quiet little success named ""Jackie Brown"", which I found, is more pleasing in substance the ""Pulp Fiction"", and many other films. On a slight homage to blaxploitation films of the 70's, he gives us a drab, seedy region in California, where we meet the most complex and colorful characters, including Ms. Brown. What really hits you hard is the interest in these character, their emotions, their behaviors, their life. It's one amazing film. <br/><br/>The main character, as you already know, is Jackie Brown, a stewardess who works in California. In her mid-40's, Jackie knows a man by the name of Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) who is an illegal gun merchant. Jackie and Ordell are connected to the same bail-bondsman by the name of Max Cherry (Robert Forster in an unbelievable performance). With Ordell's wealth of cash from his sell's, he hires Jackie to import them into California from Mexico (Where her flights come and go). The police however, are catching on to Ordell, and one cop by the name of Ray (Michael Keaton), is on Jackie's trail. Along for the ride is Ordell's ex-con friend Louis (Robert DeNiro) and one of Ordell's stoned-out-of-her-mind girlfriends, Melanie (Bridget Fonda). These six players are all on the trail of Ordell's half a million dollar profit, and like the DVD box exclaims ""The only questions are...who's going to get played...and who's going to make the big score?"".<br/><br/>Quentin has a habit of resurrecting aging star's careers, such as Travolta's with ""Pulp Fiction"", but this time around he does it twice, with extraordinary performances from Pam Grier and Robert Forster. There's even a subtle romance between Jackie and Max. Even Ray, the cop, has an eye on Jackie. And it's within these subtle hints of the script that we get into these characters and feel for them. It's amazing what Quentin can do with them, and how each speech between two characters has such immense importance. <br/><br/>What's a great shock is the feel of how the movie takes it's time and does not rush to it's ending. It takes in as much as it wants, and so do we. The film is a long film, about 2 and 1/2 hours long, and yet we don't mind how long it takes, because we're not looking for the end. We're studying each scene with precision, admiring the character development. The ending is a cool, classy, laid-back approach. No startling revelations, but a very satisfying feel. <br/><br/>The soundtrack features the soul and sound of the 70's with featured bands like The Delfonics. The opening and closing will give you a great smile, and it's because of how Quentin chooses his musical arrangements. I could not have been happier to hear the music being played for the ending. I savored every moment of Jackie Brown and you should too.<br/><br/>My Ratings: * * * * (Out Of 4) A+ (A+ Being The Highest, F Being The Lowest) 10 (On the IMDb.Com's scale, 1 being the lowest)"

As it seems a lot of viewers are not able to catch every detail presented and have the impression that sometimes nothing happens and therefor find Jackie Brown not speedy enough.

","""It wasn't as good as 'Pulp Fiction',"" you've probably heard many people say.<br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" was Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to his 1994 Academy-Award winner ""Pulp Fiction."" Granted, this time around, Tarantino takes his filmmaking approach differently, but it is far more satisfying than its predecessor.<br/><br/>A lot of you are probably thinking that what I just said is sacrilege. I'll repeat myself: ""Jackie Brown"" is better than ""Pulp Fiction"", and here's why:<br/><br/>-- Smart retelling of an Elmore Leonard caper(his novel ""Rum Punch""), which always make for good films.<br/><br/>-- Explosive soundtrack featuring Bobby Womack, The Delfonics, Johnny Cash and more.<br/><br/>-- Excellent cinematography by Guillermo Navarro. <br/><br/>-- Surehanded direction by Tarantino, who leisurely paces the film with some creative one-shot sequences, but never bores us, who embraces the blaxploitation film influences but never spoofing them, and doing something different from the similar ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"".<br/><br/>-- The casting of Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Michael Bowen, Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister, Jr., Chris Tucker, and especially Robert Forster in his Academy-Award nominated turn as Max Cherry, the no-nonsense bail bondsman who helps set up the caper and can't help but fall for Jackie in the process.<br/><br/>-- And, of course, Pam Grier, one of the most underused actresses we have, in her most explosive performance to date. She commands the screen with her sense of fear of Jackson's character, her sense of style (a nice touch involving buying a suit DURING the score) and her sense of cool. And her chemistry with Robert Forster is perfect. That last scene gets me every time.<br/><br/>Plus, everyone told every key plot twist in ""Pulp Fiction"" before I ever got to see the damn thing. Worse things have happened, but Tarantino is not slumming. If anything, he is grown as a filmmaker, and I hope that he can take his time and give us something new to chew on. His next film, ""Kill Bill"" with David Carradine, Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Sonny Chiba and Daryl Hannah, sounds terrific.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"
"TheRuleBreaker","Null","1","2","29 July 2002"," Another excellent masterpiece by Tarantino
","This film further solidifies Quentin Tarantino as one of the best motion picture directors in the business, and even adds a new dimension to his repertoire, as he was able to take a well done Elmore Leonard novel and make it into a well done feature length film. Jackie Brown is an absolutely stellar film for five main reasons, the first of which is the casting for the film. The stars assembled for this movie are the some of the most unlikely collection of names, with many of them playing roles that differ greatly from most of the roles they have played in the past. This movie proved that Pam Grier still has what it takes as a successful actress, and Samuel L. Jackson was an outstanding foil for her character. Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, and Bridget Fonda are very strong secondary roles, but the most suprisingly uncharacteristic role is that of Robert De Niro, who's character is almost nothing like any of the previous characters he has played in his illustrious career. It was certainly a huge departure for him, and he played it very well. Secondly, this movie has very good cinematography, which is something Tarantino has made a habit of maintaining in all of his feature films. The angle preferences give the movie a very good edge and serve to help the storyline well. Third, this movie has unexpected twists, similar to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs in the sense that you don't see them coming, but when they happen, you see exactly why they happen and how they work. None of Tarantino's movies are predictable and they often push the envelope in terms of what you expect to see, and that's an edge that he will always have in his career. Fourth, the plot is intelligently simple, yet deceptively complicated. On the surface, the story is all about money, drugs, and guns, and what makes it complicated is the twisted nature of the consequences that come from each of the characters' involvement. Some of the characters in this movie never even meet each other, yet what they do and whatever actions they take directly affect the actions of the others, another trait that exists in Tarantino's previous films. Finally, the soundtrack is outstanding. The use of classic soul songs like Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street,"" ""Natural High"" by Bloodstone, and ""Street Life,"" by The Crusaders featuring Randy Crawford really serve to give this movie an identity that is distinctly different from Tarantino's other pictures. This movie has great emotion and a unique level of suspense as a result of the music, without the use of dramatic scores and orchestrations, which really is a trait that Tarantino uses in all of his movies to give them their own identities. The bottom line is that Quentin Tarantino is a master of film directorial prowess, and Jackie Brown is simply another masterpiece to add to his collection."
"Decko_koji_obecava","Null","1","2","17 July 2002"," Quentin hits the bulls-eye again, but in a slightly different manner
","Quentin Tarantino is one smart dude. After the explosion of ""Pulp Fiction"" and everybody expecting him to make ""Pulp Fiction 2"" he offered up something that, for a name that occupies the blank after phrase 'Directed by:' on the credits list, doesn't have a lot in common with his previous masterpiece.<br/><br/>In the years after its release ""Pulp Fiction"" has been copied so many times in other movies, that the last thing QT wanted was to copy himself and repeat what was already said.<br/><br/>If characters in ""Pulp Fiction"" were like something out of comic book, these guys are their more mature, multi-dimensional versions. This is not to say that ""Pulp"" is inferior to ""Jackie"" but merely an observation stating the 'grown-up nature', if you will, of this movie. This is essentially a sweet and smart love story between a couple of people in their 40s - Jackie Brown, stewardess who after years of service and bad life choices has very little going for her and Max Cherry, a bail bond business operator who reached the contemplative stages of his life and is thinking of quiting his job. Of course many other characters are equally involved and each contributes a lot to the overall quality of the movie. <br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" works on every level, as a love story, as a crime caper, as a human behaviour study and even as a comedy (Chris Tucker has a marvelous cameo playing a thug named Beaumont Livingston). This is due to many things but largely to the fact that QT is an extremely observant director who knows how to write dialogue that will make every one of his characters come alive.<br/><br/>Excellent, excellent movie, I can't wait for his next one."

I can't think of other actress to play Jackie Brown, I would bet Tarantino conceived her picturing Pam playing her, she's just great she's Jackie just like George C.

Max is the rhythm of the movie himself: Being just smooth and equilibrated he keeps the movie on an even but always thrilling elapse.<br/><br/>The atmosphere: a very 70s LA couldn't be better sketched: Jackie's apartment, Max' office and the steak house where Jackie and Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) have Piña coladas and Screwdrivers are simply amazing you just feel like if you have been there.<br/><br/>That's more or less all I have to say about this picture which in my concept is simply one of the greatest movies ever.<br/><br/>I also find remarkable the Robert De Niro role as Louis Gara an ex con who add the fun touch to the movie."

Jackie was neither tough nor sexy enough to be a second Foxy! But I was wrong: Tarantino´s film is brilliant actor drama with fantastic protagonists like Robert de Niro show Samuel L. Jackson and Bridget Fonda in the lead! However, the greatest thing is main actress Pam Grier herself: she has nothing lost of her sex appeal and is still one of the most gorgeous ladies on our planet! Her acting is great, she even steals Robert de Niro´s, but she didn´t use her chance for further appearances in better movies, what is quite incomprehensible to me!

With this movie, however, he seems to have thrown that all away and focused on a story that tries to be too clever and kills itself by forgetting twists and turns aren't all should go into the movie. I'll admit I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed but I got confused to the point of frustration watching this movie. There are only so many times you can use the ""who's with who?"" thing before it gets boring and confusing, and Tarantino broke the record with this script. The music is another big letdown. Tarantino seems to have gotten too comfortable with the 70's black soul/funk genre, which results in an uninspiring, flat soundtrack.

This is because the screenplay was adapted from a story by crime-novelist Elmore Leonard.  His influence is very clear to see (compare the style of the movie for example with Get Shorty, another movie that was based on a Leonard story), but the fact that Tarantino directs can be seen by several flashbacks and the 'nouvelle violence'that made him famous.

Possibly the most mind-blowing thing in the movie is Samuel L. Jackson's character Ordell Robbie. A low-level criminal with a pony-tail (yes, the silver screen's baddest motherf***er sports a pony-tail), he almost seems like the sort of person who should have been played by Denzel Washington - but make no mistake about it: Jackson does a good job with the role. It seems that Bridget Fonda's character didn't have much purpose of being in the movie; ditto Robert DeNiro's character. Michael Keaton's character is mostly interesting when you realize that this was his last good movie until ""White Noise"" last year.<br/><br/>All in all, this isn't the Tarantino movie that I would recommend above all others, but it is worth seeing.

","The movie Jackie Brown, adapted by Quentin Tarantino from the Elmore Leonard novel Rum Punch, is full of style and for me the best thing is that the actors and their characters all shine with intelligence. They might be doing dumb things, but at least in the case of characters such as flight attendant Jackie (Pam Grier) and police detective Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) they mull over their choices and try to do their best in life. As the wily small time gangsters, Robert De Niro and Samuel L. Jackson provide ample comic relief, and even Bridget Fonda, as the gangsters' floozy, plays her part with petulant flair. The opening scene has to be singled out here as one of the most fabulous I've seen -- in which a determinedly steely Jackie, who is smuggling drugs, walks the length of an airport hall in her air hostess uniform. Pam Grier is surely one of the most under-rated actresses in history, and here she finally gets to shine. She is so smart, sassy and glamorous it's frankly criminal she hasn't had the breaks in the industry she deserves. She definitely has the X-factor, and Tarantino shows her off in almost every scene. Robert Forster, playing Jackie's prospective romantic partner and bail bondsman Max Cherry, is similarly under-rated as an actor. As Jackie tries to get herself out of the double-crossing criminal entanglement that is the film's premise, Max is there, first as an objective justice professional but eventually as a true friend who has fallen in love with her. As Max, Forster beautifully conveys, just with his facial expressions, his affection for Jackie, and Tarantino picks up on this and lingers on Max watching Jackie. It's all the sweeter for the fact that these two people are 'older'- - it's not a conventional love story but it's funny and touching."

","The late 90's weren't the best time to be a Tarantino fan. While peaking in the early 90's with masterpieces like Reservoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction, the mid 90's didn't show him the best light, as Four Rooms was a huge waste of potential (and Tarantino's segment was the most pointless in the film) & while From Dusk Til Dawn was a fun B-movie homage, that's all it was, and it was very forgettable in the process. And let's not even start on his horrible attempts at acting. Because of this, many felt that by this point, Tarantino was a two-trick pony and had to make something truly special in order to say otherwise. This is where Jackie Brown comes in. Despite being his least stylistic film, Jackie Brown makes up for it with strong character development, an engaging story and a great script, creating Tarantino's most mature film to date.<br/><br/>The story is that Jackie Brown, a flight attendant, smuggles money from Mexico to the US for Ordell Robbie, a black-market gun runner in order to make extra income for herself. However, when she is arrested for smuggling drugs that she was unaware were in her bag, she decides in order to avoid jail time to help the law get Ordell in jail. However, she finds it difficult to find where her loyalties lie. The story for the most part is very engaging, as it keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen all throughout the film. While the large amount of subplots can make the film overly complicated and hard to follow at times, it is still interesting and keeps you on the edge throughout the film's duration.<br/><br/>The characters are also very well written and demonstrate Tarantino's best character writing to date. All of the characters are three dimensional and very compelling. It also helps that all the acting is fantastic, with Pam Grier being the standout, delivering an Oscar worthy performance as someone who is struggling with what to do with her life, and will go to extreme lengths in order to have a peaceful life. Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forester, Robert De Niro, Michael Keaton among others are very good as well and Chris Tucker actually isn't annoying for once. The script is also very good as well, with great dialogue & interesting themes relating to the ideas of aging, gun violence, betrayal and many more that keep the film utterly engrossing throughout. <br/><br/>The biggest problem for many is that this is Tarantino's least stylistic film to date. The dialogue isn't as Tarantino-esque as before, there isn't much action & the story is for the most part (except for an outstanding sequence set in a mall where a scenario happens from multiple perspectives) told in a linear fashion. To be fair, the film does feel slower than his previous films and isn't as enjoyable as them because of it (not helped by he film's overlong two and a half hour running time), but it is still engaging nonetheless, due to it's story and characters, which due to the lack of action the film has more time for. The film also has some style, as particularly highlighted with the aforementioned mall and the marvelous soundtrack, which oozes funk and soul, and is fits with the film perfectly. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a great film. While not as good as Tarantino's previous efforts, it still is quite outstanding, due to its characters, story and acting. Too long and potentially hard to follow sometimes it may be, but it still is worthwhile viewing for any Tarantino fan, who want to see him at his most mature, and arguably best, era of film-making."

"mdewey","8","1","3","15 June 2013"," Jackie Brown getting' down!!
","It may be old news now, but Quentin T. showed out in this fast and sassy maxi-scam caper flick. He couldn't have hired a better acting ensemble to pull this off, to wit, Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Sammy J., Bobby D., Brigid F., Chris Tucker, Michael K., etc.<br/><br/>For starters, I think this is the best performance of Pam G's career: she exhibits a multi-dimensional persona here I have never seen her pull off before. For example, notice how she effortlessly segues from the street-savvy demeanor whilst in the company of Sammy J., etc., to the middle-class, nice girl, good-diction modus operandi when she's in the company of the the likes of Robert F. She shows how tight her game really is and isn't afraid to do whatever it takes to pull off her intended caper.<br/><br/>Robert F., mild of manner and well composed, is cast as the antithesis of the Sammy J. character who is a down-and-dirty, bombastic rascal. Notice how Robert F's character, a white bail-bondsman, effortlessly mixes in well with people of color without being obsequious or trying to be hip: He is merely himself and lets that fact set the tone for whatever may ensue.<br/><br/>Sammy J. is his usual awesome self, with great support from Bobby D. and Brigid F. That unholy trio makes sparks fly as the drama unfolds. Notice how Bobby D's character slowly shifts gears from a mellow understated ex-con to a violent shooter when he becomes unduly provoked: a nice touch from Mr. DeNiro.<br/><br/>Quentin T's usually crisp directorial skills are in evidence here, as his cutting in and moving back and forth in time work very well. His rewinds in time allow the viewer to see the same scenes from another vantage point so that one can see the logical progression of events from several angles. All that and an awesome, cleverly positioned soundtrack that kicks much booty! How about ""Across 110th Street"" at the ending? Did she ""get across"" or what?!<br/><br/>This is my favorite Quentin T. film: ya gotta check it out!"

"napierslogs","10","1","3","29 May 2011"," Slick characters and slick dealings in one perfectly executed film
","I never thought that I would actually like a Quentin Tarantino movie, let alone think that it's a brilliant film that should be revered. ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) was entertaining but most of his other violent, ridiculous ""artistry"" I couldn't even sit through. ""Jackie Brown"" though, gives us some powerful characters to connect to, a drug and money plot which for the most part makes sense, and relatively, very little violence.<br/><br/>The eponymous Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a 44 year-old black woman, but I can't describe her using Samuel L. Jackson's words because they are all expletives. I am hoping that I'm allowed to laugh at Jackson's many racial, blasphemous, and offensive declarations because they were hilarious.<br/><br/>The majority of the comedy is when we are being introduced to all the characters at the beginning of the film. Once we establish that Ordell (Jackson) is a very ruthless, rich arms-dealer, then we establish that Jackie Brown might be more like the opposite of him, a hard-working stewardess trying to make right in society. But they're friends and she's caught with his money and cocaine.<br/><br/>After giving us some rich characters, we then get a plot. A plot which involves some very shady connections, and under-handing and double-crossing. But we're given everything we need to know so it's easy to follow, and then we get to guess who is actually working for whom and who is defrauding whom. And every single one of these potentially-suspicious characters is played by a great actor in a role seemingly made for them.<br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" is filmmaking at its best with these vibrant characters, engaging story and the detailed use of style, song choice, and framing of shots to keep all of the connections alive. Who would have known that Tarantino knew how to write for, and dress, a woman so well?"
"Brawl_666","9","1","3","10 July 2010"," A Tarantino film for non-poseurs...
","Pitch perfect. So Tarantino actually made at least one film that doesn't allow viewers to get high on gore, and does require some concentration to get it. No wonder people didn't like it. Jackie Brown is like a Coen Bros. script directed by Tarantino. A bunch of people all scrambling for a bagful of cash - except unlike a Coen Bros. movie, these people aren't all morons, and someone manages to get away. The director executes it like a pro, never letting a viewer's attention wane.<br/><br/>The dialog in this film is smart and sober. Samuel L. Jackson is the epitome of scum, and plus he's badass to the core. Pam Grier is an absolute FOX. These two were born to play their parts. The casting is uniformly perfect - except De Niro. I have no clue what he was doing here - seems like the studio wanted more ""star value"". He sleepwalks through the whole thing, dragging down the quality of the entire film.<br/><br/>Overall this film is just a BIT slow. A couple of places require some speeding up, but on the whole the mood and pace is perfect. The character of Jackie Brown is one of the most interesting things Tarantino has come up with. He seems to have very quickly realized that his fans don't want anything even remotely resembling substance, and so he went commercial big-time with his next project. Kill Bill struck the mother lode. Its eerie; the man has a frightening grasp of the average movie-goer's likes and dislikes."

","Some have a problem with the running time, they say it drags They say, it kinda sucks compared to Pulp Fiction I AM NOT ONE OF THEM I'll keep this short The casting and acting is flawless.<br/><br/>It's a comedy, a drama, a crime film, it has one of my favourite characters in movie history (Ordell Robbie, played to perfection by Samuel L. Jackson) The real treat of the film is that it's a slice of life look at people dealing with age and facing retirement. Ordell knows he can spend the rest of his life spending, Lewis can't smoke a bong properly anymore, Jackie Brown and Max Cherry are both stuck in jobs that will have them with things that ain't worth a damn Quentin Tarantino said he made this film for black audiences and everyone else is invited. And while I've enjoyed everything he's made, this one I can't fault and the parts I love, I love more than in his other films and a lot of other films I love in general This film is a rarity - how many films do you see with an African-American women of Pam Griers age have a roll like this in the film She looks absolutely stunning and is quite simply excellent in the film, as everyone is.<br/><br/>Tarantino still uses references from other films, the title sequence is from The Graduate. There is a shot of a womens feet (out of all shots of womens feet in his film, this is my favourite). There are references to things on television. There's a great soundtrack and so on and so forth I don't know if I'll ever see a film like it again in my life, but I prefer it to Quentins others because of it's adult themes and much more to Pulp Fiction because of the structure I give it 100/100"
"thesar-2","9","1","3","20 December 2009"," Jackie Crosses the Street
","I make some mistakes on some of the repeat viewings I have of movies. A few years back, I re-watched Jackie Brown and immediately named it my favorite Tarantino film. And this was after the release of Kill Bill Vol. 1-2 but before both Death Proof and Inglourious Basterds. Though, Jackie Brown remains an almost excellent film, I take back my statement. Besides, I get a lot of flack from my friends who always seem to name either Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction as their favorite.<br/><br/>Okay, I'm getting off the subject. Jackie Brown is an excellent film in reference to acting, dialogue, suspense and character depth. My problem, and the reason it's no longer my favorite Tarantino effort, is the length and his simple desire to never edit anything out, or so it seems. Recently, I watched Inglourious Basterds in the theatres and that one, too, I had the problem with the drawn out scenes. (Side Note: I've been bashed pretty hard on that one, but I guess I do have little patience for very slow moving movies. Not all Tarantino movies are, but almost all (if not all) of M. Night Shyamalan and Michael Mann's movies are. I try to avoid those two directors at all costs.) This movie should have been cut down, and by a lot. Such as a minimum of 30 minutes to make a much more tight and suspenseful film.<br/><br/>Regardless of that argument, it's the acting and dialogue that shines the most for me. I've never been privy to see any of Grier's work, but I absolutely loved her in this movie. Every motion she made, the nervousness, the human side to her lying/trickery was played out perfectly. But not just her, Forster (another, I haven't seen too much of to make an opinion outside of this film) had such depth, even with barely moving his face or body. You could tell he was just plain tired. Worn out.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the performances, they were also top notch. We already know Robert De Niro will go down as one of the greatest actors of all time, but I think his turn in this movie shocked the heck out of me. Clarification: it was the most original performance I've seen of his career, something completely different and despite him not being 100% likable, it was the range De Niro had that enthralled me.<br/><br/>Fonda and Keaton were also good, but there was yet another well done job by a personal favorite: Samuel L. Jackson. Sure, on the surface, it looks like he's playing every other role he's played, as he often does. But, here he certainly adds depth, and you can see how his demeanor changes as the stakes are raised. Also, the fantastic lines he spoke helps make this one of his best performances ever.<br/><br/>(Spoilers follow) After a rather long opening, we learn of Ordell's (Jackson) gun-selling empire, his girl-keeping properties and his $500,000-hidden money in Cabo. Two of his minions get into trouble and Ordell gets to business to get them out of jail to eliminate them. One's easy: Beaumont (Tucker) but the other has a lot more to lose and gain, Jackie Brown (Grier.) She's a fast-thinking, smooth criminal who convinces three sets of people to help her better her situation, i.e. taking off with the half million.<br/><br/>Group 1: the cops who are more interested in nabbing Ordell. Group 2: the bail bondsman responsible for setting both Beaumont and her free and is obviously smitten with her. And Group 3: Ordell, himself, and his gang of lowlifes. Watching her move/use her magic on the various people is part of her and the movie's charm. Will she, or even, could she get away with this without ending up like Beaumont on the slab? This is a must-see for Tarantino fans, but beyond that, anyone that loves character and plot driven stories, like myself. Throw in some awesome tunes and dialogue, and you have a near-perfect movie.<br/><br/>Side Note: Yeah, I know I said the opening was rather long – but I'm referring to after the immediate opening credits with Jackie on her way to work. It may seem simplistic to some, but just her standing still, while moving, in conjunction with that amazing song, Across 110th Street, is absolutely one of my favorite opening credit scenes of all time."
"pandora12","5","1","3","5 April 2008"," Nod to blaxploitation films
","I didn't think there was much depth to the characters or much attention given to the script. It is hard to believe that this was based on a novel. Compared to Quentin Tarantino's other films this just doesn't measure up. I realize that this is a nod to blaxploitation films. I am not a fan of that type of film so maybe that is why I couldn't really appreciate Jackie Brown. Robert DeNiro is such a great actor, he should not be settling for such 'nobody' roles. Samuel L. Jackson did his best with what he was given. I like the way he changes his looks to fit each character he plays. I am glad that Pam Grier managed to keep her shirt on, literally! If you have ever seen Pam Grier in her blaxploitation films she is constantly running around bare-chested, it's ridiculous."
"Scars_Remain","8","1","3","27 February 2008"," Superb!
","Finally, I have seen Jackie Brown and finished all of Tarantino's films. This one was a fantastic film that I had a lot of fun watching and wondering what was going to happen next. I would say it's better than Death Proof but not as good as his other films, but that doesn't mean it isn't great.<br/><br/>The story follows Jackie Brown, a flight attendant from California who gets caught up in some drug problems and an arrest and it just goes from there with some brilliant writing and clever plot twists.. The cast is amazing and how could it not be with the likes of Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, and Robert Forster? The directing is great, of course, as well as the cinematography. You should see it! <br/><br/>Tarantino fans will be pleased with this film as it is very much his style. As I said, it's not as good as his other big films but it is definitely worth seeing and maybe even owning. You make the call."
"terminal157","9","1","3","10 January 2006"," Jackson doesn't have a character?
","I just want to disagree that Samuel L. Jackson in this movie doesn't really have a character. One of my favorite things about this movie is his character. It's an extremely subtle and well-done depiction of a manipulative sociopath. If you pay close attention you can actually see the way he's carefully watching the reactions of people he's talking to to make sure they're going in the direction he wants. The character himself is acting almost constantly throughout the movie, the few times you see him alone, as he really is, it's like he's a completely different person (a very frightening person). One of the hardest things to do in acting is to play a character who is himself acting, and it's to Jackson's credit that he pulls it off so well."
"Jamesp8908","10","1","3","2 January 2006"," Best Movie Ever Made
","Jackie Brown directed by Quentin Tarantino has intrigued and inspired me from the first time I saw it. I have probably seen the movie twenty times or more.<br/><br/>One of the characteristics of the movie is that it is both realistic and unrealistic. It is hard to believe that the story of Jackie Brown is real because the chain of events is too unlikely. In addition, there are too many coincidences. The chance of types of characters portrayed in the movie coming together is unlikely. For example, Ordell Robbie is a criminal who will do anything to save himself and protect his money, including murder. Melanie is a druggie who has no apparent way of supporting herself other than living off of Ordell. However, she seems way too intelligent and too attractive to have to resort to that.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown could be a true story because of the sense of realism. The individual actions are not too incredible. The characters have flaws that make them seem human and they are not stereotypes. The dialog of the characters in Jackie Brown are down-to-earth.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is an amusing and entertaining movie. Jackie Brown has a lot of violent action, but it is not too graphic. In addition, it is enjoyable because it is unpredictable. The movie does not follow strict chronological order. Additionally the movie is entertaining because of the different points of view of the same scenes.<br/><br/>The reason why Jackie Brown has intrigued me is that the movie allows you to put yourself in a character's place and makes you think about how you would react to extreme situations. Even though the police have never arrested me, seeing Jackie get arrested gives me a sense of how it would feel to be in prison. Before Max Cherry met Jackie, he was lonely and had nothing to do but work. He had a stressful job dealing with criminals. He trusted a criminal, but she was doing what she had to do to survive so she was not really a criminal and he saw that, so he wanted to help her. He was a good and decent man."
"marquis_llama007","10","1","3","6 December 2005"," Awesome film
","This Tarantino film is probably my favourite of them all! It has an amazing storyline, great cast, great use of pop culture references as usual, great music. Overall the film is awesome! Samuel Jackson and Pam Grier give amazing performances as to be expected and yet again Tarantino has used less known of actors in smaller roles and slightly better known actors (at the time) to fill out some of the leading character roles which gives a great atmosphere to the film. This film probably holds my favourite scene from any Tarantino film, it seems to sum up the kind of style he uses in all of his films. It is where Ordell puts Beaumont in the boot of his car, goes into the driver seat, takes his gloves out of the glove compartment puts them on and puts on the tape player which plays Strawberry Letter 23 (download it if you haven't heard it)which is a cool laid back tune, quite upbeat, Ordell then proceeds to drive around the corner park and then we see him get out of the car (from a distance) and shoot Beaumont in the boot and then get back in the car and the music continues to play, if you know this scene or have not yet watched it YOU MUST WATCH IT!! it just has an amazing feel to it. Watch this film! You'll love it."

"domino1003","10","1","3","19 November 2005"," Grier and Forster Shine in Tarantino's Flick
","""Jackie Brown,"" which is Quentin Tarantino's 3rd flick, pays tribute to 70's blackploitation films, even using 70's queen Pam Grier in the title role.<br/><br/>Grier plays Jackie Brown, a 40-ish airline stewardess who works for a crappy airline service. She also runs money from Cabo to the states for Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), a shady dude that sells guns. She soon gets busted by ATF Agent Ray Nicollete (Michael Keaton). It seems that one of Ordell's associates, Beaumont (Chris Tucker)dropped her name to get out of an arrest of his own. Knowing that Ordell will kill her (Like he killed Beaumont after he bailed him out), Jackie uses her skills to outsmart him.<br/><br/>With the help of Max Cherry, the bail bondsman that picked her up from jail (Robert Forster), she plans on stealing Ordell's money (a total of $500,000)from under him and the feds. However, Ordell's girlfriend Melanie (Bridget Fonda)also wants the money, trying to get Ordell's friend Louis (Robert DeNiro)in on the deal. And so the game is on, with half a million dollars up for grabs.<br/><br/>Tarantino has created a great movie. Those familiar with blaxploitation and 70's movies will really get something out of it. All of the performances are great (And Jackson excellent as always). However, it is Grier and Forster who really shine. The scene in which Max is waiting at the jail to pick up Jackie is a prime example: As she walks toward him, fresh out of jail, you can see the exact moment when Max falls for her. And falls HARD. Tarantino's use of music is also key: Max plays ""Didn't I Blow Your Mind This Time"" over and over because he first heard it while having coffee with Jackie. A sure sign that Max is intrigued with her. By the end of the film, you want them to get together. They are just such a sweet couple! Even if you're not a Tarantino fan, you will still love this film. A must have."
"blanche-2","8","1","3","2 October 2005"," an homage to an earlier genre
","Quentin Tarantino does a magnificent job with ""Jackie Brown,"" a rich film that hearkens back to the black exploitation films like ""Foxy Brown"" that gave Pam Grier, the star of this film, her start.<br/><br/>Though the plot of ""Jackie Brown"" is wonderful, the characters make this film worth watching. Pam Grier, an actress of remarkable presence and special beauty, plays a flight attendant caught between gun merchant Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), for whom she transports money, and two ambitious detectives portrayed by Michael Keaton and Mark Dugas. She decides to go for a con of her own and enlists the aid of her bail bondsman (Robert Forster). Forster hails from my home town, and he is one who knows a lot about career ups and downs. He first made a splash in ""Reflections in a Golden Eye,"" and when the reviews came out, he was doing construction work outside the newspaper office. The review was thrown to him. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Jackie Brown,"" playing a man at a crossroads. He's marvelous as a hard-working 56-year-old man who's seen it all, made his life choices, accepted what he has, and then falls hard for Grier.<br/><br/>There are so many layers to the film and performances. The tone is laid back, natural, and conversational, and most of the acting is very underplayed. Jackson is great portraying an absolute horror show who bails people out so he can kill them before they give him up. DeNiro has only a few lines as Jackson's apparently easygoing, take it as it comes partner (and what comes at him is Bridget Fonda), shrugging and smoking pot through most of the film. Towards the end, he nearly steals the movie as his nerves creep up on him. It is an absolutely brilliant performance. Keaton is perfect as a hyper detective. But it's Grier, as a powerful, street-smart woman determined that she has had her last bad break, who captivates as Jackie Brown. The part is unusual, in that it's a lead role for a 44-year-old woman.<br/><br/>Tarantino gives us the usual scenes shown from various characters' points of view, the violence you don't see coming, and a great sound track. Though not considered his best film, Jackie Brown is interesting, fun, and bittersweet. And hey, he gave some very good actors a second place in the sun."

(In case you didn't know, Robert Forster was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars).<br/><br/>However, a bit of a downfall was that it had a bit too much talking, and not as much action as it should, but it kinda makes up for it with the whole idea and cleverness of it.

"moviemanMA","8","1","3","1 August 2005"," Jackie Brown is another Tarantino classic!
","Quentin Tarantino has written and directed some of the best movies in the last 25 years, starting with Reservoir Dogs and all the way up through the Kill Bill movies. Each of his films has a distinctive quality about it, whether it's the violence or the harsh language, but the thing everyone remembers most is the dialogue between characters.<br/><br/>In Jackie Brown, Tarantino takes us for a ride as we follow Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), a flight attendant helping an arms dealer named Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) get money where it needs to be. After a flight, she is pull aside by two cops, one being Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton), who find the cash she is smuggling in for Ordell. Now she faces jail time and Ordell must get rid of somebody who might snitch. What happens now is the bail bondsman Max Cherry(Robert Forster) and Brown team up to mess with Ordell and his two pot smoking companions, Melanie (Bridget Fonda) and Louis Gara (Robert De Niro). Now it's a nice plot of how Ordell wants the half a million dollars he has coming to him with these arms deals and how Jackie Brown is the only connection between Ordell and the police and Cherry.<br/><br/>Tarantino once again delivers the goods with this film. The movie starts off with a great dialogue between Jackson and De Niro about guns. The rest of the movie is very entertaining. Whenever Grier and Jackson talk, it's a good scene because the two have no idea what the other is about to do to the other one. They are both a little stressed out over the fact that the money isn't in the right place and are trying their best not to get each other pinched.<br/><br/>This movie received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Forster) and many good reviews. Forster isn't the only one giving a great performance. De Niro, Fonda, Jackson, Grier, Keaton, even Chris Tucker who is in the movie for probably less than five or ten minutes gives a notable performance.The whole ensemble is incredibly well casted and deserves to be recognized.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is vintage Tarantino. This film is over shadowed by his other giants (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2), but still is a great film. Tarantino is one of the best writers of recent cinema and this piece shines. Another great script from Tarantino, a fun plot, and an incredible cast give this movie something to be proud of. Quentin always delivers the goods, and this sure lives up to that. Jackie Brown is a great film, and don't you forget it!"

Max Cherry and Jackie Brown are easily the hottest middle-aged mismatched couple in movie history, and just as sweet as a child's first crush.

","""Jackie Brown"" was widely received as a disappointing follow-up to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" but I think it's actually a better movie, if less obviously so. It's hard not to be blown away by ""Fiction"" because of it's sheer audacity; ""Jackie Brown"" is a quieter film that shows Tarantino has the potential to become a mature and sophisticated director. It's somewhat ironic that Tarantino, associated with the young hipster audience, made this film, because at the basic level ""Jackie Brown"" is about getting old. All of Jackie's motivations spring from the fact that starting over will soon become impossible for her. That the options available to a a middle-aged, lower income level, black woman in modern America are severely limited. Tarantino shows an amazing prowess for getting into the head of this woman. His sensitive direction coupled with Pam Grier's top-notch performance combine to make Jackie one of the most compelling and honest female characters to hit the movie screen in recent years. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent too. Robert Forster stands out as bail bondsman Max Cherry, who becomes Jackie's partner in crime, as it were. Samuel L. Jackson does well with the kind of part he seems born to play, but his character is not as interesting as the others and so makes less of an impression. Bridget Fonda is a scene stealer as a California beach bunny, and the contrast between her and Pam Grier is used quite effectively.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that in the book this movie was based on, ""Rum Punch"" by Elmore Leonard, Jackie was white. Changing the race of the title character to black adds a whole other dimension to the film that the book lacks. This is one case where the movie greatly improves on its source material.<br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" will take some commitment on behalf of the viewer. It's leisurely paced and more reliant on character study than Tarantino's other films, but these aren't detriments. They merely illustrate that Tarantino has some range as a director, and I hope he continues to explore that range."
"GoldGriffin07","9","1","3","4 April 2005"," A WORK OF CINEMATIC ART! (Medium spoilers below)
","Quentin Tarantino took his art of film-making to the next level with JACKIE BROWN. After a ton of success with PULP FICTION, Tarantino matured, cut down on the violence and proved he could still make AWESOME films. The story tells of a flight attendant (Pam Grier) who was to bring money to a gunrunner (Samuel L. Jackson), but is stopped by two ATF agents (Michael Bowen and Michael Keaton). From there, we meet more characters and more plots. Two of the best characters in the film are Max Cherry (played to perfection by Robert Forrster) and Louis (Robert DeNiro, who wanted the role of Max, but he is perfect in this role).<br/><br/>Taking a cue from old robbery/ripoff films, Tarantino asks the question to you, ""Who is playing who?"", and it is a confusing twist. Until the finale of the film, you will not know who works with who.<br/><br/>Many think this is Tarantino's weakest film, but I disagree. Though I hold all his films on a separate scale than most, this is probably the best, not my favorite, but a pinnacle of film-making. By assembling an all star cast, using a superb novel from Elmore Leonard, and adding Tarantino's special brand of direction, this film succeeds on so many levels.<br/><br/>It should also be noted that this film has an AMAZING soundtrack, and the pieces are awesome. Probably the best soundtrack I've heard in a long while . 9.5 of out 10."
"keuhkokala","8","1","3","1 March 2005"," Tarantino's most adult work
","Jackie Brown is probably the most adult work of director Quentin Tarantino. Although the name and star Pam Grier hint for a blacksploitation-style movie, the movie never feels like any kind of exploitation. There are numerous references to movies like Foxy Brown and many songs in the background are ripped from their soundtracks, but the movie itself is actually quite calm. It has some violence but it's not very explicit ea. it's shown off-screen. This is not how Tarantino movies usually are. Another thing that freaks us Tarantino fans out is that in the movie characters talk mainly about stuff that's related to the plot, there's barely any mention of old TV-series or Kung-fu movies of the 70's. This is why the movie also feels less Tarantino than his other work. This may be due to this being an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's the Rum Punch and not an entirely new story from QT's warped mind.<br/><br/>All this does not make this movie a bad one. In fact it's surprising how little actually happens in the movie, it's mainly just talk until the last 40 minutes or so. Yet Tarantino clearly has a gift with words, you will always feel interested about what a character says. Speaking of characters, Tarantino has usually a marvelous cast, but this puts the likes of Pulp Fiction to shame. Pam Grier is great at the title role, Robert DeNiro gives us yet another immortal role and Samuel L. Jackson does a superb arms-dealer who thinks a little too much of himself. Yet the best performance comes from Robert Foster, who is really the heart of the movie as a bail-payer, who becomes interested in Jackie Brown's scheme to steal the money his boss wants to smuggle to America. The relationship between Foster's character and Jackie is touching, almost like Vince and Mia in Pulp Fiction, as it's an almost love-story which ends before it even starts.<br/><br/>The plot is actually like a Seinfeld episode without the jokes. All characters seem to have different interests at first, but later all the plot points tie in together. And this time Tarantino actually tells the story linear, not by some jumps in time back and forth. It's actually a working solution for this film. We Tarantino fans got a little worried there when he made such a straight movie, quit for six years, but we certainly were rewarded as his next one was the two-volume roaring rampage of revenge, his most exploitational movie yet.<br/><br/>**** (8/10)"
"ryan_kuhn","9","1","3","13 February 2005"," An Underrated Look At Desperate People
","Quentin Tarantino knows what he likes when making a movie, and what he likes are actors and actresses that once had a career, and then fell off the radar. Jackie Brown stars two actors that fit that mold, Pam Grier, the 70s blaxploitation star, and Robert Forster, who gives an Oscar nominated performance. Grier plays the title character, Jackie Brown, who's an stewardess for the worst airline that connects between her home of Los Angeles and Cabo San Lucas. After her criminal past, she lives on her $16,000 salary, picking up a few dollars by running money from Mexico to her contact in LA, played by the always dependable Samuel L. Jackson. Robert Forster plays a worn down, 50ish year old bail bondsman who meets Jackie while picking her up from jail after she's caught with drugs with the money headed to Jackson's character. While this film boasts the most plot of any of Tarantino's movies, it is still not the most important part of the film. The interaction between two lost souls over the age of 40, and how they try to outsmart their enemies (gun dealers, the feds, the police) is fun to watch. Some complain that at 2 hours 30 minutes it's too long, but I disagree. The length allows the characters to talk to each other, not just about plot points, but to also just talk. The film also features Bridget Fonda as a beach bum, Robert De Niro as a baked ex-con in a truly funny, if not subdued role, and Michael Keaton as an ATF agent who thinks he knows how to handle Jackie Brown. Jackie Brown is on one level about an airline worker smuggling money into the country for her boss, but on a more important level, how desperate and tired people of a certain age will act when the chance is there to make a change in their life."
"FrankBooth_DeLarge","8","1","3","12 February 2005"," Excellent, not disappointing at all
","Director Quentin Tarantino started his film career with the great Reservoir Dogs, then the following film he made was the excellent Pulp Fiction, then he made Jackie Brown. Some people were disappointed with this because they were expecting this to be the best movie ever made. This isn't the best movie ever made, but it still is excellent.<br/><br/>The qualities that make a Tarantino movie are an interesting story line, style, complex characters, witty dialog, and action. This doesn't have as much action as his other movies, but it still keeps you interested the whole way through.<br/><br/>This isn't as raw or violent as Reservoir Dogs, as flashy or showy as Pulp Fiction, or as unique as Kill Bill, but it still has a unique style.<br/><br/>The story follows a stewardess who is smuggling money for an arms dealer. Quickly, she is wanted by the FBI and the arms dealer at the same time. There are several other things that take place, eventually making the whole plan start to back fire. This is shown mainly in chronological order, but there is one scene that jumps back a little ways from the current event.<br/><br/>This is a great movie, for those of you who watch Tarantino movies just to watch people get shot or tortured, you might not enjoy this as much. The running time is really long at 2 1/2 hours, but it does have plenty of entertainment values that keep this movie from ever becoming boring. The music is great, it's a good collection of music from the '70's. The dialog is clever and often humorous, allowing the audience to sort of hang out with the characters and get to know them.<br/><br/>This is worth watching, I would recommend this at all costs. This is for anyone who likes Tarantino, or anyone who wants to see a great, stylish movie."
"kintopf432","7","1","3","10 November 2004"," Entertaining
","Entertaining entry in the Tarantino canon. It never quite lives up to the promise of its stylish opening-credits sequence (could any mere story live up to that thrilling tracking shot? Who is this person? What's going to happen to her?), and in places it again shows the director's casual disregard for human life (or for character life, anyway). But all in all it's a fine entertainment, well acted (especially by Robert DeNiro in his small role), believably characterized (the romance element is particularly nice), and suspensefully plotted. And, as usual with Tarantino, the best part of all is the vibrant, chattering screenplay, yet another virtuoso exercise in language. 7 out of 10."
"MF210","8","1","3","3 May 2004"," Entertaining but not a Masterpiece
","My Rating: *** out of ****. <br/><br/>When it came out there was no doubt that people would be disappointed by Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino's follow up to his masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. People thought by some miracle that Jackie Brown would be the masterpiece that Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction was. Sadly, it was not the case and Jackie Brown did not receive half the critical praise or the box office that Pulp did. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, while Jackie Brown is entertaining in its own right, has a brilliant performance by Samuel L. Jackson, and has some great lines of dialogue, it is not a masterpiece. The good news is that it is a good film and definitely worth watching. It was just unfortunate enough that it would be compared to Pulp Fiction. <br/><br/>The difference between this and Tarantino's other films is that this is an adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel, Rum Punch. Admittedly, I have not read the book so I can't compare the two. Leonard is supposedly famous for the snappy dialogue he writes. Tarantino admits that he is somewhat influenced by Leonard. So its kind of hard to tell if the dialogue here is Tarantino's or if its Leonards but there are some great lines here. Theres actually a conversation that really stands out. Its a conversation about hiding in a trunk, whether this is Leonards or Tarantino's, its got classic written all over it. Unfortunately, while there are some great lines here, theres not nearly as much as there was in Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>
Samuel L. Jackson has always been one of my favorite actors. I have yet to see him turn in a bad performance. His work as Ordell Robbie ranks with the best I have seen from him. Its a compelling, mesmerizing performance that rivals his performance in Pulp Fiction as his best work.<br/><br/>
No one in the cast matches Jackson's performance but they give solid support. Many people have said that the best performances given in the film were done by Pam Grier and Robert Forster. While I thought that both did solid jobs, I didn't find anything remarkable about their performances. Despite being somewhat underused, Robert De Niro gives an entertaining performance. Bridget Fonda is also well cast as a pothead.<br/><br/>
Stylistically, this is a toned down Tarantino film. The film moves at a slower, deliberate pace. Tarantino does use a split-screen but only once and briefly. The most intriguing thing Tarantino does is show a crucial sequence in the film from three different perspectives. I am not exactly sure of the reason behind this but it was interesting. <br/><br/>Overall, Jackie Brown is an entertaing film that even though its not a masterpiece I would still like to see it again. I did think it could have used a little trimming towards the end but perhaps its because I saw it on TV and it was with all those damn commercials. I may review this film again after I watch it on DVD. So if I do feel different in anyway expect a changed review."
"FranktheRabbit","10","1","3","20 December 2003"," Elmore Leonard meets Blaxploitation
","Jackie Brown (1997/Quentin Tarantino) **** out of ****<br/><br/>The openings of many Tarantino films are classic. They usually began with some great dialogue at a diner or bar, and set the tone for the film itself. But with `Jackie Brown', you get the exact opposite. What you get is pretty straight forward: The rolling of the credits accompanied by a song (and a small homage to The Graduate'). But, the normal credits do set the tone for the film. They clearly state that this will be Tarantino's most normal, serious, and realistic film. <br/><br/>The plot is about a flight attendant (Pam Grier) who gets caught smuggling her boss's gun money into the United States. Instead of getting sent up river, she teams up with a FBI agent (Michael Keaton) and a local cop (Michael Bowen) to bust her employer (Samuel L. Jackson). But then she thinks up a plan that works toward her advantage. Along for the ride are Robert DeNiro (an ex con), Bridget Fonda (Jackson's hot and cold lover), Robert Forster (in an Academy Award Nominated performance as a burnt out bail bondsman), and Chris Tucker as a loud mouth lowlife.<br/><br/>
Just about everything in this film is great, if not everything. Tarantino has once again gives past actors another shot at fame (Grier and especially Forster). This is Tarantino's most realistic film, probably due to the fact that the story is based on the novel `Rum Punch' by Elmore Leonard, which he adapted into an interesting caper film and blaxploitation homage. The characters are not larger than life like they were in `Pulp Fiction' and in `Reservoir Dogs', they are real people, and that is why they are so likable. The pacing is also excellent. I have read some reviews saying that it is to slow, but the pacing reflects the mood of the two main characters. Grier is tired of her dead-end job, and tired of making $16,000 a year. Forster is tired for practically the same reasons as Grier. And their tiredness is the slow pacing that most of the film has.<br/><br/>After watching one of the documentaries on the second disk of the DVD, I greatly respect Tarantino's casting decision of Robert Forster. He was saying that he could have easily cast someone like Gene Hackman in Forster's role, because Forster was a Z-list celebrity making films like `Vigilante' or `Maniac Cop 3'. Although he appeared in bad movies, his performances were still good. And Tarantino saw this in him, and gave him the opportunity to show the world that he was here, and that he hadn't lost his chops.<br/><br/>When the name Tarantino' is brought up, usually `Pulp Fiction' or `Reservoir Dogs' comes to mind. But this should not be. `Jackie Brown' is not considered as one of Tarantino's better films, and this is sad, because it is just as good (if not better) than the first two films mentioned. Excellent!<br/><br/>-30-"

","A stewardess (Jackie Brown played by Pam Greer) gets in to legal trouble when bringing contraband back to the US and has to tread a difficult path between the police and the dangerous criminal that is using her.<br/><br/>Certainly easy to see why Tarantino would be interested in this piece of airport trash (lots of mini-characters, cross agendas and ping-pong dialogue), but harder to see why he should chose to make the thing so long and laborious.<br/><br/>(Maybe it is a case of ""never mind the quality, feel the width?"")<br/><br/>Fancy having Robert ""I've never paid for it"" De Niro (maybe working at his ""fashion director"" discount price?) and give him a throw away role - as a slow speaking criminal moron that anyone in the Actors A-Z could play! He is not even funny-stupid, just stupid-stupid!<br/><br/>Greer is not stretched here anymore than she was in her Blacksploitation heyday. She is in a hole and has to think her way out. There is no one else in her life, she is not totally honest (ambiguity should never be knocked in movies!) and anything she does is only really about serving herself. Good performance - but there is nothing to really go wrong.<br/><br/>Tarantino is actually quite a green film maker (he prefers giving ""my life as a hot new director"" interviews and watching B movie junk to learning his trade on a set). Maybe he knows the limits of his own talents - only time will tell. Certainly his criminals are remarkably samey - idiots, thugs and street comedians with guns.<br/><br/>If you want to portray a caper in great detail (and cover the same ground more than once ala Kubricks early work) then you have to make sure that every little thing works and is correct. As the goofs index shows, there are clear errors that you can spot in one sitting and that doesn't even include things that make no sense at all.<br/><br/>Here we have a rehearsal of a criminal act that the police are privy too. Why a rehearsal? It is a trap, the criminal has fallen in to it, arrest him. Why ask him to go again? What are they learning from the first time, he can't lead them anywhere? He might change his plans and bring his money in some other way next time!<br/><br/>Equally a child could come up with a way of transferring money easier than here - why the elaborate pantomime, what about simply going to the ladies toilet and passing bags under the door?<br/><br/>Without getting involved in spoilers - the way the thing is resolved is barely TV movie standard. After a sloth like crawl through the rest of the film - the thing wraps at double speed, with a stock device out of TV drama writers' handbook. I doubt any movie of the last ten years has had so much acting talent, budget and attention and yet come up with such an average product."

","Not that this was a bad movie...  I can't fault him on the semi-lackluster script because this story was adapted from a novel.  But it took him 4 years just to make Jackie Brown and now 5 to make Kill Bill?  If you've read the script for Kill Bill, there is a pretty good chance you are as disappointed as I am.<br/><br/>HOWEVER Jackie Brown is NOT Dogs or Pulp Fiction so it should not be so closely compared to the other two.  It is well directed, well acted, (in the case of Pam Grier and Robert Forster, I found Sam Jackson's performance to be very annoying)and the music is very good.  On the other hand, the story, whether it was a novel or not, was not top rate.  The ending falls flat, there is no twist...but maybe that was the intention, I'm not sure. DeNiro didn't even need to be in this movie, it bothered me that he had such a meaningless role (in terms of DeNiro caliber roles, anyone his age could have played that part).  I'll give it a 7 though when all is said and done because of Pam Grier's performance and the soundtrack, and those two things put together make the movie interesting enough for me to watch and enjoy."

","It's difficult to distance ""Jackie Brown"" from the earlier works of director Quentin Tarantino.  Compared to ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" it falls down at least a couple of pegs.  Tarantino's characters usually live in the criminal fringe of society, but most can evoke some sympathy from an audience.  This was not true of ""Jackie Brown"" at least not for me.  In the title role, Pam Grier gives us very little outside of attitude ... she might be in trouble, but she's not taking anyone's guff ... and I didn't feel that was enough.  I don't think you can base a quality film on someone whose only obvious attribute is that she can vamp through an airport like Tina Turner (who, by the way, would have been a better fit for the character).  Robert Forster, as the bail bondsman, gave an excellent performance.  He validated Grier's character by subtly playing off her affected sassiness.  Forster gave the audience a character to cheer for.  Samuel L. Jackson made a terrific villain, but I couldn't stand that little braid he had growing off his chin (was that supposed to be a beard?).  Robert Deniro showed, once again, why he is one of the best-paid stars in Hollywood.  He played the part of a basically useless thug, a man without a conscience or charm, but made him funny and charming, in a brutish kind of way.  Deniro made the character interesting, even though it was only a small part.  They should show clips of ""Jackie Brown"" in Acting 101 classes for Deniro's performance alone.  It is too bad, for the sake of this film as a whole, that Deniro's character was such a small part.  Two of the best scenes in this movie are between Deniro and Jackson, in a panel truck, and between Deniro and Bridget Fonda, in a parking lot.  ""Jackie Brown"" gets bogged down in the scenes between Grier and Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen, as two narcotics policemen.  The ordinarily likeable Keaton is out of his element here, trying to play a tough but well-meaning cop. He isn't able to establish any chemistry between himself and Grier.  As the hero, Forster did a much better job of that, and Jackson as well, as the anti-hero.  Fonda is believable as Jackson's ""blonde surfer girl"".  You see flashes of Quentin Tarantino's magic touch in ""Jackie Brown"" but mostly this film is remarkable only for a few very special acting performances amidst some questionable casting choices."

I like Reservoir Dogs and I really love Pulp Fiction, so I had hopeful expectations prior to viewing this film. Sadly, I was very disappointed by what I saw.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro was a wasted talent who had no purpose to the story, the movie doesn't know what it wants to be, and Samuel L. Jackson doesn't make a convincing hustler. Does that mean I hate everything about this movie? Not necessarily. I like the direction, the dialog is smooth, and the production value is good, but I wanted more and the movie just didn't deliver. For example, there's a scene where the female lead is getting a bag full of money in a dressing room. It shows you this exact same scene from three different perspectives which was annoying and didn't move the plot forward. Tarantino did this method so well in Pulp Fiction, but that movie worked because of its non-linear structure. Here, its like Tarantino ran out of ideas on the way there and didn't know how to translate his vision.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was a disappointment.

","Reportedly, Elmore Leonard read the Tarantino-penned script of Jackie Brown and proclaimed it the best screenplay he'd ever read. This wasn't hyperbole - watching Jackie Brown is watching dialogue glide right off the page onto the screen in a fashion you don't often get to see. Jackie Brown is the ultimate writer's film, an action film where the dialogue is the action. <br/><br/>Tarantino balances the film's narrative complexity with genuine emotional involvement and (shock) a believable love story and the result is so brilliant it seems almost effortless. Perhaps this is why people consistently rate Jackie Brown below many of his other films. It all looks a little too easy, a little too cool. <br/><br/>Well, it's my feeling that this film represented the peak of Tarantino's monopoly on 'cool' in films, and that his output post Brown has been a constant battle to maintain that status or to win it back. Tarantino has said he would never adapt another film. I think that's too bad, as this film represents what I believe is the greatest film to Tarantino's credit. Jackie Brown is fantastic cinema told with balls to the wall confidence."

But as I've seen for myself, that isn't so. In fact, I prefer this film any day over his latest film, ""Inglorious Bastards"", which had so many over -the-top moments it felt silly in comparison to his usual work. Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard, which I have not read. Despite this, our director brings his full game to this film and it shows in every shot. The story flows quite nicely and the comedy is well played and natural. As with any production of this particular director, there is never a dull moment and the tension can be heart wrenching at times.<br/><br/>And to keep all of this in sync, we have one of his most memorable cast to date. Samuel L. Jackson is as menacing as ever as Ordell, while Chris Tucker is incredibly funny with his role. In fact I find Jackson's performance as stirring as Jules in ""pulp Fiction"", although here it is clear he's the antagonist. Robert DeNiro is just as excellent as you would naturally expect, while Bridget Fonda is just as sexy as she is talented as Melanie, one of the most intriguing characters in this movie. Michael Keaton is the ATF agent, and I loved his performance as I always do. I was surprised to see Pam Grier and Robert Forster have such a natural on-screen chemistry, it fascinates me. Both nailed their performances hard and did excellently.<br/><br/>As I said previously, the plot swerves and turns this way and that and I loved every minute of it. And the sound track was fresh, delivering a very hip, 'Blaxploitation' type of feel to it all. I mean overall, I enjoyed this film more than say the ""Kill Bill"" films (not to dethrone them off my own personal lists, as they are great films) and it is worthy of every film and Tarantino's fans respect.<br/><br/>A...""Man, I ain't geetin' no trunk, for no minute!!"""

(With the exception of Zeus)<br/><br/>It's rare to see a long film and not be aware of the passing of time - this is no exception.<br/><br/>Needs to try harder (Or perhaps not so much)<br/><br/>Dan"

","I first watched Jackie Brown when it came out in the cinema back in 1997. And, like so many people at the time, I was unimpressed. I fell into that large group of people who felt it wasn't up to the violent/gory standards of Reservoir Dogs or the cleverly made-up standards of Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>Now, fifteen years later, I decided to watch it again and see if my opinion has changed. Now I'm not so blown away with the great Pulp Fiction, I thought I might be less biased.<br/><br/>Sadly, my opinion hasn't changed that much.<br/><br/>This time I was able to look at it as a stand-alone film, not just 'Pulp Fiction 2,' yet, unfortunately, I still found it sub-standard.<br/><br/>It's two and a half hours long. And, for quite a lot of time, it really feels like it. Samuel L Jackson plays a similar (if not as cool/likable) character as his one in Pulp Fiction and does his best to carry the show. Robert DeNiro is obviously a great actor of the modern age, yet he doesn't seem to come alive at all. He mainly sits on the sofa looking like someone who's come on his own to a nightclub and doesn't know whether he should leave or not. (despite participating in the film's really only shocking and unexpected moment of the film). Plus the film's titular character, Pam Grier, is as good as she can be and Bridget Fonda makes good eye candy for the lads! The major gripe I have with the film is its constant use of over-wordy dialogue for scenes. Yes, we get to know the characters well through how they interact with each other, but it's just too much. Each scene is dragged out for longer than it feels like it needs to be.<br/><br/>Sometimes films are re-released as a 'director's cut' with added material. Jackie Brown is one film I'd like to see a director's cut of which has been trimmed down to a shorter run-time.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is not Pulp Fiction. It doesn't try to be. It does win points for staking a claim to being a film in its own right. However, the fact remains is that it just isn't as good as anything Quentin Tarrantino has done before it, or since.<br/><br/>I'm glad I gave it a second viewing. Even though now I doubt I'll ever watch it again (even in another fifteen years time), I didn't feel like I'd completely wasted the two and a half hours of my life. I just felt that there are better gangster-style films of the genre than this, despite its impressive ensemble cast.<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"
"The_Void","8","1","5","10 January 2005"," Tarantino does what Tarantino does best
","Quentin Tarantino's third feature isn't generally as highly rated among fans as his previous two. Many non-Tarantino fans say that Tarantino fans don't like this film because it's central character is a woman, but the simple fact of the matter is that it's simply not as good. Jackie Brown lacks the bite and dynamic genius that epitomised Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and instead of having a profound influence on cinema, Jackie Brown is more of a continuation of what Tarantino started with his first two features. I am neither a fan nor a hater of Tarantino; up until the Kill Bill travesty, I was a fan; but now I'm not so sure. However, this was made in a time when Tarantino was still cool, and 'cool' is something this movie definitely is. The coolness comes from Tarantino's quick-fire script, relaxed character mannerisms and old style soundtrack. The coolness doesn't do the film any favours whatsoever on the realism, or credibility front, but when you're watching Jackie Brown, you know you're watching a movie; so just sit back, relax and have fun, as Tarantino takes you on a tour of what he loves about cinema.<br/><br/>In technical terms, Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's finest hour. This is the most intelligent and mature script he ever wrote (the fact that it was based on someone else's work not withstanding). This is also the film that he reached his directorial peak. Tarantino is good at making cool crime films; he proved it with his first two features, and this film goes a long way to proving it more. Typically, it's a long way from perfect; it's overlong (an interesting prelude to Kill Bill, which was about 2 hours overlong), the character development is cringe-worthy at times and the story gets muddled a little towards the middle; but the good outweighs the bad, and when you've got the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Robert DeNiro chewing fat over a 'Chicks with Guns' video, you're unlikely to care about the film's problems. As usual, Tarantino razzle-dazzles his audience with his trademark 'great' cast (which really is great by the way) and a soundtrack comprised of songs that used to be hip (and now are again, strangely) and this helps to mask the film's problems also.<br/><br/>All in all, Jackie Brown is a lot of fun. Audiences the world over should gather round and thank Tarantino for making this film. This is the sort of film that allows you to lose yourself for a couple of hours and just absorb what you see on screen. Quentin Tarantino may not be the greatest director of all time, but he knows how to entertain and this film is immense in that department. Here's to hoping Tarantino returns to projects he can handle in the near future..."

","""Jackie Brown"" is one of the dullest movies I've ever seen (actually, I shut it off about 2/3 of the way through, since I wasn't following the story anymore and had no interest in doing so).  A semi all-star cast, with all of the actors clearly ""playing themselves.""  A deadly boring story, little action, and it all goes on for far, far too long.<br/><br/>I simply wasn't interested enough to put in the energy required to follow the plot, and so as the film progressed I knew less and less about what was happening.  Despite the ""realistic feel"" (which on deeper examination seems carefully contrived), I cared nothing for any of the characters (in fact, I found most of them quite irritating, especially the two detectives) and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen (eventually, almost praying for something interesting to happen).  Unfortunately, nothing did.  There are those who might enjoy this movie, I suppose, but I thought it was a complete dud, about as interesting to watch as plain, unsalted white rice is to eat.  5/10."

Jackie Brown, with its complex crime plot and detailed characters, is a must-see for anyone who is a fan of the genre.<br/><br/>What really holds this film together is the fabulous acting.

","Jackie Brown is often considered one of Tarantino's weaker projects. While I believe that this viewpoint does hold some truth, it still doesn't take away from the fact that it's still riddled with his charm, uniqueness, and genius.<br/><br/>Tarantino's usual strengths are here - engrossing, realistic dialogue, interesting presentation & cinematography, amazing score, and entertaining characters. It's these attributes that make sitting through Tarantino run times worth it.<br/><br/>However, for the first, and possibly only time in his career, Tarantino's own style works against him in Jackie Brown. The screenplay is an adaptation of the book ""rum punch"", which features a story that would benefit from Tarantino breaking away from his usual style at points. The two styles do actually go together pretty flawlessly in roughly the first hour of the film - the characters are all introduced in an entertaining and informative fashion, and they all seemed pretty distinct and memorable, partly due to the spot on acting by everyone involved (although mostly Samuel L Jackson & Robert De Niro). However, once Jackie begins to go rogue and scheme on pretty much everyone else in the film, the film began to lose me a little.<br/><br/>The ""one woman against the world"" plot presented in Jackie Brown would truly benefit from Tarantino really getting into Brown's head, but his laid back style doesn't quite allow for that, making many of Brown's decisions confuse me just as much as it confused her opponents in the story. As an audience, we can be surprised by our protagonist, but we shouldn't be confused. As a result, the story structure and direction left me questioning most of Jackie's decisions in the second and third act, making me feel detached from her, and her partner Max Cherry - when the film really would have benefitted from making us truly root for Jackie through getting a glimpse into her psyche, not just because she's the title character.<br/><br/>The film is also full of long shots. At best these make the film extremely interesting to watch unfold, but can sometimes leave the film with the feeling that it's meandering a little - the film, much like many other Tarantino films, could lose around 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Despite the slightly lackluster protagonist and meandering moments, Jackie Brown is still definitely another quality film in Tarantino's catalogue, filled to the brim with life and character, and a story that is undeniably interesting once all the pieces fall into place. 7/10."

","Following mega-hits (especially back-to-back mega-hits like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction) is bound to be a tough job. If Reservoir Dogs didn't cross your path back when it first came out, Pulp Fiction would've and, by the time Quentin Tarantino began working on his third film, it's only inevitable that people would compare whatever we would go on to do with his two previously established hits. Perhaps as a response, he decided to make Jackie Brown, which goes in a different direction entirely.
As has already been said here on IMDb, this film is much more ""mature"" than anything else Tarantino's done, which could've worked in his favor. This movie, however, is a major slow-burn that really starts to drag before the halfway point.
A lot of people adore this film - would, in fact, place it on a pedestal as being Tarantino's best film - but it just wasn't for me. It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it was a major disappointment to follow up the prior two films. This particularly story could've been justifiably told in a 90 minute window as opposed to the ass-numbing 154 minutes that is Jackie Brown.<br/><br/>I still maintain that Quentin Tarantino hasn't ever made a ""bad"" film, because ""bad"" this film is not.

","""Jackie Brown"" shows Quentin Tarantino at his very best - and his very worst. Like all of Tarantino's work ""Jackie Brown"" has razor sharp dialogue and unique characters driven by excellent performances from the entire cast. Pam Grier and Michael Keaton in particular create sympathetic, three demensional people that are among Tarantino's most realistic creations. As always Tarantino's music choices animate each and every scene, even if what's happening on screen is less interesting than the soundtrack.<br/><br/>But there's a reason that ""Jackie Brown"" has a reputation of being one of Tarantino's weakest movies. Although it does highlight what's great about Tarantino, it suffers from his biggest flaw as a director: excess. Excessive characters, excessive language (more specifically, excessive racial slurs), and an excessive running time make ""Jackie Brown"" a less than entertaining experience. There's absolutely no reason for ""Jackie Brown"" to be over two and a half hours long - a running time that's largely the result of unnecessary filler and drawn out conversations. ""Pulp Fiction"" is longer than it needs to be, yet the characters are so original and entertaining that you don't care they talk too much. The characters in ""Jackie Brown"" are well-written, but they just aren't interesting enough to justify endless, long-winded conversations about nothing of importance. What worked in ""Pulp Fiction"" doesn't work in ""Jackie Brown."" Fortunately Tarantino learned from this and switched styles with ""Kill Bill"" 1 & 2, which remain two of my favorite films of the past 20 years.<br/><br/>The central plot, which involves a flight attendant attempting to outsmart men on both sides of the law, is novel but simply not executed well. Unlike Tarantino's other plot driven films like ""Kill Bill"" or ""Django Unchained"" there's no emotional investment in the overall story. After the first forty-five minutes the movie loses you as a viewer until the sensational third act - which thankfully is well worth the long wait.<br/><br/>All in all ""Jackie Brown"" showcases what's great about Tarantino - and what's not so great about Tarantino. There's more good than bad: the acting, directing, and writing is just good enough to overcome poor pacing and an uninteresting plot. 7/10."

","Some say ""Jackie Brown"" is Tarantino's best work. I would say it at least equals the other masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction"". If you love his other work, then you must give this gem a chance, although everything is done very differently then in his other work, yet the Tarantino magic is still very recognizable and highly enjoyable. Higly enjoyable! I would say that ""Jackie Brown"" is his most playful work, yet simultaneously it is also his most serious work. It just oozes creativity and fun in his typical Tarantino direction style, but the story and the characters are still being portrayed very seriously, unlike many other Tarantino works in which characters often become almost cartoon like. <br/><br/>This story is told entirely chronologically, with only one flashback. It is based on a story by Elmore Leonard, who has written numerous great stories, that have been turned into movie scripts. Quentin Tarantino got to know of this famous author by reading pulp magazines in the seventies, which were the inspiration for the title of his most popular movie ""Pulp Fiction"". But ""Jackie Brown"" is totally different in style and storyline, so be warned, because some first time viewers are a bit disappointed watching ""Jackie Brown"" because they expected more action. It is still very funny, but it is a talking heads movie, lots and lots of talk. Some serious talk, some con talk and some hilarious talk! <br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" is a slowburning portrait of a woman in financial dire straits, who smuggles some money across the border for a weapons dealer (Samuel L Jackson). She gets caught and then the story unfolds in ways you couldnt imagine, because Jackie Brown has gotta save her own ass and does she know how to do that! Female empowerment Booyah! Gotta see it for yourself. Suspenseful, hilarious and touching. <br/><br/>The huge amount of time that is taken to learn to know the leading character Jackie Brown pleases me enormously. But some Tarantino gore fans migth find it lacking in speed. I love the slowburning flow of this story, I truly think the slowness is essential to the core of this subtle portrait. Almost 2 and a half hours is the running time and I guess 75% is pure talk with close ups of Jackie Brown and the other characters. <br/><br/>Shot in 4:3 format, the old television format of the seventies and eighties and this particular choice of the director further prenounciates these magnificent close ups of the characters. It's a talking heads movie, in which every eyelash, wrinkle and nervous twitch in ones facial expression can be observed. That makes for some stunning pictures of the actors in it. <br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" is an Actor's Gem! Best dork role of Robert de Niro ever. Most freakiest role of Samuel L Jackson ever. And Pam Grier is by far the star of this brilliant Tarantino flick. What a joy to watch over and over again. I just can't get enough of it!<br/><br/>Please check out the Trivia section of this film, because it is full of fun anecdotes. Interviews and quotes by Tarantino himself are often as interesting as his movies. Just a quote that I couldnt withold from you Imdb viewers: Quentin Tarantino compares the film Jackie Brown to Rio Bravo (1959). ""It's a hangout movie"", he explained. ""Jackie Brown is better the second time, and I think it's even better the third, and the fourth time. To me, that's the thing that Rio Bravo (1959) did. I remember the first time I saw Rio Bravo (1959), but I remember more the fifteenth time I saw Rio Bravo (1959).

","RELEASED IN 1997 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Jackie Brown"" is a crime drama about a middle-aged flight attendant, the eponymous Brown (Pam Grier), who smuggles huge sums of cash from Mexico to L.A. for a too-cool arms dealer, Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson). When she's caught by two agents (Michael Keaton & Michael Bowen) they propose a deal to apprehend the dealer in exchange for her freedom. In the meantime Ordell enlists an aging bondsman, Max Cherry (Robert Forster), to release her with the aim of eradicating her. Brown knows Ordell's wicked intentions and devises a plan to not only survive the life-or-death situation, but come out the richer for it. Bridget Fonda plays Ordell's hot white babe and Robert De Niro his fresh-out-of-prison pal.<br/><br/>This is Tarantino's most realistic film, so don't expect his typical cartoonish-ness and buckets of blood. There are occasional flashes of violence, but this is mostly a talk-driven drama. Interesting dialogues have always been one of Tarantino's strengths and so it is here. Grier is a distinguished protagonist while Fonda is smoking in her Daisy Dukes. De Niro's character is in a post-prison stupor, but you know he's still very formidable, which one character is too dull to realize. Bottom Line: ""Jackie Brown"" may not be as eventful as ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) or ""Django Unchained"" (2012), but it's a very good crime drama and unique in Tarantino's oeuvre. <br/><br/>THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours & 34 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area (e.g. Venice Beach, Carson, Torrance, Compton, Carson & Hawthorne).

The opening and the ending works very well and especially the 3 perspective shopping montage that feels both clever and original (If it's not stolen from another movie). And the camera work just screams Tarantino, so you still know who is behind the movie. <br/><br/>And my final line is this: This guy will never made a bad movie. <br/><br/>Death proof was a dead project from the beginning because the Grind house genre is not a very serious one and I would still think most people would agree that it's one of the better movies in it's genre. And this one is still a solid film that works and doesn't lose hes reputation after making Pulp Fiction (One of the greatest movies of all time) that would have give most directors goosebumps. Just the idea of after making two adrenaline pumped movies going back and making this one, just say so much about how skilled and controlled Tarantino is as a director and that's why he will never do a bad movie.<br/><br/>This is a solid film that I would have cut a bit in the middle.It's my least favorite movie in Tarantinos filmography and I don't even think it's in my top 100-150."

","Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's third feature length film, and the only one is his roster that's not an original screenplay. And this is why, in my opinion, it's his least- best work. It's still a solid piece of work, but by filming an adaption Tarantino doesn't get the chance to break free like he's done with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. JB contains only fleeting moments of absurdity and outrageousness, toned down as if to keep the director in check. Jackie (Pam Grier) an air hostess, is forced to smuggle money from Mexico to L.A by the unconvincing weapons dealer Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson). Betrayal and double crossings ensue. Agent Nicolette (Michael Keaton) is on her case. Others involved include a bail bonds accountant (Robert Forster) and a couple of Ordell's friends (Robert De Niro and Bridget Fonda). A good hour could be cut from the 154 minute running time to make it quick, snappy and enthralling. Instead it drags in the 2nd act, and by that time, I had to pause, and split Jackie Brown in to parts. Of all of Tarantino's films, this is one I won't be rushing back to."
"robsta23","8","0","1","3 December 2015"," Not Tarantino's Best, Still a Damn Good Movie
","After seeing it once when I was about 17 or 18, I didn't care too much for this film. It was ""complex"" - which I realize to be false after a second viewing - and it was very slow. Watching it again at the age of 22, I actually paid good attention to what was unfolding before me and appreciated this flick which diverged from the typical Tarantino style.<br/><br/>Going into this film, you should note that it is heavily laced with dialogue sequences and is Tarantino's least violent and least action-packed film. I suggest you pay careful attention to what is said by each character as well, as characters are being described and discussed before they appear in the film.<br/><br/>The main story is of particular interest, as it follows the heroine, Jackie Brown, as she struggles for survival while being pulled by two opposing forces - the arms dealer, played by Samuel L Jackson, who is hesitant to trust Jackie, and the cops who are trying to take the arms dealer down. Interestingly enough, we also have a male character who lies somewhere between these two poles. He is a bonds man, played by Robert Forster, who Jackie seems to depend on for advice. You may think he is a man of the law at first due to his occupation, but he ends up being about as morally ambiguous as Jackie Brown, experiencing Jackie's story and her actions without bringing his knowledge to the cops whatsoever.<br/><br/>Aside from being slow at certain parts, the main bit of criticism I have to give this film is that it seems way too heavy on close-ups or shots that zoom into close-ups and pull back as a reaction. I understand Tarantino wanted us to get close to certain characters, experience what they are experiencing, getting more intimate etc etc, but this was a motif so obvious it annoyed me.<br/><br/>This film may feel long at points, but it seems the extra time is necessary to develop each character in the ensemble cast well enough to understand who they are and what their goals are in this very intricate story. I would recommend this film to anybody who appreciates a good drama or to any Tarantino fans so they may experience his range as a director.<br/><br/>3.0/4.0"
"a1_andy_11","Null","0","2","6 December 2014"," Disregard the plot holes and it's still just above average.
","Jackie Brown is one of those films that captures the feel of a 90s LA expertly. Specifically the scenes in Ordell's apartment and the mall. The high production value helps with this. The choice of editing, sets, props, and cinematography pull you right into those scenes.<br/><br/>The plot tends to get a little too convoluted. It contains some big holes. i.e. There would be CCTV all over the mall. The store clerk at Billingtons would have been interviewed by the police. Not to mention the fact that people NEVER get handed a bag full of cash and just assume it's all there without checking immediately. Everything was just too conveniently tied up at the end making the heist utterly unbelievable..<br/><br/>The above issues pale in comparison to the films fundamental flaw. Our bad guy (Ordell) is a much more likable character than the good girl (Jackie). Even though we know Ordell is a degenerate criminal we still root for him. Jackie Brown is given the moral high ground to steal the cash. The viewer is supposed to feel good about her intricate back stabbing scheme. We don't though because it's much harder to emphasise with Jackie. We understand Ordells motivations in a much clearer way. This problem is compounded by the fact that Pam Grier is a mediocre actress surrounded by actors and actresses that steal every scene she is in. All of the other characters are more interesting to watch than hers.<br/><br/>Tarrentino overused 'Didn't I' by The Delfonics too. It got dreary hearing that song played in the final act.<br/><br/>Overall I give a 7/10. Mainly for the supporting cast and the production value."

","JACKIE BROWN seems to play against Tarantino's usual violence-and- pop-culture driven type and that's why I love this movie. It's a loving ode to '70s blaxploitation movies and a slick caper movie that just oozes style. But it's not a huge departure; there are still the long stretches of dialogue between well-rounded characters, but it's the quality of the writing and how smoothly the dialogue flows that keeps things moving. Boring is not a word to describe this movie. This thing's got a heavy-hitter cast (whacked- out De Niro, the always terrific Keaton, Fonda rocking that beach bunny getup and Jackson who just unloads the attitude) and it spotlights Pam Grier and Robert Forster, who are both winning casting choices.<br/><br/>It's my favorite Tarantino, a slow-burn character piece that just seems to hit all of its targets. The soundtrack cooks, Chris Tucker gets capped after five minutes' screen time, and it's always a thrill to watch the heist go down. <br/><br/>Great movie, all around.<br/><br/>9/10"

","The reason that this film is highly underrated is because it is not your average Tarantino Film!. I do not mean this in a bad way. It is a brilliant film but is different then Tarantino's other films. It has an A list cast, a great director, and an interesting storyline that never has a dull moment, and it has very interesting characters. the only reason that i rated this film 8 out of ten is because when it is compared to Tarantino's other films i think his other films are not as good AS Jackie brown. Jackie Brown is still a great film but it lacks a bit of the great dialog and cool action and dark comedy scenes seen in Tarantino's other films. If you are a Tarantino fan then it is essential that you watch this because it is Tarantino's most mature film. Another reason this is underrated is because it was compared to Pulp Fiction and because pulp Fiction is the better Film between the two it was underrated because most people that watched this film set there expectations to high. If you are a Tarantino fan and have not seen this yet than you should definitely watch it"
"dromasca","8","0","1","24 July 2013"," the less Tarantinesque of Tarantino's movies
","Somehow I missed 'Jackie Brown' - a Tarantino movie made in 1997 which takes in his directing career a chronological place between 'Pulp Fiction' and the two 'Kill Bill' movies. It is to some extent the less Tarantinesque of the Tarantino movies - 150 minutes of solid film making, a violent gangster movie very much in tone with the 90s, but lacking the excesses and the sarcasm of his greatest films. I am sure though that many other folks will consider it the best or one of the best films in his career, exactly for the same reasons I did not like it completely. Great acting by Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda and Palm Grier. Excellent soul music soundtrack - Tarantino's mobsters have a special taste for music, did you notice?"

","I'll refrain from summarizing the entire film because you've either already seen it or you're interested in watching the story. Instead I'll just share some thoughts I had with you.<br/><br/>It definitely felt like a step down from most of his films. There wasn't anything revolutionary about the film. The beginning seemed to lag for a good while. It eventually picked up steam during the heist portion of the movie, but that in itself didn't really seem to have anything new to add to that genre. The were some really nice long shots in the film (I'm a huge fan of artistically staged lengthy takes), the car pulling into the empty lot on the other side of the fence is a good example. I will say tho, that there were some long shots that seemed to be stretched out for no apparent reason other than just to do it.<br/><br/>The acting was solid. The characters were a mix. Jackie was stuck in a dead end job for somewhere around twenty years and yet she proved to be quite the master mind by the end of the movie. Kind of makes you wonder why she wasn't able to advance in her career. Jackson's character was well played and was indeed intriguing, but after a while I kind of wished he would leave me alone. <br/><br/>It's not a bad movie, but not one I would recommend to someone else. These are just my thoughts on this particular project. If you're interested in the film I'd urge you to see it and make your own."
"drqshadow-reviews","9","0","2","8 May 2013"," Black Sheep of the Tarantino Family, Jackie's More Substance-Minded Than Style-Blinded
","Easily Quentin Tarantino's most mature work, which admittedly isn't saying much for a director who brought us the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique and a literal blast of adrenaline to the heart. That's not to say his films have ever lacked in substance - rather, I think the true depth of their character is merely overshadowed by those visceral moments of graphic excess and their stylish methods of delivery. Jackie Brown, instead, manages to step out from that bloody shadow and shine on its own volition. Its lingering close-ups and long doses of heady silence give the impression that the plot is moving slowly, when in fact it's going roughly a mile a minute. Tarantino just wants us to savor the performances of his all-star cast and the tangle of plot threads that surrounds them before forcing our heads out the window and punching the gas in the last twenty minutes. Along the way, he subtly, efficiently grazes a gamut of emotions that leaves us deeply invested in the (often untimely) fate of each character. Rich, complex and rewarding, it's not as flashy as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but it's every bit as excellent."
"Degree7","8","0","1","7 May 2013"," Highly enjoyable crime caper
","Tarantino is often derided by his dismissives as an over zealous, pop-culturally obsessed schizoid with a penchant for fetishizing violence and, oddly enough, feet. But in this 1997 adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel, and hot off the heels off the watershed event that was Pulp Fiction three years prior, he chose to follow up his electric filmography by incorporating a slightly more complex and elegant plot in the form of a heist caper. What sets it apart from other entries in the genre (and subsequent adaptations of Leonard works by the likes of other gen X indie directors like Soderbergh), is Tarantino's unique combination of cinema homage and pastiche that gives the proceedings a fresh and vibrant aura. Tarantino skillfully employs elements of blaxploitation through choice soundtrack, camera work, and elegant casting. Pam Grier in the eponymous title role as a middle aged Afro-American woman attempting to emerge out on top of a crime sting is not only a headstrong and intelligently spunky protagonist, but through the course of the film she offers an acute sensitivity to her situation that adds a gravity to the story. coupled with a subtle turn by Robert Forster, in a similair comeback role to John Travolta in Pulp, as an aging, jaded bail bondsman who is injected with a burst of vitalic romantic interest in Jackie Brown, and the subsequent bonding that grows between them offers Tarantino his most empathetically human and thematic material thus far.<br/><br/>But the most entertaining turn in from the cast is Samuel L Jackson as the fast-talking, foul mouthed thug who isn't quite as clever of a criminal as he thinks he is. The often witty and hilarious dialogue exchanges between he, Bridget Fonda, and an unassuming Robert DeNiro as a bumbling, apathetic accomplice is amusing and carries the film deftly onward, even when it threatens to be dragged down by the slightly dry plot. But there is a noticeable lack of cloying pop cultural references in the script that Tarantino is known for. Instead, it is all just great character acting, and he manages to make the mundane a roller coaster of verbal levity.<br/><br/>The look of the picture is great, with skillfully composed shots and fine tuned audio, with a killer soundtrack to top it off. Jackie Brown is a tightly made film that delivers in its black humor and a feel good tale of one sassy feminist throwback getting the better of her clueless colleagues, and learning a little bit of mid life wisdom along the way. Highly recommended for fans of well constructed and stylish crime capers."

","It's the best of Tarantino? No it is not! It's extremely fun? A LOT! Jackie Brown is the 3rd feature film from the master Quentin Tarantino, and can once again prove their writing skills and originality, and an unforgettable cast. The story looks a bit like Pulp Fiction, Jackie (Pam Grier) is a black stewardess 40 years, with life unstable financial environment, at least in this work. Because secretly she's a drug dealer and exchange money, she works for the ""famous"" arm's dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), the most dangerous and ruthless leader of the crime (and extremely entertaining) anyone can know. On a normal day of traffic, Jackie is caught by two DEA agents Ray (Michael Keaton) and Mark (Michael Bowen), before being arrested both agents offer Jackie the chance to have all his clean criminal record in helping arrest Ordell . Between being perpetually stuck or open your mouth and be killed by Ordell, Jackie sees only a chance to enjoy this little game of intrigue. The entire movie, like any Tarantino movie, is filled with intriguing dialogs, what is most striking is that the film manages to be extremely fun just getting the dialog, and the plot twists than any movie Tarantino has. But this was the first film I see that Tarantino takes mild violence. It is violent? It is, but is not that awesome bloodbath of the other Tarantino's films. The cast is also formidable, Samuel L. Jackson BADASS as always; Pam Grier excellent as Robert Forster; Robert De Niro does not give his best performance, but he still shine as the temperamental junkie Louis Gara. Not the best of Tarantino, but it is really entertaining from start to finish, keeping the good spirit of the films of the great Master."
"aciessi","8","0","2","26 March 2013"," A Different Tarentino
","When you think of Quentin Tarentino, you think of Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds and Django Unchained. But never, in conversation about his works, is Jackie Brown ever really discussed. It seems that Jackie Brown has always been the black sheep of Tarentino's legacy. It didn't even make a decent amount of money in its theatrical run. Surprising, because with the phenomenon of Pulp Fiction, you would think that moviegoers would line up for blocks to catch this flick on opening weekend. But we all knew he wasn't going to top what he did before. Making a movie better than Pulp Fiction is an impossible task. But thats not what Tarentino was going for. Tarentino wanted to take a break from his violent roots and prove himself as a filmmaker by making a smart, sexy crime caper along the lines of Ocean's Eleven. Not only did he meet his goal, he exceeded it. The cast is near perfect, delivering some of the best performances in any Tarentino film. Pam Grier channels her old bad-ass acting career while at the same time being who she really is, making her performance so raw and dangerously cool. Robert Forster's performance was truly moving, capturing his unrequited love for Jackie so subtly, conveying it powerfully in every shot of his time on screen. Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson as always. Bridget Fonda is absolutely steaming. All except for Robert DeNiro. I couldn't get used to him playing the blithering idiot he is on screen. It made me a little uncomfortable, considering that he is a powerhouse of an actor and this role forced him to take a huge leap backwards. But I guess, somehow, its pretty cool to see him play someone else. Whats restraining me from giving this a perfect score is the movie as a whole. It just doesn't feel like a movie directed by Quentin. His body and soul is just not present here, other than his penchant for witty dialog and an impressive soundtrack. I guess I was disappointed as much people were when the film debuted. We wanted more, we expected so much, and we were let down. Jackie Brown will always stand in the shadows of Quentin's other films, but don't let that be a reason to never see it. Watch it from beginning to end and embrace it as an excellent film, not his film."
"basilisksamuk","7","0","1","24 February 2013"," Good Tarantino but film belongs to Pam Grier
","The things you need to know are; that SLJ sells guns and Pam Grier, who plays Jackie Brown, works as a flight attendant for a crummy airline but smuggles money out of Mexico for SLJ. Jackie Brown is braced by the feds who are after SLJ just when SLJ decides he wants his entire half million stash bringing out of Mexico. Thrown into the mix are Robert De Niro as a very dim sidekick to SLJ, Bridget Fonda as one of SLJ's girlfriends and Robert Forster as a bail bondsman who falls for Grier. The scene is then set for a complex plot in which you are never entirely sure who is going to double-cross whom right up to the very last few scenes of the film.<br/><br/>This is a very conventional film in many ways. It is heavily plot-driven in a way that sustains tension throughout. The characters are given plenty of opportunity to develop and to surprise the audience. There are laughs and a few in-jokes. The camera movements are, for the most part, very constrained and the use of close-ups is extensive. Only twice does Tarantino do anything out of the ordinary; once where he uses a short split-screen sequence and once where he shows the same scene three times from three different perspectives. But you feel that this is not the director showing off but sensible decision taking about how the plot can best be served. The violence is nearly all off screen and the only thing your maiden aunt could object to is the language. And what language it is. It seems like Tarantino has a perfect ear for putting just exactly the words you would expect into his character's mouths. We all know no one is as fluent, as funny or as dumb in real life but, whilst we are in the cinema, we believe that real people could speak this way. It seems like there are acres and acres of dialogue in Tarantino's films but they are all worth hearing.<br/><br/>At the heart of the film though is Pam Grier as Jackie Brown. It's not as if she comes over as being a great actress but she does come across as being a real woman. She's got a serious choice to make if she is ever going to get out of being a flight attendant and she is streetwise enough to be plausible as the woman who will risk it all to rip off the half million and still win your sympathy. She is also in her forties, big by comparison with what is fashionable, and more gorgeous than any teen or twenties stick-insect actress that you could ever mention. Clearly, either Tarantino or the cameraperson, or both, are deeply in love with Pam Grier as is evidenced by the many long and lingering shots of her. Some of these shots go on for so long that there can be no reason to hold them for the sake of advancing the film. They are simply there to let us look at her and read every nuance in her face. If you don't like her face then some of this film will leave you cold. And this leads to my only criticism of the film in that it could comfortably be 20 to 30 minutes shorter – not necessarily cutting the shots of Pam Grier but elsewhere where things run on just a shade too long."

","Jackie Brown is a 44 year old air hostess who also acts as a money carrier for her boss, gun dealer Ordell Robbie. When one of Ordell's other employee's is caught he is forced to kill him, however, before he can get to him the employee tells the police about Jackie and they pick her up. With Jackie facing jail or being killed by Ordell she strikes a deal with both the police and him to bring in a large stash of money. However to help her retirement she plans to play the game to her own ends. The film is still full of Tarantinoisms for the fans - the heavy soundtrack, the pop culture references, the witty, slick dialogue. It is in Jackie and Max where Tarantino has grown up a bit - although in fairness this was an adaptation rather than his own script, but he still manages them better than some of his own thin characters. Tarantino takes a breather between Pulp and the Kill Bill movies here with a nonviolent drama. It's slow, but it's refreshing. The characters are all well conceived and all of them sustain and give an extra strength to the plot. I appreciate especially two acting jobs: The one by Samuel Jackson, which does one more time the role he does best; Pam Grier, who plays the main role (JACKIE BROWN), and does a magnificent work playing a strong and intelligent woman that can deceive everyone and ends fulfilling her goal. About DeNiro's role, LOUIS GARA, which is not a very important to this movie, I think he does a character with a personality from what I'm used to watch in other movies. Here, he's silent and nervous and almost seems like a ""poor little devil"" thief. <br/><br/>I think Tarantino did a great job one more time. It's not a masterpiece like PULP FICTION or Kill Bill but it's a great film and must watch for any movie buff Overall I enjoy this film and can understand why it will never be loved to the extent that Pulp was and is. However to me this is a satisfying film with an enjoyable plot and a more traditional delivery.

","Watching Jackie Brown again on a big screen, as I had the pleasure of doing last night, reminded me of what an utterly superb piece of film making this was by Quentin Tarantino. There isn't a single wasted shot, scene or line in it, and the two and a half hour running time passed in a thoroughly enjoyable manner. From the opening shots of Pam Grier rushing through the airport to the strains of Across 110th Street, the story unfolds in a gentle but gripping way that allows the characters to breath and become far greater than the sum of their parts.<br/><br/>And what a story it is, with Tarantino's vision of the Elmore Leonard novel, Rum Punch, really bringing a vivid life and colour to the intrigue and uncertainty. The performances all work well, with Grier looking as sassy and sexy as any woman I think I've seen on screen, and her counterparts equally stepping up to the plate and delivering. Robert Forster convinces as nice-guy Max, the integrity of the man not overshadowed by his willingness to live on the edges of legality. Jackson and De Niro as the odd bad couple are funny and convincing in their engagements, with the added frisson of Bridget Fonda stirring up the mix.<br/><br/>The music is used brilliantly, adding to both the action and the events on screen and seeing it again in a cinema reminds one of just how good the camera work and editing really are. Its sumptuous to look at and quite compelling as you're swept along, particularly a long urgent take in the mall the second time around. I was still seeing things that I had missed in the various times I've watched this on DVD since it's release and I really can't recommend it enough. His best work in my opinion, measured, humorous, thoughtful, well-structured and utterly eminently watchable."

","Pam Grier is magnificent as Jackie, a woman whose life has taken so many wrong turns that she's reduced to air hostessing on the most obscure route possible which is a cover for her role as a drugs-money mule (her 'boss' the psychotic Samuel L Jackson). When the cops catch her, Jackie has to choose whether to work with them, against them, or a bit of both. The enigmatic older man bail-bondsman played brilliantly, touchingly, by Robert Forster takes a shine to Pam, and is a spanner in everyone's works. De Niro and Bridget Fonda are very amusing side-bar players in this. It's true pulp in its purest form: Elmore Leonard and Quentin Tarantino are made for each other.

",", I love Pam Grier and Tarantino is my favorite director. That being said, I was disappointed in his follow up to Pulp Fiction, a much better film. Pam is Jackie, a stewardess on a Mexican airline who smuggles cash for a gun runner named Ordell(Samuel L. Jackson). One of his workers, Beaumont, is arrested and jailed, so Ordell pays a bondsman, Max, to get him out in order to kill him before he turns informant. Too late, as he has already given Jackie's name and she is busted with planted cocaine and sent to the pokey. Her boss sends Max to bail her out and he is awed by her body and will not set her up to be killed. Instead they go back to her house where she pulls a gun on Ordell, and they make a deal where she will smuggle half a million dollars for him and he will retire. Of course, there is no honor among thieves, and Q.T. uses several plot twists throughout the Elmore Leonard inspired movie. It is also a tribute to Foxy Brown, the 60s blaxploitation film which starred Pam Grier. She still looks great; a very well preserved and sexy woman. The major problem is the 2-1/2 hour plus running time, which needed a good 1/2 hour edited out. Also, Bridget Fonda is one of the most annoying actresses on earth. She should go away forever. The rest of the cast is good, especially Robert Forster as Max and Robert DeNiro as Louis Gara. The length and Fonda's bad acting ruin it for me."
"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","10 October 2011"," A Woman Named Jackie Brown ...
","Quentin Tarantino created such recognizable trademarks in his first two movies that the third one, ""Jackie Brown"" seems like borrowing the name, but not the essence. No over-the-top violence, no wisecracking dialogues, no non-linear editing except for a few parts: ""Jackie Brown"" is not the most defining film of Tarantino's style, but certainly of his incredibly versatile talent. <br/><br/>The film patiently lets the relationships grow and the decisions be made with a level of realism that respects the audience's intelligence. Interactions, deep moments of thinking, while a usual thriller would mostly rely on action, massive shootouts or bloody violence; in ""Jackie Brown"", the point is elsewhere, and the plot only works to assess the depth and three-dimensionality of the characters, stuck in a cat-and-mouse situation with the complexity of a chess game. And with so many lives at stake, the smartest will be the winner. There's such a harrowing feeling relying on Jackie Brown's desperate need to be THE smartest, it's only fitting that she is an attendant: her situation embodies the stressful nature of her job, when regularly, she expresses the need to light a cigarette so she can pull herself together, have a break. And think again.<br/><br/>What makes ""Jackie Brown"" so compelling is that the best scenes generally feature two characters trying to act clever, to make a decision, a move, to see through things. Nothing is taken for granted, not even one earlier scene when Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) gets rid of Beaumont Livinston, a business partner who's got busted by the AFT agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and might rat on him, Beaumont (Chris Tucker) is hard to convince, refusing to get in the trunk, he finally falls in the trap when Ordell tempts him by promising his favorite food after the job is done. This scene is well-written and it serves the plot on two crucial levels: first, it highlights Ordell's personality as an excellent manipulator, secondly, it illustrates in what kind of situation, Jackie Brown is put, when she's the next one arrested by Nicolet.<br/><br/>The film is long because it works on a repetitive process, vital to create a feeling of logical continuity when the whole plot is based on pure logic. The first repetition involves the third most important character of the film, the bail bondsman, Max Cherry, played by Robert Forster in a nuanced but powerful performance, rightfully Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Max paid the bond for Beaumont before he got killed, and of course, he's the one in charge of Jackie Brown's case. By using the same logic, Tarantino deliberately lures us into a feeling of predictability to better surprise us with the scenes' outcomes. Yes, we expect Max to fall in love with Jackie, but the way it's handled is original and satisfying: no sex scene, no stereotypical dialogues, there's a relation evolving smoothly, graciously, with lines that ring true.<br/><br/>And 'true' is the first feeling that inspires the growing tacit romance between Max and Jackie. Hard to believe that it's made by the same director who made ""Pulp Fiction"", with an emphasis on ""Fiction"", but it's the ultimate proof of Tarantino's originality and versatility as both a writer and a director. Look at just how the characterization works. In most movies, characters are defined by their actions, in ""Jackie Brown"", their thinking, their decisions, their collaboration, and their interactions define them through an extreme intricate puzzle with all the pieces reassembled together at the end. The movie can be frustrating at some parts where we don't follow Jackie Brown's reasoning but this is pivotal as she's trying to outsmart Ordell, Nicolet and Max a little bit, that we might feel outsmarted too. <br/><br/>The film works on that intellectual and subtly emotional level, that makes all the difference between ""Jackie Brown"" and the other 90's gangster films. And Tarantino didn't forget his particular touch, we get the iconic trunk shot, the beautiful sight of Bridget Fonda's lovely feet (sorry), an unrecognizable De Niro in a loser role, and a homage to the opening of one of my all-time favorite movies ""The Graduate"". Tarantino's touch is present but never without serving the story. Take Bridget Fonda as Melanie, she is an obnoxious and particularly annoying spoiled bitchy blonde and De Niro as Louis Gara isn't the brightest of the bunch, the combination of the two makes you expect the worst. They're criminals, they know how to shoot, but Jackie Brown is smart, and Max Cherry has a fondness on her, their 'partnership' as she likes to say, is more valuable than all the guns in the world, to outsmart a criminal mastermind like Ordell.<br/><br/>And Pam Grier as Jackie Brown, is the reason-to-be of the film, another demonstration of Tarantino's secret talent not to revive careers but to remind us how underused some actresses are... or some actors like Robert Forster. ""Jackie Brown"" wouldn't have worked the same with actors and actresses used to play lead romantic roles. Grier and Forster are so into their character of old, tired, hard-working people that they don't expect to fall in love, so the communication goes through objects, music and other intermediary elements. When Max listens to this beautiful 'Delfonics' song, we know it's his heart for Jackie that is pounding and we feel for them whenever the melody can be heard. Age is one of the recurring themes of the film, incarnating this passing of time as an invitation to act before it's too late, a tormenting feel of urgency. Because there's always more than money, more than freedom. Jackie Brown is not totally relieved at the end as she knows she's won more than a 'partner' in Max. <br/><br/>And we're satisfied that, at least, they could finally exchange a tender, intense and rewarding kiss before another song could get between them, leaving the ellipsis or the interrogation mark up to the viewer."

","Tarantino's massively hyped follow up to pulp fiction doesn't disappoint, and stands as his smartest and most mature movie to date.<br/><br/>The film follows the story of an air hostess (Pam Grier) who gets arrested for trying to smuggle money out of the country, and she gets caught up in the middle of the gangster world as her old partner Samuel L Jackson tries to get her to work with him again, while she also falls for Bail-bonds man Robert Foster. The plot works well as it is filled with twists and an always moving narrative, while the performances are the real highpoint: Jackson, Foster and Grier all do well but its Robert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda who give the standout performances as Jackson's friend and girlfriend respectively.<br/><br/>As you'd expect from a QT movie, the film is filled with well written chunky sections of dialogue, with all the characters getting fleshed out very well. But what sets this apart from Tarantino's other work is that the film feels more mature and professional: there's no messed up chronologically, no weird unrealistic events and there's not an endless list of connections between this and other films with no star cameos. Don't get me wrong, I still feel Pulp Fiction is his best film, but Jackie Brown proves QT can create a smart yet normal movie.<br/><br/>Something some people might not like is the film is very slow burning and at the beginning its unclear where the plots going, but give it a chance and the film really picks up. My one major criticism of Jackie Brown is that the films final quarter is a bit boring and all of the things that happen feel very dragged out for no reason, although the films ending is a satisfying end. But I don't find JB as re-watchable as QT's other film, mainly due to its more realistic story and pacing.<br/><br/>Overall I'd heavily recommend Jackie Brown as its a slow but heavily rewarding film that once again shows Tarantino's talent as a filmmaker. 9/10"

","Jackie Brown is an airline stewardess who moves money to Mexico for L.A. arms dealer Ordell Robbie. After a shakedown by the cops, a worried Ordell decides he wants to get all his money out, and Jackie sees an opportunity to escape her situation <br/><br/>Based on Elmore Leonard's classic crime book Rum Punch, this is a sensational, hypnotic thriller, with outstanding direction, lashings of style, highly original characters and three fabulous performances from Grier, Jackson and Forster. Tarantino somehow manages to depict a criminal underworld which seems frighteningly real and brutal, and yet at the same time is filled with his beloved seventies nuances and crackerjack dialogue. The casting of cult blaxploitation star Grier (Coffy, Foxy Brown, Sheba Baby, Friday Foster) is obviously a dream come true for him, and he just can't get enough of shooting her - the opening five minutes is just a montage of her amazing face, memorably underscored with Bobby Womack's soulful number Across 110th Street. Grier seizes the role completely and delivers an amazing performance which retains all the chic and sexuality of her previous work, but with the depth and maturity to portray a middle-aged woman taking a desperate gamble on her future. She's amazing, and what I like best about the movie is Jackie's relationship with Max, who is also looking to break out of a rut, but is not as ambitious as Jackie. They have an extraordinary unspoken chemistry, and their two key scenes together - having coffee in Jackie's kitchen and the finale when they kiss - are my favourites. Contrasting their earthiness is Jackson's incredible turn as gangster Ordell, alternately hilarious and terrifying as he plays all the other characters like puppets. The only word to describe him is intense, and there are some moments - like the scene in the van when he closes his eyes and (correctly) deduces who has stiffed him - where he just burns up the screen. This kind of movie is all about the characters, and Tarantino lovingly crafts every word and nuance out of them all, from Ordell's braided goatee to Max's blue 1976 Cadillac Seville, all of which combine to create such a rich atmosphere. At two-and-a-half hours it could perhaps use a little trimming, but I'm not sure where; every scene is pretty tight, and as with all great thrillers the build-up pays off big time with a satisfying dramatic finish. An outstanding crime picture in every respect and the icing on the cake of Grier's long and distinguished career. Dedicated (very appropriately) to gifted writer/director Sam Fuller, who passed away just prior to the film's release."

","Tarantino's fans don't seem to like the fact that this isn't a typical Tarantino movie. It's more realistic and doesn't have the super-crazy action violence that Tarantino is known for. As such, it has a gritty feel to it, and the violence comes off more effective because of the realism. But don't judge it by how well it conforms to his pattern; judge it for what it is. It's a great crime movie. <br/><br/>Based on an Elmore Leonard novel, the story is clever, and the characters are outstanding. The cast, especially Samuel L. Jackson, but also DeNiro, Robert Forster, and even Pam Grier, bring these multi-dimensional characters to life with plenty of depth and believability. I'd recommend this for anyone who wants a tough, R-rated crime drama."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","1","8 June 2011"," Detach ""Jackie"" from its predecessor and its merits shine
","It's never easy to follow up brilliance. After suddenly rocketing to notoriety, Quentin Tarantino was left with an inevitable task: make a movie after ""Pulp Fiction."" His choice came in the form of ""Jackie Brown,"" the story of an airline stewardess (saying ""flight attendant"" would not gel with the vibe of this film) caught between an arms dealer and the law and hoping to pit them against each other in order to walk away with a half a million dollars.<br/><br/>Despite an abundance of a badass trash-talking Samuel L. Jackson, ""Jackie Brown"" doesn't have the same growl as ""Pulp Fiction,"" but the comparison only exists beyond that because they're crime dramas made within three years of each other.<br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" has a distinctly more retro '70s vibe than ""Pulp Fiction"" as well. Tarantino paints Jackie (Pam Grier) as a tough-as-nails woman who can stick up for herself in a man's world, but that doesn't make it any easier for her. This ""Charlie's Angels""-style feminism in addition to music choices and title sequences intend to make ""Jackie Brown"" kick old-school ass. It doesn't run all that deep, but it certainly keeps Tarantino's signature nice and shiny.<br/><br/>The film feels an awful lot like a foul-mouthed version of a Coen brothers film in that small- time characters put themselves way in over their heads. The core relationship in the film exists between Jackie and Max Cherry (Robert Forster in an Oscar-nominated role). Max is enamored with Jackie, perhaps for her sheer courageousness and fierce independence. As a bail bondsman, we expect him to remain peripheral to the story, but after picking up Jackie from prison for the first time, he becomes more and more intertwined in the conflict, putting his life on the line frequently. Without his pure admiration and sympathy, Jackie would never have been able to consider pulling off the ""sting."" Although neither of them are morally commendable protagonists, there's still a sense of who deserves what.<br/><br/>The Jackson storyline with Robert De Niro in an unusual character role keeps the film stylistically akin to a Tarantino script. Jackson is the same no-nonsense character from ""Pulp Fiction"" only without the temper. He presents a world of trouble for Jackie, albeit one she got herself into. De Niro is out of place, probably because its weird to see him play second fiddle for an entire film. Together they set the mood and allow for the Tarantino dialogue to shine through.<br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" comes across as lighter Tarantino fare — except in terms of appropriate language. The story here retains an admirable simplicity, but nothing strong enough to crawl out of the shadow of ""Pulp Fiction,"" at least not at the time, hence its reputation of being the ""underrated"" Tarantino film. With particularly strong characters that we like despite their moral behavior, ""Jackie Brown"" rates as a unique retro crime drama.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"

","It's easy to dismiss this film as one of Tarantino's lesser popular films. But if you look closer, it's actually really good. This is a film that can't be compared to Tarantino's previous two movies, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. It features elements from both films, but is overall a more mature, straight-forward film. It's a character driven film, like any other Tarantino film, however it is slow, but in a good way. Nothing's rushed, we get a lot of time to study the different characters. The dialogue is witty and clever, just like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Then there's the realism, which is excellently portrayed. People act and talk like it was just a normal day, which makes it an absorbing experience, and will make you forget that the actors are actually acting, and that there's actually a film crew behind the scene.<br/><br/>Then there's the ensemble cast. All six of the main characters each have different point of views, watching them do what they do is simply fascinating. This is one of those films where the ensemble cast works really well. All of the characters have their part in the story, nobody is miscast. It features Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda and Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro is very amusing, his performance is the best (out of all the great performances in the film). It's fun to watch him in this film just for validating the fact that he doesn't always get type-casted. Pam Grier and Robert Forster are excellent as well, and Samuel L. Jackson nails his role, which is somewhat identical to his character in Pulp Fiction, though that's not a bad thing.<br/><br/>This is another must-see Tarantino film - Moose finds this film worthy of a 10."

","I don't really understand why this work by Tarantino has to be put in context or why one would say it's a minor work. It's really some of the best directing he's ever done and it feels very real. He didn't write this so what. All the performances are great, and Jackson shines throughout. But it's really about Jackie Brown, and I would go further and say this movie is about Pam Grier.<br/><br/>And is she pretty! I'll always remember the opening credits with the long all in one shot sequence at the airport, and Pam Grier, the way she walks, her amazing hair, the warmth of her skin, there's lots of dignity in the way she walks and it's beautiful, and many shots feature her in a very fashionable, warm and sexy way - ah that suit! Tarantino really triggers you with her flamboyant beauty and her voice and the strength of her character, and each time she's on the screen we're in awe. An amazing showcase - sure I had seen her in Segal's ""Above the Law"" but you know what I mean. Tarantino saw something I think beyond the script, something very sensual, and romantic and it's sweet that romance with Max and all. And that music. It could have been all cheeseburger a la Pulp but no, Tarantino shows you those actors, their hair, their toes, and it's all silk.<br/><br/>It's really watching this I remember why I found Tarantino so good and Grier so ravishing."

"MBunge","8","0","1","29 August 2010"," I pray this won't always be the third best Tarantino flick
","I haven't liked the last 3 movies by Quentin Tarantino. I loathed Kill Bill, was bored stiff by Death Proof and unimpressed by Inglorious Basterds. I was starting to wonder if I was being unfair. Perhaps my standards for Tarantino's work were too high and I was being overly critical. Then I rewatched Jackie Brown and remembered just how great Tarantino can be. This movie is so good it completely validates my view of how crappy everything he's done since has been.<br/><br/>Based on a book by Elmore Leonard, this is probably the least showy and ostentatious of all Taratino's films, but it's also the one where he's most trying to grow and mature as a storyteller. It's about a loquacious and murderous gun dealer named Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) who's set himself in inner city Los Angeles like a spider in a web. Ordell has women set up in houses all over town, an ex-con buddy named Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) helping him out and 500 thousand dollars stashed down in Mexico. To get access to his money, Ordell relies on an 40something flight attendant working the last airline job she'll ever have on the worst airline in the business. Her name is Jackie Brown (Pam Grier). When an ATF agent named Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) catches Jackie coming back into the country with drugs and an envelope filled with 50 thousand dollars, he gives her a simple choice. Go to jail and lose everything she has or turn on Ordell. It's a simple choice but Jackie Brown isn't a simple woman. With the aid of a bail bondsman named Max Cherry (Robert Forster), Jackie hatches a scheme to get her out from under the cops, Ordell and her own run down life.<br/><br/>This movie looks, feels, flows and even sounds different than anything else Quentin Tarantino has done. It dispenses with slick attitude and embraces and earthy and compromised reality. These characters are real people living real lives and when they talk, they say real things. They live in a world that looks lived in and unpolished. When these characters act, they don't do anything cutely clever or stylish but move and perform with a mesmerizingly plain directness. Jackie Brown is an effort by Tarantino to become more than the flashy shtick he executed so brilliantly in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. He's not trying to make that same sort of film again and he wonderfully succeeds.<br/><br/>There's a lighter touch to the whole movie. The violence is less grotesque, the dialog is less contrived, the performances are less theatric and even the music that defines Tarantino's direction is less intrusive. Most of the songs we hear are a part of these characters' lives, not a soundtrack slathered over them.<br/><br/>Now, that does also mean that Jackie Brown doesn't have quite the energy or intensity of Tarantino's previous work and the pacing of the story is maybe a bit too luxurious. But there are no serious flaws to the movie. There's nothing in here you have to overlook or excuse. There's never a point or a moment that you have to accept that you wouldn't accept if you saw it in the work of a lesser filmmaker.<br/><br/>The performances here are uniformly strong with the actors filling out the depth of each and every character. None of these roles are just here to serve The Almighty Plot Hammer. They do what they do because of who they are.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is a really good film. Sadly, though, I fear that when Tarantino's career is overJackie Brown will still be the third best movie he ever made. True, that would mean he made three films that were better than most people ever make. It would also mean he spent decades throwing away one of the greatest talents of his time."

","Compared to Tarantinos other movies (and yes I've seen all of them) this is not the best one, in fact I would consider it his second least good. However, that doesn't mean that it's a bad film in any way. On the contrary, it's a damn good movie. Sure the story is very simple, it's a heist movie on a very realistic and small level. yet the directing is still better than that of most films. It's a surprisingly long film, two and a half hours, but never a dull moment. So I really don't have more to say, I recommend it. heck, if you're afraid of Tarantino films because of his reputation for violence, relax you can watch this one, except for quite an amount of swearing (which you'll hardly notice) there nothing nasty in it.

","Grier, a star of ""blaxploitation"" films of the 1970s, is back in this tribute to such films, playing the title role of a flight attendant who becomes a pawn between the police and a notorious arms dealer. In adapting the Elmore Leonard novel, Tarantino shows himself to be an expert story-teller, keeping the film consistently entertaining despite the long running time. Considering the film's theme and the director's obsession with violence, this one is surprisingly and refreshingly restrained on that front. The interesting characters are fleshed out by an excellent cast, with Forster particularly impressive in an understated performance as a lonely, middle-aged bail bondsman."

","My love of this movie is almost inexplicable. There are no moments of cinematic exhilaration. There are some holes in the caper that the movie is centered on, but there is an amazing love of story and cinema by the man who brings us this tale, and I think it is a genius who happened to be at his peek at this particular moment.<br/><br/>As well as Tarantino's genius, we get some great performances by some gifted actors. Among the great performances was Robert De Niro's brilliant performance as a pathetic man totally beaten up by life and prison. I suspect that many movie goers had difficulty with De Niro's performance at the time because it was so opposite of the confident character we came to know from his portrayals in his films prior to this one. Samuel Jackson's great performance owes quite a bit to De Niro. These characters just seem to naturally belong to and deserve each other.<br/><br/>I have to ultimately judge this movie on the fact that I keep returning to it. I've watched it a dozen times and I'll watch it another dozen times or more before I'm done."
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","0","2","8 October 2009"," Quentin Tarentino's finest work yet.
","I have seen most of Quentin Tarentino's films. But of all of the ones I have seen, I thought Jackie Brown was the best. This one wasn't even written by Tarentino. his one was written by Elmore Leonard, who wrote Get Shorty, 3:10 to Yuma, and others. You can tell because this film is genius. <br/><br/>Jackie Brown is an incredibly smart film. Almost all of the characters are likable and there are a ton of great performances. The best are from Bridget Fonda and Robert Forster. Fonda plays Melanie, who lives with a gun runner(Samuel L. Jackson) on a beach. She also sort of lives with Louis(Robert De Niro) who has just gotten out of prison. <br/><br/>I'll get back to the characters in a second. The film mostly revolves around Jackie Brown(Pam Grier), who is caught with money in a bag that isn't hers. She is put in jail, and she is soon the key figure in a plot between the police and Ordell(Samuel L. Jackson). <br/><br/>I can't really tell you anything else about the film. The film is funny and has a lot of brains. You see some incredibly surprising things in this film. You see Robert De Niro smoking a bong and having sex. Yes, I told you it was surprising. The dialogue in the film is smart and the plot is interesting. I was engaged throughout all of this film. I have to read the book some time. <br/><br/>This film has it all. It's got laughs, fantastic performances, and a little bit of romance. I forgot to mention another great performance in the film. Robert Forster's performance as Max Cherry, a bailout dealer, is so cool and nice. There is a somewhat romance between him and Jackie. Almost all of the characters in the film are likable. The film has a cameo of Chris Tucker, who, to me, made the Rush hour films. I like Chirs Tucker, but I wanted to see more of his character. This is Tarentino's best, and that is saying a lot. Quentin Tarentino is a fantastic director. I wish to see more of him in the future. I saw his most recent film, Inglorious Basterds, and loved it. I haven't seen a bad Tarentino film yet.

His endowment in writing and directing simultaneously in films is pure bliss, and is shown extremely well in this film. <br/><br/>The character development from every single major role is brilliantly put together, even with the small amount of nonlinear events, they all coincide in amazing manner. The development in the roles of main characters Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), Ordell Robbie (Samuel L . Jackson) and Max Cherry (Robert Forster), are much more accessible if there is previous knowledge on Tarantino's style, but even without it can be appreciated by all cinema-lovers. Not only with those characters, but with all. Not left out is the struggle and hard earned validity of each role, which encapsulates many different personalities of charisma, and also much exigency when handling situations that this movie absolutely encases.<br/><br/>Once again, Tarantino absolutely nails the edge-of-the-seat viewer detail, capturing the ins and outs of human nature in crime fighting, gangster fueled situations.

"freedomFrog","Null","0","1","28 August 2009"," The conventional wisdom of ""Jackie Brown""
","Adapted from a novel by Elmore Leonard, Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to his classic ""Pulp fiction"" is another crime movie, paying tribute to the blaxploitation movies of the seventies, starring blaxploitation icon Pam Grier along with Robert Forster, Samuel Jackson and Robert de Niro.<br/><br/>One of the most annoying cliché you can read in a review of a Tarantino movie is some kind of pompous statement about ""Jackie Brown"" being his best/most mature work to date, usually meant to imply that everything went down hill from there. Well, let me respectfully disagree It's not that ""Jackie Brown"" is not a great movie. It is. But it is also a very conventional one by Tarantino standards. Like it or hate it, you have to admit that a Tarantino movie is unlike anything else you watched in a theater. They don't follow the codes of other movies; they don't unfold as you would expect them to do. They have their own rhythm, their own groove. That is, except if the Tarantino movie in question is ""Jackie Brown"".<br/><br/>It follows the template for ""serious film-making by serious film-makers"" to the letter. For an audience uncomfortable with the non-conformism and the chaotic creativity of other Tarantino movies, this might be reassuring. They are on known grounds there. This is conventional film-making. For once, a Tarantino movie is walking the line, talking the talk, going the way it should go. This is what a good movie by a great director should look like. So, be a good boy, Quentin. Do what everybody expects you to do and just shoot another ""Jackie Brown"". Who knows? You might even win an Oscar in the process! <br/><br/>Except that Tarantino is not a good boy. He does not care about what people expect him to do. He just follows his own path, without compromising, and this path leads him far away from the standards of conventional film-making, although he demonstrated in ""Jackie Brown"" that he mastered those standards as well. It's almost as if he did ""Jackie Brown"" just to prove that point. Yes, if only he wanted, he could be a ""serious"" film-maker making a ""serious"" ""mature"" movie. But a Tarantino movie is not about following the conventions: it is about inventing new ones! There are wild territories off the main road and it is where he wants to be.<br/><br/>This is this gung-ho take-no-prisoner attitude that makes him without a doubt the most brilliant and interesting director currently working. And that's why ""Jackie Brown"", although an accomplished work by any standard, cannot be considered in any way as the apex of his movie output."
"adrongardner","10","0","3","23 August 2009"," ""I'm serious as a heart attack...""
","Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's best film. There is not a single note wrong here from beginning to end. Dogs was a rough start, Pulp was a crowd pleaser, but with Jackie Brown, there are characters who are more than pawns in a game of ""Guess what movie I ripped off..."" <br/><br/>The awesome cast is firing on all cylinders to give the movie a real backbone. Surprisingly only Robert De Niro's presence comes off out of place in his nearly wordless role. <br/><br/>The film works better on more levels than any other Tarantino. Why? Three main reasons;<br/><br/>He is working from a completely realized story from Elmore Leonard. Tarantino has never shown himself to be much with a singular story over 2 hours, Leonard's Rum Punch gave him a solid foundation to work from.<br/><br/>He is free of gimmicks dealing in black and white suits, glossy guns or samurai swords. There are almost no way to quantify his filmic references here, but they are all completely in sync with the story and characterizations, not for flamboyance. The story and characters rule here. What little violence there is in Jackie Brown, it actually has power and doesn't feel gleeful like in Pulp or Kill Bill.<br/><br/>Most importantly...<br/><br/>He is hopelessly in love with almost every character in this film and it feels as if he KNOWS each of these people. The personal touches for each of the players here are well done by the actors, but Tarantino simply worships them with his words, his camera and his soundtrack. This film could easily be called ""Reverence.""<br/><br/>More than 10 years on, Jackie Brown feels fresher and far more mature than a re-watch of his other films, which by comparison come off as wind up toys or forced. On the other hand, Jackie Brown is a true love song to Pam Grier, the 70s and Blaxploitation and movies in general.<br/><br/>But above all that, Jackie Brown is solid and just a damn good movie on any level. I doubt he'll ever make one as good. Few people could."

They struggle, they are scared, they are defensive of themselves, they succeed and sometimes they are not so lucky. Unlike many films i think this is not so much about whats happening, but how the characters react to events that occur, which makes it a more interesting story that really pulls you in.

"knucklebreather","8","0","1","24 June 2009"," Pedestrian writing, fantastic acting and directing
","I think Jackie Brown has two interrelated problems: it has a pedestrian plot and it's from a director who, especially in 1997, was known for his unconventional plots. Jackie Brown has a snazzier intro and better written characters than you might expect from a typical Hollywood suspense flick, but while a few of the twists are directed in a more bold and confident style, it's hardly surprising that in a movie like this there are double-crosses, people playing both sides, and unexpected problems coming up for people's carefully planned schemes. Ultimately, Jackie Brown's story is a pretty generic ""scramble for the cash"", nothing to get very excited about. In some ways the plot is actually handled more poorly than your in your typical summer blockbuster with its by-the-books suspense building. Justifiably, most people were disappointed with the core plot of Jackie Brown, and I think that's why it's so widely considered an inferior film to Tarantino's other work.<br/><br/>That said, it's hardly a bad movie. The music is exciting, the acting is spectacular (especially Jackson and Forster) and the directing is clever and engaging. The script isn't exactly bad, it's just an average Hollywood script from a guy who, three years earlier, had delivered a script that was revolutionary."

","If you're expecting more of ""Pulp Fiction"" from writer & director Quentin Tarantino in ""Jackie Brown,"" the cult moviemaker's first full-fledged cinematic opus since ""Pulp Fiction,"" you may feel sorely let down by this extreme chick flick. Neither as sadistic nor as sexually bizarre as either ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Jackie Brown"" represents something of a departure for Tarantino. Indeed, an initial viewing may leave you with the impression that ""Jackie Brown"" suffers from a sketchy plot and lackluster action. Nothing could be farther from the truth. While ""Jackie Brown"" covers familiar ""Pulp Fiction"" territory, Tarantino emphasizes characterization at the expense of ultra-violence and implausibility. Furthermore, ""Jackie Brown"" may be Tarantino's most accomplished film in its visual storytelling and the performances are simply unforgettable.<br/><br/>Veteran African-American actress Pam Grier, who acquired a name for herself during the 1970s with blaxploitation epics such as ""The Big Doll House"" (1971) and ""Coffy"" (1973), plays the eponymous heroine. As a 44-year old woman, Jackie works as a flight attendant for the worst airline, a shuttle that flies between the United States and Mexico. Life has not exactly been rosy for Jackie. She resorts to smuggling large sums of U.S. currency into the country that belong to Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction"")a treacherous arms dealer, who stashes his cash in Cabo San Lucas. As the film unfolds, prickly ATF agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton of ""Batman"") busts Jackie for sneaking $50-thousand past customs. Nicolette and his LAPD partner Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen of ""Iron Eagle"") put the squeeze on her, especially after they discover a two ounce baggie of cocaine hidden in with the bucks.<br/><br/>Jackie finds herself in jail, and Robbie posts her bond. Robbie hires bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster of ""Medium Cool"") to spring her. Robbie follows an unmistakable pattern. Paranoid about going back to jail, Robbie ices any of his cohorts who come into contact with the law. Jackie got busted thanks to a tip the cops squeezed out of Robbie's low-life henchman Beaumount (Chris Tucker of ""Rush Hour""). After Cherry gets Beaumont out of jail, Robbie kills Beaumont and hides the corpse in the trunk of an abandoned car. Robbie is so leery of his buddies that he brings in an old-time convicted bank robber, Lewis Gara (Robert De Niro of ""Goodfellas"") and uses him for his latest scheme.<br/><br/>Once out of jail, Jackie cooperates with the ATF. She plans to bring in more of Robbie's dough and be a part of a sting against him. She tell Robbie what the law wants her to do and then presents him with a deal that will get him the rest of his money. She'll bring in all his money at once when the cops aren't expecting it, and they'll pull a switch before the fuzz could figure it out. Robbie is leery again, but eventually he agrees. Meanwhile, Jackie pulls a fast one not only on the cops but also Robbie and get away with a fortune in cold cash. She devises another plan with Max Cherry.<br/><br/>While there are no overlapping plots, ""Jackie Brown"" is Tarantino's best job of writing. He lays the story out in clear, simple terms and never needlessly complicates the action as he did in ""Pulp Fiction."" You won't get lost in the middle of this action comedy. Of course, the language is as corrosive as all get out. The F-word is used at least 131 times, and the S-word is heard as many as 69 times. Tarantino's fans will appreciate the usual profane, inane dialogue that he writes so well, especially Robbie's instructions to Gara about how to unlock his car.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Tarantino, ""Jackie Brown"" is based on best-selling novelist Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch,"" published in 1992. Surprisingly, Tarantino removed two major shoot-outs that add bang-bang action to Leonard's book. Robbie wants to kill a Nazi skin head and heist his huge arsenal of firearms. What might have made for a distinctively ""Pulp Fiction"" moment, however, Tarantino scrapped. Tarantino also eliminated a gunfight between Nicolette and Robbie's gunmen. Usually, Hollywood filmmakers go out of their way to beef up Leonard's novel. Consider the horrendous misfire that Burt Reynolds produced from Leonard's entertaining novel ""Stick."" While ""Stick"" boasted the trademark Leonard dialogue (he c0-scripted), the movie featured violence that the book did not contain. Although Tarantino doesn't capture the quirky Leonard dialogue, he does a better job of transferring ""Rum Punch"" to the screen than either Reynolds did with ""Stick"" or Barry Sonnenfeld with ""Get Shorty."" As Jackie Brown, busty Pam Grier is ideally cast. Originally written for an Ann-Margret type (in ""Rum Punch"" she was named Jackie Burke), Tarantino has changed the racial composition of the heroine but retains the spirit of Leonard's heroine. ""Jackie Brown"" is one of those pictures where the heroine isn't fresh out of a Playboy centerfold, though Grier has the obvious endowments. Instead, Tarantino uses her as a woman caught in the middle that wants and deserves to get out of a bad situation. Compared with previous Tarantino efforts, ""Jackie Brown"" represents a definite feminist turn of the screw.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is both diverse and fantastic. Although Robert Forster has almost vanished from the screen, his performance as Max Cherry is so good and straightforward—in a poker-faced way—that you forget that Forster is acting. Cherry may qualify as one of the few tough-guy male heroes who could serve as a role model. Meanwhile, Robert De Niro brings his customary thespian skill to his bank robber thug and delivers a fastidious performance that relies on his physical presence.<br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" lasts over two hours, but nothing obstructs the straight ahead plotting. If you're counting, only three characters get shot, and Tarantino stages each shooting incident off-screen or is shown from an angle that prevents the viewer from seeing much gore and violence."

","I personally think Quentin Tarantino's third feature film was under-rated. Most people seem to think of it as his weakest film to date but I disagree. I definitely wouldn't go so far as to say it's his best; it's got nothing on 'Pulp Fiction' but it's still a great movie in it's own ways. I found myself somewhat let down after watching it the first time because I originally expected another 'Pulp Fiction', which it wasn't intended to be. It's an adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel 'Rum Punch' (a pretty faithful adaptation) and a bit of an homage to the blaxploitation movies of the 70's. The movie follows the title character, Jackie Brown (played by 70's blaxploitation icon Pam Grier), a middle-aged flight attendant who runs money to/from Mexico for gun runner Ordell Robbie (played by Samuel L. Jackson, super-cool as always). After Jackie's caught bringing $50 grand and a bag of cocaine into the country, she finds herself making a deal with ATF agent Ray Nicolette (a twitchy, entertaining Michael Keaton) and trying to scam both Ordell and the ATF while walking away with a half-million dollar payload.<br/><br/>The film continues to display Tarantino's strengths as a filmmaker. He once again displays a knack for perfect casting. Grier gives a strong performance as the down-on-her-luck Jackie who's ready to risk everything to escape her menial life. Robert Forster (another icon from 70's and 80's B-movies) puts in a great supporting performance as bail bondsman Max Cherry, Jackie's only real accomplice. Oddly enough, one of my favorite performances in the film was Robert De Niro as Ordell's new partner, ex-con Louis Gara. He's only a supporting member and doesn't really even much dialogue or purpose until the final act but he's fun to watch. Louis is such a subdued person, not the type of role I'm used to seeing De Niro in. Louis's character is all in his body language and it's awesome to see De Niro playing such an awkward person. Rounding out the primary cast is Bridget Fonda as Ordell's stoned surfer girl Melanie, providing a small but somewhat vital role.<br/><br/>In addition to his ability to find the perfect actor/actress for each role, Tarantino once again shows he knows how to create a film's atmosphere with a great soundtrack. The music is practically it's own character in the film, using 70's soul and R&B to add to the film's flavor. With tracks by Bobby Womack, the Grass Roots, and the Brothers Johnson, this film has one of my favorite soundtracks in recent years.<br/><br/>The movie runs a bit long (roughly 2.5 hours) but it generally doesn't drag. There are a couple points where you start to feel the long running time wearing on you, but it usually passes as the plot once again grabs you with another interesting turn. The story can be a bit complex as the characters plot, double, and triple-cross each other but it leaves you satisfied by the end (though, I admit, I thought the climax was a bit weak). The movie combines a cool crime story from Elmore Leonard with the cinema stylings of Quentin Tarantino. While it does have a couple weaknesses, it's still a great follow-up to 'Pulp Fiction' and in my opinion shows that Tarantino is one our strongest modern filmmakers."
"Isaac5855","8","0","2","3 April 2008"," Tarentino proves to be as great a storyteller as he is a film stylist...
","Though PULP FICTION is definitely Quentin Tarantino's stylish masterpiece full of cinematic flair and magicianship, Tarantino also proved to be a master storyteller with his severely underrated follow-up JACKIE BROWN, a richly entertaining story of LA criminals and low-lifes that may not contain the cinematic trickery of FICTION, but is a textbook example of telling a great story on film. And it's not so much the story itself, but the way it unfolds with its introduction of characters which are alternately detailed and murky, but done in a style that keeps you glued to the screen and greedily anticipating what's going to happen. Tarantino's story centers around the title character, a 44-year old flight attendant (Pam Grier) whose double life and shady past are the linchpin of an elaborate story of her struggle to get out from under the thumb of a sleazy weapons dealer (flawlessly portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson). Once again, Tarantino tells his story from the far reaching points of an octagon, where each point of the octagon appears to have no connection to the next but it all manages to flow into one smoothly executed climax displayed from several points of view. Tarantino's deft screenplay rivals his Oscar-winning PULP FICTION screenplay and his direction is as stylish as ever. As always, Tarantino's penchant for stunt casting pays off, especially with the casting of 70's action heroine Grier (who still looks fantastic) in the title role. Grier is smart, sexy, and completely commands the screen without ever going over the top. Tarantino also revived the near comatose career of Robert Forster by casting him as Max Cherry, the cool-headed bails bondsman who befriends Jackie. Forster's smooth and controlled performance actually earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, though the whole cast works at Oscar level. Also providing solid support are Michael Keaton (one of his best performances), Michael Bowen, Bridget Fonda, Chris Tucker, and especially Robert De Nio, having a ball playing Jackson's old buddy who re-enters his life. And it's all backed up by some of the most amazing Motown music from the 1960's that will evoke memories by itself. Tarantino and company hit a bullseye here."

Pam Grier is a legend and should have won an Oscar for her wonderful performance as Jackie Brown. But what a supporting cast! De Niro (Fav Actor 01), Sammy L Jackson (Fav 02), Mickey Keaton, Bridget Fonda, Chris Tucker, My god! We basically follow Jackie Brown through her trials and tribulations. She is a 44 year old (still smoking though) air stewardess. She gets busted with money and drugs. After that she conspires to just leave her past life and the way to achieve this to help the cops. She gets a friend Robert Forster her bail-bondsman who also works for Samuel L Jackson, Jackie's boss. His friends, De Niro and Fonda are supposed to pick up money Jackie's flying in (under the noses of cops) but they get screwed in the end, De Niro kills Fonda, Sammy L kills De Niro and Sammy is murdered by the cops with the help of Jackie. Jackie leaves for Spain, after unsuccessfully trying to get Forster to go with her. Overall, another good movie by Tarantino 8/10"

","Small-time gangster Ordell (Jackson) runs guns. He also has the nasty habit of using a legit bail bondsman (Forster) to haul any captured associates out of prison and kill them before they can talk. When hostess Jackie Brown (Grier) is arrested for smuggling Ordell's money into the US, she persuades Ordell to let use her to con the feds and smuggle his entire fortune under their noses, while deceiving the police into thinking she is helping them nail Ordell. But whose side is Jackie Brown really on? <br/><br/>After his crowning success Pulp Fiction, Tarantino tones down the stylistic fireworks and adapts an Elmore Leonard novel. The slick double-crossing and elegant narrative is pure Leonard, but the dialogue and humor remain vintage Tarantino, and the union works wonders. After an opening shot that bodes ill by shamelessly copying ""The Graduate"", and hints that this might be a mere blaxploitation revival, Tarantino plays things more subtly with a laid-back and elegant direction, comprised mostly of long takes and a fluid camera - courtesy of longtime Del Toro collaborator Guillermo Navarro - allowing us to focus on the actors and their ace performances. Robert Forster received most of the praise at the time of release for underacting to a tee, while Samuel L. Jackson's larger than life Ordell and Robert De Niro's half-wit convict Louis steal the showier moments. In truth, this is a group effort, and everybody delivers, from Pam Grier to Michael Keaton (in a role he reprized a year later in ""Out of Sight"", also adapted from a Leonard novel).<br/><br/>Jackie Brown was not fully appreciated when it first came out, and Tarantino sadly seems to have disavowed it to some extent, following it with the indulgent and pointless Kill Bill duo, before finding himself again with the more playful Deathproof. This might be less showy and hard-hitting than Reservoir Dogs, but it remains his most sensitive and mature film to date. One can only hope he will explore such territory again soon."

","It almost feels like Jackie Brown was made before Pulp Fiction. It feels like you are watching a young Tarantino movie, a less developed director. Don't get me wrong, its a very good movie, good acting, good story, the script is nicely put together. It just didn't pack quite the same punch as Pulp Fiction. I'd say its below reservoir dogs and pulp fiction on the list of Tarantino movies but better than the kill bill series. But any Tarantino fan should get this movie, and fan of a good, old-fashioned, fun caper movie. Samuel L.

","Jackie Brown is an air stewardess who is paid by Illegal weapons supplier Ordell Robbie to bring his stash of money which is kept in storage by his silent partner in South America. After someone tips off that Jackie brings the money in she is arrested by the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agency and has to make a deal that will see her out of jail and get her as far away from Ordell Robbie as possible.<br/><br/>You hear people constantly comparing Pulp and Jackie so if you want to read someone do that, please look at someone else's review. Jackie Brown is a masterclass in character driven movie making. There are numerous stand out scenes and everyone in this film has their moments (Apart from Robert Deniro, as the stoned up ex-con who cannot cope with the changes in the world upon his return.) But the real story in this film is with Jackie Brown and Max Cherry. Robert Forster's portrayal of Max is arguably one of the best performances by a supporting actor you will ever see. As Jackie's unrequited Lover he seethes pent-up emotion and the scene where he watches her in her apartment is like liquid silk pouring onto the screen. Also for Movie lovers everywhere that notice these things, do watch his face when he turns round in the mall and sees her sat down, it is the look of love that is virtual impossible to fake as his entire face lights up. Simply for Max Che ..., I'm sorry, Robert Forster's performance alone this is a must see, but add Pam Griers, unfortunate Oscar-overlook, outstanding performance and this film is a real treat.<br/><br/>Although I loved pulp fiction, as many film fans are finding out, it is this baby that has legs."

","OK, so how did Jackie Brown get the half million dollars out of Mexico? She's an airline hostess, not a stewardess, and she's never shown making a flight. I also missed the part where someone writes a withdrawal slip for all that cash. But aside from that glaring plot hole, and if you don't think about it too much, you can have a pretty good time with ""Jackie Brown"". But don't expect the reckless abandon and frenetic fury of the two films that put Quentin Tarantino on the map, you know the ones I'm talking about. What you have here is a more controlled pace and a linear approach that's easier to follow than Tarantino's signature moves. That gives the viewer a little more time to anticipate what might come next, but even then you're caught off guard by certain scenes. You might have expected Beaumont (Chris Tucker) to get whacked, but having Louis (Robert De Niro) waste Melanie (Bridget Fonda) was a left field stunner. Which brings me back to the suspension of disbelief necessary to pull this one off. You have a broad daylight shooting in the parking lot of the 'world's largest indoor mall' and not one other person is in the vicinity?<br/><br/>What I don't want to do is talk myself into not liking this film, which I see now might be easy enough to do. Instead I'll focus on the characters, with De Niro delivering a sublime performance as a small time hood to Samuel L. Jackson's bad a-- self confidence. Pam Grier's Jackie was in total control, with a range that gave the film a lot of it's energy. The surprise though might have been Robert Forster's character Max Cherry, flying so far under the radar as an actor that I can't believe he's garnered over a hundred film credits, and I can't picture him in even one. Round it out with Fonda and Michael Keaton and you've got a lot of talent keeping things just near the boiling point.<br/><br/>With the movie now hitting the ten year mark, it's interesting to see how director Tarantino goes back to the well for his latest effort in the two part ""Grindhouse"" feature. ""Nothing gets between me and my A-K"" could have been a trailer for that one, and who can miss the connection between Max Cherry and Cherry Darling?"
"xo_mafia_ox","10","0","4","3 April 2007"," One of the most underrated movies ever!
","I think that one of the biggest that has to do with this movie is ""Is Jackie Brown better than Pulp Fiction"" ..... Honestly I have to say Pulp Fiction is better. One of the greatest films of all time. Jackie Brown is an excellent movie with a great story line but not better than Pulp Fiction. Pulp Fiction had a better cast and the best anti heroes since The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. But Jackie Brown did have Robert De Niro who is without a doubt one of the best actors alive. I think if Robert De Niro's character would have been in Jackie Brown more then it would have been better. It was nice to see Samuel L. Jackson working with QT again but he is without a doubt better as an anti hero in Pulp Fiction than the crooked bad guy in Jackie Brown. Jackie Brown is an excellent movie though. One of the better movies of the 90s. I was surprised that is wasn't on the 250 best movies list. It's not your normal movie. It's different then most movies. I think it deserves to be on the 250 list. If you like Terrentino then it is a film that you just gotta see, no question about it. Good cast, good soundtrack, surprising moments, and more. Jackie Brown is a great flick that shouldn't be passed up!"
"robertrosado","10","0","2","4 February 2007"," Tarantino's secret weapon.
","In 1994, hip director Quentin Tarantino made a splashy debut with the intense and funny crime story, ""Pulp Fiction"". While he was lathered with acclaim and awards, many wondered what else this new kid on the block had up his sleeve. Was he a one-hit wonder? That question was answered in 1997, when Tarantino successfully adapted Elmore Leonard's classic novel, ""Rum Punch"". Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a tired, run-down flight attendant in her mid-forties. After years of clashing with the law, she finds herself at the bottom of the economical ladder. She is a woman who is very close to unemployment, and is scared to death that her life is coming to an end. She soon finds a lucrative opportunity in Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), a fast-talking weapons dealer with a lot of money to his name. In the meantime, Jackie falls in love with Max Cherry (Robert Forster), a bail bondsman who shares similar concerns with Jackie...<br/><br/>In adapting ""Rum Punch"", Tarantino made one significant change: Instead of having the heroine, Jackie Burke, be a white woman, he would change her into a black woman. In doing so, he made the character, Jackie Brown (amended to refer to Grier's classic movie role, Foxy Brown), that much more desperate, and anxious to grasp on to what she has left. One wouldn't think that the jive-talking style of Tarantino would mesh well with the classy smooth language of Leonard, but that's what makes ""Jackie Brown"" such a unique work, as well as a gem of modern cinema.<br/><br/>Pam Grier (""Coffy"") is absolutely sensational in the title role. Every facial expression and line delivery brings home the attitude and fears that Jackie has about the world around her. She is close to disappearing, but she's not ready to give up just yet. Grier is strong, sexy, and emotionally available. She is a splendid protagonist. Robert Forster (""Medium Cool"") returns to the spotlight to give a nuanced performance as Max. As with Grier, it is the subtle touches that give Forster his color. In his eyes, body language, and vocal inflection, we can see the world-weariness that Cherry feels in everyday life, and more particularly, his occupation.<br/><br/>As Ordell, Samuel L. Jackson (who gave one of the finest performances of the nineties in ""Pulp Fiction"") does some of his funniest, most distinctive work here. When Jackson is on screen, you cannot take your eyes off him. He is charismatic, even if his character is truly repugnant. Being a fan of ""Pulp"", I was not surprised to see that Jackson can also be nightmarishly intimidating. While it may seem that he has been handed a thin character in first-class boob Louis Garrell, Robert De Niro's (""Meet the Parents"") greatest achievement is actually making sense of a guy who says next to nothing for the duration of the running time. Like Forster, De Niro uses technique (and an odd sense of humor) to tell us everything that we need to know about him. Bridget Fonda (""A Simple Plan"") gives her best performance yet as Melanie, the sneaky and ditsy beach bunny. Finally, Chris Tucker (""Rush Hour"") works wonders in his brief role as Beaumont Livingston.<br/><br/>""Jackie Brown"" has everything I have come to love about Tarantino's work: Eclectic casting choices, interesting shots, challenging material, and high intensity. But it also has something a bit more than that. Every time I view this movie, what continues to catch me off-guard in the sweet romance that blooms between Jackie and Cherry, and how genuine it is. It is refreshing to watch two beautiful, middle aged people share the same kind of intimacy that we usually see from much younger movie stars. ""Jackie Brown"" is the most unconventional of love stories, and that is what makes it so charming, and so alarmingly easy to connect with.<br/><br/>Another element that separates itself from the pumped-up action that Tarantino is so well-known for is the character development. One criticism that is constantly address is that the film moves very slowly. I have to disagree with this, as there is not one scene in present that does not either further the story along, or aid the audience in getting into the characters' heads. The leisurely pace of ""Jackie Brown"" works to its advantage. By the end of the film, these are not names on a script page; these are good friends. Tarantino also deserves credit for an elaborately-staged heist in the story's final act.<br/><br/>While ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill"" are Tarantino's more well-known works, ""Jackie Brown"" is a masterpiece that I hope will find an audience over the following years. It is deep, suspenseful, leisurely paced, and unexpectedly humorous. The best part? You don't even have to be a Tarantino fan to enjoy it."

Discussing the merits and demerits of Kill Bill (I say 2 yeahs and guy at work sez 1 sucks and 2 is better) and the guy asks me if I've seen it. I say no. He sez I should. It's taken me 2-3 years to do it, but DAYUM, I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Jackie the character has it all: looks, brains, charm, sass, and a survival instinct that makes all women want to stand up and say yes! Pam Grier has been SERIOUSLY UNDERUTILIZED in the acting world. WHY? Tarantino does an extraordinary job of directing JB. I'd like to give the man a great big kiss for the way he has portrayed Jackie. No slack for her. No apologies. No exaggerations. She is what most women are or could be if only men would just leave us alone. But men don't leave us alone. They own everything and control everything -- except the pussy -- so we are forced to deal with them. I applaud Tarantino for having the balls to acknowledge what's beautiful about women.<br/><br/>The cast of JB is extraordinarily kickass. It's a nice change to see DeNiro play something other than a leading role! Don't get me wrong though, he's awesome in what he does. Samuel L Jackson blows me away in this movie. It's hard to describe how he captures the essence of the character he portrays, but he has subtantial acting skills. Jackson's little blond surfer girl -- Bridgette Fonda -- is perfect for her role. Michael Keaton has only a bit part and seems like a weak link in an otherwise titanic strength chain. Maybe it was him or maybe it was his slimy character though...<br/><br/>The real star of this movie, however, has to be Robert Forster, who plays a bail bondsman who gets drawn into the plot of the movie. What the hell? I never would have thought he was capable of doing what he does in this movie. Kudos to Mr. Forster and to Mr. Tarantino for his abililty to see what Forster can do and giving him a chance to do it.<br/><br/>Is there anything left to say? I don't know.

The last one that I saw was Jackie Brown and liked it better than the others. The fact that so many great actors were in it, combined with me being in my mid 50's and remembering the movie the Sting so well may have had something to do with it. I have probably seen it four or 5 times on TV and is one of the few movies that I purchased the DVD. I am just a regular working guy and definitely not a critic but have recommended this to several people and all have loved it. All the actors do superb jobs. I think 30 years from now that people will still be watching it and finding it as enjoyable as they do now. One thing that I noticed that nobody put in the goofs was the age that Max was supposed to be. He said that he was 56 but when he showed Jackie his id, I believe that he was born in 1948, possibly a year or two earlier. At the time the movie was made, that would have put him in his late 40's."

","Let's not get carried away - Pulp Fiction, this is not. But to anybody who knows his work, this movie screams Tarantino from beginning to end. It is clever, intriguing, observational, entertaining, but never patronizing.<br/><br/>Personally I think DeNiro & the stunningly gorgeous Fonda are hopelessly mis-cast here. As in PF and almost every other movie he appears in, Jackson controls every one of his numerous scenes. That's fine because he does it better than anyone else I know. But it needs a very special actor to play opposite him, and the above mentioned don't quite fit the bill here. Forster & Grier on the other hand, manage it well (for those not yet fans of Forster, check out American Perfekt.) Keaton provides good support but Chris Tucker is under-used. Locations are not really memorable and the film lacks atmosphere. What really makes this worthy is the script, the plot, and the lead's acting. Of course there's the music too, but it's all strangely subdued.<br/><br/>Obviously the pedigree is evident and the film is well-crafted, but it is the story that shines through here.

","Quentin is an infuriating filmmaker inasmuch as, try as I might, I have a hard time finding something wrong with his movies. He's an arrogant, flashy, pompous, occasionally idiotic, and pretentious person; his movies have been, since Pulp Fiction, genius. Granted, that body of work really only comprises three or four films depending on how you count, but it's an incredible, vibrant, and always fun body of work. Pulp Fiction is probably his best film, but Jackie Brown is a close second--a more mature and touching film than anything else in his oeuvre (aside from, of all things, Kill Bill Vol. 2). <br/><br/>Jackie Brown is about, well, Jackie Brown, a middle-aged flight attendant busted for helping out a gun-runner. She pals up with Max Cherry, bail-bondman, and double-crosses, nay triple crosses, Ordell, the gun-runner, and leaves Ray Nicolette, ATF agent, flummoxed. It's a convoluted crime film told with precision and an interest in the characters. There's action and incident, but, like the best crime novels, it cares about its people. It makes Jackie and Max and Ordell and Ray and Louis and Melanie real; it makes them fascinating. This is due in part to a wonderful group of actors but also to Quentin's incredible ability to draw pitch-perfect performances from anyone. He even gets De Niro to tone things down, which is something I wish more directors would do, as that's when the man is at his best (look at Goodfellas and tell me that's not his best performance). <br/><br/>The story, for those that like the serpentine twists of a crime novel, is delicious, mouthwatering. You sit and watch and find yourself continually amazed and pleased by the developments on screen. It's a great cinematic experience, feeling that inexorable pull as a great filmmaker pulls you around unexpected corners. <br/><br/>Jackie Brown lacks some of the ""formal innovations"" of Pulp Fiction (sorry, that out-of-step chronology was done before, like, in the 1950s), but it doesn't lack the energy and brilliance that made QT's masterpiece such breath of fresh air. It's simply great and it's simply great to see two fantastic actors (Pam Grier and Robert Forster) in roles they've deserved for years. <br/><br/>As I said, Quentin is, as a person, a bit of a, um, ninny (at least as far as his appearances on TV are concerned). He makes great movies. I'd love to rake him over the coals sometimes, but his films shut me up. Now if he could only start demonstrating better taste in the films he champions (Hostel? WTF?)."

Jackson is mind-blowingly evil in this film. Michael Keaton (in a role reprised for Soderbergh's Out of Sight- brilliant) is a revelation. For those of you who think of him only as Mr. Mom or Batman, it's basically time to think again. <br/><br/>All this and Deniro too! The great Bob is amazingly laid back in this film. Wonderfully, wonderfully subtle. And Bridgit Fonda is in it too and does an amazing job.

","For a Quentin Tarantino film, this is pretty clever, even if it doesn't mix up scenes like his others have. Basically Jackie Brown (Golden Globe nominated Pam Grier) is a flight attendant caught by the cops smuggling gun money at the airline she works for, along with some cocaine. Eventually though, Fed Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and LA Cop Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) decide to team up in order to arrest the arms dealer she works for, who they don't know, Ordell Robbie (Golden Globe nominated Samuel L. Jackson). She has to choose to tell the cops about the arms dealer, or get her freedom with Ordell suspecting, or shut up and do some time. That's when she meets Max Cherry (Oscar nominated Robert Forster), her bail bondsman, who falls for her. Then Jackie comes up with a plan to play the cops off against Ordell and the guys he works for, Melanie Ralston (Bridget Fonda, Peter's daughter and Jane's niece) and Louis Gara (Robert De Niro), among others, and walk off with their money, but she needs Max's help. Also starring Rush Hour's Chris Tucker as Beaumont Livingston and Lisa Gay Hamilton as Sheronda. The scenes in the department showing the different times of the payoff from the three sides of the story, Jackie, Melanie and Louis, and Max is really engaging, The Simpsons even spoofed the same format. Samuel L. Jackson was number 11, and Robert De Niro number 2 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 50 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Al Pacino) on The World's Greatest Actor.

"TheNorthernMonkee","10","0","3","11 March 2005"," more genius from Tarantino
","SPOILERS Let's be honest for a second here. Out of everyone in Hollywood today, there must be few who are living the dream as much as Quentin Tarantino. With a life drenched in cinema, Tarantino is the king of ""cool"" cinema. Creating films which are full of pop culture references, always featuring an awe inspiring soundtrack and with magnificent characters, Tarantino has seemingly not put a foot wrong since 1992's perfect ""Reservoir Dogs"". With both Dogs and the more successful ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) under his belt, 1997's ""Jackie Brown"" was another rung on the Tarantino ladder as he created a film containing humour, some memorable lines and an amazing career reemergence by Pam Grier.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown (Grier) is a flight attendant for one of the down-market airlines. Secretly running money into the country for Ordell Robbie (Samuel L Jackson), things suddenly seem to go wrong for her when she is arrested by Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) of the police. Now with the help of bail organiser Max Cherry (Robert Forster), Jackie Brown is out for herself.<br/><br/>It's an acceptable fact in modern cinema that if Quentin Tarantino is involved with a film, it's going to be stylish. Whether he's written the film, directed it, or simply put his name to it, the film is going to be stylish. ""Jackie Brown"" is without a doubt, no exception.<br/><br/>From Pam Grier's first appearance, through to her final scene, the film flows with a soundtrack to orgasm over. With a distinctive soul feel, it's hard not to be dragged into the adventures of Jackie Brown.<br/><br/>The casting also adds to the persona of the film. Samuel L Jackson as gun merchant Ordell is perhaps not as good as in ""Pulp Fiction"" but he's not far off. Robert De Niro as well, looking remarkably old and worn is brilliant as the stoned bank robber friend of Ordell who is just out of jail. Then, add to the list Keaton, Forster, Bridget Fonda, Chris Tucker and the amazing Grier, and you are looking at an outstanding lineup.<br/><br/>Tarantino also has an amazing knack for unique camera angles and sound techniques. In ""Reservoir Dogs"" he had Michael Madsen's Mr Blonde walk between two locations whilst music was only audible in one of the two. Copying the technique in ""Jackie Brown"" one scene is amazing where the story rotates between cars, all playing different songs. The way it is done is nothing short than genius. Then with camera angles he again replicates an idea from Dogs by having a camera filming from an open car trunk. Looking up at characters from the tight angle, the scene always looks strangely intriguing, almost like your secretly observing on a private conversation. Tarantino introduces us to his views on picture and sound quality, and you begin to realise just how clever the man truly is.<br/><br/>Everyone knows what they like to see in cinema. Whether it's a comedy starring a rubber faced comedian, or a serious drama starring an old English thespian, choice is all around. Personally though, whatever the mood, the one thing you can always rely on is that few films will be as stylish as a Quentin Tarantino feature. ""Jackie Brown"" might not be quite as amazing as ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"" but it is still one of the best films you will ever see."

","This film is so much better than Reservoir DOGS, though not nearly as good as the masterpiece that is PULP FICTION. This movie was fun to watch though it was a bit LONG. I personally consider this as one of my favorite movies. The plot is very good and steady, and of course you can easily recognize the fact that this could be QT's best, and even though it wasn't, it is still damn good. Pam Grier and Samuel L. Jackson are totally great in the roles, and the supporting cast is great too(Bridget Fonda, Robert DeNiro). The movie is all about character study, and definitely one of the top art house movies ever to grace the screen.<br/><br/>What flaws is actually quite unfair in my opinion, being the fact that people expected QT to make another PULP FICTION, and even though he could of, I know 100% he could, is that if he did, people would not think it was original. Jackie Brown is truly worth seeing and will appeal if you just watch it as it is, and don't expect anything else.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown 9/10"

She embodies this every woman effortlessly. The fact that she was not nominated for an Oscar says more about the Academy than it does about her work.<br/><br/>Samuel L.

I have watched this film several times and I still laugh whenever she is on screen. Someone please build a comedy around this neglected comic talent! The other wonderful surprise is the understated Robert Forster. He and Grier are a match made in heaven. They simply could not be any better.<br/><br/>For anyone who loves intelligent, mature, adult cinema, do yourself a favor and don't just rent, but buy Jackie Brown."
"Boris-57","Null","0","1","11 October 2004"," Grossly underrated. Provides the angle for digging Kill Bill.
","I don't quite recall the story. At the time (not that long ago - saw it fairly recently, around the time KB1 came out) I thought it was fairly run-of-the-mill. Still the movie stuck. I'd seen and liked Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Used to like the memory of the first one more, but after several re-viewings, and considering the point I'm going to try to make, I doubt whether Pulp isn't the better one. Anyway.<br/><br/>I may be slow, but it took Jackie Brown for me to realize what it is that QT does so well. He actually takes caricatures, puts them in a fancy comic book story/place and tells the story around them. But here appears the skill (some call it genius) : in doing so, he manages to get the emotions across. Real emotions with caricaturised characters - how? Where he was still a bit to much obsessed with the formal experiment in Pulp and especially Dogs, this eagerness to toy with the story falls by the wayside in Jackie. Maybe that's why it's so underrated - because many think ""this time he didn't pull it off"". But in all my vanity I'm pretty sure that he didn't want to, at least not like in Pulp or Dogs.<br/><br/>In Jackie the camera sticks like glue to the main characters, to a degree that they were all the images I had in my head afterwards. Of course, the devine goddess Pam Grier IS camera glue. Put the point is : he takes this basic cliché character (though Grier's has some 'depth'), and focuses on it, and lets the full drama and being of the actor playing that character define the drama of the character. It's the return of the classic Hollywood Star Quality*. Forget creating a deep character and having it played by an actor whose face/name you can't recall because he becomes te character (like for example the invariably brilliant Timothy Spall - so good you hardly notice it's the same actor in all those roles); instead, make the character a vehicle to exploit the star quality. And there we are : one of the meanings of ""exploitation cinema"" (though that exploitation covers more than that <snicker>). ""What would Sasori be if she wasn't played by Meiko Kaji?"" becomes ""What would Sasori be if she wasn't Meiko Kaji?""<br/><br/>And that's why it's a key to Kill Bill, or at least a bridge between the kaleidescopic formal frenzy of Pulp and the more stylized spareness of Bill. Kill Bill 1 got you on the wrong leg (probably deliberately), superficially recalling the frenzy of Pulp, and then it seems to fall short, too. But KB has much more to do with Jackie Brown, meaning that the essence is the characters that become emblematic through the presence of the actors portraying them, a hint you could also get from KB 2 (it pays to re-watch Vol.1 AFTER Vol.2!). But all this is not the end in itself. The end is to, by the 'trick' just described, bring an emotion across, so that a story obviously implausible to the rational mind becomes plausible to the emotional sense, becomes plausible BECAUSE we recognise the unnuanced basic emotions brought to nuanced life by the beaming presence of the actors. And Q has the visual and directorial (is that English?) flair to capture that beam on pellicule. And that's what makes it great film. This, Jackie Brown, and Kill Bill Vols. 1 AND 2.<br/><br/>Numerous exploitation directors (Jackie Brown) or the likes of Sergio Leone (Kill Bill) might have done the exact same thing before him, but he brings it all to such implausible, often utterly 'incongruent' heights, that the awe before the fact that he still can pull the emotional arc thing on you makes your jaw fall into your lap. Dang.<br/><br/>*note: This is, though superficially alike, a completely different ballgame than what e.g. David Lynch does (whom I like even more). He also has caricatures play in often grotesque implausible stories. The difference is that with DL the characters are puppets in a play or figures in a painting, and it is the painting as a whole, and not just the actors, that has to get the emotion across and make you forget the actual content of the story, in order to dissolve into the er... message of Love. Only in A Straight Story can one see a resemblance with what QT does - still only that, because the thing as a whole remains important in order to make the superb acting in the end bring the message across."

","""Jackie Brown"" is different. With this film, Quentin Tarantino takes a half-step back from his own distinctive style to adapt a novel by his hero and obvious influence, Elmore Leonard. It's true that ""Jackie Brown"" is one of the more overlooked films on Tarantino's luminous CV. It is a comparatively quieter work than the director's other, more explosive, films. ""Jackie Brown"" even unfolds in (nearly) linear fashion. Be that as it may, this is one funny, richly detailed, and memorable crime story.<br/><br/>Pam Grier shines in the title role, imbuing Jackie with great depth, humanity, and strength. Grier shares a fine onscreen chemistry with Robert Forster, who is excellent in his role as a smitten bail bondsmen. The rest of the cast, including a villainous Samuel L. Jackson, contribute well. Robert Deniro and Bridget Fonda make a very funny - if unlikely - comic duo.<br/><br/>Tarantino wasn't looking to top ""Pulp Fiction"" here. He set out to create a stylish and enjoyable movie, and succeeded."

Robert DeNiro was especially funny in this movie and Bridget Fonda was looking especially sexy in this one. A scene involving them beginning in a shopping mall and ending in a parking lot had me sidesplitting in laughter. The score was really good but I had a few problems with the script which relied on too much chance to get things going. Also Pam Grier's character I really had no sympathy for her because all of her problems were caused by HER decisions not by the cruel hand of fate.

"stamper","8","0","2","7 March 2004"," The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 4 - Through his eyes, but not by his hand: Jackie Brown
","Different, but the same<br/><br/>
Jackie Brown was the first (and until now the only) film that was directed by Quentin Tarantino, but written by someone else. The film was based on a novel by Elmore Leonard called Rum Punch. Now despite the fact that Tarantino did not write th e story of the film itself, his hand is very visible in the dialog. There are lines and conversations in this film that I consider to be typical of Quentin Tarantino (the same phenomenon can be found in From Dusk till Dawn). These conversations are mostly about nothing or do not really matter as far as the plot goes, but still they are interesting and entertaining to see,because they are gripping and sometimes even funny in their simplicity. I truly believe that the reason for Tarantino's brilliance partly stems from the fact, that he does not hide the amount of ridiculous conversations a human being has on a day. He shows us just how often we do that and he sometimes even exaggerates it. I must say though, that in this film, he stays on the normal side of conversations and despite the fact that there are some Tarantino tendencies to be found in the conversations, the man himself does not go quite as far as in his preceding two directorial offerings.<br/><br/>
Now Jackie Brown has what you might call an ensemble cast, with Robert DeNiro, Samuel L.Jackson, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda and Pam Grier, but that does not suffice to make a film good of entertaining. In my opinion Heat would be a pretty good example. That film had lots of names attached to it, but did not get much further than mediocrity. This film is different though. The actors have all been perfectly matched to the characters they are supposed to play. There was no actor or actress here that made an Academy Award winning performance, but every actor (including Chris Tucker) got his part down good. I was really impressed, especially by Pam Grier. Now I don't really now any of her other work, but judging from the sort of films she made, I would not assume that she could play that well. I guess it just all depends on the part you get and the director you work with.<br/><br/>
This film has a running time of 150 minutes, which I would say is pretty much for an ordinary Gangster film without too much action, but throughout the entire experience there never ever is one part that is too long. Everything done in this film is done with some thought and every scene is made perfect by the chemistry of the subtle camera movement, the actors and the music. Now I'm not the sort of folk you would catch listening to any of the music played in this film, but I felt that they underscored the events taking place on screen to maximum effect. Tarantino has really emphasized that he is the master when it comes to combining picture and songs to enhance the impact of the film. The music is not there to sell the soundtrack, as is the case with films like Daredevil or The Blair Witch Project 2, it is there to make you feel the movie. Tarantino does not want you to watch his film. He wants you to experience it. Jackie Brown may not be as thrilling as Reservoir Dogs and it may not be as cool and mysterious as Pulp Fiction, but it still is an enjoyable experience. There are many directors out there who would love to have a film this good on their resume (not to mention the cast) and still Jackie Brown is not as good as Tarantino's preceding directorial offerings.<br/><br/>

I loved this movie, and Pulp Fiction.  I think that Pulp Fiction is liked more because people were expecting a fast-paced, action packed movie.  They couldn't be farther from the truth.  In fact, this is a movie driven by character, which apparently disappointed some.  Like the others, Tarantino adds puts in long, uncut frames, lots of F's, foot scenes, and one great movie.

Her method of revenge is to steal the dealer's money, but being under parole, she comes off with a very clever plan. It could be said that the plot is nothing special, and it could be said that is right. However it is how Mr Tarintino changes the simple plot to a labyrinth of sub plots and explaining the story in unchronlogical order which makes it intriguing to watch.<br/><br/>It is absolutely brillant to see that Pam Grier, the queen of blaxploitation movies, is being ressurected for such a good movie. Also I would have to say that she is looking fine for age as well. Samuel L Jackson is just enthralling as Ordell Robbie, the arms dealer, and like in Pulp Fiction, he seems to get the greatest lines. Robert De Niro was good as Louis Gara, Ordell's aging partner in crime, who just got out of jail. Bridget Fonda was only there for eye candy and was not involved as much as should have been. Chris Tucker and Micheal Keaton were good in bit part roles in the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it would have to be said that though this does not have Tarintino signature all over the movie, it still has inklings of Quentin's genius inside the movie.

Cool and collected, you wonder how long it takes for him to snap.<br/><br/>Sam Jackson is Ordell Robbie, the gun runner who thinks he's cooler than he actually is.  Sure, he has the money, the guns, the girls, but it's all just to stroke his own ego as he's not much more than a bumbling cool guy-wannabe.<br/><br/>Then there's Max Cherry, the bail-bondsman who has seen and done it all, and now just wants to sit back and enjoy life, but can never let himself do so.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is a little bit of everyone.

But the incredible high rates that the first two films get have a lot to do with hype and the exposition of crude violence. I do like them, just that I think they didn't deserve such reverence.

I think this is a fantastic film, with great writing, directing and especially acting (like all of Quentin's films). The story is about a middle-aged black woman Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) who is a stewardess for a crummy airline that flies from L.A. to Cabo San Lucas. When she gets caught by two police detectives Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and Dargus (Michael Bowen) for transporting drugs and money for a brutal thug Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) she ends up in jail. When she gets out of jail on bail, an older bail bondsman named Max Cherry (Robert Forrester) who is Ordell's bail bondsman as well, falls for her. Out of jail, she must help Nicolette to catch Ordell, but if Ordell finds out her plan, he will have absolutley no problem killing her. With the choices of helping Ordell and risking going to jail and helping Nicolette and risk getting killed, she decides to play them both and work with Max to get $500,000 from Ordell, turn Ordell into the cops, and run off with the money. This film also stars Robert DeNiro as Ordell's partner in crime, Louis, Bridget Fonda as Ordell's girlfriend, Melanie, and Chris Tucker as a loud mouth petty thief, Beaumont Livingston. Great performances given in by Pam Grier, Robert DeNiro, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda and especially, Robert Forrester in the role which earned him an Academy Award Nominee for Best Supporting Actor of the Year in 1997. This film is great, and I highly recommend you see it. Although not as good as 'Reservoir Dogs' or 'Pulp Fiction', this is still going to be a memorable Tarantino film. Rent it Today (But see 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' first). Grade: A-"

","Rarely do  I see a movie where all the characters are real. They are in jackie Brown. Not only are they real, I actually like most of them (even Ordell, although he scares me to death). The script is a gem -- smart and funny with great dialog. And the acting -- Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson and Fred Ward are absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>I can watch this movie over and over at the end smile because I know that at least someone in Hollywood still knows how to make movies!"
"preposterous","10","0","1","16 January 2003"," questions and thoughts
","This will undoubtedly contain some spoilers<br/><br/>Jackie Brown is, in some ways, a rejuvenation of the Carmen opera.  In Carmen, the exotic, beautiful, willful outlaw of a woman seduces a straight arrow soldier of the barracks<br/><br/>About Max Cherry, the film in many ways centers around him.  All the other characters are acting almost entirely out of selfish motivations.  Max takes considerable personal risk to help a woman he adores, and yet he doesn't impose himself sexually on her, and asks only his 10% professional rate<br/><br/>When Jackie tells Max that she never used him, he replies ""I never said you did"".  That doesn't necessarily exclude the possibility that he did think that.  In my opinion, Jackie did use Max, and Max did what he did for her knowing that she was using him.   Max is in true love.  Jackie was smart enough to use Max in a way that didn't hurt him, to be honest with him about her true intentions via the plan, and thereby establish an intellectual intimacy.  Jackie may be an enticing woman, but Max's feelings for her actually enhance our perception of her beauty.  Max's ability to appreciate people for who they are rather than what they can bring him is what makes this movie unique.  Without Max, this movie would only be a story about greed and money.  Jackie never does anything for anyone but herself.   Her only redeeming quality is that she is able to realize Max's love for her and use him in a way that doesn't belittle him, i.e. she's honest with him<br/><br/>I am confused about several parts of the plot.  I don't understand the switch in the Trial Run.  I don't see Sheronda handing any bag to Simone. Simone isn't facing Jackie, but Ordell said he wanted her there so that she could see how it went down.   If they've exchanged the bag already, why does Simone bother to ask Sheronda for the time?   What gives Simone the knowledge/sense of when is the right time to ask?  If Jackie doesn't know that Simone is going to be there, how does Max know to stay, waiting to follow Simone after Sheronda has left?  Clearly Simone got the money, because she vacated her premises immediately after.  Jackie approaches Ordell in anger because she claims not to have anticipated Simone being part of the plan.  Again, if that's so, how does Max know to watch her?  And if it's not so, then why does Jackie put on the charade of being surprised<br/><br/>I am confused about the scene where Ordell gets shot.  Ordell calls Jackie, who is at Max's office, and then Jackie quickly dials other people: probably Winston and the police.  They all arrive pretty quickly.  I wonder what Jackie would have told them to induce them to go there and wait in the back room.  It just seems like a lot to have happen without an explanation. Furthermore, I think it is out of character for Ordell to walk into a trap like that.  He already knows he can't trust Jackie<br/><br/>I am confused about the scene where Max comes out of the movie and passes Ordell.  Max goes to meet Jackie in what looks like a pre-arranged meeting. Ordell thinks something is suspicious when he seems them together.  Well, duh?!  Why doesn't he at least tail her and quiz her later about this?<br/><br/>I have noticed that the bag of money shifts in the dressing room seat between the time Jackie and Max are in the fitting room"
"preposterous","10","0","1","11 January 2003"," beautiful love story
","There's something beautiful about a character who has grown, experienced life's many letdowns, first hand, and emerged from an angry, vengeful, egotistical, attention-seeking twirp into a reticent, humble, calmer, sadder/happier adult.  How do you feel about getting older?  This is the question of the movie<br/><br/>I'm getting older.  Pam Grier and Robert Forester, in their roles, reminded me of the grace that comes with age.  I've read other comments on this board, about how some people feel that this film almost gave us the impression that we have been living with these people for some time, and gotten to know them pretty well.  I feel like I definitely got to know them. That sad quality of Robert Forester, the melancholic mood, it's become more and more a part of my character.  The unrequited aspect of the plot, it too is something I can identify with.  And Pam's character, she's such a wonderful person anyway.  She's had her hard knocks, in real life.  Haven't we all?  But she wears it well.   To me this is a triumph of character. Jackie triumphs over the people she must overcome, while staying true to the one person who is true to her: Max Cherry.  Max is true to just about everyone, and he is the most sympathetic character in the film<br/><br/>I saw Reservoir Dogs when it came out, and loved it.  I laughed when a friend described it as the 'feel good movie of the year'.  I thought Pulp Fiction was, to a certain extent, a sell out, in that it took the basic ideas of Reservoir Dogs, and made them more saleable by virtue of the big names: Bruce Willis and John Travolta.  So, when the bad reviews came in for Jackie Brown, I figured his goose was cooked.  Here we are in January 2003, and I only just saw Jackie Brown for the first time one month ago.  It has become my new favorite film.  It has replaced the Sorrow and the Pity as the 'regular' flick in my VCR.  I think I have seen it eight times, or more<br/><br/>I'd say this is his best film yet.  Granted, we needed the other two films to get to the point where we are now, but his story of redemption, and tender, unrequited love, the acting, the soundtrack, the casting (except De Niro, who was underplaying to a fault) - it's a combination that I can't easily forget.  <br/><br/>My favorite scenes are, first, when Max meets Jackie at the gate, as that song is playing.  And, second, in their last meeting, the tender kiss and the even more poignant look on Max's face as he excuses himself from his phone conversation to look out the window, with that 8 year old look on his face, I can feel his stomach getting socked<br/><br/>It's a bittersweet film.  It's a calmer film.  <br/><br/>For those who say it isn't 'Pulp Fiction', or at that level, all I can say is that I actually prefer Jackie Brown.  These characters are loveable. Even Samuel Jackson's dispicable character is otherwise loveable, or at least valuable<br/><br/>I love the people who put this movie together"

","Tarentino is a brilliant director and it is displayed in Jackie Brown. The tumultuous blacksploitation period of the 70's was the obvious precursor here. Pam Grier the 70's blacksploitation Queen gives an over the top performance as a middle aged air line stewardess and Samuel l Jackson steels the show as the seedy antagonist. The great thing about Jackie Brown is that Tarentino is in no rush at all. This film is effectively languid. Jackie Brown is not as ostentation as Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but it does prove that Tarentino has diversity. Bring on Kill Bill."

","I thought ""Jackie Brown"" was a wonderful movie.  This is what happens when you have a well written story, competent directing and good acting.  Look at the cast: Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton and they were all superb in their roles. The story was inventive, involved and entertaining.  The story didn't really have plot twists but you knew what was going to happen and you just didn't know how it could be pulled off.  There were a few surprises like the character in the trunk and Bridget Fonda in the parking lot.  Many people I've talked to didn't like the movie.  They expected some Hollywood Lethal Weaponish crap with its requisite cliched script and formulaic car crashes and explosions.  This movie seem to confuse them.  Unfortunately they are kept happy with a steady diet of that crap and when a movie of this caliber comes along it throws them off.  Thank you Quentin Tarantino for movies like this."

","For those of you who say you didn't like this film as much as QT's earlier films, watch Jackie Brown again.  <br/><br/>This film relies on more on the characters, and who can outsmart the other. The plot's important to the film, but QT doesn't need to jumble the storyline, with the exception of one scene that is played three times, from different character's points of view.  <br/><br/>Tarantino's gift lies in casting.  It seems he knows exactly who to get to play his main characters, and all of them fit.  Pam Grier was so good, she probably gets recognized and called Jackie Brown on the street. Robert Forster was equally strong as Max Cherry.  I can't think of anything flawed when it came to casting.  Sorry Rush Hour fans, but Chris Tucker's 5 to 10 minutes of screen time is his best performance to date.<br/><br/>Another enjoyable facet was the music.  Along with the numerous homages to Grier and her blaxpoitation days(""Street Life,"" ""Across 110th Street""), there's good tracks from the Delfonics, the Grass Roots, and Johnny Cash. Once again, the music just seemed to fit the movie. <br/><br/>Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction were great movies, but Jackie Brown is better.  I didn't like Jackie Brown the first time I saw it, but I gave it another chance, and I was hooked.  I got the DVD (as well as Pulp Fiction).<br/><br/>9 stars"
"drdeathray","Null","0","1","12 September 2002"," Very cool and slick characters
","This movie is awesome. Too many people have judged it by comparing it to Tarantino's other films, Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and that's a shame. I saw this before I saw Pulp Fiction and thought it was better. All of the characters are well scripted and you really get to know them. Robert De Niro plays a different character than we're used to seeing him and does a great job with it. Samuel L. Jackson's character is as cool and bad@$$ as Jules was in Pulp Fiction, maybe more so. Yes this movie is a tad bit long, but that's called character development people. It's also less violent than Tarantino's other films. While I haven't said any plot details in this review, I feel no need to. All you need to know is the characters are great and the music is excellent as well. That's not saying the plot is boring or awful, you'll just have to see for yourself. The DVD of this film is wonderful as well, with a trivia track (which in my opinion, are more entertaining than commentaries), interviews, documentaries, trailers for old Pam Grier films (which have to be seen to be believed) and my personal favorite- The complete Chicks who love guns video! They really took their time on this one. So if you want to watch a cool crime movie I suggest Jackie Brown."

All the characters are interesting (I can't believe the reviewers here that say they were bored!), the acting is first-rate (from everyone, including an understated Robert deNiro), and the direction and editing are is tight and neat.

","I'm a huge Tarantino fan (loved Dogs and Pulp) but after watching Jackie Brown I was a bit disappointed. To me every character was boring and some were useless. DeNiro and Fonda's characters weren't too interesting and could've been done without. Sam Jackson's character also disappointed me but then again none of his characters will ever touch Jules Winfield. All in all I didn't care about anyone in the movie.<br/><br/>Personally I felt that QT somewhat sold out with this movie. Let me remind you I love his work and think he's a god among moviemakers but Jackie Brown lacked something that Dogs and Pulp oozed, attitude. Tarantino used the whole different POV's in the department store but he had to give times and just used different angles of the same scene. If anyone knows anything about Pulp the opening diner scene and last diner scene has Pumpkin saying two different lines. Some say this was a goof and some debate that it uses the different point of views. (first being Pumpkin's and the second being Jules'). To me a true Tarantino flick wouldn't have to flash times on the screen to inform the audience, they should figure it out for themselves.<br/><br/>I still don't blame Tarantino though, I feel if he'd used his own work and ideas instead of Leonard's Rum Punch he would've made a better movie. I'm just hoping his next movie will blow me away like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction."

","Jackie Brown is one of those films that leaves you satisfied after a showing. Tarantino did very well, rather than what a lot of others have to say. Those who complain about the film's length should stick to a lesser story, something that isn't as layered as this Elmore Leonard adaptation.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is superb. Whoever casted the film deserves a mention as well as Tarantino. From Samuel L. Jackson to Robert DeNiro to Chris Tucker in a more subdued role, all are in perfect character throughout. However, if there is anyone who steals the show it is Pam Grier. Grier delivers a powerhouse performance and just like Travolta in Pulp Fiction, I hope this manages to resurrect her film career. The camerawork on Grier at the beginning of the film as she walks through the airport and later while she is walking through the mall is a perfect example of how one can have an effect on a film without dialogue. <br/><br/>This film ranks up there with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs and still manages to do so without the use of gratuitous violence. The story is also presented in flashback sequences like Pulp Fiction, but again in a lesser form. Tarantino is a master with using differemt film techniques and angles and even threw in a split screen to sharpen the 70's effect. Another shot of Grier that speaks volumes in right after she has made the money switch. Frantic looking, she makes her way through the mall and seems lost and confused. As she turns around looking for someone, Tarantino circles her with the camera creating a state of confusion, then instantly stops this as she calls out a name. Moments like this are what make Tarantino one of the best directors of all time.<br/><br/>Tarantino is using another Leonard story as the basis of his next film and if it follows suit in the ""Jackie Brown"" genre, it will surely be another success.<br/><br/>A full recommendation for this film.<br/><br/>8/10 stars."

Still, there's no doubt the man has talent, and he shows it here.<br/><br/>I do agree with those who feel it's too long, De Niro is wasted, and Samuel L. Jackson does go overboard on the n-word.  But it's funny and compelling to watch after the plot kicks in, with the same attention to character Leonard has.  I'm not as familiar with the work of Pam Grier and Robert Forster that Tarantino and those of similar tastes are, but I was blown away by their work here.  And who'd have thought a filmmaker as supposedly trapped in hipsville as Tarantino would present straight a romance between two middle-aged people, let alone an interracial one?  That alone makes it worth watching.  I also loved Bridget Fonda in the role of Melanie, an airhead.  Fonda does that type of role well, because she has no condescension in her.

Many of their scenes together showed that Jackson can quite easily intimidate almost anybody.<br/><br/>As far as the story, it was mildly interesting, though I'm not sure if the constant flashback/different points of view really worked for me after awhile.  To be fair, I did not read local favorite Leonard's novel, but the plot seemed a little disjointed to me.

""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" were thrill rides that rode on these traits, but this under-appreciated film digs in much deeper, with equal success.  Beautifully written and acted characters in a rumination on past glories and uncertain futures. How often do you see that come out of Hollywood?"

","I loved this film. Tarantino strikes again. While this is an altogether different film from Pulp Fiction, it's still great (to me even a little better). Once again the selling point is the excellent dialogue and acting. Samuel L. Jackson proves he's definitely one of the best actors around as long as he stays out of the water (see the dreadful SPHERE for details). Pam Grier is also very believable in her role and deserves more opportunities in the future. For anyone who likes acting over special effects, this film's a bag full of stacks of cash."

The cast was excellent, with performances delivered brilliantly. The much talked about dialogue, sharp and smart.

","Entertaining, well-crafted crime caper (based on Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch) centers around a handful of characters and their connection to half a million dollars. Grier is a struggling flight attendant trafficking money for slick gunrunner Jackson and trying to play both sides to her advantage, Forster a lonely bail bondsman who falls for her and tries to help her out of the jam, Keaton an ambitious federal agent trying to make the big bust, Fonda a stoned-out beach bunny trying to get her undeserved peace of the pie, meanwhile De Niro (in a purposefully muted performance) is an ex-con with no common sense. Plods at times, but the cast is stellar (especially Grier) and you're pulled into Tarantino's bizarre world of hip dialogue and unique character interactions as each of them try to come out on top. ***"

"PickUrFeetInPoughkeepsie","10","0","2","20 April 2002"," A different side of Tarantino
","This was the second movie by Tarantino that I ever saw, the first being 'Reservoir Dogs'.  After having been amazed by every second of 'Reservoir Dogs' (pop culture references, great dilaogue, cool minimalistic action, unconventional character development), 'Jackie Brown' seemed very bland, and dragged on way too long.  I was younger then and hungry for brain candy rather than any real themes, especially about getting old and not having anything to show for it.  So I labeled this proof that Tarantino could make a mediocre film. Now, after a second viewing, a few years and many lessons and heartbreaks and shattered dreams and heavy depressions later, this film really spoke to me.  This is a much more subtle film than any of the others Tarantino has been involved in.  The characters don't babble on about meaningless topics to no avail, but rather they speak about their desires and ambitions, and often not very in depth.  There is a lot about these characters that we have to figure out by reading the little there is on the surface, but they seem less contrived.  In Reservoir Dogs, each character is built up to be a certain type so that they can play a certain role in the crumbling of the jewel heist.  Here in 'Jackie Brown' we often haven't pinned down what a character is like until after they've acted.  The relationship between DeNiro and Fonda's characters is especially interesting because they do a complete turnaround in their attitudes towards eachother, even though DeNiro's performance wasn't one of his better outtings.  Grier and Forster manage a mostly platonic interracial relationship that we do not see very often, even in modern cinema.  Tarantino shows signs of maturing visually here as well, especially the shot he uses for the demise of Beaumont, but I don't want to reveal anything for those who've not seen it.  Anyway, 9/10."
"glassorange","10","0","3","11 April 2002"," Another classic from Tarantino
","Out of the three feature-length pictures Quentin Tarantino has made, ""Jackie Brown"" probably ranks at #3, with ""Reservoir Dogs"" at #2, and ""Pulp Fiction"", the very best film ever made, being at #1.  However, ""Jackie Brown"" is still a great film.  It displays Tarantino's directing and storytelling talents just as well as when we saw them in  his two previous films.  His cast is excellent as well, with the title character played by Pam Grier, and some outstanding performances by Robert De Niro, Michael Keaton, Samuel L. Jackson, Bridget Fonda, and Robert Forster in an Oscar-nominated role as a lonely bail bondsman.<br/><br/>Tarantino's story is difficult to describe, so I close now, offering this final advice to the reader: By all means, see ""Jackie Brown"""
"seanahalpin","10","0","3","17 February 2002"," A great Tarantino
","Jackie Brown is my favourite Tarantino film. Grier is absolutely brilliant in the lead role, showing that a middle aged black woman is able to pack one hell of a punch. She is sexy, manipulative and gives as good as she gets while maintaining her charisma throughout.<br/><br/>The movie is not as violent or ""arty"" as Pulp Fiction, but I feel that in some ways this allows a wider audience to appreciate what Tarantino has to offer. (Luckily, Tarantino does not make one of his frequent awkward cameos in this film). Lisa Gay Hamilton (aka Rebecca on TVs ""The Practice"") makes a cameo as a young misled country girl.<br/><br/>The plot is simple on the surface - but there are depths and unexpected twists all the way. Samuel L Jackson is always great value as a gun runner, truly cold hearted and yet likeable.<br/><br/>This film was perhaps not marketed as well as it should have been, and is worth a look for those wanting a suspenseful thriller where characterisation is more important than explosions and special effects."

"wood-21","Null","0","1","11 November 2001"," An action film with a human touch and people you care about
","I found 'Reservoir Dogs' quite a powerful movie, if lacking in light and shade but I did find 'Pulp Fiction' too extreme.  Jackie Brown may not appeal to those who like fast moving action all the time but to those who like things a little more subtle with more emphasis on character this is definitely more than a quick fix.<br/><br/>Robert Forster as Max Cherry stood out among a host of colourful and volatile characters, there was a reflective and silent quality about the acting, you knew there was more going on behind those eyes than he ever expressed.  It was almost as though Jackie Brown was his opposite in character, a force of nature, a risk taker and someone passionate about going for what she believed in.  However, I do think that the chemistry worked well because they both shared a vulnerable, even sensitive side and this was movingly portrayed.<br/><br/>Samuel L Jackson as Ordell Robbie added a nice touch of laid back humour to the proceedings even if it was tinged with menace.  This was a nice foil for Max's serious approach.  Michael Keaton as Ray Nicolette provided a lot of nervous energy almost as if the part could hardly contain him and the dark edge which appears to be a trademark of his acting.<br/><br/>The only criticism I would have is that Tarrantino did tend to fade scenes out and cut the action at crucial moments (the scene of Max and Jackie drinking wine together for instance), almost as if he has an itchy trigger finger himself and is anxious to shoot the next scene.  He focuses on Jackie Brown's wall and a picture of two children, never explaining who they are although it is Max who notices and he keeps everything under control.  Why wasn't there some kind of celebration after the success of the plan at the end, we switch from Ordell dead on the floor to three days later!  It's almost as if the director hates too much detail.<br/><br/>Still, minor frustrations apart this is a perceptive film about real people with real frailties rather than simple stereotypes."

","Why are you despised by so many? Is it because you re-defined American independent cinema with Reservoir Dogs (1992)? Is it because you achieved ultimate mainstream success with another cool and imaginative black comedy thriller Pulp Fiction (1994)? now a modern classic, or is it just the fact that you have such a strong belief in you're own talents? Thus is the sadness of Tarantino, a man who only wanted to make good films, but ended up having all his ideas stoles, ripped-off and twisted into stupid violent capers by talent less imitators (take a bow Guy Ritchie). Tarantino should be hailed as the genius he is, not only did he do more for nineties cinema than any other director, but he managed to create all his films with a strong story and believable, well-written characters. <br/><br/>Following Pulp Fiction was never going to be easy, and one must commend Tarantino's integrity to not just deliver a Pulp Fiction 2, instead opting for Elmore Leonard's multi layered character study ""Rum Punch"". This is a change of pace for Tarantino, a much slower, less flashy film than his previous classics. There are no over the top speeches or odd bursts of violence, the characters in Jackie Brown are based completely in life, a strong contrast to the almost pre-destined worlds of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, gone are the ironies and the knowing nods to all things past. Jackie Brown exists on it's own merits and should be judged that way.<br/><br/>
The plot follows Jackie (Pam Grier, in the role she was born to play, if that wasn't already Foxy Brown) and the characters that move in and out of her life. She's a woman trying to do the best for herself, but torn between two men, Bail bondsman Max Cherry, and cool drug dealer cum gun runner Ordell Robey (Samuel L. Jackson). She's also torn between both sides of the law, trying to make the best of the situation without succumbing to the charismatic lure of Ordell, which would undoubtedly be her fall. The reason a lot of Tarantino fans initially reacted against Jackie Brown, is because of the difference in tone and pace, it not only shows Tarantino's willingness to grow as a film-maker, but also the respect he shows to his characters. The film unfolds slowly, making sure that all the balls are in motion for the grandstand final.<br/><br/>If the film is flawed in any way, it's in the fact that the characters are so multi-faceted that their actions become too hard to follow, we get lost and the film refuses to break the pace. And in an odd way, there still doesn't seem to be enough time dedicated to the actors, I was left feeling that I wanted to know more about them and their characters, that I deserved it. People just refuse to give the time it takes to enjoy everything the film has to offer, ""Chicks with Guns"", Jackie's Entrance through the airport in the opening credits, the Rashomon inspired three way final. Jackie Brown revels in it's homage to the Scorsese/blackploitation days of seventies cinema in the same way Dogs used the heist film or Pulp Fiction's references to, well pulp fictions.<br/><br/>People tend to forget that this was (and still is as yet) Tarantino's third film, think about how many directors have made such a well crafted and assured third film as this. And although Jackie Brown doesn't have the same magic as Dogs and Fiction, it's still one of the most outstanding films of the nineties. Hurry back soon Quentin, modern American cinema needs you.<br/><br/>A respectable 8/10"

","This was a slick, stylish, cool little caper by our friendly neighborhood director Quentin Tarantino, where he takes one of the coolest actresses of all time, Pam Grier, and one of the coolest actors of all time, Samuel L., and an all star cast, including Robert De Niro and Bridget Fonda, and puts them all on the trail of $500,000 in the recreation of Elmor Leonard's novel 'Rum Punch'.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie because of the twist and turns, the betrayal, the way Pam Grier figures out how to trick everyone, the parts that you didn't expect, and of course the excellent acting. Also, everyone had a purpose in the plan, and everybody thought they were fooling each-other.<br/><br/>You may have to watch this a few times to figure out all of the plans and how they all came together, but you don't have to understand all the little things to understand and enjoy this movie. For those of you who are hoping for a movie that is similar to 'Pulp Fiction', this is not the one you want, because the only similarity between the two films is the great acting and dialogue, which makes this a good movie alone, but for those of you who are looking for an intelligent, witty, violent, and well acted heist movie, this is the one for you! 9/10"
"hanse.man","9","0","1","20 June 2001"," no adrenaline kick, but a good caper movie
","Since both Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction are my favorite pictures ever, of which many dialogues are imprinted in my brain, I was very curious how Tarantino had filmed Pam Grier. She featured in one of the unforgettable dialogues in Reservoir Dogs and she is obviously an 'old' (pardon me the adjective) hero of Tarantino. 'Jackie Brown' does remind us of the seventies, and the age of the cast helps to bring it about: it is convincing to believe the seventies were good days for them, and that they have held on to the music of those days. Unlike the music of RD and PF, this was not my music, regrettably. Most of it just didn't ring a bell for me. For days I sang 'Little Green Back'(RD) or had the saxophones of PF in my mind and I can go on about this for a while. I can see that if you're a fan of the music in Jackie Brown, this adds a great extra quality. I didn't get the adrenaline kick out of it that I had hoped for. Be this as it may, I still thought it a good movie. The theme of ageing which each character (except maybe the cops) had to deal with assured that I empathized with them. The plot about the money and the question where Jackie's loyalty lied had me in their grip too. I agree with what others have written here about the relationship between Jackie and Cherry: it kept me curious how it would develop. Many images will stick to my mind too. DeNiro rocking his chair while Simone does a Diana Ross act to me is a classic, and thinking back, most of his scenes are. However, I read here that the dialogues were as good as in Tarantino's other movies. This is insane. E.g.,if I compare Jackson's character with his in PF he was good watching here, but in PF his lines (the pre-execution speech, the coffee shop dialogue, the foot massage, etc) were magic. All in all I think the movie is good: 8.5 out of 10. To me Tarantino stays the best director since Hitchcock. With JB he rode two hobby horses (Grier and the music) that are not mine, nor were the dialogues as great as in his 2 classics, but it was a feast for the eyes and a very enjoyable movie nonetheless."

"necrodemion","8","0","1","11 June 2001"," Tarantino's best, but not necessarily for Pulp or Dogs fans
","This movie was the best Hollywood flic I've seen in a long while.<br/><br/>The film marks Pam Grier's triumphant return to centre stage after years of neglect following the end of her early career in Blacksploitation pics. Still looking knock-out gorgeous in middle-age, Grier proves to all naysayers once and for all with this film that she definitely can act. Clearly Tarantino's tribute to one of his favourite actresses, the film's soundtrack (another excellent Tarantino soundtrack, this time with an appropriate focus on 70s funk and soul) even features one song sung by Grier, and another by Bobby Womack, the singer Grier first began her showbiz career as a back-up singer for.<br/><br/>As equally brilliant as the the casting of Grier in the main role is the casting of Robert Forster as Jackie Brown's bail bondsman. The on-screen chemistry between Grier and Forster works perfectly, and the two's final scene together is the moving pinnacle of the entire inspired film.<br/><br/>But those Tarantino fans looking for the graphic violence of Reservoir Dogs or the snide cynicism of Pulp Fiction will be disappointed with this film, which is a much deeper, quieter and more mature work. A good crime tale told with a nice plot twist, but more than this a deeper probing into the issues of aging, life and intimacy, this work satisfies in ways that Tarantino's previous works could not.<br/><br/>With this film, Tarantino has made me into a fellow Pam Grier fan, and has left me waiting to see more from both of them."

","Like in the Pulp Fiction` segment with John Travolta and Samuel Jackson, we experience a certain, deplaced calmness here. The movie runs two and a half hours and singular scenes are longer than usual. There are hardly any violent scenes in the movie, no bloodshed; language is the only reason why I couldn't watch the movie before I was sixteen. The music is from the seventies and also quite slow and melancholic. Pam Grier was famous in the seventies and Robert Forster himself even looks like coming straight from a twenty-year old TV series. This calmness  that is the result of all these facts  had a great fascination on me. It produced a fantastic suspense and if the dialogues were not typical for Tarantino I would say, it's a very Hitchcock-like film.<br/><br/>If there was an Oscar for casting, this film would have won it. That unusual mix of well-known and coming-back actors, all together doing a great job, makes the film most interesting from the start. 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Actually, there is nothing to complain about, as long as you see the film only once. When I saw it a second time, the dialogues started to get a little tiring and I asked myself: Do they really have to be so long each? So don't watch it twice one after the other."

Although the screenplay isn't his, original, because it's adapted from an Elmore Leonard novel it really suits QT well!

The movie sports an excellent cast, and some beautiful camera shots, however, and there really is quite a bit of life in the acting.

Brown works for San Cabo Air, the worst airline to be a stewardess for in the business, Brown says, and traffics drugs and dirty money over the border.  She is caught with some of the money by federal agents, though, and is forced to stop her illegal scheme.  This is where Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) comes in. He is the international gun smuggler who employs Jackie, and wants to recover his money from Mexico, before he gets busted as well.  There is a huge part of the movie then (which is almost three hours total) devoted to trying to get the $500,000 back.

","Despite the inevitable backlash against Tarantino, and regardless of whether you approve of his violence/bad language/self-referencing narratives, I firmly believe the cinema owes him a huge debt. <br/><br/>For I genuinely believe that the 1980s were the worst decade in history for the modern motion picture. The ""high concept pitching"" of films that could be summed up literally in two lines, with functional dialogue and A to B plotting had caused a serious slump in creative output, and audiences were being patronised by what substandard fare was being pumped into the cinemas.<br/><br/>In 1992 Quentin entered the scene with Reservoir Dogs (9). Okay, it's heavily indebted to foreign film, but the real-time/time-bending conceits of the movie, coupled with naturalistic dialogue that gave characterisation broke down the rot. Okay, films with plot and character were all the rage in the 60s, 70s, 50s even. But the 80s had forgotten how to do it, and Quentin gave it back to us. Now I'm sure everyone could tell me there's another film writer-director that did it first, but Quentin was the one to popularise it. He capitalised on Dogs with the more commercial, more indulgent, more juvenile, but ultimately much more fun Pulp Fiction (10). Without these films we would never have seen such fare as The Usual Suspects, with it's wordy script and time-bending, and this would never have bled on to the dying British film scene with movies like the successful Trainspotting. There were other successes, too, such as by far and away the greatest Tarantino film not directed by Tarantino, True Romance (7). Starring Christian Slater (who allegedly gives 10% in royalties to Jack Nicholson for every performance), it lost the downbeat ending and time distortions, but Quentin was said to be satisfied with the linear narrative of this 93 movie. His first real film script (discounting an incomplete student project, ""My Best Friend's Birthday""), it was completed in 1987 and went for years before being taken up. It showcased some of his best dialogue and Hollywood satire; Tony Scott's more laid-back direction actually giving greater chance for the writing to shine. And for a film that also features Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman and Balki out of Perfect Strangers, it didn't feel crammed. Amazingly, I still know of people that won't see it as they think by the title that it's a romantic comedy.<br/><br/>However, the nature of the films and the fact that Tarantino did so much in so little time meant a backlash wasn't only inevitable, but in certain quarters, eagerly awaited. Experimental, between-film follies such as Four Rooms didn't help, and when Jackie Brown emerged, three years after Pulp Fiction, it seemed as if his time had passed. Jackie Brown (7) was a smoother, maturer direction for Tarantino. The first of his films not to come from his own ideas, but from a source text, Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch, it was a new direction. Interestingly, aged 15 Quentin had been caught trying to unsuccessfully hustle a copy of Leonard's ""The Switch"" from a shopping mall. Many of his previous films did use the oft touted ""magpie technique"" of borrowing. Ringo Lam's City of Fire has often been brought up in conversation against Reservoir Dogs and the ""Butch"" segment of Pulp Fiction was a reworked version of Roger (Killing Zoe) Avary's ""Pandemonium Reigned"". Yet this was a fully-fledged adaptation, Miramax having bought him the rights to four Leonard novels in 1995. (The other three being Killshot, Bandits and Freaky Deaky. Quentin's original plan was to make Killshot, starring himself, Bruce Willis and Holly Hunter).<br/><br/>Of course, many don't appreciate a film that has in it's range Robert DeNiro, yet underuses him, and Samuel L. Jackson, who is given plenty to say, but nothing as incendiary as Ezekiel 25:17. There is only one time-break, where a single scene is played out three times in the same bracket, and only one kitsch moment, where an animated plane is used to paper the gaps in a $5 million-higher-than-Pulp-Fiction-but-still-very-low $13 million budget. Violence is almost non-existent by Q's standards, and the subjects discussed range not from burger bars to the Fantastic Four but the fear of ageing and the Delphonics. Top of the bill is a long-term idol of Quentin's, Pam Grier, who is even name-checked in Reservoir Dogs. It's an altogether more relaxed, more controlled film, and in many ways the writing is stronger. The easy option of a sketch-style format for his script is discarded, making it, in a sense, a better film. Yet people claim it to be worse. Strange. A genuinely touching romance at times, the only comment this one got was ""it's nothing compared to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction"". Quentin, it seems, is a victim of his own success.<br/><br/>And so it is that we now await his fourth writer/director vehicle, another Leonard piece, ""40 Lashes"". Fingers are crossed that it will a superb return to form, though maybe it doesn't really matter. Even if Quentin's time were over, he would still have achieved a wide-scale revitalisation of American cinema. However, it would be fortunate if 40 Lashes did live up to its promise, if only to put the ghosts of Tarantino failures to rest. But that's another story. The time"

","Quentin Tarantino made a promising debut with Reservoir Dogs. His 2nd film, Pulp Fiction is simply amazing. His next film, Jackie Brown is another great effort from this gifted film maker. If you see this movie with an open mind and don't expect it to be another Pulp Fiction, you will enjoy it. It's not as fast-paced as Pulp and with alot less violence and profanity, but is a very entertaining film.<br/><br/>Jackie Brown marks the first time Tarantino has adapted someone else's work. In this case, Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch. Leonard's books, like Stephen King's and Michael Crichton's, translate very nicely to the big screen. The book was great and Tarantino follows it pretty closely. The one major change is white Jackie Burke becomes black Jackie Brown. This happens so he could cast Pam Grier in the lead role. She is terrific in this. Robert Forster, another 70's star rescued from oblivion is very good, too. They join John Travolta as actors whose careers have been revived thanks to Mr. Tarantino. <br/><br/>Robert DeNiro, Bridget Fonda and Michael Keaton are good in small roles unlike any I've seen them play before. Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as always. Jackie Brown is a very enjoyable movie with an awesome soundtrack. It is not an original Tarantino story and is unlike either of his first 2 movies, but is alot of fun. Tarantino comes through again. I'm looking forward to seeing more films from him in the future."

","I was put off going to see Jackie Brown in the cinema when it was released. Reading through the lines of the reviews discouraged me.<br/><br/>The critics were damning it with faint praise: terms like ""Tarantino has matured"", etc. abounded. They appeared to be hedging their bets: it wasn't quite as good as its predecessors, but then maybe it was a grower and we don't want to have to be revising our opinions. It sounded to me like those situations when you've been invited to a dinner and you know your hosts have worked long and hard to produce a quality meal and you never like to say the meal tasted lousy so you allow your tongue to contradict your taste buds.<br/><br/>Having finally got to see it recently, by virtue of a special offer at my local video store, I would not hesitate to give it an unreserved thumbs up. And I would go farther and state unhesitatingly that it is by far the best screen dramatisation of an Elmore Leonard novel.<br/><br/>There was a time in the 1980's when I devoured Elmore Leonard novels.<br/><br/>I loved the combination of wonderfully offbeat characters and violence and comedy which he devised and while he may not be hardbitten enough to compare with the classic hard-bitten stories of Chandler, Hammett, and Cain, I don't believe he ever tried to and he succeeded on his own merits.<br/><br/>But I had begun to despair of them ever being translated properly to the screen (I am not considering his western stories as I am not a fan of western novels, I couldn't comment). Mr. Majestyk seemed more a case of ""melon farmer does Death Wish""; a TV version of Glitz was antiseptic; Get Shorty was unfortunately less than the sum of its parts and it did suffer from  the handicap of having John Travolta playing the lead role of John Travolta. Yes, the later Out of Sight was stylish and George Clooney did seem to be finding his niche but Steve McQueen had played the best version of The Thomas Crown Affair.<br/><br/>No, Tarantino has done it and perhaps it means he did find time to read books in between bouts of movie-watching. <br/><br/>The story of the washed-up no-hope airline stewardess somehow finding it in her, with the help of a lonely and chivalrous bail bondsman, to outwit both the cops and her violent part-time drug-dealing boss for an unexpected pension bonus is certainly one to appeal to all of us who likes to see the underdog triumph, but it is done with such panache and perfect pacing that you don't feel the 150 minutes or so of screen time pass. And, in fact, you don't want it to end.<br/><br/>And the performances. Robert Forster as the bail-bondsman plays the classic Leonard hero to perfection and Pam Grier is not far behind. (I had certainly recalled Pam Grier from the blaxploitation era and, in view of the long interval, hadn't expected her to be this good.And my one memory of Forster was in Haskell Wexler's ""Medium Cool"" which he had helped make special but I hadn't recalled much of him since then  and this performance certainly topped that. There were many complaints about the De Niro performance and certainly his character was no Travis Bickle. And the role certainly didn't call for one of the top screen actors of his generation. But this was another typical Leonard character: the indolent half-wit who suddenly remembers how he got to where he was: he was, after all, a violent hard-bitten career criminal who is, albeit at unexpected times, required to practice his craft and show how he came to be a violent hard-bitten career criminal. And he did so. Unexpectedly.<br/><br/>You can forgive Tarantino his little indulgences: Samuel L. Jackson's character wasn't too far removed from his role in Pulp Fiction ; the language was a little bit over the top. But while the video clips at the beginning weren't out of the Leonard textbook, they were refreshing and funny (although I'm sure the PC lobby didn't think so). And what a soundtrack! (I was reminded of what an impression the Brothers Johnson sublime ""Strawberry Letter 23 made on me the first time I heard it).<br/><br/>I would like to think I'll never tire of watching this one. And I would put it above both its predecessors, which is certainly no bad thing.<br/><br/>So what if Tarantino has matured. We all grow older and wiser. 10 out of 10 (or can this one also go up to 11?) Give that man a Guinness!"
