"emily37","9","92","112","27 August 2003"," a good teen movie that shows how bad today's teen movies have gotten
","with the recent release of the special edition dvd of this film, i'd suggest you go watch it.  yeah, this movie is a light, fluffy gen-x teen movie with its music video moments.  however, what was eight years ago just a normal teen movie has gained some semblance of social relevance --  compared to today's teen movies, this film can be seen as some sort of masterpiece. <br/><br/>
for one thing, you never see films anymore where teens are actually fighting for something except for a date to the prom.  the characters in empire records, yes, are submerged in their overdramatic romantic escapades, but their main prerogative in the film is to prevent a large corporation from buying out their independent record store.  are there films that spark that kind of activist spirit in middle- and high- schoolers today?  no.  we're going backwards.  <br/><br/>also, the humor in this film offers up some absurdist wit, which you never find in teen movies now.  a kid glues some quarters to the floor so he can laugh at the poor saps who later try desperately to pick them up.  a shoplifting teenager gives the fake name of 'warren beatty'.  do kids today even know who warren beatty is?  i doubt it.<br/><br/>this film was made in 1995, right before many of the laws allowing corporations to buy and control multiple media outlets were passed.  the years since '96 have shown us a homogenization of music and movies, especially in the teen sphere, and it is turning today's teens into a bunch of celebrity-obsessed idiots. <br/><br/>compared to your sons and daughters, the kids in empire records can be now seen as role models."
"Taggarttrains","Null","65","78","19 December 2001"," See it twice to appreciate it.....you'll be lukewarm the first time and love it the second time.
","I love this movie.  This movie is the kind of movie I watch movies for (um....did you follow that?).  I would make one suggestion, however....watch it twice before you decide if you like it or not.  If you're like me you'll probably be lukewarm the first time you see it but like it more each time you see it after that.<br/><br/>The reason for seeing it twice is because the film's strong points become more evident the second (and beyond) time around.  Each character is well-defined, with individual traits and idiosynchracies, but this can be lost the first time through because you're trying to follow the story. There is a very strong soundtrack for the movie, but you appreciate it more the second time through, because you better understand how the music applies to the scene.  The actors have great chemistry and the character interactions are great.  The movie never takes itself very seriously and it's just a lot of fun to watch.  You'll find yourself rewinding it to see certain scenes again and again.<br/><br/>I grant you the movie will never win any Academy nominations.  The plot is simplistic and the ""neat"" ending (all problems solved perfectly in just one day) is unrealistic (not that this bothered me....I personally loved the ending....if I want ""reality"" I'll watch the evening news).  Also, trying to follow the storyline tends to take away from the character interaction the first time you see it; hence, the suggestion to see it at least twice.  I actually didn't care for it the first time I saw it because I was looking at it strictly story-wise.  The second time I saw it I concentrated on the characters and the dialogue(which I loved), and that's when I realized the appeal.  If you're into serious movies that reflect real life and real suffering, you'll probably want to pass on this one.  However, if you watch movies to have fun and laugh, watch this one.  Also, if you like music- especially a moderately wide variety- you'll enjoy it.  It's worth your time, but save the beer for the second viewing.  ""Sugarhigh"" is awesome- Well done, Gina!  Hot voice....  Oh, and Damn the Man!  9 out of 10."
"po5mrk","10","60","83","11 August 2001"," Perfect...Well, not quite Perfect
","For me, Empire Records is a very conflicting movie.  On the one hand, it's hysterically funny.  On the other hand, it attempts to make great revelations about America's youth.  Somehow, though, it all works!  Sure, there are some ""sappy"" predictable parts that you're not sure whether to laugh or cry at, but the timing of these scenes is fantastic.  One thing that really struck me about this film is the amazing use of music.  Certain songs can be heard repeatedly throughout the movie which really help to distinguish parallel story lines.  All in all, I think it's great."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","20","25","2 May 2011"," I do not regret the things I've done, but those I did not do.
","Empire Records is directed by Allan Moyle and written by Carol Heikkinen. It stars, Anthony LaPaglia, Maxwell Caulfield, Debi Mazar, Johnny Whitworth, Liv Tyler, Renée Zellweger, Rory Cochrane, Robin Tunney & Ethan Embry. Plot centre's on one day at independent record store Empire Records. With the store under imminent threat of a take over by a corporate chain, this is no ordinary day. For on the day that the store will be visited by a fading pop star, they are forced to confront their personal issues, and maybe, just maybe, learn something about the people they work with.<br/><br/>The film was a box office failure and was met with mostly negative reviews from the professional critics. Coming as it does from the director of critical/cult darling Pump Up the Volume, many were expecting a better and more hard edged picture than what they got. It also had to compete with certain 80's favourites brought to the cinematic world by John Hughes. While coming fast on the heels of the immensely popular Clerks (94) didn't help its cause either. Was it a case of bad timing? Is the film really just poor? And or, as mooted at the time: a career killer for those involved? Personally I think it's a film that needs revisiting now some 15 odd years after its release. In fact time has actually been kind to it and it now appears to have a good solid cult following. So unless you are judging it against the superior, record shop set, High Fidelity, you may find it's a film that's hard to dislike.<br/><br/>Some of the complaints against it are fair, with the main one about it not having fully developed characters being as true as day is a day. While calling it one long stitched together music video has some substance when taking it at face value. Yet what is there is worthy of a second glance, they are interesting characters, and their respective hang-ups and pressures are evident enough for us to hang our hats on; even if it's set up to be accompanied by still more hipster indie rock music. There's also been much guff written about the film as regards calling it a teen angst film. Yes it is, but have these reviewers forgotten about the adults in the movie? LaPaglia's store owner, the father figure, trying to remain cool as his charges come under threat. Or Mazar, needing a wake up call from her job/career ignorance; and the big one, the delightful Caulfield (splendid bit of casting) as fading pop singer Rex Manning, imposter? Indeed. It's all relative as to why Empire Records deserves more than a once only viewing. As for the music, it does indeed rock, with each track carefully selected to be at one with the scene it accompanies. My favourite? AC/DC-If You Want Blood, a ball busting track for a vibrant and kicking scene.<br/><br/>As for it being a career killing movie? The ladies of the piece have done rather well for themselves, Zellweger, Tunney and Tyler have made their marks in the industry, while Mazar has never been without work prior or post Empire Records. The guys haven't hit the heights of Zellweger and Tyler, which in the case of the excellent Rory Cochrane is not only a surprise, but also sad. Cochrane's Lucas is the key character and the glue in the middle of it all, always on hand with a dry quip or some philosophy, he's also supremely cool. Cochrane can be seen in serious mode leading 2006 thriller Right at Your Door. LaPaglia has always worked since 95, playing a number of different supporting characters, and Embry has appeared in big release's such as Vacancy and Eagle Eye. Caulfield has turned into the go to guy for TV shows and Whitworth, who quit acting for a while, pops up from time to time in minor roles such as in 3:10 To Yuma and The Rainmaker. So, not a career killer then.<br/><br/>Stick it to the Man, Baby, Empire Records is a vibrant and funny movie. 7.5/10"
"AvidClimber","7","8","9","6 February 2013"," Empire Records — Mostly marginal kids working in a record shop as solace
","Empire Records is funny and slightly offbeat teen movie. A well built one, which each quirky character having a well defined personality, a set of problems, and realistic interactions with each other. Their personas all ring solidly true, each with deep emotional affects. However, not everybody will see themselves represented here, it is but a thin slice of society.<br/><br/>The music is good, the dialogs are interesting just like the story, and it keeps an overall positive tone, although it does talk about some serious issues. It touches each subjects lightly, and keep the focus on the what is happening, on the development of the situation.<br/><br/>You will be entertained, if you're looking for a good adolescent flick."
"mifamily6","10","54","83","1 March 2004"," One of my modern favorites. Wait... THE favorite.
","This movie is awesome.  The best thing is the music.  Excellent.  It's the greatest collection of songs put into a movie.  Even better than Pulp Fiction.  There should be a BEST COMPILATION Oscar given to a music supervisor.  That's hard but in this kick-ass movie, it seems so effortless. The acting is also top-notch.  Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler, Anthony LaPaglia, Robin Tunney, Johnny Whitworth, Max Caulfield, Debi Mazur, and Rory Cochrane, one of the coolest people alive.  The script is really good. Directing, also good.  Everything was pretty invisible, and I absolutely mean that in a positive way.  Just like in the old days, when it was invisible, they put you in the movie.  I felt like I was with these characters the whole way.  The new ""Remix!  Special Fan Edition"" is probably better.  I can't decide.  They're both superb.<br/><br/>10/10"
"lilcutie18613","9","27","39","27 July 2005"," Empire Records
","This movie follows the stories of many people who work at Empire Records, a music store on the brink of closing. All the characters are memorable, even the boy who steals a CD and is caught and hit by the door of a car. The drama, comedy, and music work well together all around.<br/><br/>Liv Tyler really impressed me in her role. She was very convincing as an intelligent young lady on her way to Harvard. All the actors were great in their roles and I can't imagine anyone else taking their places. And the soundtrack is AWESOME!!!!! :) All-in-all a cute film that you can watch again and again."
"Johnny_Depp_Forever","8","31","46","7 July 2003"," Great movie, a sign of it's time
","I love this movie very much. I don't own a lot of movies but this is one that I do. Like any film, it has it's problems but in general it is great. The film was well casted, each actor fit and made the best of his or her role. Maxwell Caulfield played Rex Manning, the character you love to hate. Anthony LaPaglia played Joe who was one of the best managers that you could work for. The actor's attitude toward his role was very well displayed. Rory Cochrane played Lucas, who is my favorite character in this movie. Then there is Johnny Whitworth, now everybody sort of disinclueds him or doesn't like him but I think that he did a good job as AJ, I could not see anyone else there, maybe someone could have done a better job but he did well. The rest of the cast was fantastic. The plot of the film was a little non existent, it's more like a series of events that just go one after the other with no really flow. Anyways, take the movie for what it is: teenagers working at a record store, dealing with life issues with good music playing in the background. This is a great film."

","I had heard a lot about this movie, that it was one of those really great but under-appreciated 90's movies, so I decided to watch it. It is now one of my favorite movies and I'm really glad that I saw it. Every actor does a great job - they make you feel like you've known them forever and you really go through the troubles that they are going through. I especially liked Ethan Embry as Mark and Johnny Whitworth as A.J. I was really surprised with how well Liv Tyler acted the part. The characters themselves are really relate able, and made me want to work at that store so badly. Also, it had one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard. I loved how they incorporated the music into each scene - it was part of what was going on, not just background noise. Overall, this was a really great movie - ***** out of 5."

","i dunno. theres just something about this movie.<br/><br/>yeh, in actuality, its probably dreck. its probably worthless and people probably wont remember its years and years from now when they start making out the lists of '90s movies that changed the sphere of moviemaking.<br/><br/>so what?<br/><br/>for me, this movie really does capture the feel of the mid-'90s. i was like these people once. i wore an outfit scarily like the one liv tyler sports (although without the hideous unders combo, im sure), i knew people like every one of the 'archetypes' from the movie and i really, really wanted to work in a record store. hasnt everybody? and doesnt everybody want there to be a cool record store like this in their town?<br/><br/>i guess for me it is a nostalgia thing, but i watched it (again) the other night with my boyfriend, and we both still laughed during the funny parts and cuddled during the sweet parts and, well, danced during the dance parts.<br/><br/>
its just fun to look back on such a 'time-period' movie like that ... the clothes, the attitudes, the music even ... how good is it to hear the gin blossoms again, eh?<br/><br/>im sure many would disagree, but for someone who was right there when it was all happening, so to say, its a gentle reminder of the days before mtv committed suicide, before liv tyler started making 'real' movies, and when phrases like 'whats with Today, today?' could travel through a junior high faster than mono."

Wow. I'm glad I watched this movie, because I can relate to it more now. My work, lucky enough, is a lot like this movie. We're all close friends and have fun. But I'd like to work at Empire Records, they can actually dance in the store! :D The acting was fun and enjoyable and the story is a hoot. I would recommend Empire records for a watch.

"jonstevens4","10","6","9","20 January 2007"," How this became my favorite movie ever...
","Way back in 1997, at the young age of 17, I wandered into my local Hollywood Video store with the family, looking for a comedy to get me through the night.<br/><br/>At the time, I had been trying to get a job at one of the music shops in the mall (for the record, I never got one there). So when I stumbled upon this movie I had never heard of I thought it might be worth the $1.99 I'd pay for it. So I take it home and it became a favorite, but not my favorite.<br/><br/>Fast forward to a year later and I decide to move from Virginia to Alabama to be with my girlfriend who I met online. That weekend after moving my stuff into her apartment all we wanted to do was cuddle (as we haven't seen each other in months). We decided to watch a couple of movies. I started digging in my movies and she started digging in hers. We turned to each other and low and behold, we both were holding our copies of Empire Records. It was pretty hilarious at the time and the taste in movies sealed the deal on our relationship... We've been together nine years next month and have a four year old daughter together.<br/><br/>But the love for 'Empire' doesn't end there.<br/><br/>After moving to Alabama, I got a job at a movie theater. One of my co-workers there also held a second job at a movie rental store. He is the master of movie knowledge and he became one of my best friends. One day I started telling him about this movie. He had never even heard of it (this was in 2001 mind you). He said he wanted to see it so I brought it over and we watched it. He instantly named it his favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>From that point forward, we couldn't work together a day without cracking jokes by referencing lines from this movie. Every day, at that place, was Rex Manning Day!"

"callanvass","9","5","10","1 January 2005"," GREAT movie that i enjoyed VERY much!
","GREAT movie that is very enjoyable with lots of likable characters and a cool plot!. I actually liked Liv Tyler a lot in this because normally i am not a fan at all, but she was excellent here. It's an excellent blend of Comedy and Drama, with a bit of romance thrown into the mix. I was expecting this to be a very good movie and i wasn't disappointed, and i loved the shop lifting scene between Warren and Lucas. The direction was excellent Allan Moyle did a terrific job he kept the film at a very good pace and not allowing a dull moment. The acting was great. Anthony LaPaglia did a terrific job here , he was very likable had decent chemistry with Debi Mazar and i loved the hairdo!. Maxwell Caufield did his job but he acted with his hair and i hated his character. Debi Mazar did what she had to do well but didn't have to do much. Rory Cochrane was EXCELLENT here, he played a bit of a weasel but he was extremely likable and was my favorite character here, and even if he did lose $9000 dollars to Atlantic City he still rocked!. Johnny Witworth was very good as A.J and had decent chemistry with Liv and was pretty likable. Robin Tunney was excellent here and was pretty likable and her shaved head was pretty funny!. Renee Zellweger was GREAT here and is GORGEOUS! ,good to see her in any movie. Liv Tyler was VERY good here , and quite beautiful, as i said normally not a fan but she was great here. Ethan Embry was Goofy but likable. and Richard Sexton III annoyed me and made me laugh at the same time. Overall give this a shot a must see! ****1/2 out of 5"

This movie is definently not for everyone and I can understand why it's not getting a lot of good reviews. If you enjoy quirky teen comedies with a nice soundtrack give it a try."
"BandSAboutMovies","7","1","1","29 May 2019"," A failure at first
","Empire Records may not be a musical, but without music, it wouldn't really have much of a story, would it? It does fit into the main prerequisite for this week: it was a total bomb on release before finding an audience that was ready for it years after it was actually made. This coming of age and battle against the corporation film may have just been too much for 1995, but in 2019? It fits right in.<br/><br/>Writer Carol Heikkinen supposedly worked at a Tower Records store (IMDB claims that it was store #166 at Phoenix's Christown Mall) and used tons of stories that she had experienced while working there.<br/><br/>This is the story of 24 hours in the life of Delaware's Empire Records, an independent music store. It starts when Joe (Anthony LaPaglia, The Client, Annabelle: Creation), the store manager, allows Lucas (Rory Cochrane, Dazed and Confused) to close the store alone for the first time.<br/><br/>That's when he learns that Music Town, a national entertainment big box store, is buying Empire Records. To keep its spirit of independence alive, he takes all $9,000 from that day's sales and sets out to quadruple it in Atlantic City. Sure, he doubles it, but Lucas' luck could never hold out.<br/><br/>The next morning, a decimated Luchas is found by A.J. (Johnny Whitworth, who ended up being Blackout in Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance before anyone cared about superhero movies) and Mark (Ethan Embry, Pete on Sneaky Pete). He tells the two of them of his plight as they try to keep him away from Joe, who is looking for the missing deposit once the bank and the actual owner call.<br/><br/>The real heart of Empire Records lies within the kids that work there, like Corey (Liv Tyler), Gina (an impossibly young Renée Zellweger), the suicidal and soon-to-be bald Deb (Robin Tunney, The Craft) and her hanger-on boyfriend Berko (Coyote Shivers, who was married to Liv Tyler's mom at the time, former groupie Bebe Buell).<br/><br/>The truth of it all is that Joe had wanted to become co-owner all along and had hoped to use that $9,000 to make it happen, keeping the store independent. Meanwhile, all hell is breaking loose because the store is dealing with Rex Manning Day.<br/><br/>Yes, former 80's pop star Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield) is coming to the store, which has a line of older women and gay men ready to greet him. The store employees and even Rex's assistant (Debi Mazar, who continually wins me over in small roles) openly hate the singer, but Corey has been planning to give him her virginity. He blows her off and ends up sleeping with her best friend, Gina, as all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>So much of Empire Records really does hold true to the hijinks ensue manifesto. It's an episodic account of this one big day in the heart of a record store, complete with shoplifters being converted into employees, a mock funeral for Deb to cheer her up, an all-night benefit to ""Save the Empire"" and love winning against all costs. Oh yeah and Gwar shows up.<br/><br/>It's amazing that this movie even made it on the screen, as it was severely edited in post-production, with three significant characters and 40 minutes of footage ending up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Reviewers said things like the movie was a ""soundtrack in search of a movie,"" ""deserved a bullet to put it out of its misery"" and it was a ""lost cause."" That said - the soundtrack album peaked at #63 on the Billboard charts and The Gin Blossoms' ""Til I Hear It From You"" and Edwyn Collins' ""A Girl Like You"" made it into the top 40.<br/><br/>Today, a film that only made $300,000 on initial release plays revival houses and has enjoyed several home video re-releases. April 8th has now become Rex Manning Day to so many people now.<br/><br/>Sadly, this movie may not mean much to kids today, as music stores have disappeared. Yes. even the big stores like Music Town."

Even Roger Ebert agrees with this .GWAR had a similar part in another absolutely terrible movie called Blind Date , also the only good part of that movie . I cant believe the one guy is the the same guy who played Slater ""catch ya later"" in dazed and confused . He was so cool in that movie and so uncool in empire retards , i mean empire records . Please do people really think life is like this movie ? Is'nt that what its going for ? I've never worked in a record store but i've seen High Fidelity enough times to know it's not like this , and the difference between a good movie and a bbbbaaaaadddd one ."

","This film started off annoying the hell out of me but ended up as a total delight. Here we have several very mixed up kids full of angst and various problems making life miserable for a record store manager....and, at times, each other. Good comedy; the kids, with their crazy cutting up and, at times, profound thoughts, kept me completely entertained throughout. 4 stars."
"gavin6942","6","3","6","3 August 2007"," One Day in A Record Store With Those Kids...
","An employee steals the money from a record store's vault, with the hopes of gambling with it in Atlantic City and making it big. He fails, and the next day the store must face the reality: without the money, they will be turned into one of many chain stores where the more laid back approach to selling music just doesn't slide with those in charge. Also, this day features a visit from washed-up pop star Rex Manning.<br/><br/>Directed by the writer and director of ""Pump Up The Volume"", this film simply is not as good as ""Pump Up The Volume"". And, sadly, it's also not the best movie about people hanging out in a record store -- ""High Fidelity"" is a better contender in that category. What this film does excel at is showing a store with way too many employees who do nothing (how can they possibly afford to pay these slackers) and really encapsulating what it was like to live circa 1995 (probably as much or even more so than ""Reality Bites"").<br/><br/>That is really the only selling point for this film for me. Reminding me of 1995, when music like the Gin Blossoms was cool and people dressed like they were trying to escape the 1980s but didn't know how (and ended up turning to flannel for help). Sure, we have Robin Tunney (""The Craft"") and a young Liv Tyler... even Renee Zellweger. All fine actresses, but nothing worth seeing the film for if that's all you want to see.<br/><br/>There's nothing new about the idea of trying to get a store saved from going under (or a school, or a radio station -- see ""UHF""). What makes this movie different is that the characters are just, well, weird. They sit around, don't do a lot of work, wander off for no reason, and nobody cares. The store could run more effectively with fewer employees, and the film would probably be tighter if one character was dropped (maybe Ethan Embry).<br/><br/>Warren was by far the most entertaining part of the film for me. His hoodlum antics just made me very amused, and without him this would have been a highly dull film. Do I care about a girl's depression (which is never really explored or resolved) or another girl's acceptance to Harvard (which is barely covered) or a pill addiction (which is dealt with so minorly)? No. I am never given a reason to give half a fig. Each character is so shallow that their shallowness is almost deep in its presentation.<br/><br/>If you need a flashback to 1995, this is a film for you. The music obviously plays a large role in this movie, and the styles will be familiar. But as far as being an outstanding film or a cultural achievement or even a cult classic, I guess I just don't see it. All the hype this film had or has circling around it don't amount to much. But, hype is like that -- almost never delivering on its promises."

","If you're looking for plot, serviceable acting, continuity, and general viewing satisfaction, you would be better off renting a copy of ""The Garbage Pail Kids Movie."" Poor Anthony LaPaglia. He is a fine actor and does not deserve to have any affiliation to this crap. The only explanation is that he agreed to star in this film to pay off drug and/or gambling debts. Either that or the producers have some seriously compromising pictures of him. Everybody involved in the making of Empire Records should spend the rest of their careers writing apology letters to every sucker (of which I am one) who had the misfortune of viewing such amateurish tripe. To anyone who actually enjoyed this ""film"", I pity you - seriously."

People who see it after about 1996 won't like it due to the fact that most of the music in the movie A)  Is terrible and B) has disappeared with the rest of the crap that was in the mid-90s music genre.<br/><br/>Many problems go unresolved in this movie, dialogue is forced, and everything is very unimaginable.

","One of the three worst movies I have ever seen, right there with ""Pushing Tin"" and ""Batman and Robin."" The completely unbelievable, highly annoying, and one-dimensional characters in this movie were the victims of some of the worst character development I have ever seen. Their interaction and dialogue was completely unrealistic, and their parts seemed so blatantly stereotypical. It was one of those movies I would have thought was cool in 8th grade, when I had no idea what a good movie, or even reality for that matter, was like. However, maturity makes this movie get worse and worse from a viewer's standpoint. A decent soundtrack is not enough to justify seeing this movie - I think I would have been better off spending my 2 hours doing just about anything other than seeing Empire Records."

Very young Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger show some skin and look good doing so, but that's pretty much the only highlight. Whoever chose the soundtrack for this needs to be deafened for the good of all mankind - for a store that's supposed to be all about the anti-establishment, it's got very bland, mainstream tastes."

","As one critic bluntly says, in one day everything that can possibly happen to the characters does, and everyone comes out better at the end. Truly this doesn't happen in real life, but in REEL life we call it entertainment. I enjoyed it as a quirky comedy. I probably would not have been so entertained if it didn't have some of my favorite stars, some before they hit it big -- Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler, Debi Mazar, and Anthony LaPaglia. I was not familiar with Rory Cochrane, but his character Lucas was one of the best here.<br/><br/>So, what's the story? LaPaglia is the manager of this Eastern US record store, Empire Records which has been in business since 1959, the sign tells us. On this fateful day employee Lucas is asked to close the store at midnight, and count all the money, twice. He does, and also observes that plans are in place to sell the business and convert it into a rather dull record store. So, he does what any good employee would do. Instead of putting the $9Thousand in the safe, he gets on his motorcycle and heads to Atlantic City with it! That begins a rather hectic 24 hours, involving all the employees of Empire Records.<br/><br/>Nothing Earth-shaking, just a fun movie to watch.<br/><br/>May 2020 edit: I watched it again and came away with much the same opinions. I found it especially interesting to see Zellweger right before she started her climb with the role in Jerry Maguire a year later. And now she is a fresh Oscar winner, Best Actress as Judy Garland. You can see that she was always exceptional."

","The script is very light, and the characters are pretty stereotypical, but the feel is here, and some parts (musical interludes) are really good. No real complaints about the acting. The cast was mostly youngsters, so it didn't bother me. Like a teen version of Clerks, with the same offbeat ness, only it's not Clerks (hah!). And for once, the romantic aspect didn't take over the main plot. Only to be remembered at the end. I don't see the Breakfast Club parallel other users seem to find in the storyline. They are more or less friends and are already used to be amongst each other. So where is this coming from?... The movie aged a lot, and has MTV generation written all over. But it's a cool little time capsule of 90s music, fashion and even pop culture. Also, known actors made their debut there. So why not checking it out?"

This review is for both the Superior theatrical version and the interesting but flawed extended version. It centers on a group of employees whom deal with a variety of issues while working at a record store that's on the verge of closing. All the characters are quirky and wonderfully likable Renee Zellweger, Robin Tunney and Liv Tyler being the standouts. It's easy to see why the extended stuff was cut and the impact of some of the films best scenes are lessened including the amazing finale. I would highly reccomend just skipping the extended version and just sticking with the best cut. As it stands it's a love letter to the changing music scene as well as youth in general.

For example, the owner is supposed to be (we are told) a big jerk, but he never does anything jerky and in fact is nice enough to let Joe run the store however he wants.

","This film would have been a whole lot better if every character in it wasn't a caricature. Store clerk Mark (Ethan Embry) and shoplifter Warren (Brendan Sexton III) were the worst. There might be teens that clueless and arrogant respectively, but in this film, they were just plain annoying. And the record shop manager Joe Reaves (Anthony LaPaglia) spent an awful lot of time deliberating over what he'd do about the missing nine grand. Seemed pretty simple to me, but in keeping with the one big happy family concept, he presided over the madness going on with the serenity of a Buddhist monk. Maybe I'm just a little too far removed from the target audience for this picture but it did nothing for me. The story was fairly predictable about how the missing money would be replaced, while the teen angst aspect of all the employees wound up pretty much resolved by the time the closing credits rolled. Not very comparable to real life, but I guess the picture had it's time and place, which is to say, it's a good thing the Nineties are over."

","Empire Records is one of my all time favorite films. I watched it as a young teenager and I related to it quite a bit. There were some pretty funny comedic moments in the film and the music of the soundtrack gave a unique vibe to the movie. The best part about this film is that I am still able to watch it as an adult and I still enjoy the film as well as the music.<br/><br/>The theme of Empire Records is the struggle of man against the greed of the corporate machine. Empire Records is an independent music store that is very lax with its employees, offers many different genres of music, and in general offers a very artistic environment for its customers. The owners of Empire wish to sell out and make Empire into a chain store. Joe, played by Anthony Lapaglia, is the store manager who takes an employee named Lucas, played by Rory Cochrane, under his wing. Together with the other misfits that work at Empire, they try to figure out a plan to save Empire from turning into a dreaded Music Town while dealing with their own personal problems on one very eventful day at the store.<br/><br/>Other important issues that are addressed in this film include depression, Debra (played by Robin Tunney) cuts all of her hair off and tries to slit her wrist, drug addiction, Corey (played by Liv Tyler) is the perfect student who occasionally takes speed to help her stay awake to study, and risky sexual behavior, Gina (played by Renee Zellweger) thinks she will feel better about herself and find love by sleeping around.<br/><br/>Two techniques used in this movie to demonstrate the theme were sound and lighting. The soundtrack of the film is very diverse and alternative which can be compared to the environment of Empire Records. Empire is not your typical music store and the music they play there is not always the most well known. The lighting of Empire can be considered dim and a little hazy at times, which compared to the harsh fluorescent lighting found at a chain store, gives Empire Records an even more unique feel. <br/><br/>Another film that can be compared to Empire Records based on a similar theme is Office Space. In Office Space the employees (all from different walks of life) of a company are also trying to fight the corporate greed of their boss. Office Space is another one of my favorite movies. I think the reason I relate to these movies so much is because all of these employees band together to do something I probably never could, fight the greed of the corporate machine."

But the characters themselves, and the way they were written. So many of them are initially annoying and of-putting, that I almost was dead-set on disliking them from the start. <br/><br/>As the movie went on, that slowly began to change. I started to see a bit more of the humans beneath these initially shallow characters. It's only deep in a Breakfast Club kind of way, so don't expect a deep study on the human condition. If you can't stomach the characters, you haven't missed very much. But, if you can, there's a mildly interesting (but throughly frivolous) tale to be seen. <br/><br/>Plus, you get to see Renée Zellweger actually looking semi-attractive.

We have to thank the movie for capturing the fun and delight of record stores that existed from the 1960's to the 90's. While none of them was as exciting as Empire Records, they were wonderful places where music fans could meet and enjoy the relaxed atmosphere, and who didn't light up when the man behind the counter put on some great music track that everybody started dancing or swaying to.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Barnes and Nobles is the closest thing we have today to an Empire Records store.<br/><br/>Still, I say, along with 100 million other fans, lets have an Empire Records Two, Mr. Moyle."

My favorite character is Deb, played by Robin Tunny. She shaves all her hair off like G.I. Jane to prove a point. She hates her life and wants to kill herself. Then you have Rene Z who is gorgeous in her youth in this film. She plays Liv Tyler's nymphomaniac friend. Then there is a couple other characters along with the cool boss Joe. The main plot of this story is about Lucas, assistant manager wanting to save the store from being bought out by Mega Mart or whatever cheesy corporate company wants to buy out Empire Records. So he takes all the closing money from Empire one night when he works and gets on his bike and goes to Atlantic city in hopes of making a lot of money so he can save the store. This movie is highly cheesy but a good teen flick with not too much inappropriate content for the youngsters. It also has an amazing soundtrack with, The Cranberries, Better Than Ezra, Cracker, Toad The Wet Sprocket and more!"

","I was first introduced to this film by my older sister about 6 years ago. At the time I thought ""this is rubbish"" as I was only 13 years old but as the years went by I thought ""Pure Genius"". It's not your typical magical film full of effects and an all star cast but it has everything a film needs to grasp an audience especially for the 90's - sex, drugs and rock and roll. As a teenager myself, not for long though, it has that typical storyline of drama and romance spiralling out of control then suddenly fulfilling the audiences expectations of a happy ending. However it does tackle honest issues for youth then and today of drugs, exams, parental pressure, boys, girls, jobs and more importantly life. It hits those pivotal issues that none of us want to face unless watching it in a film and I must admit after i watched it a few times I felt understood. As corny as it sounds its true. Even with the scene where Mark eats the brownies and thinks hes being eaten by a character from the TV - classic. I've had more than a few friends who have suffered from similar hallucinations which generally is funny for both them and everyone watching.<br/><br/>Empire records will always be a classic of teenage life for me and I will never forget it for that!!! Genius!!!"

","Ever wonder where the cool slackers hang out and what they do on a daily basis. Well, here is the 1995 version of that. This comedy / drama is easily the best of it's kind. This ranks up there with ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Chasing Amy"" as the best slacker movies of all time, even though all three are from the same decade. Maybe it's because the 90's was the decade of the slacker.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, before digital downloading dominated the music scene, cool kids hung out at record stores. In this film a talented cast plays a variety of these cool kids (and adults). Liv Tyler plays the pretty and popular brainiac who is headed to Harvard. Renee Zelweger is the sultry teenaged seductress. Johnny Whitworth is the artist who is afraid to do anything with his talent. The amazing Rory Cochrane is the 'James Dean' type who is sort of the mystical center of the movie. Robin Tunney gives a haunted performance of a troubled, suicidal teen. Rounding out the rest of the teen cast, there are also two boys who worship rock & roll as well as a wanna-be guitarist.<br/><br/>The adult cast is just as amazing as the younger actors, though outnumbered. Joe Mantegna plays 'Joe', the ex-musician and current record store manager who knows that he was meant for bigger and better things. Zoe Deschanel is the manager of a washed up pop star who is attempting a comeback. She shares Joe's views of her life. And Maxwell Caulfield is 'Rex Manning', the aforementioned pop star. He is perhaps the most underrated actor in the film. He plays ""Sexy Rexy"" with a cheesy self assurance that is masking the fact that Rex knows that his sex symbol days are well behind him.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is pretty thin. The owner of the record store plans to sell the store to a franchise that promises to rid the store and it's employees of any individuality. But that's okay, because the movie isn't really plot driven. It's a character study about the young and the young at heart hiding their true ambitions and selves behind false facades while they wile away their days hanging out at the record store.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a well written movie about characters that are well worth rooting for. It also boasts a great soundtrack of rock and alternative music that helps add to the fun atmosphere."

","It's safe to say I love this movie. Anyone who works with high school or college students (or those of that age group) must watch this film. It proves that life is never dull or meaningless if you're surrounded by people who really care about you, even if those people are your fellow tattooed, gum-chewing freaks. I love the friendships between these kids and their relationship with their boss. Anyone who doesn't understand Lucas and Joe's relationship has never had a mentor or been one. And Joe's love/hate relationship with his workers is so well written and portrayed. When I watched this for the first time, I was trying to figure out just when the writer had been a fly on my wall. My favorite line: ""Have I fired anyone today? No! Why would I start with you?"" I suggest watching it repeatedly. You'll catch something new every time."

","How did I miss this when It came out? Being that I used to search for movies of this type, I don't see how this gem slipped me by. I just watched saw it for the first time this week(after being inspired by many a glowing IMDb user comment!!) and found it be really terrific. The movie really affected me and watching it was an absolute trip. I want them to do a part two and I just saw part one! I guess I'm a little late in jumping on on the Empire Records train....<br/><br/>This movie is a breath of fresh air. The characters are so relateable. And lovable. Joe is awesome! ""Warren Beaty"" steals every scene he's in. And it is just so much fun in general. The musical choices are great. The numerous one liners are Brilliant! Of Coarse I saw other movies I've loved reflected in this one (examples being ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Clerks"", etc). But I think this had it's own unique charm. It's such a good choice for anyone who's a music fan out there, as well as to anyone who's coming of age and just not really sure what they want and where their going. It's a little less talky then some of the other similar movies and it seems a celebration of freedom and rock-n-roll. I was also strongly reminded of ""High Fidelity"".<br/><br/>Besides being hilarious, touching and nostalgic all at once, Empire Records also had another effect on me and that was making me want to call all my old buddies from that time period to yell at them to see this great movie....immediately. Unfortunately, I doubt many of them would be able to relate anymore. To the people who CAN relate however, who haven't seen this and who may stumble upon this review....take ninety minutes or so and See this little gem and take your own trip down memory lane.<br/><br/>I will be recommending this movie to the people in my life who I know will dig this peppy flick."

","Found this by accident really. Had browsed the 'top titles' and nothing took my fancy and just went surfing the racks and saw this. After the first view was pleasantly surprised and subsequently have re-viewed and have taken to it a lot. Still haven't mentioned the greatest thing about this movie - the soundtrack. So many classics, and for me so many from when I grew up. Flying Lizards sticks out as a favourite and sadly doesn't appear on the soundtrack CD. As for the acting, it was as expected just good performances. Some have moved on to bigger and better, some have not. Some questionable threads in the plot but I always try to remember why I watch movies and that is to be entertained, this movie does that."

","""Damn the man, save the Empire"". That is the theme of the movie and one of the best quotes ever.<br/><br/>My friends and I watched this movie over and over (and over again) in around 1997. I just saw it again recently and was flooded with memories.<br/><br/>It is probably not the best theatrical movie of it's time but it is one that I feel really captured a time in America's youth when we were coming out of grunge rock and heading to god knows what. It is a movie that will always remind me of my youth, when it was easier to say ""Damn the man, save the Empire!"" and not be worried about the consequences that those words may have."

","This movie was worth seeing in my opinion. My instincts shows that this movie is a real hit. A marvelous cast, a great plot, and plenty of sex appeal made this movie really good. Anthony LaPaglia, Debi Mazar, Renne Zellweger, and Liv Tyler made this movie a hit. Rory Cochrane is astonishing at playing Lucas, the employee who gambles the $9000+ in a casino. Sure he got slammed by the boss, but who wants to be bought out by a bigwig who wants only money? I wouldn't. Then comes in Rex Manning(Maxwell Caulfield), a music video, TV legend who helps promote the store, is nothing more than a time-warped has been. Cory(Tyler) really showed her sexual prowess in the lunch scene. That's Steve's daughter for ya! Rock on! And there's Debra(Robin Tunney) very bipolar, shaves her head, then gets to lighten up and see what's really important. When the employees and their boss fight against the buyout, they are the heroes of the movie. Strum a guitar on that one. The music was great, the scenes are fantastic, it's too bad this movie was a limited premiere. I give it 3 stars, just to be honest."

","This is a really great movie. Before I saw it someone told be it was bad, not realistic etc. They were wrong. It is funny, has great characters (that do things that one would never guess) good music and the acting is very good. The story is totally unconventional. The writing is great. I hope Allen Moyle does more movies of this kind. It is definitely his strong suit. I never like Robin Tunney much before i saw this movie but I am a fan now. She's a fearless actress. Very underrated and deserves to have a much better career. If you haven't seen this movie and love music, love record stores and play real records, definitely rent it. You won't be disappointed. I want to see it again. Also, Why is it that really good movies never get the marketing they deserve and crap movies do?!"
"aimless-46","10","0","0","6 February 2006"," The Time to Hesitate is Through
","Trying to contribute something useful to prospective viewers means trying to explain the extremely polarized nature of the comments about ""Empire Records"". An uninitiated reader would think that the love-it and hate-it groups were talking about two different films. Which is actually a relatively accurate take on the situation. Allan Moyle's films may differ in subject and structure, but they all have the same indefinable quality that literally connects them to a segment of viewers. This is not the same thing as ""getting it"" which you would use explain the positive/negative reactions to ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""Nashville"", or ""Clockwork Orange"".<br/><br/>The connection process is more subtle, and it doesn't seem to matter whether you are watching ""Times Square"", ""Pump Up the Volume"", ""New Waterford Girl"", or ""Empire Records"". An earlier comment came close to capturing this quality: "".....watched it (again) the other night with my boyfriend, and we both still laughed during the funny parts and cuddled during the sweet parts and, well, danced during the dance parts....."". The point being that if you have ever connected with a Moyle film you will most likely connect with ""Empire Records"" and will see an entirely different film that those not so lucky.<br/><br/>What about those with no prior exposure to Moyle? Think of ""Empire Records"" as the ""American Graffiti"" of the 90's, a similar ""one-day"" structure and a cast of relatively unknown young actors destined to make it big. Structurally it's a microcosm movie like ""The Big Chill"", as almost all the action takes place in the same location and the day being portrayed is not a routine one but an extraordinary one (it's Rex Manning day). Not all fans of ""Ghost World"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"" will enjoy ""Empire Records"" but it is probably safe to say that if you hated those two films you should avoid ""Empire Records"".<br/><br/>It has a happy ending with characters you like and identify with, and the small world of the record store functions as family and universe for these characters. There are lots of little things that you only pick up on after repeated viewings. I'm convinced that the over-the-top stuff works (i.e doesn't come across as totally lame) because Moyle and his editor have carefully set things up on a subconscious level. For example when Corey is agonizing about opening her Harvard admissions letter, they cut between her and attentive shots of both AJ and Gina, who are standing near her to be supportive despite having mixed feelings about her going away. They are the two people who care the most about her. Which furnishes the viewer with the information to understand the nature of her meltdown later in the film, she comes unglued not about Rex Manning but with the sudden realization that her preoccupation with herself has alienated the two people she cares about the most.<br/><br/>My favorite sequence is when Joe tracks down Deb (Robin Tunney) who has retreated from everyone and is sitting on the floor of one of the listening booths doing the store's tax return, symbolic of the protective niche she has found working in the store for Joe. In an extremely touching scene Joe finally just tells her that she is doing a good job. Tunney nicely underplays her character's gentle sarcasm during their exchange, but there is a huge dimensionality in her responses that perfectly communicates her connection to Joe and the store. So that in about 30 seconds Moyle has set up a believable explanation for the sacrifice Deb will later make to help save them.<br/><br/>My second favorite sequence is a montage of activity inside the store early in the film. While the soundtrack plays Dire Straits' ""Romeo and Juliet"", the editor cuts between characters, coming back to ""Juliet"" Mills' daughter each time the Juliet lyric is sung.<br/><br/>Plus there is a nice bit of irony as the film opens with a customer asking a question which sets all the events in motion: ""Do you think the story is already written or do you think a bold courageous act can change the course of history?"". The irony being that the bold act changes the course of history in a totally unintended manner.<br/><br/>The ending is a mix of the ""Times Square's"" ending and something out of a Judy Garland- Mickey Rooney movie where they get the gang together and put on a show.<br/><br/>""Empire Records"" has no obvious technical problems and Moyle gets very even performances out of his relatively inexperienced cast. The soundtrack is the most diverse and extensive you are likely to encounter.<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
"DICK STEEL","7","0","0","29 November 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Empire Records Remix! Special Fan Edition (1995)
","This quirky take with memorable characters take place in a span of 24 hours in a record store known as Empire Records (Tower Records anyone?) It highlights a day in the life of the store employees, made up of teeny boppers like proverb spewing Lucas (Rory Cochrane), suicidal rebel Jane (Debi Mazar), slutty Gina (Renee Zellweger), smarty pants Corey (Liv Tyler), amongst others.<br/><br/>The story starts off with Lucas taking nine thousand dollars from the cashier at night before he closes the store, and loses it all in a hilarious sequence at Atlantic City. Joe, the co-owner, learns about this, and the recovery of this amount of money forms the running theme in this movie.<br/><br/>Thrown into the plot is an equally hilarious character Rex Manning, a has-been singer who's due at the store for an autograph session with his fans. You'll definitely dig one of his cheesy music videos. Corey has a crush on Rex, and tries to seduce him, but falls flat in embarrassment. Of course she's shocked when good friend Gina manages to pull the seduction off, and me-ow, a catfight ensues.<br/><br/>As if the day isn't bogged down with too much activities in serving customers and spinning good music in the store, the employees learn that their beloved Empire Records will be absorbed by Music Town, a larger competitor. Therefore it's also a race against time to preserve the identity of their store.<br/><br/>But it's a feel good movie, with feel good songs sprinkled with the occasional metal, so the ending is somewhat predictable with all threads and sub plots merging into one grand finale. Needless to mention, my primary objective is actually to watch Liv and Renee in one of their earlier movies :-)"

","What I loved about this movie was it's connection with the audience across multiple levels. There were moments of hilarity, anguish, excitement, disgust and outright loss of control, which were all bolstered by the thematic mirroring of music. The soundtrack to Empire Records evokes the mindset of the youths in the record store and enhances everything so that that it leaps off the screen, into your ears, swirls around your brain for a bit and then spurts out again through every limb. I found myself banging along to the music of the Gin Blossoms, AC/DC and even Sexy Rex Manning! It conveyed the plight of the youth without being trite or pretentious owing to great performances from the whole cast and some inspired direction. The casting agents must have wet their pants when these guys rolled in to audition! All in all this is a top flick that makes you wanna start a band, rock out in public places and work in a record store. Thankyou for making this film!"

"SenshiKid","9","0","0","7 September 2005"," Memorable, time-appropriate movie for the ages
","First off, the main reason I like this movie is because it's so memorable. It's set in the mid-90's in a giant record store(think Tower without the corporation) called ""Empire Records."" <br/><br/>So, basically what happens is a chain of events that are only related to each other in the sense that they have to do with either the shop or its employees. It's very basic, with a pretty weak plot, but is fulfilled through its characters. <br/><br/>Speaking of characters, there is a LOT of symbolism going for this movie. What I admire about it most is that some of these characters, though symbolic, are very well fleshed out and I could swear that I've actually met people exactly like this. On the other hand, the character Rex Manning, supposed to symbolize the death of pop ""artists"" who sing and get paid, is very flat and has no background to speak of. The director made him just a tad bit too obvious about his role, so he didn't seem like a real person. You get my point.<br/><br/>Favorite character: Debra (remember the Craft?!) Favorite scene: Ethan's character chomping some herbal brownies and watching TV was hilarious, but the scene after the credits roll between the same character and the long haired boy talking about music was probably the most meaningful scene in the whole movie. Least favorite scene: Lucas gets anchored to the couch after he lost all the money. I think if I was a manager I might have actually fired him at some point...or at least smacked the snot out of him. Least favorite character: The manager! No back story, no good dialog really, and he was so freaking unrealistic(especially when he was mad at someone). He was a good actor but the director should have written him a back story, because he only /looked/ like he was complicated. Not good enough.<br/><br/>And that's my review. This movie has great music and unforgettable characters, but an uninteresting meta-plot and two-dimensional adults kills the fun considerably.<br/><br/>Until I hear it frooooom you..."

","This film is one of the best teen movies, I first watched it ten years ago when I was 12. I was hooked,you may assume that to occupy the mind of a 12 year old would be simple. But for a film to hold its charm throughout the whole period in which a teen ""grows up"" for a whole decade its truly incredible. It wasn't just because of the cast (although it is a good one) it was a mix of passionate music and dark humour, intelligent undertones suggesting subtle but impactive multi- stranded narratives each coping with their own dilemma. However big or small. The film satisfyingly draws you in. You feel every-thing for the film and the characters in it, that Allan Moyles wants you to feel.

A very funny film, with a great atmosphere, nice dialogues, and a very talented young cast. The screenplay was very well written, with some very cool dialogues. La Paglia was good in his role, however the best performances in the film came from Renee Zellweger, Rory Cochrane and a very hilarious Brendan Sexton. Liv Tyler was also good, as were Embry and Whitworth.

","From a cynical viewpoint, you could say that this is just ""Friends"" with great music, near-profanity, and sex. There's nothing wrong with that perspective, but you'd be missing out on a treat. An overly sugary treat (like the brownies in the film), but with some actual nutrition within. If nothing else, you get to see some now-successful actors in some of their earliest work.<br/><br/>I randomly found this film on the TV this morning, and I couldn't look away. The angle to this ""I found family"" film is that it starts with what most films take half of their time to get to: the failure that transforms the characters. Right off the bat, the misfit loner takes money that either belongs to the manager, the store, or both, and loses it gambling in Atlantic City. Here's one of the things that works: the manager doesn't turn him in, or beat him up (at least not until an hour into the film). He makes him sit on the couch!! Yes, there are stereotypes, and shallow ones at that, and still there is some character transformation during the course of the story. The saving grace is the music, which for 1995 was pretty daring. And everyone works their issues out somehow, i.e., we don't really get to see how, we just get the headlines. The exposition is predictable and predictably presented: for the most part, the characters announce to each other what's happened. A few times, they do it right to the camera.<br/><br/>It still works, somehow. Of course it has a happy ending. And there's a very Friends-like dance scene, but not in some fountain, it's on the roof of the store, and it's not at the beginning, it's at the end. Like refined sugar, this kind of treat isn't bad for you in moderation."

There's the Teen Angst girl who cuts her wrists and shaves her head because she's feeling invisible (and there's one of them in every school), the ""perfect"" girl, who it turns out isn't really so perfect after all, the slut -I'm sure we all know a few of them- who turns out just to be confused and scared of growing up, the guy who's not sure what he wants to do now he's leaving school, the teen criminal (I won't even tell you how he ends up), and the screwball who's on a permanent sugar high, but we love him anyway. It deals with issues like sex, drugs, moving on, change, depression, and of course just a little love. The songs in this are perfect (although the best ones for some reason aren't on the CD) and just make you wanna jump up and dance! 10/10"

","this movie is perfection. its not deep, but it means something. its not groundbreaking, but its funny. really funny. the soundtrack is quirky and delightful and fitting, its characters are at once cliché and then universally relatable to your life. you don't always need cinematic brilliance to never forget a film like this. I've seen it over 20 times with all of my friends and can say every line like i wrote the script. i don't like sentimental teen flicks, but this is a cult classic that is worth a rental, no, purchase...because you'll want to see it again. for every random act of dancing, every perfect one-liner, and how much it makes you want to work in a record store....i LOVE this movie."

","I first discovered this film as a teenager and loved it(probably owing to the number of attractive males in the cast!). I haven't seen it in a few years and wonder if I'd still be as enthusiastic about it now.<br/><br/>However, I do remember that at the time of my obsession with this film I always maintained that it was not yet another pointless teen movie. The cast was well picked and stand-out performances come from (despite previous role as a nobody in the excruciatingly awful 'Dazed and Confused') Rory Cochrane, who is utterly endearing as the witty Lucas. The mix of new actors like Liv Tyler and Ethan Randall with better known actors such as Anthony la Paglia and Maxwell Caulfield (who is outstanding as the sleazy Rex Manning) works a treat and makes for a thoroughly entertaining film. Not only is it filled with gags and myriad band name-checks, but for anyone in their late teens/early twenties who posed the question 'what the hell am I doing with my life?' this film touches on the more sensitive side of growing up too. And lets not forget the triumphant ending which sees the independent store achieve victory over corporate take-over! <br/><br/>Excellent soundtrack and amusing music-geek conversations between 'Eddie' and 'Mark' could easily be two of your friends at a party."

","Empire Records is one of the great music-based teen comedies made at the tail end of the grunge years. The characters are fantastic, the story is completely nutty, its got a pretty fantastic soundtrack, and the movie is really a good time all around, destined to bring a smile to your face.<br/><br/>Joe Reeves (Anthony LaPaglia) runs a record store, Empire Records. The movie takes place pretty much over the course of one crazy day of adventures and disasters at the store. Adventures and disasters that begin with a night of fowl gambling and the loss of the store profits by the cynical, sarcastic Lucas (Rory Cochrane). That sets things in motion. Joe sees the situation as major trouble (obviously, since he's the manager and responsible for the cash), while the rest of the clerks see it as an opportunity to seize the day! <br/><br/>In the course of this day, several things go on behind the scenes of Joe trying to figure out how to get the money back and in the meantime, explain to the owner why there was no deposit made at the bank the day before. As your typical Generation X comedies made in the early and mid 90s goes, you'll have a bunch of different, fairly interconnected situations among a scattered cast of characters and most of these stories are all about who is in love with whom. On this day at Empire Records, retro retard rock singer, Rex Manning, is at the store to autograph CDs for aging fans. Soft-spoken braniac, Cory (Liv Tyler) has made plans to approach Rex and let him know that basically she's grossly obsessed with him. Meanwhile, AJ (Johnny Whitworth), wants to seize the day and boldly profess his love to Cory, if only he can get the confidence to do so. Jane (Debi Mazar), the stereotypical badass of the group complete with shaved head and black attire, avoids explanation of some fresh scars on her wrists. Mark (Ethan Embry) and Eddie (my favorite character, played by James 'Kimo' Wills) are just being themselves, a crazy duo who love to have fun. All this going on while Joe has to try and save Empire Records thanks to Lucas's big mistake.<br/><br/>Sad but true, some things get quite corny. Some of the characters are obviously stereotypical and the Hollywood happy ending of such a bizarre day is quite unbelievable. But, basically, it's a movie about music, friendship, and romance played out to a good mid 90s soundtrack the features The Cranberries, The Gin Blossoms, Dire Straits, Edwyn Collins, and tons more. It ain't no cinematic masterpiece, but it is definitely one of the best teen/gen x comedies of its day (sharing the ranks with Freaked and Tank Girl, of course). <br/><br/>Damn the Man, Save the Empire!"

","I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember. It not only has a great cast, full of young and talented actors, but it also has a good plot, and a killer soundtrack. There are several smaller story lines running together, which all meet up in the end to prove that, while music may not actually save lives, it sure can make you feel a whole heck of a lot better. The characters are easily identifiable, and you can almost instantly relate to at least one of them in one way or another. This movie made me want to work in a record store for the sole purpose of getting paid to listen to awesome music and hang out with cool people.

Renee Zellwegger has a scene in the movie where she sings, not to be missed. Liv Tyler looks hot as usual. Robin Tuney is the depressed girl who hates everyone, & decides to shave her head @ work. Maxwell Caulfield is hilarious as Rex (Sexxy Rexxy) Manning. Debi Mazar has a bit part as Rex's assistant Jane. I also recommend that you check out the soundtrack. It's one of the best soundtracks out there."

","This really is a bizarre beast of a movie.  some aspects of it are really really good, and others really really bad. It certainly gives the impression that the script aimed higher than tacky happy comedy, but the director/production company didn't. A friend of mine forced it on me as a tacky happy, but quite frankly, when one of the main characters tries to top herself, and cuts her hair off for attention then it really isn't all fun and games. It's worth watching, if only to appreciate the movie that it wanted to be, even if it didn't quite have the balls to be it. Definitely a good argument that scriptwriters should just to direct their own scripts."

"anser","Null","0","0","10 February 2004"," Pitch Perfect
","Empire Records is a gem among teen flicks for two reasons: cast and direction.<br/><br/>First the cast - a real ensemble of actors with real credits and, in the case of the youngsters, real futures.  It took about five movies each before Liv Tyler or Renee Zellweger gave as much as they give in Empire!  Robin Tunney doesn't just appear in the movie with a shaved head - she cuts her hair on screen.  (You realize they had exactly one take.)  The kids interact believably and movingly.  LaPaglia and Cochrane are the anchors.  By the time the movie is over, you have a real sense of who Joe is, and if you're older than a teen, you probably know someone like him.<br/><br/>
The direction (and some of the writing) is deft.  Two or three things are usually happening at once, and are timed to peak in satisfying sequence.<br/><br/>All of this sounds normal for a good quality grownup movie, but it is *so exceptional* for a ""teen flick.""  That's why Empire Records is a gem.<br/><br/>This movie would make a great double bill with High Fidelity."

","Empire Records is a unique, hilarious movie that has been my favorite since I've seen it in 95. There's an intriguing and original plotline, yes, but the cast of characters really brought it to life. Liv Tyler plays the short-tempered Corey, Johnny Whitworth plays the adorable (A.K.A. hot) artist A.J., Ethan Embry (as Ethan Randall) plays the strange rocker Mark, Coyote Shivers plays the guitar playing Berko, and Anthony LaPaglia plays Joe, the manager of Empire Records, who brings it all together. This movie has a great soundtrack, and I especially liked the headbanging scenes. All in all, a great funny movie you can watch again and again."

I first watched it all the way through on video at a friends house, and found myself in hysterics throughout most of it!  Okay, the characters and plot aren't very well developed, but its a feel good, escapist teen movie full of laughs, and is probably responsible for much of the younger generations' aspirations to work in a record store.  The characters are funny, especially Mark, and there is an abundance of one-liners.  Also, as someone else commented, it has become very nostalgic of the early to mid-90s.

"fishbulb11","Null","0","0","25 February 2003"," Music and Teen Angst
","While this movie is one definatley worth watching, there are still certain aspects of it that make me cringe. First of all the casting of Johnny Whitworth as AJ was a terrible decision. This character was supposed to be intresting and deep. However by casting a pretty boy I found my self hating this character. If this movie was made ten years ealrier John Cusak would have played AJ, of course because of the music it would have been a entriely different film.<br/><br/>As much as I hated Johnny Whitmore I did think that Anthony Lapalglia was great as Joe. Joe was supposed to be like that groovy guidance counselor in high school who was always there to look out for you. Lapaglia plays this character just right. There is no doubt that this material is below him but he handles it very well.<br/><br/>Some of the other memembers of this cast are also entertaining to watch. Another good performance comes from Rory Cochrane as Lucas, the philospher and smart ass of the group. Also this film features a pre-Jerry Maquire Rene Zellwegaras the slutty Gina.<br/><br/>The story it's self is nothing really revoluntionary. A group of mistfits work in a record store that is going to be made into a Sam Goody type outlet store very soon and all the freedom their cool, hip boss, Joe has provided them will be gone. Oh and there is the girl dealing with suicide, heart ache, and ultimatley love growing from heart ache. At certain points in this film it seems like it is trying to be a 90's take of Dazed and Confused. Dealing with teen issue while packing the movie full of period music and colorful characters. However, rest assure it is no Dazed and Confused<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is just alright. It is a good movie to catch on VH1 every once and awhile or even rent when you can't think of anything else. For me the film's soundtrack brought me back to the good ole' days of 1995. Coming home from the 7th grade turing on the radio while doing homework and listening to the Gin Blossoms<br/><br/>Catch the movie if it is on or rent it when you got nothing else to see, it's good for that."

What Empire Records succeedes in doing is taking a day in the life of a place that all teenagers can relate to (A music shop), taking a cast of gorgeous, hip young things, playing a brilliant soundtrack throughout, and chucking in some quotes that you can go over again, and again with your friends (me and my friend's personal favourite is Joe and Lucas' 'where's the money gone' conversation, that is as funny now as it was all those many viwings ago).<br/><br/>Anybody who disregards Empire Records as a badly-acted, unrealistic film with a weak story-line, and cliched characters are missing the point entirely.

If you don't find yourself quoting from this film after the first viewing, something's wrong. If you don't know the entire script after the second or third, something's seriously wrong. And if you don't bother watching it at least once a week, then you're far too busy for your own good.<br/><br/>The cast all give great performances, but this isn't a film which is open to dissection. It has one soul (typo intended!) purpose - enjoyment. Well maybe two if you count the feel-good factor. And don't get me started on the soundtrack. Really. Don't just rent it. Buy it, own it, and watch it over and over and over.....<br/><br/>8/10"

"GabrielSeraphim","Null","0","0","7 April 2000"," decent movie from semi-decent script
","A good example of a movie where the main character isn't a person but a thing, in particular in this movie, a record store.  Allan Moyle stuck with what he seems to know best, teenagers and suicide (as in Pump Up the Volume).  While this movie provides general entertainment, it is almost a perfect example of another teen movie that was written without purpose. There isn't much that makes this movie different than most teen movies of the 90's.  The characters aren't believable as teenagers, at the most, late teenagers, early 20's.<br/><br/>Then we have the unbelievabilty of the character Joe who doesn't do anything except help, yet again the boy who stole $9,000 dollars from his store. Forgive me, but most managers aren't going to take that in stride like its an everyday occurrence.  The only believable teen character in the movie would be Warren, except him showing back up in the store with a gun.<br/><br/>If there is to be any real praise for this film it would be for Allan Moyle; however, he did much better work with Pump Up the Volume, especially with delivering a message.  Empire sold itself on its soundtrack, not on story or acting.   Definitely watch it, but literally don't expect anything, it runs in the same vein as Swingers and Clerks in telling a story with no story. And while Swingers and Clerks pulled this off far better, they had a more believable basis than what the creators designed for Empire Records."

","Empire Records is my favorite movie of all time. It is the portrayal of one crazy day in a record store. The characters are all completely different and the different reactions we get from each them in each situation allows the audience to relate to every circumstance in one way or another. Many people, however, may not like the movie, simply because it does not mesh with their sense of humor. The humor is definately aimed at teens of today, although my parents think it is hilarious. Backed with an outstanding soundtrack, I have found it impossible to get sick of it. I laugh everytime. Most of the humor is not found in jokes but rather in the characters, especially Lucas, Mark, and Rex Manning (at least in his video).

When I was in high school my entire class knew Empire Records off by heart. I'm not talking that they could speak along with the movie, we could do it sitting in class, and we did, for fun. The acting isn't great, the story is unoriginal, it all turns out in a sickening saccharine way, but for some reason it grabs teenagers and sucks them in.

It was so bad. Worst of all, the music, the clothes, all that stuff--I wore the little minis, the belly shirts, the big boots, dated boys with skater haircuts--now I know how my mom felt when she looked back into the '70's and realized that the Farrah Fawcett hair and big owl glasses were not the height of style.<br/><br/>Plus the plot on this movie was weak, weak, weak. If there EVER was a place where people could work and this kind of adolescent s**t went on, even in the mid-nineties, I would guarantee they would get fired. What kind of manager puts up with this drama? And to have an employee have sex with a guest in a closet AT WORK? Classy! Dancing with your shirt off in the aisles? Woo-hoo! Sounds professional to me! Why not shave your head at work before your shift--and leave all your hair in the sink? Yay! <br/><br/>But I guess I perhaps missed seeing this in the window where it might have been relevant to me. I hope that teenagers today realize that someday they are going to look back someday and see just how silly their fashions (hello 80's new wave! Wait--there's nothing new about it) will look with 12 years distance. This movie takes whatever coolness that existed in the time period and encapsulates it into a sitcom-esquire music video. So I do have to say, Booo.<br/><br/>On a horrible note, this movie brought home the fact that Renee Zellweger has NEVER BEEN YOUNG. Liv Tyler and I are the same age (29) and I don't think that she looks much different, which is a good thing.

","Empire Records is the worst movie about music there possibly can be (with the exception of possibly 8 mile). The basic theme is the workings of a small time record store, about to become a major music store. The problem with this is the fact that it is ALREADY a major music store, but everyone is too damn dumb and blind to realize it. Its an awful movie with awful actors and an awful plot.<br/><br/>Absolutely none of the characters have any emotion that's more than skin deep. The one and only thing that was ever remotely good about the movie was seeing Lyv Tyler undress, though it certainly isn't worth it to sit through over an hour and a half of CRAP to see less than I could find on the internet in less than five seconds. Honestly, who could actually like bulls**t like this? I borrowed the movie from a friend, and having seen it I am very glad that I did not pay money to see something like this. I would say I want my money back, but instead I'd like the time wasted on this back to do something more useful like burn as many copies of it as I can. If you really want to see what a real small time record store looks like in the form of a movie (with good acting and an actually interesting plot), see High Fidelity. It's soooooo much better.<br/><br/>Once I finished watching this movie, I could only think two things: 1) THANK GOD!!!!!!, and 2) I can't believe that I actually sat through the whole thing. It's probably because I have such a high appreciation for music, that I though it must get better at some point (Steven Tyler must have disowned his daughter after such a disgraceful movie). Despite anticipation though, it only got worse as the ""plot"" thickened, finally drawing to a conclusion that's ""fun for the whole family!""...

I like mostly old punk and some new stuff as well, and this movie had tunes from AC/DC and even cool original music (at least I think its original) that Renee Zellwegger sings. All in all, I praise the skillfully witty humor, and the moral that, and I know it's corny, you can accomplish great things if you stick by your friends. It is also quite entertaining to see Liv Tyler flip out after being criticized for a speed addiction, (generally not one of Liv Tyler's roles) and the character of ""Lucas"" is hilarious with his insightful views.

","This was like a large puddle - shallow and muddy. It's a sad day when the best performance in a film is by a C-grade washed up actor playing a washed up singer. Maxwell Caulfield drew from his own experiences and it showed - him I believed. The rest of the characters were so cookie cutter.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe the level of angst and pathos in this film. It just went on and on. I managed a CD/video store for a while and had teenage employees AND worked counseling teenagers for two years. I saw some of those problems, but in one day???!!! Give me a break. The writers got together and threw in the entire table of contents of a high school counselor's handbook. Maybe if the writers had reduced the number of characters and their many manias, there could have been a bit of character development.<br/><br/>And as the store manager, I would have been on the phone so fast to report the theft and the thief. I am not going down for some punk kid who thinks he has the magic touch at a craps table.<br/><br/>I gave it a 3 because I liked the music and from a technical standpoint, it was well done."

","I was excited to see Empire Records for the first time a few years ago. I had several friends and acquaintances who raved about it and I was more than impressed to see Toad the Wet Sprocket and Gin Blossoms on the soundtrack. Talk about being disappointed. This is a dull film with little merit beyond the obvious appeal of its idle fantasy. ""We're young and we have problems but we stick together and straighten ourselves out with a party"" seems to be the single puerile point this movie drives for.<br/><br/>The characters are almost without exception completely unlikable and poorly developed (although the bald girl is rather cool). One character blows all the record store's money at the beginning of the film, no reason given. Liv Tyler wants to sleep with her aging pop idol and elicits no sympathy. Zellweger actually does sleep with him and elicits even less. I wanted to slap them both. The artist with the coins in the floor is in love with Liv but I just wished he would see how impossibly stupid she was and date someone else. Maybe the bald girl, since she was the film's single redeeming character (and that's not saying much).<br/><br/>Worst of all is the erratic, potentially mentally ill manager played by Anthony LaPaglia. This is by no means a criticism of fine actor Anthony, but his character is appallingly written, shifting from nurturing and understanding father figure to angry and psychotic manager type between - and even within - scenes. Nothing about the film feels consistent or worth caring about.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a good film about music try High Fidelity or Almost Famous, where the characters are actually entertaining and well written and the stories not the stuff of ridiculous adolescent fantasy."

","This was horribly written and acted. I can imagine the writer wracking her brains every 10 minutes for what was going to happen next in the script and finishing it in two days. If you notice, she never got a real job after this script (a tv item and an independant film about ballet)...<br/><br/>This movie is one of those that gets made because a studio needs to fill a ""teen movie"" quota, not because the filmmaker was inspired by any specific idea or concept.<br/><br/>Several parts were mildly amusing, but I don't know how anyone can rate this movie a 10. I can't even begin to describe what is wrong with it - it was just a meaningless mess.  I know some idiot is going to say ""that is the point... it's a slacker film"". If you look at a movie like ""Reality Bites"" or director Alan Moyle's OTHER film, ""Pump up the Volume"", and compare it to this, you see that a movie about people who are a mess doesn't have to be a mess itself."

","I wanted to like this film - I really did - but from the outset, I couldn't help but notice how cliched the characters were. I just couldn't bring myself to lend any empathy whatsoever to the ""tortured souls"" which were gratuitously scattered about the store. Frankly, they came across as posers.<br/><br/>Let's see, there was the brainy, just-trying-to-be-accepted girl, the suicidal ""walk one day in my shoes and I MIGHT respect you"" girl, the token slut, the oh-so-cool but mighty mysterious & outrageously unrealistic beatnik dude, etc, etc. I couldn't help but think that the writer must've spent hours upon end in a local mall trying to get a beat on the pulse of today's youth. Sadly, he produced this bouillabaisse.<br/><br/>Even more maddening was the intertwining of sub-plots designed to lend credence to each character. The scene in which the brainy one finally goes mad and begins ripping things apart was utterly ridiculous and completely forced.<br/><br/>This is one of those films that actually made me blush - not because of any suggestive scenes, but because I became embarrassed that I was actually watching it!"

","Once upon a time there was this magical place called ""the record store."" It was a place that appeared for many generations following World War II. A place that had a vivid spot in American culture, especially American teenage culture, before we even walked on the moon.<br/><br/>I for one still have cherished memories of piling into a car with my friends, taking the trip out to Tower Records, only to get publicly castrated by the super-hot chick with the pierced nose that worked behind the counter because I brought a copy of the ""The Book of Secrets"" for my girlfriend.<br/><br/>She forced me to turn around, hold the album high, and announce to the entire store that I was buying Loreena McKennitt.<br/><br/>It was one of the most humiliating moments in my high school career...And you just don't get that level of quality service at Best Buy...let alone Itunes. So occasionally you took a shot in the face for your girlfriend's bad taste...but you also did it in an environment where you were talked into buying Getz and Jobim and a complete collection of Bossa Nova, just because one of the clerks caught you walking through the Jazz section.<br/><br/>""Empire Records"" is just like that, it's a time testament to childhood. It's your youth wrapped up into a feature film. It may be a flawed movie, from time to time, but the jokes are there and they are funny. The people that you used to know are all there too.<br/><br/>I can't remember what the hot clerk that made me do the Mummers Dance looked like, but in my minds eye now she looks just like Robin Tunney. James 'Kimo' Wills was the stoner clerk that took me from Pearl Jam to Coltrane in one shopping trip...and if you are out there, whoever did that for me...thank you.<br/><br/>Maybe you were never lucky enough to get a job at the record store, but you still knew some of the clerks very well. You spent your hard earned money there and you can never go home again.<br/><br/>You can never REALLY go home again. Maybe you can head to Rolling Stone, but the staff there are all Millennials and most of their knowledge stops no later than 2006. They are polite to the customers, not surly and hysterical. The Record Stores of today are an empty shell of their former glory...<br/><br/>But you can still watch ""Empire Records"" you can still go back in time to the day BEFORE the music died...well, before it died again, and, for a little while, pretend you are still living in that time and place where music was played on instruments and people sang without auto-tune.<br/><br/>The movie is like the baseball diamond in ""Field of Dreams""...only for audiophiles. What makes it great is that sense of peace in the universe.<br/><br/>For Gen-X to Baby Boomers ""Empire Records"" reminds us that we were there, and alive, in that little corner of time. Now, twenty-years back, we can watch it with all the warm, glowing, nostalgia it deserves."

","As I sit there watching DVDs, I very often tell myself I'm great at selecting glamorous, likable TV shows, but when it comes to movies... There are so many I watch that just doesn't hit it off with me. TV show characters tend to become friends, a movie is very different, everybody's a stranger, I don't care for them. <br/><br/>Well, happy to say that EMPIRE RECORDS is a big hot hit with me. It's a small production with a lot of heart that beats a lot of much-bigger movies simply because it is likable, with likable characters. And what a treat to see Renée Zellweger during her glory days! And Liv Tyler entering her STEALING BEAUTY phase. A dream cast, with those two going on as if they're in an Aerosmith music video! <br/><br/>Yeah, back then, they weren't big marquee names. Now it is an oddity to see their names so low on the cast list.<br/><br/>Not saying it's perfect. I found the first half to be very promising, with the second half a letdown in many places. There are characters (like Jane) going nowhere, just wasting space. But overall, I can see why there is a board poster so obsessed with it, the dude wrote a self- proposed TV series sequel, and, yes, I would have watched.<br/><br/>I heartily recommend this one.

"michaelmunkvold","6","1","2","30 May 2015"," One of my favorite bad movies
","""Empire Records"" is not a good movie: it's flimsy, shallow and deeply, profoundly stupid. It's like a cross between a Guess jeans commercial and an episode of ""I Love the 90s"", with pop culture references instead of dialog and youth culture clichés instead of characters. It's a Twinkie of a movie - a momentary sugar high with no nutritional value whatsoever.<br/><br/>Yet, I can't help but like it. ""Empire Records"" is the kind of cheerfully brainless movie you watch when you're sick or you can't sleep. When you're too stressed to take anything of any substance, its high-spirited, empty-headed charm is pretty soothing, like comfort food or a pair of well-worn sweat pants. Sometimes you need to watch a stupid movie; when you feel such a need, ""Empire Records"" is just what the doctor ordered.<br/><br/>""Empire Records"" doesn't have a story so much as a series of vignettes held together by a thin plot device: the titular record store, which is about to go out of business. The store is staffed by a motley group of Pretty White Kids With Problems who listen to inoffensively ""edgy"" alternative rock (Gin Blossoms, the Cranberries, etc). They spend their day in the store angsting over unrequited love, musing about movies and bands, and having the obligatory life-changing revelations. (This keeps them too busy to do any actual work; not once do you see anyone so much as clean the bathroom.) They then throw a big party that miraculously saves the store, and everybody finds love and happiness. The end.<br/><br/>I know, it's ridiculous. ""Empire Records"" redefines the word ""stupid"". Nevertheless, every time I see this movie I can't help but smile. Maybe it takes me back to when I first saw it, at 14 - when all I wanted out of life was to hang out, listen to music, and feel like I had the elusive, all-important power of being cool.<br/><br/>The cast - actors like Liv Tyler, Renee Zellweger, and Brendan Sexton - were avatars of cool for adolescents in the mid-90s, and the simple act of watching them made us feel cool by proxy, as if they were letting us hang out with them at the popular kids' table. At that moment in our lives, they gave us what was then the ultimate gift: the fantasy of being forever young, beautiful and hip. Most people eventually outgrow the need to be cool, but when you're a teenager, it's like oxygen. ""Empire Records"" brings us back to an idealized version of that time, and the nostalgia washes over us in a wave of warm fuzzies. If a movie can do that, it doesn't need to be good.<br/><br/>""Empire Records"" may not be a good movie in the strictest sense, but I can watch it with a smile on my face, even if I forget about it moments after I finish watching it. It's cinematic junk food, but so what? There's nothing wrong with a donut every now and again. Just don't let it spoil your appetite for more substantial fare."
"The-Sarkologist","10","1","2","14 January 2012"," Pretty much my favourite romantic comedy
","When coming to this movie there is so much in it that needs to be said and can be said that it is almost impossible to get everything out of it in 1000 words. Aristotle's unity of time and place plays out well in this film as the action occurs through a single day and plays out mostly in the record shop. Further, each of the characters in the film have an epiphany which will change the direction of their life.<br/><br/>The first is Lucas. He is a character that had a hard life but Joe, the manager of the store, was willing to drag him out of the muck that he was in and give him a second chance. This willingness occurs at the beginning of the movie where he is entrusted to lock up, but he finds out that the store is going to be bought out so he attempts to win enough money to buy it out. What can be said is he fails, yet he still returns to face the problem, and Joe does not turn him over to the police, even though he deserves it. Lucas is basically the voice of wisdom. He has been through everything that everybody is going to, so even though he is facing the possibility of a lot of trouble, he is still able to console everybody and give them the wisdom that is needed.<br/><br/>This brings me to Warren. He is a kid that is a shoplifter, but it seems that the kid has never had a close family. His background is not drawn out, but a lot of it is implied with his reaction to the close knit family that are the employers of Empire Records. He is hostile towards them, but the truth comes out when he enters the shop with a gun in a fit of jealous rage. He has never had a group of caring friends like those at Empire Records, so when he sees it, he wants to destroy it. If he cannot have it then nobody else can have it. The caring nature of Joe, and the people at Empire Records, turn to welcome him even though he stole from them and held them hostage.<br/><br/>Debbie is the next namely because she faces up to Warren. It is not because she is tough but because she has been through death and is no longer scared of it. She enters the movie, goes straight into the bathroom and shaves off all of her hair. She constantly tries to avoid the questions of the others, though her bandaged wrist attracts their attention. Why did she try to commit suicide? Her answer is that she woke up and realised that everyday of her life was the same: the only difference was that the problems that piled upon her were different. But what was her real problem? We realise this at her funeral - she does not die but they give her a funeral so that she knows not only that she is a part of this family but that her death would hurt people and that she would be missed. She realises what her problem is - she simply wants to be noticed, that is why she dresses the way she does, acts the way she does, and shaves her hair - she simply wants to be noticed. At he funeral she suddenly realises that people not only notice her, but also love her.<br/><br/>AJ is the next character. He is in love with Corey and wants to go to art college but he does not think that he is good enough. That is his problem: he does not have any faith in himself. He seems to be okay, but Lucas tells us at the beginning that everybody has a problem even though everybody denies that they do not have one. It is only when AJ is confronted by Corey that he realises that he has no faith in himself. He tells Corey that he loves her, but to Corey it is the wrong time. It wasn't because it started her thinking and she realised that she did love him, but even then he had given up because he did not expect it to happen, not to him. When confronted by Corey he realises that he is not hopeless and can do things, so he does.<br/><br/>Gina doesn't really change because she already knows herself. She is more of a character that Corey reacts from. She and Corey are good friends, but Corey does not understand so when Gina screws Rex Manning, Corey freaks. She then realises that Gina was simply being herself and that is something that must be admired. Gina does not care what people think, and lets that known plain and clear.<br/><br/>Joe is also an important character as he is the father figure in the movie. He has taken all of the characters in, including the delinquent Warren, and makes them apart of his family. Jane becomes the mother figure, or will as she does not take that role in the movie. Joe is the one that takes the big problems upon his own shoulders, but others come to him for help.<br/><br/>Empire Records is a very good movie and as a friend says, it seems to capture the hopelessness of the 90's. It is a movie about family when the family unit is collapsing. It shows us that going out on our own never solves anything, and this is made clear right at the beginning when Lucas fails in his bid to win enough money to buy the store back. It is a movie that shows us that me must work together to survive and to overcome all of our problems, yet also shows us that there are somethings that we must do for ourselves."
"chocokitty11","9","1","2","22 January 2011"," A really underrated movie
","I adore this movie. Right after I saw it, it was my new favorite. It was really funny and had a great script. The soundtrack ROCKED. But I think my favorite part about this movie is the characters. They all seemed so real, like people I could be friends with or go to school with. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and good points and bad points. It seemed a lot more realistic than how most teen movies are where there is one really bland main character and then he or she has its quirky stereotypical friends. This movie is little hard to get into at first but thats the only thing I don't like. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially if they like movies like The Breakfast Club.

"votefornumbersix","9","1","2","23 October 2010"," Great for what it is
","Empire Records is a simple, feel-good teen movie with a predictable and cliché happy ending and, as other reviewers have noted, completely one dimensional characters. That being said, I have to admit that I love it for what it is. Sometimes I want to watch a deep and thought provoking movie with a complex storyline and sometimes I just want to keep it light. For the latter, Empire Records is perfect. <br/><br/>The primary characters are a bunch of teens working in a record store, each with their own set of problems ranging from unrequited love to attempted suicide. The plot of the story is centered around the possibility of Empire Records turning into a MusicTown, which would put an end to the kids' relaxed and fun work environment. It's simple, sure, and there's something so overdone and cliché about a bunch of teens complaining about ""the man,"" but the good music, original jokes, and hilarious antics of the store employees more than make up for this.<br/><br/>While it's true that each character is only as deep as their typical teen problem, you almost don't want to know anything else about them. The existence of their problems makes for a legitimate storyline but the absence of anything else keeps the movie light and unpretentious. Almost every one of them is likable simply because they listen to good music and make funny jokes. Ethan Embry's character Mark is hands down the best, as a lovable dopey pothead with some of the best lines in the movie. Next would have to be Rory Cochrane's character Lucas. His little sayings throughout the film aren't supposed to be taken as insightful because they're such obvious BS, just like all teenage attempts at being deep. They're hilarious because they are so empty and ridiculous. <br/><br/>It's only a nine because I hate Liv Tyler's whiny and annoying character Corey. She's smart enough to get into Harvard but stupid enough to think that offering her virginity to Rex Manning would be in any way special. Her little faux-tirade at A.J. toward the end of the movie (""You're so special and you're so talented...."" blah, blah, blah) is the absolute worst."
"write_the_wrong","7","1","2","12 September 2008"," Why do people love this movie so much?
","Empire Records has been regarded as a cult favorite from the last couple decades. The story in general is nothing special. It's predictable, generic, and at times not even existent. Lets be serious here, the film ends in about a half dozen separate miracles, every problem was solved by the end of the day  everybody's never been better, and they all dance on a rooftop. So how has this film maintained such a dedicated fan base over all these years? What this film was so successful in was having such a great cast, and an even better soundtrack. Since the plot of the film was so lacking, the film had to rely heavily on dialogue in order to push the story forward and keep the audience engaged. Every role was cast perfectly, each character unique and troubled in their own way. All of the performers played very well off of each other, when you watched the movie it truly felt as though you were watching these people for a day at their record store. All of the characters were believable, and interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Perhaps the strongest attribute to the film, however, was its soundtrack. The music throughout the film was able to keep the audience into every character, every emotion, and every scene that was appearing before them. The music was refreshing, fun, and very fitting to the scenes they were attached to. The music will probably always be regarded as the most remarkable aspect of the film.<br/><br/>What's so interesting about this movie is the fact that it is able to be so successful even without a decent story. The filmmakers were able to use different resources in order to engage an audience and keep so many people interested in the film  even so many years after its release. Empire Records truly was revolutionary for its time."

","It's closing time at empire records. Lucas has close and he is anxious about it being but with this responsibility; but then he does something wrong. He takes off with nine thousand dollars to Atlantic City and loses it in one grand gesture on the craps table. The next day he comes to realise his mistake; but he's not the only one with problems today at empire records. Through this one day we meet the rest of the employees and one day they wont forget in a long time.<br/><br/>Today is Rex Manning day; Rex is making an appearance for signings. Corey loves Rex; she's loved him since she was a child and wants to offer herself to him. A.J though loves Corey, but cant decide whether to go to art school or not. Debra is the black sheep and is suicidal, but she wont let anyone get close to her for anyone to help. The rest of the employees are some of the craziest people; it would be awesome to work at empire records.<br/><br/>This was such a surprise watch. It doesn't really try to be anything prolific about teen life; instead is a honest comedy about a group of odd characters trying to set their lives on course. The jokes are perfectly timed; just before it seems to drop the ball and go flat, it quickly catches it and your attention is brought back. This does towards the end dive deep into the sentimentality, but it fits perfectly and it works to its advantage. Its also great to see a lot of actors at the beginning of their career before they became big. Renee Zellweger, Liv Tyler and Anthony LaPaglia give good honest performances, and Robin Tunney is great as the misunderstood Debra. All the performances are actually good, everyone gave their character an honest and unique personality, they seemed like real people and you could identify and relate to them.<br/><br/>Empire Records comes from the left field and delivers a great comedy of teenage life."

"hellsablazing","10","1","2","21 March 2003"," Remarkable piece of film history-a classic!
","Empire Records is by far the most superior Generation X film ever made. It's even the best under 35 film ever made. I, as does everyone else, knows it's no Oscar material; but it never tried to make it self be that, so stop making it out to be and ripping it apart! It's brilliantly acted-probably one of the best casts ever-coordinated, greatly directed, and the script is clever, witty, AND original regardless of what non-movie buffs claim. What other film can get tarnished on a select theater run and then come back to acquire millions, even maybe a billion fans on video; bringing it towards cult status! Anything that includes Zellweger, Tunney, Tyler, Whitworth, Cochrane, and Embry in the same movie gets a thumbs up in my opinion. I only hope that someday there will be something along the lines of an E! True Hollywood story made for this film...they did it for Clueless! So what it all boils down to is that this film is a work of art-sorry, no killing people, massive sex, or violence-it actually relies on the acting and story. So whoever doesn't admire this film is either: very old, jealous, or a fan of the Scary Movie type of films! Get a life, pop in the video, and watch careers and skill be brought to life!  Empire gets an 100 from me!"

"hershiser2","7","1","2","3 November 2002"," Has some cult status
","For the most part, I don't enjoy the current wave of teen films (such as the Scream series, though I am a horror fan), as they seem entirely too fake and cheesy (the only one I truly liked was 10 Things I Hate About You, basically because I like the entire cast). Where Empire Records did seem fake (the story line of an employee blowing $9000 of the store's money gambling and the boss deciding to pay it out of his own pocket is ridiculous), for some reason I found myself enjoying it quite a bit. I think the story in this film is quite a bit better than most in this crazed genre, and its one that keeps your attention. Why? I'm not quite sure. I think one of the reasons could possibly be that I have always wanted to have a job like that. I always wanted to work to be a fun place to go to, one that you did not mind going into day after day. In some ways, it reminded me of a job I once had, as my coworkers were great, and we considered our managers as friends, and we had fun at work while we actually got things accomplished, but not to the extent of fun these people had. 	The acting in this film is quite good, surprisingly. There is only one actor (the stoner) who I found to be quite unlaughably bad (so bad he's not even funny). Where most of the actors aren't overly known (Johnny Whitworth, Rory Cochrane), they do their parts convincingly, yet failed to make a name for themselves. I found both of those actors to be quite good, yet I'd never seen them in anything before. Other key players (Renee Zellweger and Liv Tyler) have become more `mainstream' after Empire Records. 	I'd been recommended this film several times since its release, and I never thought it seemed interesting enough to sit down and watch it. I'm certainly glad I saw it, however. I believe the film has a certain rewatchability that I look for in films (that so many films lack). 	Though I don't think this film would be considered cult just yet, it certainly will gain that status some day along with the dozens of other teen movies in the genre. In another ten years or so, people will look back upon these films and undoubtedly laugh at them the way we now laugh at films from the 1980s. I am not a fan of this genre mainly because I find it quite ridiculous that they portray `teens' (however, most of the time the actors portraying these teens are actually in their 20s, which is another thing that bothers me) acting the way they do. It's even more disturbing to see some idiotic people follow the lead of these `teens' and act like this in real life, which I see more and more, and tend to avoid people like this. I do think that when looking back on this genre after 20 years that this film will be considered one of the better ones. 	Where I wouldn't recommend this film to everyone, I would have to recommend it to certain types of people."

","Empire Records is a hilarious and moving look into the lives of a group of teenagers during one day at the independent record store where they work. Though they may be very different, they all have the common bond of simply loving music. There's all types of personalities in this wonderful cast: the straight-A perfectionist with more than a few secrets (Liv Tyler), the slut who only acts the way she does to cover up her insecurities (Renee Zellweger), the lovably funny and hyperactive punk-rock kid who dreams of being in his own band (Ethan Embry), the misunderstood suicidal goth whose self-destructive ways only make you like her more (Debi Mazar), the wise father-figure *though he's still their age* who has made his own share of mistakes that have a cost (Rory Cochrane), and finally the hopeless romantic who obsesses over the people he cares about (Johnny Whitworth). This is wildly entertaining, a little bit weird, but overall a great look into 1990's culture. The whole cast is great, but standouts are Ethan Embry and Rory Cochrane who steal the scenes they are in. Also the soundtrack is awesome. Go check this one out, you won't be dissappointed! 9/10"

","This is just one of those films where you see the characters and are able say, hey, I know that guy/girl. Each of the characters portray every personality on the spectrum. From the sexy high school brain, to the burnt out kid with a ""Hash"" problem, to the suicidal youth, this film has it all. The movie plot itself revolves around the lives of the employees, all teens to early twenties. The store manager, played perfectly by Lapaglia, is stressed out because the store owner wants to turn their little town record store into a music chain store. Not to mention, one of his employees, Lucas, played brilliantly by Rory Cochrane, just stole the stores nightly deposit. Also, it's Rex Manning day. The day when a washed up has been teen idol, played comically by Max Caufield, is coming to the store to promote his new (and rather lame) album. Between the individual problems of the employees and the financial problems of the store, Joe (Lapaglia) has his hands full. This movie is held together by the performances of such new faces as Ethan Embry, Liv Tyler, Johhny Whitworth and Robin Tunney, this film is sure to go Platinum. However, there were some weak performances too. Rene Zelweger, who is best known for completing the life of Jerry Maguire, is empty and boring to watch. <br/><br/>I give this film *** (I'm taking one off for Zellweger)"

I know some people have a soft spot for this one, but not me. Empire Records is one of the most abysmally annoying films I've ever seen in my life. There is no character, no charm, no originality, no effort! It all feels like one long, poorly edited music video with a sloppy screenplay attached at the last minute. Speaking of which, this movie is written terribly! There is a point when one character commits a federal crime, which would normally result in a prison sentence, and the action is brushed off like nothing! In fact, there are multiple scenes just like this. The film also has the dignity to take difficult subject matter such as drugs, depression, and even suicide, and just brush them off in its own idiotic way before returning to more quick editing, loud music, and screaming teenagers. I want to say Empire Records is so bad it's good, but that would require actual enjoyment from the film. As far as that goes, I received none.

It tries to tell the viewer that what these kids are doing and saying are cool - but it's not. It's datedly uncool - the girl that shaved her head to be like Sinead O'Connor - really??? Was this an attempt to be the 90's version of Fast Times at Ridgemont High? I see some similar characters, but these actors can't act, and they don't have much to do in the movie except behave like dumb shallow teenagers. Obviously before CDs became the norm, there's a few nostalgic scenes with a TDK product placement sign and shelves of cassette tapes. It reminds me of Tower Records when idiots take over.

","Empire Records is arguably the closest the 90s came to channeling one of those memorable 80s teen ensembles like the Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles or Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Occurring almost entirely within the confines of an independent music store and utilizing some then fairly unknown, but quality, young actors like Liv Tyler, Renee Zellweger, Ethan Embry, Rory Cochrane, Johnny Whitworth, and Robin Tunney with an excellent older cast Maxwell Caulfield, Anthony Lapaglia and Debi Lazar.<br/><br/>Lapaglia stars as Joe Reaves, the manager of Empire Records, an independent music store facing hard times and on the verge of selling out to the Music Town franchise thanks to the evil owner Mitchell Beck (Ben Bode). For many of Reaves teenage staff, Empire Records is their last chance saloon. On the day after Lucas (Cochrane) in a last ditch attempt to save the store, steals all of the money from the store safe and loses it at a casino, Reaves tells his employees about the impending sale. With a past his prime 80s rock star Rex Manning (Caulfield, brilliant) visiting the shop to sign autographs the confused staff work through their various issues and try to come to terms with the coming change.<br/><br/>The film has an excellent soundtrack and some great comedy scenes. LaPaglia is excellent and he is ably supported by the minor players. Cochrane's Lucas and Tunney's Debra being the standouts. Though Whitmore and Tyler do their best to drag proceedings down with a fairly unremarkable love story. This was a much loved film among teen audiences when it came out in 1995, and many years on, while dated, still stands up. It goes a little more deeply into some significant issues faced by the characters, without getting bogged down by them, though it does offer some too easy solutions.<br/><br/>In the end if you take good performances, a great soundtrack, and an basic plot, you get a good movie."

","There is truly nothing I love more in this world than laughing at something that is intended to be dramatic. That is what a majority of the so called ""dramatic"" scenes did for me. This movie is intended to be a comedy with dramatic elements. I love when the drama becomes the comedy. One of my favorite touches in these kind of movies are characters like Tyler's who are going to Harvard, and the pretty boy who is secretly an amazing artist, and don't forget the slutty girl with the heart of gold. The suicide girl's character I believe was in every movie of the 90's dealing with teenagers. There is a reveal of Liv Tyler's character's speed addiction which leads to a big falling out between members of the store; this was intended to be dramatic. When the scene unfolded I found myself laughing as hard as I did when I saw Woody Allen's Bananas for the first time. This movie is very very very bad. If your in the mood for escapism than this is the movie for you or if you're dumb.<br/><br/>Also there is this scene where Liv Tyler yells at the boss in order to be the one who gives lunch to the 70's lowlife; her yell reminded me of the bad acting of Mischa Barton's yell on the O.C. very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>If you like this movie I hope that you're not an adult, if you're not you may still have a chance to be aware of what is good and what is bad.

A big franchise is about to take over, so before The Man puts them all on 'mute', they decide to go out on a high. Apart from the suicidal goth chick, of course.<br/><br/>With characters as sketchily drawn as these, it's no surprise that most of the cast are still unknown - with the notable exceptions of Renee Zellweger and Liv Tyler.

No such luck.<br/><br/>The plot is virtually non-existent, appearing to be made-up-as-they go. The opener has one of the half-dozen co-workers of a CD/record store run off to Atlantic City, determined to quadruple the embezzled daily takings, so the store won't be sold to a ruthless chain. Immediately the story switches to showing how each of the late-teen-ish store workers are ""messed up"".<br/><br/>A young shoplifter who is prosecuted, then returns with a gun, is forgiven and offered a job (apparently all in the same day). A side-plot shows a has-been Pop-Idol (with far too much pancake make-up) as a shameless womanizing creep. All ends well, when a Party-A-Thon saves the store. Lots of teen-stuff, with references to inappropriate and dangerous behavior, glamourized and made appealing. <br/><br/>This film is a disservice to films of this genre.

The screenplay is squeaky-clean corporate gobbledygook masquerading as edginess, the direction is negligible, and none of the actors seem to be acting in the same movie. It's also peculiar that, for a movie that's ostensibly for and about music lovers, it seems to have no interest in either music or music fans: Other than as a means to irritate each other, the characters don't seem particularly interested or moved by music, which is sort of like making ""Inception"" without discussing the psychology of dreams. As far as the performers go, only Renee Zellweger seems to be doing any acting here, while Ethan Embry (credited as Ethan Randall) delivers a sloppy, distracting performance that's all squeaky noises and unrestrained manic energy. It's like the filmmakers set out to make a cross between ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Reality Bites"" but didn't bother understanding what made either film effective.

This movie's paper-thin plot advanced for about the first 10 minutes, then proceeded to spin its wheel in monotony and trash comedy until the last 20 minutes.

The actors in this film come off as budget acting school dropouts, who are hardly worthy of any roles at all. Plain and simple: DO NOT BOTHER.

","This 1990s teens/20s comedy is pretty awful for the most part, but it does have its pleasures. Among them are the opportunity to watch pre-superstardom Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger prancing gorgeously around, and some appearances by other young actors who went on to do more interesting stuff. The dumb script centers around a Tower Records-like store where the characters all work. One of them took the store's proceeds and lost it all gambling, and now everyone is trying frantically to keep the place from being sold to a competitor - or something along those lines. It deserves a viewing and a few good laughs before being sent off to oblivion."
"hall895","5","0","1","8 June 2011"," Entirely unremarkable
","Once upon a time there were these places called record stores. People went to these places to buy music. Empire Records is a movie set in such a place. The young employees of Empire Records band together to try and prevent their quirky, independent store being sold to one of those big, bad corporations which will turn the place into a soulless, generic Music Town. If they'd only known the changes which would be coming to the music industry in the next decade they wouldn't have bothered. Anyone up for Empire Records 2: The Day iPods Put Us Out of Business? Eh, probably not. One movie spent with this bunch of unremarkable, unoriginal slackers is enough.<br/><br/>Empire Records is a movie which is overly familiar. We've seen so many similar stories with similar characters. There's nothing to make this movie stand out from the crowd. All the clichéd characters we've come to expect from a movie like this are here. The slut, the virgin, the depressed loner, the artist, the stoner. There's the eccentric guy, the comic relief guy, the father figure. Every character fits into a neat little box. The result is less than inspiring. The movie is incredibly predictable. There's no real drama. Attempts at comedy fall flat. The whole thing seems very unfocused. All the characters have their own little stories. But we never really spend enough time with any of those characters to become fully engaged in those stories. Everyone and everything gets tossed together into a big stew and the end result is underwhelming. Some of the performances are pretty good, with the girls generally coming off better than the boys. Watching this movie it's easy to see why Renée Zellweger, Robin Tunney and Liv Tyler were destined for bigger and better things. The guys though are rather forgettable. Probably the best male performance comes from Maxwell Caulfield playing a washed-up pop star. At least his character adds a little something different to the movie. Otherwise it's all about this group of young slackers, none of whom has an individual story which stands out and whose overriding collective quest, to save the store from corporate blandness, isn't particularly compelling. The best thing the movie has to offer is its soundtrack, a nice mid-1990s musical time capsule. But tossing some snippets from some good songs into the mix, and somehow managing to entertainingly shoehorn Gwar into the plot, isn't enough to save the movie. We've seen a lot of other movies like this one. Most of those other movies have been much better than Empire Records."

","From the title I expected this to be some sort of film charting the success of a music studio or something, it sounded like it, I had no idea it was going to be a teen movie, and a pretty good one at that. Basically Lucas (A Scanner Darkly's Rory Cochrane) is in charge of closing the Empire Records independent music store, and when he sees that the store could be taken over by another business, he decides to take the $9000 in the safe and gamble it in Atlantic City to win big and save the store, ultimately he loses it. The next day he returns to work to tell boss Joe Reaves (Lantana's Anthony LaPaglia) the bad news, and Joe punishes him to stay sat on the office sofa, and only to move if he comes up with a way to get the money back. This day happens to be the day that the store has invited pompous and fading pop singer Rex Manning (Maxwell Caulfield) to promote his new album and sign autographs. Each individual teen character, high school students and young adults working in the store, are having their own emotional problems, all coming out on this day. Overachieving student Corey Mason (The Lord of the Rings' Liv Tyler) heading for Harvard University discovers Rex isn't the lovable singer he seems to be. Lovesick A.J. (Johnny Whitworth) wants to tell Corey his feelings for her at a precise time, and when he does it's the wrong time. Gina (Renée Zellweger, a year before Jerry Maguire) is the free spirit who takes advantage of her chance to get with Rex, but it may not have been the best decision and everyone disapproves, don't worry, this will change. Debra (The Craft's Robin Tunney) entered the store immediately shaving her hair off, and continues most of the day being a hostile, antisocial and near suicidal person, burying herself in work, but she come out once in a while. Finally, Mark (Ethan Embry/Randall) is the geeky one who is willing to make a tit of himself on the live news right outside to spread the word that the store needs money to survive. There is also the frequent appearance of the shoplifter calling himself ""Warren Beatty"" (Brendan Sexton III) who starts out as a troublemaker, but everyone warms to him and are willing to forgive him, and even consider him for a job in the store. In the end, after a big alcohol and music filled party in the street and the store, they manage to raise enough money for Joe to pay manager Mitchell Beck (Ben Bode) at first for a deposit, but he allows him to buy the store for himself. Also starring Debi Mazar as Jane and Coyote Shivers as Berko. Besides the up and coming stars Tyler and a more overshadowing Zellweger appearing, Cochrane is really good as the sarcastic and near brooding at times teen, and Caulfield has his moments as the snobbish and despised disappearing pop star. What I really liked about this teen movie besides the great cast and ""let's pull together"" attitude was the soundtrack, including The Buggles' ""Video Killed The Radio Star"", Edwyn Collins' ""A Girl Like You"" and The Flying Lizards' """"Money (That's What I Want)"", a good fun comedy drama. Good!"

","Empire Records is a classic case of someone saying ""hey, I think I'll write a screenplay about the place where I work. There are all these weird, eccentric characters I can develop by easily basing them on the goofballs I work with."" The threadbare plot about a slacker who gambles away the day's record sales at Atlantic City isn't enough to sustain or entertain throughout a feature length film. The characters, while weird and eccentric, are so unlikeable and have few if any redeeming traits. The best of the lot are Liv Tyler and Renee Zellweger. The male characters are all slackers who haven't grown up yet. There's absolutely no reason why the store manager shouldn't have turned in the Lucas character to the police. There's obviously a history shared between the store manager and the employees, but the store manager only demonstrates that he's a huge pushover unable to grow up himself. The film tries to portray the manager and his employees as a surrogate family with a ""Breakfast Club"" screenplay. Then the characters release all their angst and are supposed to be a little more together and wiser at the end. It doesn't work. I don't care about any of these extremely immature idiots; they're all just annoying and need to grow up. *1/2 of 4 stars."

They did a great job of acting without taking themselves too seriously. The movie also has great quotable lines and a wonderful soundtrack.

It's funny, random, romantic, dramatic, and overall overly entertaining. It's very easy to relate to, because there's no real backbone to Empire Records, like real life.

","A friend of mine randomly let me borrow this movie and I'd heard a lot about it as if it was some kind of cult, ground-breaking movie, so I was quite looking forward to watching it. Instead i was disappointed. The first major problem was the acting, which was, lets say, CRAP, too energetic and a hint of Brady Bunch! Especially at the beginning when you see everyone arriving at work at the same time all hyped up and dancing around the store like they have nothing better to do with their lives. It made me sick! Who the hell enjoys going to work that much?<br/><br/>The film opens with one of the newest members (i presume) closing the store for the first time all by himself. He's given some simple rules: count the cash twice and don't touch Joe's (manager) beer or cigars. But being a 'teenager' in 1995, rules are made to be broken. The little bugger takes the money to a Casino to try his luck after discovering Empire Records is to be bought out. In his favour he strikes a 7 and wins but then he gets cocky and tries for another go. Guess what? He fluffs it! And that kick starts the basis of the plot that doesn't actually take off until halfway through the film. In between this we are introduced to the individual characters such as a couple of typical stoner metal-heads, the pretty-boy with a crush, the pure virgin, an attention-seeking little cow who has the world on her shoulders and symbolizes her anger by shaving her head and showing off a bandage on her wrist where she attempted suicide. DAMN RENEE ZELLWEGER'S POUTING LIPS! sorry. <br/><br/>I can't really think what else there is to say about this film.

To me it was just mediocre at best.  The beginning starts off very funny with Lucas' debacle, and I would think that they would really take that and build a decent plot around it; but the writer and director failed...miserably.<br/><br/>The problem is that this movie is way too outlandish and indecisive.  No one person is the central focus, the movie is comprised of several little sub plots, and this gives the audience no real connection to any of the characters and caused me to not give a d-mn about any of them.  What little plot the movie has is just too weak to hold up, and so many unrealistic situations happen.<br/><br/>As far as being funny, there were few moments where I genuinely laughed. And as far as being dramatic, I couldn't feel for any of the characters because of the lack of attention focused on any one of them.

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ...OK, I watched Empire Records, this is a very very bad film, it is so bad it makes me sick. It is simply nauseating rubbish. Mars Attacks and Plan Nine from Outer Space are more realistic than this. You know the set up. Like Dawson's Creek it is full of all these beautiful, intelligent teenagers who always look perfect and talk in long words...well what I am getting at is that these characters seem to be based on an American Super-Class, not un-like the Hitler Youth. Even the 'freaks' in Empire Records are these perfect-looking people who are really cool and never make any mistakes (unless it is absolutely essential to the plot). The events that happen in the movie are so far detached from real life you seem to wonder who (or why) anybody even came up with this rubbish. At one point they set up a funeral for this girl who tries to kill herself. All the staff attend leaving the 'zany', drug-taking youngen to look after the whole shop by himself...Cue comedy montage sequence.<br/><br/>The premise for the whole film seems to be that some Dawsonscreekesque character closes up the shop, finds evidence that it may be bought-out by a massive company and decides to take nine thousand dollars to a casino to save the shop. (F**k The Man!, well due to the certificate of the movie, F**k The Man becomes the much lauded Damn The Man!). He bets all nine grand, wins eighteen and then loses the lot. The first two minutes provide enough information to drive the whole film to it's conclusion.<br/><br/>What do they do with the Dawsonscreek wannabe? Do they sell-out? (no-way, Damn The Man), What beautiful situations do all the beautiful teenagers get themselves into?,  How do they save the shop? What wacky situations to the wacky teenagers get into?. Surely they have enough to support a film this bad, no? you must be kidding, what else could possibly fit into a film of this size? I know, lets have a shop-lifter (who can represent Americas misunderstood youth and therefore give the movie some moral stance and it can pretend it is actually saying something). Lets make him really ugly, no?, lets make him look a bit rough then, no?, how can we make him different from all the good-looking people? Let's give him a red sports jacket, Yes! that's it. Anyway, Shop-lifter is caught, police come and get him, at the end of the movie he comes back with a gun and shoots at everyone (blanks of course), shouting out some really emotional spiel or other along with the line - `who would give me a job?'. Ah Ha, that's it, he has no place in society, he isn't evil, just misunderstood...and guess what? They give him a job and right at the end amid all the chaos (Damn) The Man is trying to control these savages and can't operate the till (Ha Ha Ha, you may be rich but you can't operate a till, Damn YOU) and asks `Doesn't anybody work here?' and who should step-in? That's right it's the shop-lifter proudly showing The Man his name tag. ...all ends safely tied-up. Cue ending with all the perfect people dancing with each other on the roof as happy as Larry. There are many more sickening ends tied-up but I think I'd vomit if I tried to recount the whole lot. Does this film have any value? Yes, if there weren't really (REALLY) terrible movies, all we'd have is Hollywood Blockbusters and Alternative Cinema, there would be no room for the likes of Happy Gilmore. It's good to have a range, it helps put things into perspective.<br/><br/>Honest wasn't a bad movie per se, it was a nothing movie ie. it wasn't actually bad in the way that this movie is bad, it is plain old not good and fails to inspire any emotion in either direction. Empire Records has you cringing and wanting to vomit repeatedly.<br/><br/>Is there anything good about this movie? A scene which features Renee Zellweger having sex on a photocopier is never a bad thing."

","I saw this movie when I was a teen (late teens) but did not feel that it ""spoke"" to me.  There are a lot of coming of age, comedy-dramas that really identify with their core viewers but this was not one of them.  Over-acting and ridiculously obvious characters kept it from becoming the feel-good movie of the year.  It's not a waste of time however, a lot of my friends enjoyed it, there are some good laughs and eye-candy. But if you want to laugh or feel heard as an angst-ridden teen I suggest: Animal House, With Honors, Pump Up the Volume or Ferris Bueller's Day off (Cameron provides the reality :)"

","I cant believe people like this movie. This is a ripoff of Dazed and Confused and John Hughes. It shows the trials and tribulations along with the hardships of working in a record store. It is totally unrealistic and should be banned. All of the actors look like they are bored to death. I know that some of the actors have talent, with the exception of Ethan Embry but this is an embarrassment. It's only redeeming value is a cameo by Gwar and a cast of beautiful women. Too bad having gorgeous women cant save a movie. Teen dreck. Zero stars"
"blackxmas","Null","0","2","13 March 2001"," EMPIRE RECORDS a Teen Trash Classic
","In reality, this movie really stinks. It's obviously rushed, not well thought out, and reeks of mid-90's alt-slacker non-revolution. Yet it's totally interesting from a cinematic standpoint as we watch Allan Moyle cannibalize the themes from his previous teen pictures into one big ball of overly-romantic teen angst. It's compulsively watchable and highly embarrassing at the same time; you wouldn't want to be caught watching it by your friends. Everybody in this film seems to be having a good time making it and that vibe is infectious. It also gets better with repeated viewings. Go figure."

","First off, I'm a 21 year-old, so when this movie came out, it was smack targeted at my age-group, which in fact, should've ended(probably did) that 'target'with people in their mid-twenties.<br/><br/>The one bad thing I have to say is...sorry, but, I'm one of the few people who don't like Liv Tyler. Guys, I tried. Maybe someday, I will, but it hasn't gotten to that stage yet. this means that, to me, anybody could've played the part of ""Cory"". But this leads me to the next good thing about this movie.<br/><br/>See, Allan Moyle just uses actors as pions to the mood he wants to invoke. It doesn't mean that all his characters are realistic, but many times, they are. For example, the typical, ""lost soul"" kind of girl who can't find her mom, treats people like garbage, and tries to commit suicide, is cliche because it's been covered countless times in the past. But the attitude it gives us about her, almost like, 'if you don't just think about yourself, and get some humor into your life, pieces will come together' is strikingly original. Same with the other characters. I'm sure you already knows that this is directed by Allan Moyle, same guy who directed ""Pump Up The Volume."" You can sense the similarities, one of them being the cool effects that peer togetherness/pressure can bring, in Pump Up The Volume it was Slater's fans, in this flick, towards the end, all the young peers who have probably only HEARD of how cool Empire Records is, go there and raise money and help it out. In short, this is done to create Empire Records as a cult hit.<br/><br/>Okay, now cool quotes.""Lucas, where's the money?"" Joe, the money is gone. ""Where's it gone to?"" ""U-h-h...Atlantic City."" ""Really. What's it DOING in Atlantic City?!"" ""...recirculating?"" ""Lucas-"" ""Joe"" Lucas-""""Joe"" (then, about the owner) ""Lucas, I told Mitchell, you forgot to deposit the money. I told him it was still in the safe!"" ""Joe that's not true, it's in Atlantic City...I swear!""<br/><br/>and then, when Empire Records is about to become Music Town, Gina (Renee Zellweger) and Debra(the ""lost soul"" girl) are reading the rules<br/><br/>Deb- ""no tattoos or piercing."" Gina- ""No revealing clothing."" D- ""we're both screwed. At least you're used to it. G-0h, Deb. Don't be bitter. I'm sure with your ever growing collection of flesh-mutilating appendages and your new Neo-Nazi bootcamp makeover, the boys'll come-a-runnin'. D- ""Let's not fight, let's just rip.""<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on the soundtrack!!<br/><br/>5 out of 4 stars<br/><br/>See it now! Please."

","This movie is good.  Admittedly, it could've been better, but it's good. Unlike such other teen comedies such as Ten Things I Hate About You (which was really funnier than this movie) and Can't Hardly Wait (which was really a lot worse than this movie), it didn't have that make-ya-wanna-vomit ""I'm in love with you but you tell me that you don't love me at first but at the end you realize that you really do love me and we make-out"" plot.  Well actually it does, but at least this time it's just a 5 minute insignificant subplot (really, just 5 minutes).  What's good about this movie is that it doesn't try to have a deep plot, unlike other teen disasters (i.e. Suburbia).  This is a movie that's entertaining from begining to end, and it doesn't make you feel bad (i.e. Suburbia).  I really hate Suburbia.  Don't go rent Suburbia.  Rent Empire Records."

Because its a teen movie written for adults.I mean in the sense that when a teen movie is written its written by the the 50 year old fat man who needs money. But this movie is written by some one who is a teen or a person who not too long a go went through it. Its funny, dramatic and most importantly , real.<br/><br/>

"Wild One","Null","0","1","19 January 1999"," Cliched characters held me away.
","A friend of mine recommended that I watch this film so me and some other mates watched it.  I thought this was a bad movie and I wasn't going to write in about it but today I decided to check out other people's views. One person seemed to get it - LawnBoy 4 - but everybody else seemed to think it was some wonderful teenage rebellion movie.  I like a lot of teenage rebellion movies, Pump Up The Volume being one of my favs - by the same director, but I want to relate to the characters, or if not at least see some quality acting and direction.  In my opinion if you are going to introduce a straight A, Harvard-bound character who then turns 180 degrees to be revealed as a speed freak who throws herself at teen idols, then I would try to treat her with a little bit of understated reality based direction, try to make such a huge turn around seem possible.  These characters, especially Warren, got on my nerves.  The only people that I could relate them to are other characters from other similarly cliched films or even comic books.  Empire Records is a bad movie.  I think it is time someone made a true nineties teenage rebellion flick, dark, honest and real."

","I just finished watching this movie. let me start by saying that I usually dont comment on movies, unless they are exceptionally good or exceptionally bad. normally I just leave a rating. I'll admit, I downloaded this movie purely because Liv Tyler was in it. My expectations were not all that high, just that it have something resembling a plot, decent acting and that she look good in it. Well, they got one of those right, and it damn sure wasn't the acting or the plot. what kind of high quality **** are these people smoking and where can I get some of this stuff. Okay, the main story line of this movie is that this kid stole over $9000 dollars from his employer. this is not a spoiler by the way, it occurs in the first five minutes of the movie. The only form of punishment that he is subjected to is that he has to sit on the couch. no police report, no termination of employment, as a matter of fact, the manager tries to commit fraud to cover up for this guy. Horrible acting, one of the basic 14 or so plots floating around in hollywood, just the names and places substituted. I gave it 3/10, just because of the fact that liv tyler appeared in her underwear, and that you get to see rene zellweger in skimpy clothing, but that was being liberal. I just don't like giving anything a real low score. I dont know what else I can possibly say that could be considered positive. don't waste your time. later."

","Despite a fairly heavy layer of schmaltz, this is a fun, heartwarming film. More in the style of an eighties, John Hughes-style teen comedy than the more clever-clever nineties batch it came along with, this basically follows a gang of semi-stereotyped kids all working in a wacky record shop, dealing with their adolescent issues and trying to save their store; of course the answer to all their problems turns out to be a big party at the end. Most of the characters are pretty lovable, all interesting; the actors, particularly the less well-known ones, all perform brilliantly and seem to be having a great time doing it. Even the most hardened cynic will find it hard not to smile, particularly at the end."
"eve6kicksass","Null","0","1","19 February 2002"," The worst movie ever made...until Feb 15, 2002 that is...
","Title:  EMPIRE RECORDS Rating: 0 stars (out of 5)<br/><br/>If you don't get the summary line, it means that Britney Spears' CROSSROADS will probably take the title of worst movie ever made from this. In writing a review of EMPIRE RECORDS, I will admit that I'm making an opinion, though it is agreed by virtually all of my friends, a lot of people I'm not friends with and every single critic to see this piece of crap.  I will explain as well as listing some *spoliers*. RECORDS is set in a----oh, hell, you should know anyway---and features a group of teenagers who work there and attempt to save it from being bought by another company and turned into something else.  That is all of the plot to speak of, and it's been used so many times before that it can't be labeled as being formulaic anymore. The reason why this film is liked by so many people aged 14-22 is mostly because they say it's funny.  Here's my question:  what was funny?  The film opens up with the person working closing down, taking (no, sorry, stealing) a lot of money out of the cash register, and losing it all in Vegas.  Yeah, really funny....and for those of you who found it funny...would you do that?  Riiiight!!! Many of these characters are so stupid they make the Three Stooges look like Nobel prize winners.  What upset me more is that they are so stereotypical.  Anybody who says that these are what real teenagers are like must be mad.  I mean, this girl goes in the bathroom and shaves all her hair off....uh, why?  Because she's rebelling? (now there's a spoiler for you)....oh, yeah, that would be the excuse of anyone who loves this movie. Hell, if you want to rebel why don't you go to Las Vegas and become a street-walking whore! Another reason why some people love this film...because the actors are hot?  THIS IS A MOVIE PEOPLE!!!  These people are supposed to be ACTING, not modelling.  If you really think Ethan Embry is ""hot,"" buy a damn pin-up calendar!  God, no wonder many brainless girls like this movie!  Every performance in this movie is so unbelievable, unrealistic and not even poor enough to be funny.  That includes the script, which contains some of the worst dialogue ever contributed to a movie (though not as bad as some of the lines in CAN'T HARDLY WAIT). In my closing paragraph, I want to say I met someone once who called this movie THE BREAKFAST CLUB of the 90s.  Oh, yes, and did I mention that this person is in a sorority, a cheerleader, and listens to New Kids on the Block?  I remember the days when I worked at a video store and destroyed every copy of this film and upsetting so many bimbos who wanted to rent it...rent LUCAS instead, that is the film about REAL teenagers."
