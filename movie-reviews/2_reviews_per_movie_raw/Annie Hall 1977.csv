","The film that bested Star Wars for the 1977 Best Picture Oscar, Annie Hall is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking that transcends its simple, romantic premise to create a stunning portrait of not only 70's pop culture, but of human nature cumulative.  Directed and co-written by Woody Allen, who has since directed other gems such as Hannah and Her Sisters and The Purple Rose of Cairo, Annie Hall also stars Allen as Alvy Singer, a neurotic, death-obsessed comedian who seems unlucky in love and life.  That is until he meets Annie, brilliantly played by Diane Keaton, who is beautiful, fashion-savvy, carefree (she likes using expressions like `la di da'), and a terrible driver.<br/><br/>Annie and Alvy's relationship is an unlikely one.  She's a Midwestern girl, straight out of white-bread Wisconsin; he's a life-long New York Jew who grew up (literally) under the Coney Island roller coaster.  He's been seeing a therapist for the past 16 years; she only `needs' one once she meets him. She's an extroverted aspiring singer; he's an introverted, world-despising imp.  Yet Allen and Keaton are so perfect in their roles, they improbably make this couple one of the most memorable ever.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Alvy's chronicles of loves lost and a retrospective on his relationship with Annie, with whom he has since parted ways.  At the end of the film, we see Alvy try his hand at stage-writing-he writes a play about his relationship with Annie, but gives it a happy ending.  Yes, Annie and Alvy don't have a fairy tale ending to their relationship, but Alvy certainly wishes they had, even though he learns to live with the acknowledgment it has failed.<br/><br/>The best part of Annie Hall is its incredible screenplay-the best ever to be written.  Not a word is wasted nor a line unquotable.  Except here, while Allen's early films had thrived on streams of one-liners, Allen doesn't go for cheap laughs-each line is simultaneously hilarious and poignant. Everything is part of a greater whole.  We laugh because it's funny, but there's a greater dynamic at work in Annie Hall.  This is a story not exclusively about a relationship between two people, but also a musing on 70's politics, drugs, East Coast/West Coast rivalry, narcissism, religion, celebrity, and several other topics with which Allen deals with extraordinary ease.<br/><br/>Yet Annie Hall would not be among my favorite films of all-time if it were just Woody Allen ranting and raving about what he likes and dislikes. There are other Allen films that serve that purpose, i.e. Deconstructing Harry, and they're not nearly as good.  What separates Annie Hall is its grace, the believable chemistry between Keaton and Allen, the unique direction (ranging from split-screens to cartoon imagery to on-screen subtitles of what the actors are thinking), but mostly because it's the rare film to find a perfect balance between sheer entertainment, humor, and poignancy.<br/><br/>
When the dust had settled, Diane Keaton deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance, Allen took home Oscars for direction and writing, and the film beat out Star Wars for Best Picture, which most people consider a complete sham.  Evidently, those people didn't see Annie Hall, for if they had, they'd recognize that the acting, writing, and even the direction in Star Wars can't hold a candle to Annie Hall, one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>10/10"
"FilmOtaku","9","159","210","16 May 2004"," A perfect romantic comedy
","`Annie Hall', long thought to be Woody Allen's opus, is perhaps a perfect romantic comedy because it not only shows the happy, touching moments of relationships, but also displays the reality of coupling  the occasional waning of interest in one another, the hypercritical moments, etc.  It is absolutely brilliantly written; Woody Allen exhibits his usual dry humor and self-deprecation, but also his sensitive, passionate and romantic side.  It was because of this film that I fell in love with Woody Allen at the age of twelve (take your cheap shot here) and almost twenty years later he still is that intellectual, bookish and humorous ideal.  Diane Keaton was his muse and co-star for this film, and they are perfect counterparts  so much so that their interaction onscreen doesn't seem like viewing two actors in a film, but is a much more voyeuristic experience.  Watching `Annie Hall' is like sitting at a bistro table and observing another couple a few tables away, and that is just one of the elements that make this film so endearing. Most people can relate to at least some aspects of Alvy and Annie's relationship, which helps make this film a timeless one. <br/><br/>
However, `Annie Hall' is not just a good romantic comedy; it is a film that engages some unusual storytelling techniques.  Actors speak directly to the audience, characters interact with strangers on the street who just happen to know the answers to the personal questions posed, there is a brief animation scene, etc.  While none of these approaches were new in 1977, their execution was inspired.  `Annie Hall' is like a fond memory, or a favorite old song  anytime I have discussed this film with others their smiling expressions are usually tinged with a hint of nostalgia, because one can look back on either their past or current relationship and do what precious few films allow us to do  relate on a personal level.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"WriterDave","9","68","91","12 February 2006"," I Forgot My Mantra....
","Woody Allen's seminal 1977 romantic comedy ""Annie Hall"" is not only laugh-out-loud funny (with some of the most quotable dialogue ever written for the screen...this is the ""Casablanca"" of comedies, folks) but also sweet and charming (due in large part because of Diane Keaton's smashing performance as the title character, the flighty singer from Wisconsin with a quirky fashion sense and ""neat"" outlook on life) without ever turning trite or sappy like so many romantic comedies tend to do. Allen wisely deconstructed the genre with his non-linear story-line (something that was later done to even greater effect with a more recent and profound look at relationships, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") and charming little theatrical tricks like talking to the audience or pulling extras into the scene for their opinions on what's been going on. It keeps the viewer off guard and allows for a free flow of comedic and philosophical ideas that might otherwise not have found their way into a more traditional film.<br/><br/>In his latter years, Allen's best work has been when he is not part of the cast (my personal favorites being ""Bulletts over Broadway,"" ""Sweet and Lowdown,"" and the recent ""Match Point""). ""Annie Hall"" was made in his heyday when he could still pull off playing a neurotic New York Jewish comedienne with charm and panache. There's something innocent and benign about his obsessions here, as this was long before the Woody/Soon-Yi fiasco and the days of grossly miscasting himself against younger female co-stars. Yes, Mr. Allen has been artsier (witness ""Manhattan"") and more satirical (witness ""Zelig"") but here, with Diane Keaton as his muse, he was never more charming or funnier."
"nycritic","10","79","107","23 January 2006"," Landmark Storytelling from Allen's Creative Mind
","At the time, no one had done this: tell a story in the manner that Woody Allen did. Even though many films up until then were talky, with minimal action, with the exception of CITIZEN KANE, nothing of the sort prepared the audience at the time for what they were witnessing: scenes that introduced dialog between two actors much before they actually showed on screen. Scenes in which actors interacted with the past as if it were the present. Scenes in which actors who aren't in the same frame even when they are on screen talk to each other. Scenes in which what the characters are saying does not match their thought bubbles and we are privy to their thoughts. The discussion of an intellectual's work which suddenly produces the said individual, among many more.<br/><br/>ANNIE HALL is a unique film that still looks fresh, even when the style in itself is very 70s. This is a story of a breakup told in a non-linear pattern, showing how these two disparate yet similar people -- Alvy Singer and Annie Hall -- came together, shared their neuroses, went through hilarious times and then went into the slow plateau that became their eventual separation. This is not the kind of story that Hollywood likes to tell and it's quite admirable that Allen was able to not only get away with it but to walk away with the major awards (as well as give then girlfriend Diane Keaton her own Best Actress award) because this being such an intellectual film and not one where the actors all look glamorous, it broke new grounds for a novel way of presenting a film.<br/><br/>Groundbreaking is the definite term here. Had there been no ANNIE HALL, there would have never been ALLY MACBEAL or SEX AND THE CITY, two successful sitcoms that features inner dialog, people talking directly to the camera (and therefore winking at the audience), fantasy sequences, and modern views of how people react to each other. Balancing slapstick with drama, it is also one of the saddest comedies to ever been made and anyone who has seen the final sequence -- which plays out what the film has mentioned all along, that this is their breakup -- knows the heartbreak that unfolds over Diane Keaton's haunting vocals. One of the ten most influential movies of all time."
"BratBoy-2","Null","107","151","22 February 2000"," A wonderfully modern romance
","Woody Allen's masterpiece will always be ""Annie Hall.""  What is most remarkable today about this film is the way Allen presents it.  It's a movie about a relationship.  But rather than taking a linear approach, Allen plays with time.  We see the middle, the begining, and the end. And not always in that order.  Allen also breaks the fourth wall a lot and has many dream sequences and asides which add to the complexity of the characters.  This is a highly autobiographical film and Allen pulls no punches.  This movie is not about romance in the way that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is.  Rather, ""Annie Hall"" is a deconstruction of a romance.  At times it is funny and heartbreaking and always classic.  ""Love fades,"" indeed."
"IkuharaKunihiko","10","63","87","27 December 2005"," A masterpiece, when you think about it
","Sometimes I wish Woody Allen was cool and self confident, and not always nervous, unsure and geeky all the time. But you can't deny that he's a very intelligent person. His best film, the quiet and understated masterpiece ""Annie Hall"", is so full of jokes and inventive style it can make your head spin. Actually, this is one film I wish I had a script of so I could slowly read all those dialogs which are being said too fast. In 1978 ""Annie Hall"" beat ""Star Wars"" and won 4 Oscars ( Best picture, director, screenplay, actress Diane Keaton ) and one Golden Globe ( Best actress Diane Keaton ).<br/><br/>-------- <br/><br/>The simple comedy about a romance between the New York comedian Alvy and Annie is enriched by tons of emotions and inventive film techniques which even Jean-Luc Godard would be jealous of. In one scene Alvy is talking to Annie about art while the subtitles are presenting his *real* words, about how he wants to take her out! In the other they are having intercourse in bed while Annie's ghost/mind is absent and sitting on a chair! Alvy is walking down the street and saying how he watched the animated movie ""Snow White and the seven dwarfs"" and fell in love with the witch and presto, in the next scene he is drawn in animation in the middle of that film, having an argument with his lover, the witch. The list goes on and on.<br/><br/>I remember that I couldn't watch this film when I was a kid. I found it to be too boring. But today I completely understand it. You just have to think about it. Like when Alvy is so happy he says to Annie that he doesn't just love her, but that he ""luurves her, loaves her and luuf's her."" Also, some of the gags are simply quietly hilarious, like when the hero is narrating his society as a child, commenting on everything ( ""Those who don't know nothing, teach. Those who don't know how to teach, teach gym. And those don't know even that, teach at our school."" ).<br/><br/>Grade: 10/10"
"ackstasis","9","44","61","7 June 2008"," ""That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing""
","Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is something of a hopeless romantic. A cynical, death-obsessed New York Jewish comedian, Singer has never been able to maintain a steady relationship with a woman. He has been married twice, and divorced twice. He broke up with one woman because of their disagreements over the ""second shooter"" conspiracy of John F. Kennedy's assassination, or perhaps that was just his excuse. To paraphrase Freud, possibly Groucho Marx, he simply ""would never want to belong to any club that would accept someone like him for a member."" He doesn't drive because he is paranoid about driving; he has been seeing a psychiatrist for the past fifteen years, though these appointments were long ago reduced to simple ""whining"" sessions. There is an inherent uncertainty in everything that Singer says  as though he really knows what he's talking about, but he can't convince himself that he's got it right.<br/><br/>When he accompanies a friend (Tony Roberts) to a tennis game, Singer's first and foremost concern is that the club will deny him entry because he's a Jew. However, that fateful game serves forth something so much more significant and life-changing  he comes to meet the ditsy and exuberant Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Despite clearly having very little in common, something clicks between the two eligibles, and they embark on a tumultuous years-long relationship that will inevitably fail to materialise into anything further. Erupting with clever dialogue and witty cultural references, 'Annie Hall's' script is one of the best you'll ever see. Not only is the conversation entertaining to listen to, but  even with all the talking to the camera and interacting with random extras  it actually manages to seem startlingly realistic. This is no small thanks, of course, to the main actors, who embody their characters so perfectly that we're unsure if they are acting or merely playing themselves.<br/><br/>Though he had previously released a few well-received, light-hearted affairs, it was 'Annie Hall' that blasted writer/actor/director Woody Allen into the realms of super-stardom. In an uncharacteristic move for the Academy, Allen's film won four 1978 Oscars, including Best Actress (Keaton), Best Original Screenplay (Allen, Marshall Brickman), Best Director (Allen) and Best Picture  not undeservedly, though millions of 'Star Wars' fans would, I'm sure, disagree. Having revisited 'Annie Hall' for the first time in a year, having since enjoyed many of Allen's other films, I am genuinely amazed at his transition from silly comedian to insightful observer on human relationships. Of course, a noticeable evolution in his film-making style is evident in both the science-fiction 'Sleeper (1973)' and the Russian historical spoof 'Love and Death (1975),' but neither boasts the the intelligence nor the sophistication of this film, which wholly discards the Chaplin-like slapstick of Allen's previous films and adopts the Tracy-Hepburn screwball comedy of a decade later.<br/><br/>Originally slated  and filmed, in fact  as a New York murder mystery with a romantic sub-plot, 'Annie Hall' was taken by editor Ralph Rosenbaum and cut down (massacred, if you will) into the modern, witty 1970s screwball comedy that we still enjoy today. It is truly amazing that such an extensive post-production reshaping had no obvious ill effects upon the general flow of the film, though the structure in itself is so hectic that we probably wouldn't notice it, anyway: Allen frequently cuts forwards and backwards in time, his modern characters are able to revisit and discuss the past, characters in split screens interact, Allen regularly breaks the ""fourth wall"" and addresses the audience directly. Some of the discarded murder mystery elements from 'Annie Hall' were later incorporated into another Allen film, 'Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993),' which also co-starred Keaton.<br/><br/>Aside from Allen and Keaton, numerous smaller roles provide a crucial framework for the overall structure of the film. Tony Roberts is Rob, Singer's old friend and confidant. Paul Simon (of Simon and Garfunkel) plays a record producer who takes a keen interest in both Annie and her singing. Shelley Duvall is a reporter for 'The Rolling Stone' magazine, and a one-time girlfriend of Singer. There are also tiny early roles for Christopher Walken (as Annie's somewhat disturbed brother), Jeff Goldblum (who speaks one memorable line at a party  ""Hello? I forgot my mantra"") and Sigourney Weaver (who can be briefly glimpsed as Singer's date outside a theatre). Two slightly more unusual cameos come from Truman Capote (as a Truman Capote-lookalike, no less) and scholar Marshall McLuhan (whom Singer suddenly procures from behind a movie poster to declare to a talkative film-goer that ""you know nothing of my work!"").<br/><br/>Easily the most innovative and energetic of the films I've so far seen from Woody Allen, 'Annie Hall' is a spirited glimpse at the incompatibility of human beings, and a cynical yet bittersweet meditation on the falsity of the perfect romantic Hollywood ending. It is also a considerable comedic achievement, and Allen would repeatedly recycle his trademark neurotic New Yorker screen persona, most notably in 'Manhattan (1979),' but never with more success than this premium outing in excellence. The engagingly-convoluted storyline moves with such briskness that you don't realise just how very little happens, and that, by the film's end, our characters are exactly where they were at the beginning. Nevertheless, Allen manages to say something significant about human relationships  they're totally irrational, crazy and absurd, but we keep attempting them because of what they give us in return. Or, at least, what we think they give us."
"boycebrown-1","10","81","119","14 May 2004"," Witty and Charming, one of Allen's greatest achievements.
","Annie Hall is a movie about life.  In recent films, there are fairly predictable endings.  (i.e. guy gets girl after chase scene in Manhattan). Annie Hall goes against the grain of movies.  There is definite chemistry between Allen and Keaton.  That is one of the main reasons this movie is successful.  Alvy and Annie do not have high wage jobs, they do not go clubbing, nor are they incredibly attractive.  Why does a movie character relationship have to be so extreme it's unconvincing?  These days movie producers create plots that are unbelievable.  They don't have any depth and usually have shallow intentions.  You can sense that the two leads care for each other.  The situations in this movie resemble real life and that is why it is so critically acclaimed and remembered. Sure Woody talked into the camera, but that, in a sense is real life as well.  It reminds me of my usual thought process and how when I think; I feel as though I'm presenting my thoughts to myself.  Only he is, presenting it to us.   This movie is clever and thought provoking.  If you're looking for the opposite of a yearly run of the mill movie, this is for you."

","""Annie Hall"" is a brilliant romantic comedy that could have only been made by Woody Allen (Oscar-winning in directing and writing, nominated in acting). Allen stars as a Jewish stand-up comic who falls in love with aspiring actress Diane Keaton (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn as the titled character). Their relationship is explored throughout the course of the film in a gentle and warm-hearted way. Allen's unique views and brand of humor are prevalent from start to finish and the film is clearly made in the 1970s as many issues from that time period are explored as the film progresses. ""Annie Hall"" is simple in many ways, but deals with romantic issues in complex ways and the film is just so intelligent that it is near impossible to dislike. Woody Allen is brilliant as he usually is. Diane Keaton hit super-stardom as well with her role. The supporting cast includes the likes of Carol Kane, Shelley Duvall, Tony Roberts, Christopher Walken and Colleen Dewhurst. Look for an unknown Jeff Goldblum as an extra during the Los Angeles sequence. 5 stars out of 5."
"tedg","Null","75","117","28 June 2002"," The Story about the Story
","Woody is an intelligent man who worries about the issues of film-making. The primary concern, the very first problem, is always to decide what the relationships are among the audience, the camera, the narrator if any, and the characters.<br/><br/>Woody was on his way to making a murder mystery, which is the purest form of messing about with these relationships. In a much studied decision, they decided to cut out all the mystery and just focus on the context. In this case, that context is a richly layered evocation of a relationship. I really wish I could see the original film to discover the mysteries Woody intended to hide in the folds.<br/><br/>And the folds are as numerous and complex as they can get. We have a framing device where Woody speaks to us partly as a conversation which blends into a standup, which is mirrored as a part of the story. We have timeshifting where we move back and forth in time in a simple 'Tarantino' way; but we go way past: characters from the 'present' enter the past as Dickensian ghosts, then they talk to characters in the past. we have characters in different pasts talking to each other via split screen. We have a layering of Woody and Diane's relationship in real life, then the film, then TWO films within: a play which is part of the action and a cartoon which is the action itself.<br/><br/>More: we have Woody talking to the audience as if we were shifted into the play -- early in that play we are introduced to Bergman and Fellini: in both cases while they are waiting outside. These are the two inventors of folded narrative. Even more: while some bozo perfessor spouts off about Fellini and McLuhan, Woody enlists the audience to challenge him and drags out McLuhan himself! The joke of course is that McLuhan himself was a vapid weaver of lowbrow theories.<br/><br/>And more and more with the constant weaving of 'analysis' and other film-like activities: singers, photographers, TeeVee stars, models...<br/><br/>This period was when he was first exposed to Wallace Shawn who was hanging out with Terrence Malick, two other innovators in narrative folding. All the 'New Yorker' stuff means more when you know Shawn's father was the long-time editor of that publication and defined the self-absorbed reflection that characterizes the city and this film.<br/><br/>Keaton's manner was essential to pulling this off, someone who could pull off the story about her uncle dying while waiting for a Turkey. Watch her.. she is clued in to simultaneously being in herself (Keaton), herself (Hall), inside the story she is telling and inside the story Woody is telling. She shifts and guffaws just as if she were stoned and moving among realities, just as her character.<br/><br/>Just amazing and intelligent. Will we ever see this the way it was written and shot? Or is that mystery too intelligent for us, who prefer to think of this as a funny, endearing love story."
"MarieGabrielle","10","40","60","7 February 2006"," Classic and still timely
","I had forgotten about how hilarious this film was, even though I had seen it as a teenager many times. Since Marshall Brickman wrote the script, it is brilliant; like the part where Diane Keaton orders a pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise, in a NY deli.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's expressions and character studies are priceless, and at this point he was at the top of his game. Some of his films now are redundant ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" seemed too contrived. But this film was a realistic comedy between him and Keaton, their analysis (no New Yorker in the 70's should be without an analyst!), and their eventual break-up when she relocates to L.A.<br/><br/>Paul Simon and Jeff Goldblum portray other L.A. characters, and there is a bit part with Christopher Walken as Keaton's suicidal brother (excellent). Rent this film again if you haven't seen it in awhile; some scenes are classic, and one of the best is Christmas in L.A. as Tony Roberts drives Allen through Beverly Hills: Keaton: ""Wow. It's so clean out here"" Allen: ""Yeah that's because they never throw out their garbage they just put it on TV"".<br/><br/>Great...Woody Allen we need your humor again, please write something decent for American audiences with a brain."

","Annie Hall shows us the love story between Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). We watch Alvy as he matures and moves through several relationships set against the true love of his life: Annie Hall.<br/><br/>Alvy helps Annie grow and come out of her shell as evinced by the growth of Annies blossoming singing career. Even the songs are a metaphor for their relationship. Her first song ""It had to be you"" when their relationship starts. Later she sings in a mature, sultry voice ""Seems like old times."" Set against snapshots of their romance.<br/><br/>Keep your eye out for these young actors: Christopher Walken pre-Deer Hunter, as Annie's psycho brother ""I dream of turning the wheel into the on coming lights."" Alvy interrupts him ""I have to get back to the planet earth."" Jeff Goldblum pre-Big Chill, Jurassic Park, The Fly, In Tony Lacey's house calling his guru: ""I forgot my mantra."" Paul Simon as Tony Lacey a Californian music star. Carol Kane as Alvy's first wife whose relationship is influenced by Alvy's obsession with JFK's assassination conspiracy theories. Colleen Dewhurst, Annie's WASP mother, talking through the split screen to Alvy's mother. See if you can spot Sigourney Weaver as Alvy's date standing in front of the movie theater when Alvy meets Annie in NY at the end of the movie. Watch Gary Mule Deer in full afro when Alvy meets Annie in California. Now Gary tours with Johnny Mathis. Shelly Duvall as the transcendent Rolling Stone reporter. In a few years she will become Olive Oyl then Wendy of the famous ""Here's Johnny"" scene from the shining. My, how this movie hasn't aged at all. And that really is Truman Capote walking through the park when Alvy says, ""And this guy gets the Truman Capote look-alike award."" <br/><br/>You have got to like Tony Robbins, a square jawed ladies man in many of Woody Allen's movies (Radio Days, A midsummer nights sex comedy, Play it again Sam). You don't mind seeing Robbins type cast because you instantly know that he is going to be the perfect opposite of Allen's angst filled Alvy.<br/><br/>Another Woody Allen directing feature that I happen to like is his use of the split screen and the fixed screen. In both, the camera doesn't move thereby forcing you to get involved in the dialogue. These techniques work because Woody Allen has strong, tight dialogue and truly dramatic actors.<br/><br/>Many of the scenes from the late 70's and early 80's are wonderful to watch because they reflect the matter of fact mores and fads of the time: Snorting cocaine was cool, the veggie-burger-tofu California scene, the liberal Columbia college satire.<br/><br/>Listen carefully to the background chatter during the California scene at Tony Lacey's house with swinging' hip background music. Hysterical lines that you can use in your office today: ""Right now it is only a notion, but I think I can get the money to make it into a concept then later turn it into an idea."" Woody Allen has satirized and captured the language and mind set of the entire movie/music industries. <br/><br/>A memorable scene is when Alvy pulls Marshall McLuhan out from behind a movie placard to refute some bombastic guy pontificating about McLuhan's poetry. You wish you could do the same.<br/><br/>Truly a great movie that ages well and has a sweet message about romance."

","This film is probably one of the worst if not the worst films to take home an Oscar. Woody Allen has made a career out of wiping his ""ego"" on celluloid and calling it a feature movie. It's funny how in every film of Woody Allen's, he portrays the women in it as these stupid, ditsy, uninformed containers, while he is always the all-knowing, critical, sharp-remarking, neurotic genius who has been put there to enlighten these women on the world. Of course, the relationship fails in this film, as it reflects his personal life and taste in women...Annie Hall must have been too old for his liking or possessed too much of a will or a brain. What you do get in a Woody Allen film such as this, is two hours of his crappy, shallow, dishonest diatribe that conceals the creep inside of the ego. Annie Hall feels more like a fake, constructed front for a movie rather than delving into real emotional territory, but then, we are talking about Woody Allen."

","What a disaster of a film this is. Ironic in that it's everything it touts it hates. It appeals to a certain kind of culture especially at the time of its creation that functions only a thin layer beneath superficiality. As though just because of its constant and worthless, meaningless postmodern cynicism it actually means something real. But it's pure emptiness - there is no feeling or human soul or spirit in any of the film, and the center of it all is Annie and Alvy, with not an ounce of love between them. Plus the latter is excruciating, nauseatingly painful to watch for two minutes let alone ninety.<br/><br/>It appeals to the mind, not to the heart. It is exactly the kind of intellectualism it claims to hate.<br/><br/>The movie staggers constantly, flickering between occasional bouts of experimental wonder (I loved the animated scene) and rabid pseudo-intellectualist circlejerking. There's some knowledge behind it, but it's only mere name-drops. And again, for a movie about love it certainly is totally devoid of it. There's no real communication between the two main characters, it's all fluff, all gimmick. No genuine emotion exists in Annie Hall the movie.<br/><br/>I almost take it as a personal offense that the slopped-up holier- than-thou script is regarded as one of cinema's greatest.

","I realize I'm taking on an icon here, but honestly, this is the most disgustingly boring and over-rated film to come out of the 1970's. It is unfortunate that the rather pathetic Woody Allen, an admittedly intelligent man who alas squanders his considerable talents, firmly believes that the cosmos revolves around his legendary neuroses. Even more unfortunate, is the fact that he has succeeded in persuading a large percentage of the Western world to agree with him. Frankly, it does not speak well of our culture.<br/><br/>This (yawn) movie revolves around a pair of self absorbed lovers...a neurotic New York comedian, Alvy Singer (played by Woody) and a would-be singer, Annie Hall. The two, both in analysis, move in together so they can exchange tales of their professional, paid for navel gazing. I certainly wouldn't want to imply that it might be simply for the convenient sex. The rest of this so called neurotic romance is far too inconsequential to bother detailing here.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is played by Diane Keaton, an actress who is actually very competent. Her movies are frequently not my favorite, though I did enjoy the cute Baby Boom. Her only memorable aspect in this film is her Ralph Lauren clothes, now of course quite dated, which supposedly caused a fashion revolution at the time. <br/><br/>That classic comment of Woody's regarding sex, ""This is the most fun I've had without laughing"" doesn't particularly impress me with its brilliance. Fear not, Shakespeare, Woody serves as no threat to you as master of the English language. It is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless, uninspiring, unoriginal, and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on Mount Olympus.<br/><br/>Annie Hall isn't the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, but it really doesn't have much to recommend it. I normally adore romances, but neither one of these two selfish neurotics captured my sympathy or even remote interest. Furthermore, the supposed witty banter between the pair failed woefully to either entertain or amuse me. Back in 1977 when I saw this movie at the theatre with my husband (then boyfriend), we both sincerely wished we'd found some paint and watched it dry instead. I guess this intellectual comedy was just far too complicated for little old us to appreciate."

","Woody Allen's puerile comedy reaches a true dramatic climax through a bit of unintended irony in the often-discussed ""movie line"" scene.  In this scene we witness one pedant criticizing the pedantry of another in the middle of what is essentially a 90 minute diatribe.  This scene sets up the remainder of an unbelievably hubristic film in which we will watch Woody (Why does he bother calling himself Alvy?) promoting the person he admires most.  I'm still trying to understand how some might construe an assembly of self-consciously scripted one-liners as a coherent story.  The humor in this film was so contrived that I began waiting for drumrolls after lines like ""I never undress in front of a man of my own gender"" and even began to wonder if a few years in Manhattan would see Rodney Dangerfield swapping jokes with Allen in an onstage partnership. By the time Woody uses all of the affect he can muster to pull off a suddenly sentimental closing scene, I refused to believe that he actually felt capable of evincing some sort of emotional response from the audience. Pathos is never a temptation for the viewer who is simply not interested in Woody Allen's life or those of celebrities in general. <br/><br/>As for the purported technical brilliance of the film (obnoxious postmodern pandering), I found it to be a hackneyed hodgepodge of Nouvelle Vague tricks pulled off with much less tact.  For the sake of comparison, a film that does pull all of these elements together in a brilliantly funny and emotive package is Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player.""  ""Annie Hall"" was my first Woody Allen film and will probably be the last."

Fortunately, by the mid-80's people finally started to wise up to this shyster, and that's why every movie he makes completely bombs.<br/><br/>It's not about ""getting it"" - oh how I hate it when elitists like Allen fanatics try to pull that crap on people.

Play It Again Sam was OK. Broadway Danny Rose was OK. A few more were OK. But really. ""Annie Hall"" is a joke. It's not clever, it's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's a farce. It's a great trick that Allen pulled on audiences and he got away with it. In 1977, he must have been laughing like mad behind everyone's backs. ""I can't believe how great they are saying this movie is!!"" My goodness. You gotta give Allen credit in a strange way though. For putting a mess like this out in theaters takes nerve. Politely smiling while everyone is praising your film that you know is a piece of crap takes nerve. Woody proves that old saying miscredited to P.T. Barnum is totally true!"

","Back in 1977 Star Wars was conquering the entire world. Amassing box office numbers never before even imagined, Star Wars was truly becoming a massive part of American culture very, very quickly. With brilliant writing, casting, direction, and also a good dose of fun, Star Wars is hands-down one of the top movies of all time. It was expected to sweep the Oscars that year. But, the film would be overshadowed at the Oscars by the quiet film Annie Hall. Annie Hall put Woody Allen on the map and made him a star. The film would also launch the career of Diane Keaton. Using a very unique form of storytelling that would become perfected by Quinten Tarantino, Annie Hall is totally not the average love story, for many many reasons.<br/><br/>But, just because of it being a different kind of film, it does not make it any more entertaining. Annie Hall is charming, it does have a few laughs, but it is nowhere near the greatest film of all time. It is not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar, nor is it worthy of being listed as a true classic. Instead, the film should just be accepted as one of the more groundbreaking filming achievements of the 1970s, and nothing more. Woody Allen's one-joke film (the entire film focuses around the bizarre personality of the main character) clocks in at a decent amount of time and offers a realistic bittersweet ending, but seems to lack that punch that truly makes it a standout film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a very nervous and neurotic comedian by the name of Alvy Singer who falls in love with this interesting and pretty singer Annie Hall. Throughout the film, you see the ups and downs of the relationships, and also get glimpses into the pasts of both people in order to get an idea as to why they are the way they are, and why they have so much chemistry together. The best part of this movie is the chemistry Allen and Keaton have. When they are together, you can sense the love and care thy have for each other. Both performances were excellent; they truly were the ones carrying the film. Everyone else in the film really carried no weight and are totally forgettable characters, besides Christopher Walken's character, which shared a very funny moment with Woody Allen.<br/><br/>Annie Hall denies the fact that there is a fourth wall, as the film has the main character talking to the audience. This is not the only bizarre element of the film. The movie has many things that prior to being released, had not been witnessed before, which included the thoughts of two people talking to each other as they engaged in conversation, also has tons of flashbacks and moments in which the main characters interact with their past counterparts. All these little unique moments throughout the movie make this movie very fresh, very different from the average romantic comedy. While these little things do enhance the experience a little, it fails to save the movie from at times being a bit boring or a bit tedious. There is just way too much time in between laughs.<br/><br/>The humor is at times a bit dry, which could be another reason why it appealed to so many but did not appeal much to me. I personally thought Napoleon Dynamite was the worst comedy within the past three decades. Annie Hall is no Napoleon Dynamite mind you, but it still lacks that edge that the better romantic comedies contain, comedies like The 40-year-Old Virgin, When Harry Met Sally, Pretty Woman, and There's Something About Mary.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Annie Hall is not worthy of having that Best Picture Oscar; it should have gone to Star Wars for sure. I have never found Woody Allen that funny, and I did not really see what was the big deal about this film. It is just an average, mediocre love story told in a very unique way. While paving the way for interesting movie making from Robert Rodriguez, Quinten Tarantino, and others, Annie Hall is an experimental film that appeals to some, while failing to appeal to others. This is not the romantic comedy classic that everyone makes it out to be. Annie Hall: superb performances barred by many slow and dull moments and boring situations, not a classic in my standards.<br/><br/>Score: 4/10"

"kira02bit","1","16","30","11 February 2016"," Excruciating
","I am not remotely a fan of Woody Allen, but that does not mean that he has not produced work that I have enjoyed. I am actually rather fond of his valentine to NYC, Manhattan. I also like Take the Money and Run, Everyone Says I Love You, Radio Days and Manhattan Murder Mystery. However, I can sit through Hannah and Her Sisters, Broadway Danny Rose and Bullets Over Broadway without cracking a smile and becoming frustrated over their inability to make me laugh. I bring this up because somehow I managed to miss Annie Hall for decades until recently and it is pretty much considered Allen's definitive ""masterpiece"".<br/><br/>Annie Hall (which is the film that brought Allen the shower of awards and accolades that he purportedly disdains) centers on the romantic relationship between neurotic Jewish comedian Alvy Singer and aspiring singer Annie Hall. Right out of the starting gate, it hits on pretty much every note that one can find in Allen's other films. Alvy is obviously a thinly veiled version of Allen himself and longtime partner/co-star Diane Keaton takes the title role. Allen has done this whole semi-autobiographical character bit to death and Annie Hall is the best argument for putting it to rest.<br/><br/>What passes for comedy is that Alvy and Annie are both neurotic in their own ways - both are seeing analysts. Supposedly their relationship brings out the best in them before they ultimately part and move on. Alas, right from the beginning we pretty much sense that their relationship is doomed because both of these people are entirely too stuck on themselves and feel everyone else needs to play a supporting role. In place of any winning personality, Allen yammers incessantly as Alvy, mixing in a variety of dated, unfunny Henny Youngman-esque one-liners that are meant to convince us that Alvy is a brilliant comedic talent. Keaton, voice pitched at high whine, also babbles uncontrollably. Both throw around big words, reference the names of great thinkers, philosophers and artists, and espouse ""deep thoughts"" in a failing desperate attempt to make them appear intelligent, contemporary and interesting. The end result is a caricature of what rubes imagine New Yorkers to be like - shallow, faux intellectual, selfish, B.S. artists completely stuck on themselves.<br/><br/>The sequence where Alvy and Annie first meet and he returns to her apartment for a glass of wine is nothing short of embarrassing. There is literally no chemistry between them, they appear to have nothing in common, and we have no understanding of why Annie asks him back (or why he goes). They stammer, hem and haw awkwardly around like both are in the presence of greatness, Alvy drops some line about not wanting to get undressed in front of other men at the tennis club, which is not funny, but Annie laughs like Richard Pryor was tickling her backside. Back at the apartment, they begin their non-stop train wreck of babble and even when their lips are moving, we now get dialogue bubbles to tell us what they are really thinking. No surprise that their inner thoughts are as vapid and dull as their spoken words.<br/><br/>News flash to Allen (and his admirers) - referencing well-known, respected philosophers and artists does not make you an intellectual or brilliant. The barrage of oral flatulence which is expelled chronically from the mouths of the two self-impressed lead characters goes from irritating to unendurable at the speed of light. Alvy and Annie are two people that if you met them at a party, you would get up and walk to the other side of the room to avoid them.<br/><br/>The film's most delusional sequence has Alvy and Annie waiting in line at a movie theater and Alvy becoming insanely unreasonable because he keeps eavesdropping on the conversation of the couple behind them, where the man is telling his date why he does not particularly like Fellini. This difference of opinion so offends Allen that he must (in a pseudo-fantasy moment) humiliate the man in public. The guy demands from Allen ""Aren't I entitled to my opinion!"" To which Allen tells him not if it is contradictory to Alvy's opinion and is spoken loudly in public. Then upon finding out that the guy teaches a university class on Marshall McLuhan, Allen pulls McLuhan out from behind a sign to excoriate the man for being an idiot and not knowing what he is talking about. The irony of this scene is that the behavior of the man being humiliated by Allen is a more palatable rendition of Allen himself. When Alvy/Allen has a conniption that the man was voicing his contrary opinion too loud in public, I felt like yelling at the screen ""Pot meet kettle."" Of course in the world of Annie Hall, Alvy can voice all of his opinions publicly at the top of his lungs and be a chronic nuisance, because he is the only one that matters - and if you disagree, you will pay the price.<br/><br/>I find nothing funny, romantic or charming about this film. It reinforces completely misguided stereotypes about New Yorkers. Further I don't find spending 2 hours listening to two charmless, selfish, self-absorbed bags of neuroses blow wind, especially insightful or pleasant. And before Allen's admirers start in: Yes, I understood it. Yes, I got it. Yes, I like NYC very much. Yes, I like comedies. I just don't like Annie Hall at all."

","Okay, Woody Allen could be annoying sometimes and is heavily neurotic even in this film which he wrote and directed. The film is somewhat autobiographical about his relationships with a WASP woman named Annie Hall played by Diane Keaton in her Oscar winning role. Woody plays himself in the film even with a different name. Even though it's a short film, the story moves quickly and you have to be alert for some of the humor about the relationship between men and women. The supporting cast includes Tony Roberts, Paul Simon, Carol Kane and others. Woody's hatred of Los Angeles and all things Californian is well-known and documented. He is out of touch when he is away from New York City where he is equally neurotic. As a couple at first, Woody and Annie get along great but slowly Woody's own negativity creeps into the relationship. Annie starts seeing a therapist and their relationship unravels. When Annie's promising career as a cabaret singer rises, Woody becomes threatened and goes to Los Angeles to bring her back."

Many of my fellow students were laughing at Allen just because he is such a loser and over-analyzes everything. Well whoop-dee-doo. There is no explosiveness to this alone...it's like telling the story of a joke but forgetting the punchline. But this style of comedy is praised because it's supposedly ""sophisticated."" Yeah, right. There was only one sophisticated joke that made me laugh. This joke was about meta-physics, and I actually let out a brief chuckle. There were 30 people screening the movie with me, and it went over every one of their heads. Yes, I was the only one who understood the joke enough to laugh. I'm considered to be a pretty sophisticated guy, and it's a sad testament to a film if it does not even appeal to its target audience. That's because anyone who is intelligent enough to know what these Woody Allen sex and obscurity jokes actually mean has enough sense not to laugh at the trash. This just reinforces the fact that it's overrated.<br/><br/>Another reason why I say confidently that not only Annie Hall is overrated, but Woody Allen in general is that he received multiple Oscar nominations. What a joke. You're telling me that Woody Allen is the best director, best screenwriter, and one of the best actors in a leading role? For this garbage? Well, I guess it's safe to say that Woody Allen single handedly beat the entire film industry with this movie then. When Orson Welles received similar praise from the Academy for Citizen Kane, it was 1941, and he beat the odds by making a decent flick back when movies had an excuse to suck...and there was almost no quality competition.<br/><br/>This film should be praised for its realism, seeing as it is just as funny as your average Joe Schmoe's non-eventful life...which isn't worth viewing in the first place. One thing's for sure, this movie does not deserve a tenth of the praise it gets."

""If real life could only be like this."" In addition, the separation of spirit from body was a brilliant gag, and nobody can cook a lobster like Alvie. The cinematography is gorgeous and the performances are splendiforous. La Di Da, La Di Da. This is not my favorite Woody Allen movie (Love and Death takes that honor), but it was his best.

If the film isn't as fresh today as it was in 1977, that's because we know more about Allen and his penchant for neuroses than we did then. Many of Allen's ideas have also been recycled since ""Annie Hall"" (oft-times by Woody himself) and so it feels occasionally like a rerun. Still, the after-effects of a big love affair are clearly heartfelt, and the nostalgia near the finale is expertly conveyed.

He goes back through his past in one long flashback to try and work out why and where it all went wrong.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's career started out making films that were slapstick mixed with surreal humour.  He later moved to making more witty films that sought greater characterisation.  The missing link in this was Annie Hall - a film that effortlessly mixes the two.  The story is essentially a romance, but it spans back to Singers' childhood to weave a background for him.<br/><br/>The way Allen links all the flashbacks is very clever - most have a link in terms of dialogue etc so that the narrative isn't so iffy.  The various tricks he uses are very imaginative as well - people's thoughts are shown in subtitles, Singer gets solves a cinema queue fight in a very novel way and at one point, to demonstrate how he makes the wrong choices in love, the film turns to a Snow White cartoon.<br/><br/>Allen is great in the character he has played so many times.  His writing is excellent - clever mix of wit and surreal humour and his direction is faultless.  Keaton is excellent and very familiar with working with Allen.

","If ""Annie Hall"" had been a later Woody Allen film, you'd be ready to slap him by the end of the film's opening monologue. But in 1977, the world was not full of Allen films filled with Allen humor and ""Allenisms."" Thank goodness for that, because the film is truly one where his character can't be the sole focus. This is a film about Annie, as the title suggests, which really makes this movie great and still shine among the Allen repertoire.<br/><br/>The film stars Woody Allen as his usual neurotic, pessimistic self, in the form of comedian Alvy Singer and follows the story of his life with a focus on his relationships with women and his family. The chronology of the film is off-whack with the beginning being his childhood, followed by a time where he and Annie (Diane Keaton) are not getting along followed by the story of how they met with several tangents of Alvy's past wives, etc. thrown in the mix. <br/><br/>Allen tests your patience with his character most of the time, but Keaton as Annie is absolutely intriguing. You are drawn to her inexplicably just as Alvy is. She's a complete mess of a character, but she is so convincing and so interesting. The two of them, along with the film, are so off-beat, but that's what makes it good. The characters walking through memories like ""A Christmas Carol"" and talking to the camera and the scene when they're in line at the theater and the guy behind Alvy completely irritates him are very fun and don't detract from the story.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best part of the film is that it's not so serious. It's kind of ironic that Alvy is the biggest pessimist in the world, when his film sort of treats life in a casual and humorous way that's very much how things are sometimes. ""Annie Hall"" shows that film doesn't have to be about an intense subject that is more interesting than anyone's normal life. Normal life with strange, weird, but normal people can make for just as good of a film. A story about a relationship between two people doesn't have to be filled with sweeping moments of love and emotion. Would all this be nearly as effective if Allen and Keaton weren't really strong, believable characters? No, probably not, but that shows that there is more to good film than a unique plot that falls into a category beyond the average person's experience.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site http://moviemusereviews.com"
"Hitchcoc","10","3","4","8 March 2006"," Woody's Best
","This has so many layers from intellectual humor to pratfalls. It has some of the most memorable characters in all of movie history. First of all, the script is full of what all comedy should be about: timing. The scenes where Annie and Alvy start their relationship are amazing. He, like his constant schmuck, has arrived at a place in his life, and even if he could change, he really doesn't want to. She is just starting to blossom, but carries around enough hangups to sink a battleship. He sees her beauty and her innocence, but can't pull himself out of growing up under a roller coaster. The scene with the lobsters, which he tries to reprise with another woman, and then he falls flat on his face. Her nutty family, particularly her brother, played by Christopher Walken. This was my first experience with one of the most wacko people in show business. At least his movie persona. Alvy is rooted in New York and that who California thing. The cocaine. The convertible with the destroyed top which he obviously tried to put up while he was cruising on the freeway. No one can present unrequited love as well as Woody. Every time I see him in his comic roles, I think, ""I really like him, but I would never want to be him."" There is a constipation in his characters but that's what makes it all work. You want them to be happy, but it's not in the cards."
"ironhorse_iv","8","4","6","29 January 2017"," If they ever made a Hall of Fame for great movies of the 1970s. Anne Hall really does belong on that list.
","Though some people prefer 1979's 'Manhattan', 'Annie Hall' is generally regarded as the one of the best in Woody Allen's pretty solid filmmaking career. Worthy of the many Academy Awards, they won. This romantic-comedy was amazing, even if writer/director/actor Woody Allen kinda hates it. It's a classic that still relevant even today. Made during an era, where Allen was transforming from making silly, yet funny broad slapstick comedies to dramatic mature material that are somewhat good, but boring films, influenced by European art cinema. The film was indeed made at the right time. Full of priceless, witty and quotable one-liners, clever break the fourth wall jokes, beautiful cinematography, charming music, outstanding animation, wonderful complex supporting characters played by up and coming actors and actresses like Jeff Goldblum, Carol Kane, Sigourney Weaver, Christopher Walken, Beverly D'Angelo, Shelley Duvall, and fun cameos like philosopher, Marshall McLuhan & singer, Paul Simon made this great. I like how this movie, not only tells the fictional love story of a fixated New York comedian Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) with a ditzy, aspiring singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton); but give us, insight on the then-relationship between writer/director Woody Allen and his co-star, Diane Keaton and why the relationship didn't work. Several references in the film mirror Allen's own life, such as using Diane Keaton's original last name for Annie, and having his character, be a Jewish comedian living in New York has made most film critics believe profoundly that this film is just another of Allen's deep autobiographical. However, Allen is quick to dispel these suggestions, saying, the film is so exaggerated that it's virtually meaningless to the people that it was loosely based on. Regardless on his beliefs, the film is truly self-reflexive. It's hard to denial that Annie Hall does capitalized on many of the ingredients that had been the content of his earlier films, the subjects of cultural stereotypes, romantic angst, drugs, death, his use of therapy and analysis for comic effect, and his obsessive love of New York & his dislike of Los Angeles. Added to that, is his introspective neuroses and pessimism, his requisite jokes and psychosexual frustration about sex, numerous put-downs of his own appearance and personality, and distorted memories of his childhood. And Allen's script keeps going with scenes of stylistic strategies and cinematic techniques that support the fragmented nature of the film, such as the direct addresses to the camera style with voice over commentary, the adult time-travel back to childhood sequence & the sudden production of a real-life character. Added the double-exposed action, and the subtitled that contradict the action, and you got yourself, a very long, but unique film. Honestly, if Woody Allen didn't have editor, Ralph Rosenblum, this film could had gone forever. That seems to be a common problem with most of Allen's films. It just doesn't know how to pace itself. Many shots for this film, had to be eliminated or severely shorted, just to allow the audience enough time to digest it all. As much as I like the backstory of Alvy. In truth, I really came to see Annie Hall. Even Allen admit that he went overboard, saying he would had cut a lot of opening scenes about Alvy in order to introduce Keaton's character, faster. Diane Keaton really does shines in this role. She really does deserve the Best Actress win that year. An understated and subtle performance. I like how great, she was able to show character development, showing that Anne Hall does have confidence and that she can stand on her ownright. It's like a Pygmalion-like story. Just look at the scene where she sing 'Seem like Old Times'. Plus, the way, Keaton's idea to choose to dress Hall with mismatched of conglomeration of men's dress clothes was very influence to fashion. Absolutely gorgeous. Don't get me wrong, while, Allen's persona of playing characters with an insecure, intellectual, fretful nebbish is a bit tiresome old shtick, there was nothing too annoying about his shrill and nasal character here. I just like Keaton's performance, better. I also just glad, the film didn't kept the original murder mystery. It would feel, out of place from the rest of the story. Allen would indeed, later directed murder mysteries to satisfy that need with 1992's 'Shadows and Fog' and 1993's 'Manhattan Murder Mystery' retooled and taken from this script. Another thing, I'm glad, this movie didn't kept, was the titled, 'Anhedonia'. It truly could had been a state of acute melancholia. 'Annie Hall' makes more sense than any of the alternative titles, they were thinking like 'A Roller Coaster Named Desire', 'Me and My Goy' & 'It had to be Jew'. Overall: While, some critics might hate the movie for having a first world conflict and being a bit self-centered. With only a few flaws, this movie will continue to remind a classic romantic comedy for most, and I have to agree. It's one of the best film ever made. Definitely worth watching. La Dee, La Dah."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","4","6","9 February 2014"," The film where Woody Allen found his own voice, and one of his best ever films
","Not everybody will love Woody Allen's humour, some will find him interesting and sharply insightful while others will find him self-indulgent. With me, it veers very largely towards the former with some occasions where the latter does creep in. Annie Hall is one of his best films, a masterpiece and one of the better Best Picture winners of the 70s with only the two Godfather films even better. The best assets are the script and the chemistry between the two leads. The script is enormously witty, with cracking dialogue that induces one and at times more laughs a minute, and full of insightful observations. People have deemed it one of the best screenplays of all time, and from personal perspective there is no reason to argue. The chemistry between the two leads, running somewhat on a parallel between the relationship of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton itself, and the actors in general actually is throughout very believable. It is often adorable and often dynamic. It helps that Diane Keaton gives one of her best and most endearing performances, and while Alvy is not a particularly likable or sympathetic character Woody Allen is similarly great, his looking into the camera and breaking the fourth wall moments were funny. The supporting cast all give spirited performances, especially Tony Roberts, Paul Simon, Carol Kane and Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum is memorable as well for one of the film's best and most quotable lines. The romance is sweet and relateable, the ending for me was really moving, but the story doesn't depend on that alone, Allen also muses over topics that were relevant then and that we can see as relevant today as well, he does so in a very thoughtful way. Allen directs with assurance, and while there have been more visually audacious Woody Allen films since Annie Hall it is still cleverly made with the way it's shot, the cartoon images and how we're shown visually what the characters are thinking. There is no music score and in this case that was a good idea, there was more leeway for the relationship between the two lead characters and observations to speak, and that's the same for the deliberate but never tedious pacing. Overall, an outstanding film, one of Allen's best and one of the greatest films of the 70s. People may dislike it for it winning Best Picture over Star Wars(this viewers and many others however think it fully deserved the win), as much as I'll have a fondness for the Star Wars original trilogy and consider it a milestone of its genre it is easy to see out of Star Wars and Annie Hall which is the superior film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"gleebs75","9","4","6","27 April 2006"," Amusingly Awful Romance at Its Finest
","In typical Woody Allen style, this film is a comment on pretentious New York City inhabitants, fake and materialistic Hollywood-ites, and neurotic love relationships. Alvy is a somewhat overly intelligent, somewhat pompous, incredibly neurotic and slightly depressed comic. Annie is a woman who only gets pleasure out of smoking pot, is not too intelligent, and is too shy and nervous for her own good. Having these two characters fall in love seems slightly insane in itself, but then again, that's what Woody Allen was going for with this film. In many ways, this film could be seen as kind of a comment on how film portrays romancehow unrealistic romantic relationships had been portrayed by Hollywood and how the unhappy ending is usually the more prevalent in reality.<br/><br/>California (more specifically Hollywood and L.A) in this film is portrayed as a place full of overly tan, vanity obsessed, materialistic celebrities and their agents. Alvy, being the model New Yorker, hates California. Some of the most amusing lines in the film are between Alvy and Annie concerning the others' hatred for the two cities. Alvy's opinions on L.A all seem to hold up, however, so do Annie's opinions on New York. They're entirely polarized cities and the fact that Alvy and Annie don't choose the same city as their city of preference only emphasizes their differences even more. These two people are polar opposites, just like L.A. and New Yorkthey don't belong together. Annie and Alvy are not the type of couple that Hollywood usually had fun portraying. They are not the Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett couple from Pride and Prejudice, they are not Romeo and Juliet, they are two people who are completely wrong for each other and know it but somehow can't seem to figure it out. Every time they break up, they fall deeper into their depression because it's another failed relationship, another thing they couldn't make work. They're constantly bickering and fighting, and it doesn't really seem like love anymore after a certain point. It's the kind of love that only two mentally unstable and off base people can understand (and considering Allen's real life love situations, it becomes obvious that he is one of those people). This film is re-defining romance, re-defining how people look at relationships. It doesn't work out for Annie and Alvy in the end, and they both seem to be slightly okay with it. That's how things would have worked out for them in real life, and that's what Allen wanted to portray. If he had been a conventional Hollywood director with classic notions of grandeur and romance, then he would have had them live happily ever after. It's refreshing, for once, for the audience to figure out that not everyone gets that. Not all romances end with a ride off into the sunset.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is also a critique of American culture and the elite intelligencia. Alvy and most of his acquaintances in New York are the kind of cynical and judgmental people who are so intelligent that it makes everyone else of moderate intelligence seem like morons and scum. Alvy (even as a child, as we see in multiple flashbacks) has very high standards for people he would consider worthy of being able to share their opinions. One of the most humorous scenes in the film is when he and Annie are in the line to see a film about Nazi Germany and WWII and there is a pretentious man in line behind him spewing off his opinions on directors. When Alvy confronts him about his seemingly terribly wrong opinions, he pulls out one of the directors to back him up. Alvy is the standard that the audience is supposed to hold everyone else up against. He is a neurotic man who never has nothing to say and is usually able to voice his opinion in a witty manner. The irony of this film is its greatest feature. The depressive and cynical comic, who is too into himself to give anyone else the time of day, meets and falls in love with an unintelligent and somewhat boring girl from the mid west who would usually do nothing for him. How could it not end up amusingly awful? Woody Allen is truly at his finest in this film."

I just think the movie dragged on a bit and I find it was getting too boring after watching 10 minutes of it. I don't understand why this is considered to be one of the greatest films in history.

","Next to ""Manhattan"" this is Woody Allen's best film.<br/><br/>It chronicles the relationship and breakup of Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). That's it for plot, but it has an Oscar-winning script by Allen and Marshall Brickman which is overflowing with hilarious lines and sequences and also some sharp, on target insights about love, sex and relationships. It's basically just one great scene after another.<br/><br/>Keaton is superb in her Oscar-winning role--she's sweet, lovable and endearingly off kilter. Also her very interesting wardrobe started a big fashion trend in the late 70s--the Annie Hall Look. Allen is good also but his character is whiny and annoying--as he should be. Allen's direction is just great also, but he topped it 2 years later with ""Manhattan"". <br/><br/>Just simply a masterpiece--it deserved every Oscar it won. Don't miss this one!"
"Pookyiscute","5","9","18","9 April 2006"," What's the big deal?
","Going into this, all I've ever heard about this movie, is that it's a classic, and one of the best films of all time, not to mention the best Woody Allen film. But, after having just seen it, I'm left with a sense of disappointment. It's not at all the sentimental journey I was expecting, and in fact I found it to be a little silly at times. And, although that's to be expected with any Allen film, I was anticipating something a little more sincere with this piece.<br/><br/>Diane Keaton was very good in this, and I can see why so many people consider this to be her signature role, however you still see her has Diane Keaton, and not as the character Annie Hall. This, in my opinion was not her best role and she did not strike me as brilliant, as she did for me in 'Marvin's Room'. Woody Allen likes to write roles for himself, and instead of giving himself a character name in each of his films, he should just simply be called Woody, since he's always playing himself. He's a much better writer and director than he is actor, but I don't think I'm alone in this thought.<br/><br/>The film itself is cute, and sweet, but it's nothing extraordinary. I would say that it's not bad, but then again, it's not terribly terrific either. I would recommend it, but not before a few of Allen's better films, such as; ""Everyone Says I Love You"" and ""Manhatten Murder Mystery""."
"moniker_jones","10","8","16","4 November 2005"," An American Classic
","Woody is firing from all cylinders, nailing one joke after another in this modern American classic. While ultimately considered a romantic comedy, Annie Hall defies all labels, blending multiple genres and creating a few new ones in the process. <br/><br/>It's difficult to imagine for many of today's younger film-goers, but Woody Allen was once a terribly respected celebrity who could seem to do no wrong. In recent years his personal life and spotty track record have diminished his reputation, but many of his early works (Annie Hall chief among them) will live forever. <br/><br/>In this brilliant dissection of an on-again/off-again couple, Allen plays Alvy Singer, a neurotic comedian undergoing a mid-life crisis. It's a role that Allen created, defined, and has essentially been playing in one form or another ever since. His love interest at the time (both on and off-screen) was Diane Keaton, who won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as the title character. Annie and Alvy are both nuts (in general and about each other), but their differences play against and alongside one another beautifully. The film's resolution may leave some of us sighing, but we know it's the only sensible outcome.<br/><br/>As stated earlier, Allen is in top form here, as a writer, actor, AND director. While some of his films around this time were more artsy, this one seemed to be his most creative, original effort. While he still wears his influences on his sleeves, actually naming a few in various scenes, his maniacal interpretation of his material is endlessly inspired. Everything from flashbacks to speaking to the camera to animation are employed perfectly in this stylistic hodgepodge. <br/><br/>Lively direction aside, it's the killer material that truly makes this movie. The fairly short running time is jam-packed with jokes and gags, almost all of which work. Rarely does a line or scene fall flat. Every seemingly unnecessary utterance is there for a reason. When Annie stares quizzically at Alvy's red, erotic light-bulb, he casually mutters that they can now go about their business...and even develop photographs if they want to. Not only do the jokes work, but they're bursting at the seams with truth and relevance. In a single split-screen scene, Allen manages to humorously capture the inherent, unavoidable differences in the male and female psyches. Racism, sexism, libido, hippies, drugs, the Seventies, entertainment bureaucrats, New York vs. California, religion, conspiracy theories. All that and more is presented uniquely in what can easily be named one of the greatest films of the last 30 years. Now if only I could decide whether or not it's better than another late-70s Allen film called Manhattan."
"NovaXII","5","8","16","12 February 1999"," falls short of all the hype
","I can't say this is a bad movie, because it is alright.  I laughed out loud at a couple of the lines, and appreciated the honesty presented, as it always is with Woody Allen.  Unfortunately, I didn't really get the whole idea.  I had heard so much praise for it by so many credible folks, but failed to be impressed once I got around to seeing it.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just because I'm a young midwestern boy, so different from Woody, that I can't connect with it.

I don't know, maybe I just don't understand people who like to go sleeping around with all the females in they know. It's just weird. The funny lines usually fell flat.

","I was in the minority when I saw 1977's Oscar winner for best picture. I just didn't like. When it was on last night, I decided to give it a second chance. After all, it's 29 years since I saw it. Guess what? This time I hated it.<br/><br/>To begin with, I am tired of Woody Allen's attempt to philosophize life with his relationship with women and the fact that he is a self-deprecating Jew. He has constantly knocked the latter in many of his films. This is not appreciated.<br/><br/>In this film, he surprisingly knocks New York. He goes to California but that's not for him either. Basically speaking Mr. Allen, what is for you?<br/><br/>The plot here is weigh too thin. Allen plays the usual jerk in search of meaning for his life. Along the way, he meets Carol Kane at a Stevenson rally. He claims that what he wants to do with women is what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for 8 years. By the way, no one corrected the fact that Ike was not president for 2 terms when Stevenson ran against him. There are term limits since 1951 Woody!<br/><br/>The film is tedious and often full of clichés. How many times must we be remembered what Jews are thought of by mid-westerners?<br/><br/>I can't fathom how this stinker of a movie was given the Oscar for best picture. ""The Turning Point,"" as well as ""Star Wars,"" and ""Julia,"" along with ""The Goodbye Girl"" were far superior films. Diane Keaton acted like a typical mid-west ""shiksa."" Her hats and clothing were outrageous. She did sing nicely. Nonetheless, Marsha Mason (""The Goodbye Girl"") and Shirley MacLaine or Anne Bancroft were far better in ""The Turning Point.""<br/><br/>For my part, ""Annie Hall"" takes a mighty fall here. Allen suffers from going aimlessly through life. He is afraid to take a chance. Too bad that he did with this film."

","I can't imagine anyone thinking ""Annie hall"" is ""dull"". Knowing the ""Star Wars"" fanaticism on the web, it's not surprising some science-fiction geeks would have antipathy sight-unseen for it winning Best Picture in 1977 (and I love science fiction -- but I love film even more.)<br/><br/>For one, ""Star Wars"" was a blockbuster -- and in the 70's, blockbusters, no matter how silly, got nominated. (See ""The Towering Inferno""). Harrison Ford told George Lucas he couldn't write worth crap -- and even ""Star Wars"" isn't exactly original -- it's basically a bunch of one-dimensional ""types"" of characters. I preferred ""The Empire Strikes Back"" because it actually fleshed the characters out (being written by Lawrence Kasdan).<br/><br/>
That said, ""Annie Hall"" was so original it's been copied endlessly by other filmmakers -- from ""When Harry Met Sally..."" to ""Jeffrey"". It's so subtle even fans of the film miss some of its points --<br/><br/>For instance, Alvy and Annie are never truly in love. In that famous ""lurve"" scene, for instance, Alvy basically twists Annie's arm to get her to say she loves him -- and she convinces herself. Meanwhile, Alvy avoids saying he loves her by using variations of the word (""I luff you, I lurve you..."") Once the viewer realizes that, the rest of the movie changes, and you understand parts of the reason that Alvy's never had a truly successful relationship.<br/><br/>Even on totally face value, ""Annie Hall"" is extremely funny. From the lowbrow jokes -- ""Don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love!"" ""I'm with two guys named Cheech!"" to the deviously sexy -- ""Twins, Max! 16 years old. Think of the numerical possibilities!"" to the clever -- ""They're always giving awards -- Best Fascist Dictation: Adolf Hitler!"" ""Do they give out awards for that kind of music? I thought just earplugs."" Who can't laugh at the animation fantasy in which he envisions Annie as the Wicked Queen from Snow White? (""I don't get a period! I'm a cartoon character!"")<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" is Allen's best work, simply because it is one of the most imitated films ever, and, as we all know -- imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.<br/><br/>One note-- even though the film is filled with cynicism and funny scenes, the ending always leaves me a little misty. It's wistful and touching.<br/><br/>

Other than: I love it, too. And, not having seen it in over fifteen years, I had pretty much forgotten how much of an impact it can have.<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" is the story of a relationship told in flashbacks and fantasy sequences. The narrator tells us in the opening moments that: ""Annie and I broke up and I still can't get my mind around that. I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and examining my life and trying' to figure out where did the screwup come. A year ago we were in love."" And those opening lines are a perfect description of what is to follow.<br/><br/>The movie has no linear structure, and no plot. It's mostly two people talking. Walking and talking in beautifully filmed sequences. There are a lot of fantasy sequences, too. No two of which are the same. One scene features subtitles to tell us what the characters are thinking, another scene shows Annie's mind leaving her body during sex, while another features people in different rooms (shown in split screen) having a conversation back and forth. Random strangers stop on the street with vital information, then depart again. And one of the scenes is animated. This is from 1977, by the way. The year it won the Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>But this not a film of gimmicks. It's a film about love. The story of two very real people in love. AFI listed this as the greatest romantic comedy of all time. And it's easy to see why. There is a lot of romance in this movie and a lot of comedy, too. The stars/characters have astonishing chemistry and it's easy to believe that this woman is the Love Of His Life. The dialogue is peppered with some of the funniest dialogue every written for the screen, and many lines have escaped into popular culture and are quoted time and time again (""Don't knock masturbation; it's sex with someone I love"").<br/><br/>In terms of content and storytelling technique, this is a masterpiece.

As a reminder, before being a playwright and a film director, Allen started his career as a comedy writer and then a stand-up comedian, for almost twenty cumulated years: this influenced his first pictures.<br/><br/>After ""Annie Hall"", he found a style where comedy, if present, is a supporting element instead of a central focus. This movie is hence a turning point in Allen's career; it certainly is the best of his first period, and arguably one of his best ever. With retrospect, it seems as if he wanted to crown his first style before moving on to something different.<br/><br/>STAND-UP, WOODY/ALVY!<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" feels like a stand-up long feature, which constitutes its originality as well as its limit. The stand-up comedy style is fully assumed: it starts with Allen telling two jokes to the audience, and ends with another joke. The main character is a comedian and we see him on stage once, a reference to Allen's former career. Revealingly, he narrates the whole story. There is a self-parody component, whereby Allen caricatures himself as Alvy and the tone is detached.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there is at least a joke every minute, addressing very different topics, some of them serious, albeit generally in a light mode: life, love, death, the universe, relationships, time passing, childhood, WWII, knowledge, culture, humour, lifestyles, Jewish identity, psychoanalysis, drugs, sex and how (not) to cook a lobster.<br/><br/>The movie is loaded with funny directing tricks. Even if most of them are not new, they efficiently support the humorous tone and keep the audience focused, since the stand-up style on its own is difficult to sustain on the long term: talking to the audience, placing the adult character in childhood scenes, having characters comment past scenes shown to them, subtitling characters' thoughts as they talk about something else, introducing a cartoon sequence, having an actual celebrity (McLuhan) intervening in the fiction, etc.<br/><br/>VOYAGE INTO ALVY'S BRAIN...<br/><br/>However ""Annie Hall"" is more than this. Form, far from being random, is clever. Narration is non-linear, transitions are frequently made by thought associations (as in psychoanalysis), past and present mingle, shots are on average long: we are in Alvy's brain.<br/><br/>Progressively, the movie gains depth, as the relationship between the main two characters evolves. Annie Hall matures from a naive woman, intellectually dominated by Alvy, to an elaborate lady who knows what she wants, while Alvy stagnates with his issues. (Here we must ask: what does the beautiful, classy, witty Annie find in the neurotic, possessive, paranoid Alvy? Answer: the mysteries of love.)<br/><br/>... AND NOSTALGIA<br/><br/>Additionally, the movie increasingly becomes nostalgic. What gives it a special touch is the fact the story between the main two characters is partly inspired by the actual relationship between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton themselves: Keaton's actual family name is Hall and her nickname is Annie; Keaton admitted she recognised herself in the role; Allen and Keaton had a relationship for about a year in 1970, broke up and remained friends as in the movie. The fact the actual relationship ended approximately six years before the film adds a melancholic element.<br/><br/>Retrospection is an essential theme. At the beginning we see past scenes (childhood, flashbacks), mainly in humorous mode. Occasionally some past scenes are tragic, for instance WWII with an extract of the documentary ""The Sorrow and the Pity"", followed by the characters asking themselves: what would we have done during these troubled times?<br/><br/>Increasingly, past elements are not coming from ""outside"" of the movie (i.e. before the love story) but ""within"". This creates a nostalgic feeling: the happy times we witnessed are now gone. For instance when Alvy comes to Annie's place to chase the spider after they broke up, on her wall are the photos she took when he was previously struggling with the lobsters. Later on, Alvy dates another woman and again tries to cook lobsters. However while the earlier lobster scene was funny, his new date does not understand his humour: we are sorry the relationship between Alvy and Annie has ended, with their complicity and wits. At the end, Annie goes to see ""The Sorrow and the Pity"" as she did before with Alvy, even though now they are separated.<br/><br/>Accentuating the sense of nostalgia, the whole movie actually is a flashback made by Alvy about his relationship with Annie. Eventually, the end sequence culminates in nostalgic mood: past scenes between Alvy and Annie silently flow, while Annie sings off-screen ""Seems Like Old Times"", a melancholic song if there ever was one. They are now simple friends; instead of spending time together, they just have a drink in a café. In the last shot, Alvy stays on the sidewalk to watch Annie leave: he still is in love with her.<br/><br/>On top of flashbacks, this final sequence subtly refers to earlier episodes: a final nail in past's coffin. Annie singing refers to her previously singing ""It Had to be You"" in the nightclub. But whereas the nightclub sequence was a noisy disaster, the final song is perfect: past scenes then shown are hence beautified and idealised. Also, Alvy makes a final joke about the absurdity of relationships: it closes the loop with his two jokes at the very beginning of the movie. However instead of facing the audience, his voice is now off-screen: without Annie, he fades into a shadow of his former self.<br/><br/>Funny, nostalgic, partly absurd (as life is), sometimes awkward (as life is), ""Annie Hall"" does deliver the eggs."
"The_Movie_Cat","8","3","5","12 August 2009"," Allen's most essential and accessible picture?
","Manhattan's the better film, but there Allen's alter ego is a fundamentally selfish character. It's beautifully shot and well-written, but it's harder to like a picture where the central figure is a self-absorbed user in the middle of a relationship with an underage girl.<br/><br/>Annie Hall has no such problems for a casual audience, even though Allen does his usual neurotic, self-regarding schtick and his predilection for European cinema. This may be an issue with Annie Hall, in that Allen's character is an intellectual snob, whereas in Manhattan (8) he's well aware that the worst person in the room is himself and he's even intimidated by the intelligence of Diane Keaton's Mary Wilkie. In fact, as the titular Annie Hall then this issue is reversed, with Annie feeling she's not educated enough for Allen's Alvy Singer.<br/><br/>Regardless of comparing the ""two big ones"" against each other, it can't be denied that Woody was on outstanding form in the 1970s. There's the final cast offs of his all-out comedy vehicles with the likable Bananas (6) and the patchy, hit-and-miss Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex (qv). Add to this the imaginative silent homage of Sleeper (7) and an attempt at a serious drama with Interiors (7). The Bergman influences may be too keenly felt at times, not just with Interiors, but with a lot of the work, yet it really is Woody at the top of his game.<br/><br/>Sole aberration for me is Love and Death (4), a popular entry but a pretentious farce that I find extremely grating. Yet back to Annie Hall, and it's probably the most accessible of his pictures. Sketchy, true, and Allen would learn more about genuine narrative structure in the future, but there's some experiments largely unique to his body of work, including characters walking through their own memories and Woody breaking the fourth wall. One criticism with Woody Allen's movies is that they do have a tendency to be similar, but there's a freshness and spontaneity at play here throughout. Yet what puts Annie Hall above all others is that Woody was rarely more likable than here, and all the great Freudian gags in the world can't compete with the charm of Allen and Keaton genuinely laughing during the lobster scene."
"vtprod","8","3","5","16 February 2009"," You Forget That It Was Shot In The 70's
","From the exceptional writing of Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman (Brickman a banjo player who was in the group ""The Journeyman"" with John Phillips and Michelle Phillips who had success as Mamas & Papas left to pursue writing for television, Candid Camera, The Tonight Show and The Dick Cavett Show) you forget that you are watching characters act. The acting feels real and genuine. After you get past Allen breaking the fourth wall in the introduction with his monologue you get a sense of invitation to this New York style of living that is displayed throughout the movie with Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) a couple who has an up and down then out relationship. Especially the lobster/kitchen scene when they are throwing the lobster around then into the pot gives you a sense of script and improvisation that makes you laugh out loud. Along with the breathing hand held camera the scene makes the looseness in a closed form feel open.<br/><br/>The style of Annie (Diane Keaton) and even Woody's wardrobe (Glasses) is being fashioned today. Watch any award show with HipHop generation and you would see dancers wearing the vest and tie.<br/><br/>The long takes in this film works. The cinematography by Gordon Willis (Godfather) is excellent. Without the editing of Ralph Rosenbloom this style of movie would not exist. This film is definitely one of my favorites."
"lula-valletta","10","3","5","19 October 2008"," The Real Identitiy of Annie Hall
","What hardly anybody knows is that the real Annie Hall was an English woman, the wife of the famous dutch artist Jan Toorop and the mother of the almost equally famous female artist Charley Toorop.<br/><br/>Jan Toorop (Poerworedjo, Java, December 20, 1858  The Hague, Netherlands, March 3, 1928) was a Javanese Dutch painter whose works straddle the space between the Symbolist painters and Art Nouveau.<br/><br/>After his marriage to Annie Hall in 1886, Toorop alternated his time between The Hague, England and Brussels, and after 1890 also the Dutch seaside town of Katwijk aan Zee. During this period he developed his own unique Symbolist style, with dynamic, unpredictable lines based on Javanese motifs, highly stylised willowy figures, and curvilinear designs.<br/><br/>Thereafter he turned to Art Nouveau styles, in which a similar play of lines is used for decorative purposes, without any apparent symbolic meaning. In 1905 he converted to Catholicism and began producing religious works. He also created book illustrations, posters, and stained glass designs.<br/><br/>Charley Toorop was born in Katwijk 1891 and died in Bergen 1955. She made a lot of self portraits."

","Visually the film is exactly what you would expect from a Romantic Comedy film of that era, boring. This is not really a problem because what carries this film along on its feet is the fantastic dialogue and Woody Allen. Obviously written by Allen himself which is already an ingredient for a masterpiece. His stop start sentences and jumpy movements are almost like that of Robert Downey Jr. in someways, which is a good thing in my books as i think Downey is a fantastic actor, though i cant get past the feeling that almost whatever film he is in with some exception, hes literally plays himself. First Impressions of Allen is also this kind of self portrayal. I think this is what creates this brilliant recipe for this fantastic dish of a film. Allens interaction with the audience is great and adds to the audience relating to the character.<br/><br/>The film itself has a strange flow to it, With numerous flashbacks jumping back and forth to the past and then straight back into the present. There's some great use of Audio that add to the effect it is what the characters are thinking.<br/><br/>In terms of humour it's extremely witty, a line about masturbation springs to mind. It goes something along the lines of ""Whats great about masturbation is that your always having sex with someone you love."" There is some really great lines and quotes from Groucho Marx which when applied to the films context and plot make for extremely inspiring thoughts and you cant help but compare it to your own lease of life.<br/><br/>Such a great film. I give it 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>Defiently worth a watch and definitely something you will enjoy. What a great love Romantic Comedy."

","Of the Woody Allen films I have seen, this one is the best. As usual, Woody is concerned with a love story. Alvy Singer is a neurotic and hyper comedian who meets and falls very quickly in love with the flamboyant and ditsy Annie Hall. We follow their love story as it's told to us through short sequences that are not necessarily in chronological order.<br/><br/>Diane Keaton is superb as the titular character of Annie Hall. Her Best Actress Oscar was well-deserved. Woody Allen, essentially playing the same character he always does, seems to be at his best here too. It feels almost as though this story had special significance to him.<br/><br/>A lesson in ironic comedy, Mr. Allen uses unique storytelling and humor to engage his audience and surprise them. The characters say whatever comes to mind, speak to the camera, and talk to random strangers on the street- yet somehow this only makes them seem more real. And yes, it makes them very funny, too.<br/><br/>If you're a die-hard fan of Woody Allen, you just might think it's the best movie ever made. For the rest of us, it's mostly a light-hearted and endearing romp. No matter where you fall in those categories, it's definitely worth a watch. <br/><br/>Jay Addison"

"Don-102","10","3","5","27 January 2000"," Woody's 1st Serious Artistic Achievement Mainly Because of Diane Keaton.
","Until 1977, Woody Allen films were mostly screwball comedies.  Pictures like BANANAS and EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX... were episodic comedies, films that seemed more like short television sitcoms along the Monty Python vein. He finally reached his full potential with what seems to be everyone's favorite Woody picture, ANNIE HALL.  It is without a doubt one of his better films and foresaw a lot of the narrative techniques and content you can see in his great films of the past decade.  This is Woody playing himself, more or less, for the first time, but it is Diane Keaton as the title character who steals the show in a heartwarming performance that won her an Academy Award.<br/><br/>Woody plays comedian ""Alvy Singer"", a comedian who hates anything that is not New York and who cannot seem to function outside of it.  He is constantly bickering to best friend Tony Roberts about New York being considered a target for anti-semitism.  He is, for the first time in his long filmography, playing himself, a self-hating Jew who has broken relationships with women.  He even talks directly to the camera describing his paranoid self in the movie's first shot.  After some brief intercutting of failed marriage footage, ""Alvy"" meets the peculiar, but sensual ""Annie Hall"" from Wisconsin.<br/><br/>At this point in ANNIE HALL, the film goes back and forth in time revealing the peaks and valleys of this sweet romance.  ""Annie"" is a lonely girl, plain-looking, but with a quality Woody and the audience can't quite put a finger on.  She grows more and more lovable as the story of these complete opposites evolves.  It is still hard to figure out what makes Annie so delightful to the eyes and the mind.  She is simple and endearing, which makes her more attractive to you as you watch.  It is great acting by Keaton, who is so original in her choice of wardrobe and mannerisms (especially her need to relieve tension a certain way).<br/><br/>The film contains Woody standards like his fear of driving, his fear of bugs, or things that move in the dark (""you have a bug the size of a Buick in there""), and his mockery of Los Angeles.  The scenes in L.A. are some of the funniest I've seen in all of Allen's films especially the physical condition that besets him as soon as he gets off the plane.  ""Alvy"", like Woody, is always writing something too.<br/><br/>ANNIE HALL is not my favorite Allen film.  That honor goes hands down to MANHATTAN, made just 2 years later.  Keaton has a major role in that flick, as an intellectual ""Annie"" you could say. His great films of the 90's MIGHTY APHRODITE and DECONSTRUCTING HARRY are direct descendants of ANNIE HALL because of the overlapping narrative, Woody's talking to the audience or to imaginary people, and adorable love interests.<br/><br/>The one thing true of this film is that it is his warmest in regard to New York relationships and that is made completely possible because of Diane Keaton.  ""La-di-da, La-di-da,"" became as familiar to the American vernacular as ""Yada-Yada"" has in recent years to Seinfeld fanatics.  ANNIE HALL is complex in structure, yet deceptively simple and entered Woody into the big leagues of artistic filmmaking.<br/><br/>RATING: ***1/2"

It was a little clever and funny at times but it has definitely turned me off to trying other Allen films. I found the filming to be very bland, the acting to be mediocre and the dialog to be dry. This was meant to be a romantic comedy but but failed to accomplish that since it wasn't very funny. It seemed like someones everyday life. I'm sure if you are a Woody Allen fan or have a dry sense of humor you will enjoy this movie.

","I didn't really enjoy this movie. I found Alvy quite annoying with his constant complaining and pessimistic views. At the end of the movie I felt somewhat depressed and at the same time relieved it was over. The story was one that has been used many times, the classic case of a nerdy guy falling for a woman that is seen to be out of his league. I did like how at times Alvy was narrating so that we could figure out what was going on inside his head, and I found that the asides or soliloquy were creative ways for Allen to throw a few jokes into the movie to make it a little more light hearted. Overall I did not enjoy the movie and felt that it was the following of a whiny man in an overused story line."

Before we go any further, let me say this was not a bad movie. When I saw this movie, I was not too familiar with Woody Allen, and I thought maybe this would get me to become more familiar with him. Some scenes were funny, like the cocaine scene, and the scene with the Queen from Snow White. I just don't see what all the fuss is about this movie.

"Quinoa1984","10","4","8","11 March 2001"," it's better than I remembered.
","(Re-review 2011): I was telling my wife after seeing the movie again, for what I'm sure is only about the 20 or 30th time (and stuff just keeps getting funnier every time I see it), that while it is great, it's great in a very loose, sketchy-comedy kind of way. It has a story, and it's never hard to follow even as it jumps around (it even has, as we say in 'screenwriter-lingo', good 'plants' and 'pay-offs' with certain mentions of stuff), but it's not really about that. I have to figure it's cause Allen originally had a *three-hour* movie on his hands, that was Annie Hall and Manhattan Murder Mystery - or what would become of that.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I have to think that Allen canned the Manhattan Murder Mystery footage due to it, you know, not working, and then he and his fantastic editor Ralph Rosenblum made the film we have today out of all the sweet and funny relationship/cultural-awareness jokes that were in the story anyway. I'd be curious to see that footage though; in a way, when Allen finally made Manhattan Murder Mystery, he probably didn't change what he and Marshall Brickman originally wrote, he likely just grafted that script and then re-shot it (in some part as he was creatively pre-occupied at the time due to the Mia Farrow divorce going down). So, ultimately, Manhattan Murder Mystery is like his The Man Who Knew Too Much, a remake of his own material. But I digress.<br/><br/>It's Woody Allen. It's Diane Keaton. It's Paul Simon in disco gear talking about chilling with 'Jack and Angelica'. It's Jeff Goldblum forgetting his mantra. It's Christopher (bleep) Walken on vacation from planet Wiseau. And it's Marshall MacLughan talking about fallacies and so on.<br/><br/>Boy, if life were only like this."

","I always found Woody Allen's movies amusing, thought provoking and even intellectually stimulating and have enjoyed them for the most part. ""Annie Hall"" doesn't fit this bill at all and is in fact very difficult to sit through. I recall going on a first date when this movie came out to such high acclaim. I had to apologize to the young lady because it was so tedious and annoying. Nearly 30 years later it is even more difficult to sit through. I always thought that ""Annie Hall"" was Woody Allen's joke on the world - because he had started receiving such critical acclaim he decided to make the worst movie he could make in order to see the critics and public laud it because it was his. Watch Woody Allen. Watch Diane Keaton. Just don't watch this particular movie if you have other choices.

","I am writing this because I am totally infatuated with Woody Allen and his talkie style. When I first saw this movie, I felt like a loser stroke by middle-life crisis mentally masturbating to me, which made me zoom out of the movie. But when I watched it again today, I feel like finding the soulmate of my life, even though I would be super fortunate if I ever meet him someday. The Jewish intellectual that carries an overwhelming charm and humor gradually gets me and fixated himself in my mindset, and I feel like as if he has already been a part of my personality. I like him immensely, and I also feel like Annie Hall, whose insecurity and clumsiness with words when being nervous are actually adorable. <br/><br/>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the part when Alvy Singer drags Marshall McLuan out behind a poster frame and confront the Columbia professor that teaches his ideology. Because Marshall McLuhan claims that the content doesn't matter, it is the medium itself that matter. In another world, what Woody Allen says in Annie Hall doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is that I am watching Annie Hall in a foreign website through my phone, which undermines Woody Allen's whole existence in my experience with Annie Hall, yet all I can think of is Woody Allen's mysterious character when I watch this movie. And I love it when Annie's soul is detached from her body and sit on the chair talking about drawings when Alvy is trying to make love to her. When Annie said:""It's OK, you have my body."" Allen said:""No, but I want the whole thing."" I think that's the most romantic thing you can say to a girl.<br/><br/>There are only several films I can clap and laugh to, and this is one of them."

"Galina_movie_fan","10","2","3","27 May 2009"," Love Story: Woody Allen Style
","Woody Allen's, ""Annie Hall"" which has a tag line ""A nervous romance"" is a story of two New Yorkers who truly loved each other but could not stay together and eventually and inevitably moved on with their lives. Simple like that but it was told by Woody Allen, which made it not so simple and very enjoyable. This is the film where Diane Keaton proved to be a perfect actress for Allen's movies. She brought to the film a lot of herself, her natural nervousness and insecure attitude, even her dressing style that became hugely popular. She played Annie with such bemusement, perfect timing, and natural sense of humor, that for the whole time the viewers can't help asking themselves how she did it. The part of the answer is that Allen understood her completely and masterfully used the originality of her persona to write and direct the character of Annie. Keaton recalls, ""Of course I recognized myself in the roles Woody Allen wrote. I mean, in Annie Hall (1977) particularly. I was this sort of novice who had lots of feelings but didn't know how to express herself, and I see that in Annie. I think Woody used a kind of essential quality that he found in me at that time, and I'm glad he did because it worked really well in the movie."" <br/><br/>For Annie Hall, Allen received his first and only Oscar nomination for acting, and he deserved it. You may say that you've seen all his tricks many times but Annie Hall was the first movie where he mixed physical comedy, anxiety, and neurosis with the genuine feelings of love and nostalgia especially touchingly and funny. Engaging the audience to the film by talking directly to them may not be used for the first time ever by Allen but it worked perfectly in Annie Hall. Who would forget the scene in the ticket booth in an art house movie cinema where Woody summons up Marshall McLuhan to silence a self-important movie critic who just would not shut up? The flashbacks are smart and witty, the split screen technique that Allen uses, really adds to the characters' understanding by comparison two parallel streams of thought. Both, NYC and its antitheses, LA look gorgeous. Even the smallest cameos are memorable. Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum, for example, made their early appearances in Annie Hall. <br/><br/>The fascination and love that the film received upon its release had to do a lot with the fact that it was so different from everything Allen had done before Annie Hall. Checking the list of his earlier movies, one can't help noticing that they were pure slapstick comedies. The only earlier film that can be called Annie Hall's true predecessor is the one that Allen did not direct even though he wrote it, starred in it and for the first time shared the screen with Diane Keaton - Play it Again, Sam. As the first Allen's romantic dramedy, the one that had started the whole genre of independent and sophisticated urban love stories with an unusual, over self-involved and self-obsessed lead hero who is not always likable but nevertheless is always ready to be the first to laugh at himself, Annie Hall has found the high place in the film history.<br/><br/>Critics have compared Annie Hall to Fellini's 8 1/2 but Woody responded in his typical way that ""it's more like my 2 1/2"". The members of the academy did not think so, and rewarded the film with 5 Oscar nominations, of which it won four, making Annie Hall one of very few comedies to have won the Best Picture of the year Oscar and the shortest ever Oscar winner - 93 precious minutes of Woody Allen's genius and Diane Keaton's charming nervousness."

It's clear that Allen and Keaton are or were in love with each other, and they pop right off the screen. Every other role, from Colleen Dewhurst to Christopher Walken, is perfectly cast. <br/><br/>But the story itself, the simple way he deals with finding love, then losing it, will touch you. I don't think of this film so much as a comedy, although it's absolutely hilarious, as a film about loss with some laughs, and I appreciate it enough to watch it every few years, like an old friend.<br/><br/>If you've never seen this film, you're in for a wonderful evening."

","The movie that netted Woody Allen a Best Director Oscar (not to mention Best Picture) has him as comedian Alvy Singer in an on-off relationship with the title character (Diane Keaton, who also won an Oscar). There's the expected situations: familial embarrassment, self-deprecation, and the like. Probably the funniest scene is Alvy's conversation with the Evil Queen from ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". Truly a comedy classic. ""Anhedonia"" sure would have been an interesting title.<br/><br/>Anyone remember that time on ""That '70's Show"" when Eric and his mom went to see ""Annie Hall""?

","Why is this his best film?  Because he is still showing his wonderful love affair with New York City, because he is showing the great Diane Keaton in her like-Buster put-ons.  Because he knew then how to make indelible images in your mind: think of Annie in her goofy hat and tie and mannerisms.<br/><br/>Because they were new, we didn't have other images of him reproducing the same thing, the same tics, the same stale routines.  And of course, we didn't have to have our minds clouded with sordid images of his personal life.  Not that an artist's private life (or a politician's for that matter) should affect the power of his works: Picasso's 'Guernivica"" is still magnificent despite his brutality to women; Woody is still a master of photography, comedy and nebbishness, despite his psychological incest.<br/><br/>I understand that if I were Jewish I would 'get' even more of the movie than I did: when Annie orders a corned beef sandwich on white bread with mayonnaise, she is violating some Jewish deli more.  Guess I'll have to watch it with a Jewish friend of mine so he can point out such things to me. <br/><br/>So, see 'Annie Hall' again: the test of a great movie is that it is great no matter WHEN you see it...immediately, 10 years or 20 years after (what about 'Metropolis'?)  It is WE who have changed, and there's nothing like a great movie to show us surprisingly how.<br/><br/>And, Woody, it's time for you to make another NYC movie: a post 9/11 one with your choice of theme......a comic tragedy, maybe?  that would highlight the heartless mercenary/political  uses of the tragedy being made by Big Business and Bush?"

Men det tokigaste är att jag inte kan sätta fingret på varför jag inte kan säga något?<br/><br/>Annie Hall av Woody Allen är en historia i ett perfekt flöde. Fjärde väggen är en teaterbalkong där vi får sitta medan skådespelarna (främst Woody Allen) näst intill samtalar med oss. Och det känns som ett genuint samtal. Som att personen som detta händer faktiskt kommenterar det som händer medan det fortsätter hända.<br/><br/>Diane Keaton spelar titelpersonen Anni Hall. En öppen själ som möter neurotiske komikern Alvy (Woody Allen) och de fattar omedelbart tycke. Som nämnt så bryter filmen fjärde väggen vitt och brett, men den hoppar också i tiden och använder en del okonventionella grepp som undertexter som vid visar vad karaktärerna egentligen menar och tänker.<br/><br/>Det hela är en lek med filmskapandet, med publiken och bitvis med varandra. Men allt detta utan att tappa bort historien som berättas. Flödet i filmen är som sagt perfekt - jag kan inte minnas en scen där jag tappade filmen eller där jag inte var intresserad av det som skedde på duken. Det är mästerligt gjort och jag förstår varför denna film hyllas som Woody Allens kanske bästa.<br/><br/>Fanns det något att lära sig från filmen? Ja, på samma sätt som det finns i att dela någons livserfarenhet. Man kan se personens misstag och framsteg, se var de hamnade och kanske förstå lite varför. Något som man sedan kan ta till sig som en varning eller en förebild, beroende på var man själv tror att man vill färdas.<br/><br/>Jag skulle starkt rekommendera denna film för filmintresserade som ännu inte sett den.

Annie Hall is one of those rare films that as soon as it is over, you want to watch it again. It engages your mind, touches your heart and puts a smile on your face. Scene after scene, Woody Allen's romantic comedy about a neurotic intellectual is full of wit and laughs. It has a smart and funny script and outstanding performances by Diane Keaton and Allen.

Well, I laughed consistently if that tells you anything.<br/><br/>The movie uses techniques that were probably innovative when it was released in 1977, like Annie's immaterial essence doing something else why her body's in bed with Alvy (Allen). The dialogue-driven approach is refreshing (today, that is) and the way Alvy sometimes breaks the fourth wall is amusing.

","Re-watching this today I was struck by how this may have suffered the biggest Oscar snub of all time. Famously this film didn't start out as a romantic comedy but was a larger work of three different strands including a murder mystery (?). The first rough cut was over 2 hours and 30 minutes. Allen and Rosenblum than removed more than hour of material to shape it into a Rom. Comedy. It is amazing that the film even works in light of that. Further, one of the main techniques in the storytelling is free association where scenes bounce off of each other as they would occur to Alvy's consciousness and the film's timeline is a complete jumble. But it works. The film is hysterical and touching. It has a beating heart that captures the maddening nature of love. It is singularly a Woody Allen film.<br/><br/>There are other films by Allen which are better but this is everything the man is about. The experimental story structure, the neurotic intellectualized comedy, the self deprecating jabs at himself and film making it is all here. And the film works.<br/><br/>That it also features an absolutely charming Keaton performance is just a bonus."

The scene where Allen visits her family and meets amongst others Christopher Walken is subtle humor redefined.

The editing is beautifully done, and the whole film seems to be made up of long takes. Long takes as opposed to short ones that made up a lot of movies in the past, make it more enjoyable and smoother to watch. Also, Allen's approach of breaking the fourth wall is done in a way different than most films that do this.

It beats modern rom-coms by a landslide."

","Woody Allen is famously self-aware, but is he also self-deprecating? Some of ""Annie Hall""'s funniest scenes feature him being deprecating to others: a film professor who has no capacity to understand how pretentious he sounds, an alternative theater actor of the kind that cultivates artiness but would never admit to any affectation, and innumerable shallow everymen and women who populate the earth but fail to appreciate life's existential dilemmas. There is a hilarious moment (""hilarious moment"" is a redundancy in this film, as is ""cringe-worthy moment"") in which Allen's character tries to navigate a car out of a parking lot, and his inability to do so almost seems self-mocking until you remember that it's a way of making a point about the superiority of New York's public transportation and sidewalks. Allen (his character is not named Woody Allen, but the veil is barely there) also makes an issue out of having gone to therapy sessions for 15 years, but it's up for debate whether his lack of progress there is meant to be taken as a statement on how much is wrong with him or on the inability of professionals to help those whose eyes have so keenly pierced the void. In either case, Allen shows himself in ""Annie Hall"" to be not merely self-aware, but very good at recognizing the nature of others. His story and Diane Keaton's acting make Annie an incredibly vivid personality, fully sympathetic, whose arc must take her through Woody and on to other, if not necessarily better, things."

","The thing that sets this apart from other Woody Allen Movies is its sheer, electrifying efficiency. Sure, the Director/Writer/Actor is what he always is. A self deprecating, death obsessed, Nazi hating, neurotic Jew.<br/><br/>But here he is intertwined with so much wrap around that it is a dizzying, yet sharply edged commentary about love, culture, show biz, and human frailty. It is an unrestrained, razz-ma-tazz of Cinema techniques and stand up one-liners and it is all stirred with some biting bemusement.<br/><br/>Diane Keaton also is such an on screen force that Woody, at times, has to put it in overdrive just to keep up. He never fails. The pace is a non-stop, intelligent display of Artistic angst and there is so much fun that there isn't any time, except afterward, to contemplate all that has gone before.<br/><br/>A rich and rather poignant picture that pulls out all the tricks but never seems self indulgent, with just enough inquiry into the human psyche and just enough of the ridiculous to make this a unique and fascinating Film."

","I never really was a fan of Woody Allen films. Mainly because they tend to kind of depressing, but i recently realized that he has a very unique way at hitting the key points of life as a general term. While being his corky, weird, and sometimes overwhelmed self you somehow feel sympathy for the things he does. He is a man who stands true to himself while being as nice as any man could. What i enjoyed most about this film was the way he attempts to put himself and the audience along with him, inside of his memories. The idea of putting his present self literally in the scene of his memories is one thing, but to have his present self talk directly to the audience when this is happening is something I found really interesting. Not to many people have done this in my opinion and its a unique way to add some comic relief. <br/><br/>This film, unlike many of the other films composed in New York City, gave the city life style a more positive look. Many of the city films consist of anger and violence while this one took a more emotional approach. It kind of makes it seam more realistic or easier to put yourself in the composition of the director."

Through a unique narrative style Woody chronicles the relationship between two neurotic people over several years.

After watching this film, I hate Woody Allen. His character is narcissistic and rude. He always thinks about himself and his voice made me want to kill myself. The story is slow and boring. The characters constantly talk about sex and there is no way Woody Allen would ever get that much puss. He sleeps with at least five women throughout the film. That in and of itself is impossible. He is a short, ugly, and annoying man. The film is so shapeless and it repeats itself so many times, it is an utter chore to watch.<br/><br/>The acting is bad. Woody Allen casted himself in a film he directed (He has an ego problem). He is really bad also. Diane Keaton is quite good though. She plays a quirky yet cute woman.<br/><br/>The pacing is horrible. The film is slow and the runtime feels so long.<br/><br/>All in all, Woody Allen sucks.<br/><br/>Pros: Diane Keaton performs well<br/><br/>Cons: Woody Allen plays a narcissistic and annoying man who thinks that he knows everything, Woody Allen would never get that much puss, the story is boring, the characters suck, bad acting, slow pacing, and a long runtime.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 3.0"

","In Manhattan, neurotic Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is trying to figure out what caused his break-up with longtime girlfriend, Annie (Diane Keaton). True, the two were mismatches from the start. Alvy, raised in Brooklyn apartment under the Coney Island roller coaster, is Jewish and intellectual. Annie, however, from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, is a WASP who came to New York to make it as a singer and uses words like ""la di da"" and ""grammy"". So, how did it begin? Divorced, Alvy met Annie at a mixed doubles tennis match. Afterwards, Annie stuttered her way into giving Alvy a ride home, where he hugged the seat in terror at her erratic driving. Yet, things develop. Alvy encourages Annie to pursue her singing career more diligently, read more books, and go to therapy. Meanwhile, Annie tries to get Alvy to enjoy life more freely and enthusiastically. But, when a record producer (Paul Simon) catches Annie's act and wants her to come to California and spend time in the studio, will it be the end? This is a classic timeless film, Allen's best, in the view of many. It is extremely funny and breathes intelligence in every frame. Allen and Keaton shine as the lovebirds while Tony Roberts, Simon, Carol Kane, and Shelley Duvall back them up nicely. In a cameo, Christopher Walken is terrifying and comical. Of course, the Manhattan setting is terrific, the quirky costumes are memorable, and the direction quite clever and varied. So, what are you waiting for? Head out to get Annie Hall, well, NOW!"

She is a singer who is trying to make it, but when he and she become an item, she opens up more and wants to do more, but Alvy just would prefer to keep things the way they are.<br/><br/>The film is really remarkable and I have to say that I could understand it's praise, the story still remains so true to this day and any adult could really understand it's premisous. I loved the scene where both Annie and Alvy are at their therapists and they explain that the sex they're having is either not enough or too much.

","""Annie Hall"" can definitively be called director Woody Allen's masterpiece. Starring director Allen as Alvy Singer and Diane Keaton in the title role, ""Annie Hall"" is comedic look at a relationship between two lovers (Allen and Keaton) and the problems that plague their ""nervous romance,"" as the tag line says.<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" begins with a short monologue by Allen telling two jokes about how he feels about life, thus providing the set up for the character of Alvy Singer, which is further built up by a comedic look at his childhood, reminiscent of what we know about George Costanza's from ""Seinfeld."" From the beginning of his life, we learn Alvy has always been preoccupied with sex and girls.<br/><br/>The whole film is essentially a series of flashbacks about his relationship with Annie. We see how perfect they are for each other when they meet, both mutual with nervousness and verbal clumsiness. After he first meets Annie, more of the character of Alvy is revealed by revealing his fears- Annie's driving and death.<br/><br/>But we can't forget Annie. Diane Keaton's Annie is wonderfully performed because she isn't trying to be funny, she just is. Keaton's Annie is wonderfully different from Allen's Alvy as can be seen by her quirks, habits, and past relationships. When Alvy is uptight about sex, Annie is calm. When Alvy is neurotic about drugs, Annie is relaxed. When Alvy is whining about anti-Semitism, Annie talks about her Grammy Hall.<br/><br/>From a scene where Alvy and Annie visit her family in Chippewas Falls, Wisconsin, it can be seen from the mild mannered dinner conversation they the Halls are obviously WASPs. Again, Alvy's Jewish insecurities are tested again when he calls Grammy Hall a ""classic Jew-hater"" (not to her face though.) In a split screen comparison, the Halls and Singers are seen conversing with each other, the Halls with civil manner and tongue, the Singers with random manner and dialogue ""Annie Hall"" is a funny, but yet poignant look on relationships and much of the material in this film can be applicable to today's relationship. This film examines relationship problems from sex, drugs, artificial stimulation, past relationships, break up, marriage, how to capture escaped lobsters, and staying friends after the relationship goes bust. Yes, indeed this film did deserves it's four Oscars (Picture, Director-Allen, Original Screenplay, Actress-Keaton)."

Not to say that this isn't a good movie, but Allen has made many better films, including ""Love and Death"", ""Interiors"", and the very comparable ""Manhattan.""

","A few years back at a birthday party for my grandmother, I noticed that there was one other large party in the restaurant.  While they were quiet with proper etiquette and table manners, we were animated and boistrous with a minimum of two arguments per 15 minutes.  I turned to my mother and said ""It's just like the Halls and the Singers.""  You can tell that Annie Hall was one of Woody Allen's older movies based on the character he plays.  As Alvy Singer, Allen plays a short neurotic Jewish New Yorker who is obsessed with death.  ""Sun's bad for you.  Everything your parents say is good for you is bad for you.  Sun, milk, red meat, college..."" By contrast, Diane Keaton plays the title character, a pretentious WASP who is obsessed with life and her favourite expression is ""La-de-dah.""  Oh yeah, she just happens to be Allen's girlfriend.  The movie serves as an introspective commentary on the evolution of a relationship, and how Alvy Singer perceives his rapport with Annie Hall.  For instance, is her family truly a clan on anti-Semites, or is that just how Alvy envisions them?  The movie costars Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, and Paul Simon, with a guest appearance by Marshall McLuhan as himself.  One can see that it had a profound affect on the postmodern entertainment industry, as many aspects of the relationship between George and Susan on Seinfeld can be traced back to Annie Hall."

","I think the worst thing that ever happened to Woody Allen's career was the Oscar he won for Annie Hall. While it is a very funny in spots, it just encouraged him to make his movies more and more polished as well as more self-exploratory. I'm sorry, but I much prefer the earlier ""stupid"" films he did--where self-exploration was limited and they were just funny. Now, with Annie Hall and most of his subsequent films, he was trying to ""say something"". Yeah, maybe like ""I'm finished with good films and now I'll make essentially the same film again and again and again because it's a great adjunct to all my psychoanalysis"". I don't want to explore Woody's psyche, thank you very much--just entertain me and make me laugh.<br/><br/>Okay, to the film. Woody plays himself of sorts in the film. He goes to parties, meets famous people, has relationship problems and schmoozes. That's nice. About the only part of this film I loved was the scene where he and Diane Keaton are waiting in line to see a movie. During this wait, a pseudo-intellectual idiot keeps pontificating about the film and its symbolism. At which point, Woody begins talking to the camera--telling everyone what an idiot this guy is! Then, the blow-hard begins addressing the camera as well! Finally, Woody announces he has the author with him (standing behind a fake tree in the lobby). Then, the author tells the blow-hard that he is indeed stupid and totally misunderstood him! This is great--but there are not enough moments like this in the film. Considering how highly rated the film is, it looks like I am indeed in the minority."
"vince-41","10","3","7","12 December 1999"," Little epic
","Reviewing Fellini's ""Casanova"", Pauline Kael wrote, that it's impossible for a director to make a successful epic about himself. With ""Annie Hall"", Allen didn't just become first director to accomplish that, he was the first successful case of a person to just stand before camera, and tell the world about himself. Allen makes what other directors were afraid of: he shows all of his cards, he hides nothing. His message is: ""Here I am, a little man, telling you about my views on everything from sex to politics. Some of them are trivial, some original, but I don't care--take it or leave it"". ""Annie Hall"" could be so incredibly bad, but it wasn't. It is a masterpiece not in a sense that it's a very good film, it's rather one of those cases where you accept it for what it is.It's really simple, yes, but like with all Allen's films, it's simplicity borders with perfection. It's obvious that Allen was set to make a ""serious"" movie, but, like many times after, didn't. Instead, we got one of the funniest and honest films ever made. Maybe word masterpiece shouldn't be applied to ""Annie Hall"", but in his own half-baked way, Allen made the perfect self-portrait."

I gave it 3/10, because I could not but compare the movie to the others, far better ones, that W.Allen has made."

Everything from sitcom to romantic comedy owes a debt to this movie.<br/><br/>I liked this movie well enough, primarily for the script. It's playful with staging and multiple fourth-wall breaks (Woody Allen at his funniest here), and written for an adult audience. And Diane Keaton's ditzy performance added a necessary dose of sweetness. On the other hand, It was Allen's presence that sucked a good deal of enjoyment, at least for me. Had I seen this movie forty yeas ago, his neuroticism would've probably seemed a lot fresher to me.

","Annie Hall was 1977's Best Picture winner at the Oscars. I don't think it should have been. It was a solid movie for sure, but I couldn't buy the movie as the best film of 1977. While Woody Allen's Bananas was a screwball comedy, this film does mark Allen's most mature film up to this point. The comedy is still there, but the movie is deeper than in Allen's previous efforts. Allen cited advancing age for his more philosophical views (as he turned forty in 1975 which gave him strong opinions about death.) These philosophical views involves what it means to be romantic, Jewish heritage, the ideas of getting older, the banality of life, and of course as in most Allen's film, a love story to the great city of New York. It also has been told that the movie resembles the personal life of Woody Allen. I wouldn't find that surprising because he did date the star of the film, Diane Keaton at one point. I thoroughly enjoyed the philosophical views that Allen had in the film.<br/><br/>That also comes to the crux of my problems I had with the film. All the philosophy is fine and dandy, but people don't realize how much this film is talking. People call this film a masterpiece, but they fail to see that this film is 121 minutes of talking and walking. I was mesmerized by Allen's incredible dialogue, but eventually the talk wore me out (which is hard to do). This is a major issue, but luckily for the film it was the only issue I had. Too much talk, but the words were incredibly fluid thanks to the thoughtful script by Allen. There are some memorable monologues, and I liked how Allen spoke to the camera. It is rare for a movie to have an actor speak to the camera in a successful way, but Allen made it work here. He created a romantic comedy that made people laugh, and also made people cry. It represented more of a mature side to him that people seldom saw before this. Sure his screwball antics are still here, but his maturity level was elevated by several notches.<br/><br/>Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a neurotic stand-up comedian who reflects on the demise of his last relationship. He dated a woman named Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) who was an aspiring nightclub singer. Alvy reflects over the good times and bad times over the course of their relationship and also on factors that caused this relation to happen. He talks about growing up near C0ney Island, how he had sexual desires from a very young age, and how he always felt guilty about his Jewish heritage growing up.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie twice. The first time, it took awhile for me to appreciate Woody Allen's acting in this film. This time, I was instantly brought in to the story by his inner monologue. Allen is essentially playing himself with lots of rapid intellectual dialogue. But I enjoyed watching him piece out the information on why his relationship failed. I really did like how be added depth to his character. He may be funny, but it's not all about the comedy this time around. Diane Keaton, whom we know from The Godfather, does very well in her role. Her character is somewhat based off herself she admitted. Her character is shy, insecure at times, but she's sweet and honest. There are some good supporting roles here too. We get to see a young Christopher Walken as Annie's brother Duane. We see two other women that Alvy got into relationships with and they were performed decently from Carol Kane and Shelley Duvall. Also, there are two blink-or-you-miss cameos in the film. Keep any eye out for Jeff Goldblum and Signourey Weaver! Overall, I enjoyed watching what is probably Woody Allen's most personal movie. He later admitted he was not happy with the film because it was not the film he intended to make. But that didn't stop critics and audiences alike all around the world from calling Annie Hall the best movie of 1977. Unfortunately, I do not share that sentiment. I do, however, think this film is a good watch. It's funny at times, but it is also a thoughtful film. I would even call it a semi-experimental film. It's a film that you need to pay utmost attention to or you'll be lost. The story is not linear because there are mnay flashbacks spread throughout. Only Woody Allen could create enough witty and strong dialogue where you wouldn't need action to complement those words. For that reason alone, this film is deserving of its Best Screenplay Oscar win. This movie is a solid watch thanks to a strong, intelligent screenplay and very strong performances from Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. However, it falls short from the masterpiece everyone claims it to be.<br/><br/>My Grade: B"

","""Annie Hall"" is what you consider a typical Woody Allen movie, although he'd probably hate this classification. It centers around the concept of love and human relationships, expectations, fears and needs. In the typical mixture of comedy, drama and stylistic elements we follow a couple falling in love and growing out of it, learning about themselves through the other.<br/><br/>I really like how unconventional this movie deals with the topic. A movie about love and relationships is really not on top of innovation, yet it feels like this film has a sense for the undertones of love. In many ways philosophical, it raises questions and searches for answers, not always finding the right ones maybe but matching the complexity of human relationships.<br/><br/>I found it interesting to learn that Allen himself doesn't think highly of this film. Indeed I also liked other of his films, especially ""Whatever works"" more, that seemed to be even more on point to me. ""Annie Hall"" sometimes takes quite a lot of time to make a point and at times gets lost in itself.<br/><br/>Nonetheless this is a movie you should see. It leaves you with a lot to think about."

","Annie Hall is directed by Woody Allen who also stars and co-writes the screenplay with Marshall Brickman. Cast alongside Allen is Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall, Christopher Walken and Colleen Dewhurst.<br/><br/>Alvy Singer (Allen) investigates the reasons why his relationship with Annie Hall (Keaton) failed.<br/><br/>It's just not for me! This film I mean. I like a lot of Woody Allen stuff, Manhattan is a big favourite, but I just can't see why Annie Hall is so revered. I recognise the major talent in Allen's armoury, his dialogue is choice and often witty, observations wry and reaction timing sometimes supreme. And I know, I do, that Annie Hall is a template of sorts that must have been seen as fresh back in 1977. But it appears to me that the film's central flaw is largely ignored on account of what has been termed as unique genius!<br/><br/>The relationship at the core between Annie and Alvy is just dull, hardly anything happens between them, so are we meant to care about them? Or is it just a ruse for Allen to say some jokey one-liners? Interestingly, Allen himself has stated he was far from happy with how the film turned out, even going so far as to say it's not what he envisaged, was in fact disappointed that people only focused on the Alvy and Annie relationship. This makes sense to me since that aspect of the film is only a small thread of the intended whole cranial quilt. Does that make Annie Hall a fluke? That so many people missed what Allen was aiming for? To wit! It ultimately plays out as a series of disjointed witticisms formed around Allen's neurosis. Plenty of classical moments are within, and the actors are very good in making the scenarios work, but lots of little good bits do not make a 10/10 Academy Award winning classical whole.<br/><br/>Yep, I'm very much in the minority, I know that, but Annie Hall's gigantic reputation bewilders me. Rest assured, though, I'm happy with that and it's unlikely I could ever sit through it again. 6/10"

","I was slightly disappointed after watching ""Annie Hall"". It is touted as one of the all time great films. While it is an enjoyable film but I don't think it quite lives up to its reputation.<br/><br/>Diane Keaton won a Best Actress Oscar for her performance and she is the best thing in it. She plays Annie, initially as an awkward wannabe nightclub singer but later becoming a confident young woman at the expense of her relationship with Allen's character.<br/><br/>The main characters in the movie are great. From Keaton's Annie to Allen's neurotic writer they are a bit mad but you come to like them a lot and wish the best for them. I thought Allen throws in too many ""funny"" lines for his character, especially at the start of the movie. Some of these lines just aren't funny and you just want him to get on with the story.<br/><br/>There are some great scenes in the movie. I thought the visit to Annie's family in the Mid-west was hilarious, complete with Jew-hating ""Grammy Hall"" and a cameo from a young Christopher Walken.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching, perhaps along with ""Manhattan"", a movie from the same period in Allen's career."
"elshikh4","8","2","4","4 April 2008"," A Great Comedy By (Woody Allen) About (Woody Allen) !
","When someone secludes himself into himself, and becomes incapable of change; then he loses his love. That's the smart meaning of this comedy. And what's even smarter is how that serious meaning was made through a comedy.<br/><br/>(Woody Allen) structured the story on numerous situations, which he organized in the same order how they run in his lead's mind. That lead himself is considered now an icon in terms of expressing the hesitant cultured man, who's timorous when it comes to love, commitment, and stability. The final result is something deep yet funny; to the extent that it could be the funniest psychological movie ever made.<br/><br/>I loved that collection of daily details which formulate the lead's character eloquently, take a list: How he, as self-conceited, feels importunate necessity to prove his point of view's rightness for some guy, who hears accidentally in a line of a theater; hence, it takes a brief dream appearance of (Marshall McLuhan) to assure the lead's superiority, and shut-up any disagreement. The lead's culture gets in the way between him and having sex with a beauty, while - in fact - it's his forever fear disguised as a discussion about who killed (JFK), where he doesn't suspect the CIA, but - really - his own sexual capacities! The lead doesn't see anyone further himself; so he deemed dully that the need for love, ambition, encouragement, and alteration form his girl's side--are nothing but bad symptoms caused by her period! He was too blind to grasp the truth of himself as the actual reason of why his love failed. And lastly, he can't change himself, only his love story's end, which he writes as a play; because what can't be fixed in reality can be fixed in art. This is, as a whole, a profound exploration done very amusingly too.<br/><br/>So with uniquely structured script; that provided masterly drama and comedy, lively editing, and lovely acting, (Annie Hall) has the word ""classic"" written all over it. Many next movies, some of them by (Allen) himself, wanted to imitate it. But they were mostly less good. Maybe because they were uncreatively subjective, stupidly vague, boringly soulless. Or maybe not as witty, intensive, or hearty as (Annie Hall).<br/><br/>Though, the thing to bother a bit is that (Allen) with his strong consciousness and brilliant inventiveness became less attractive as time goes by, with the same problems in the same character; which produced several comedies by (Woody Allen) about (Woody Allen)'s cinematic persona. Hmmm, that's the act of someone who secludes himself into himself, and becomes incapable of change. As if (Allen) doesn't learn from his own lessons.. even they're that good!"

","Woody Allen grew up with ""Annie Hall,"" his at-the-time unconventional romance about two insecure but lovable New Yorkers. There's a distinct line dividing the films he had made up to that point, all of them really a 1970s equivalent to the screwball comedies of the 1930s. ""Annie Hall"" brought him respect and admiration from the ""serious"" film community (in other words, the film won Oscars), and Allen's movies were different from that point forward.<br/><br/>Allen uses a complex narrative structure to tell what is in essence a simple story, using flashbacks and forwards, and integrating devices that in his earlier movies had simply been gimmicks (like talking directly into the camera) seamlessly into his story. But all of that aside, the strength of ""Annie Hall"" is due to the wonderful characters Allen wrote, and the delightful performances of him and, especially, Diane Keaton, who plays Annie divinely. When Keaton first introduces us to Annie, she's a dingbat full of eccentric tics. But over the course of the film she evolves into a complicated, vulnerable yet tough woman who all too realistically outgrows Allen's character, Alvy Singer, a neurotic comedian who thinks every single person he comes in contact with is harboring hidden anti-Semitic tendencies. ""Annie Hall"" gives a perfect illustration of how two people who are right for each other in so many ways just can't make a relationship work. It's funny as hell at times, but it's predominant tone is one of nostalgic melancholy.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","I could easily write for more than 1,000 words about Annie Hall, because the film is of such a high standard of quality that it deserves to be written about. The film is simply amazing. The dialogue between Alvy (Woody Allen) and all of the other characters, portrays what a relationship really is, not just between a man and a woman, but between a man and his family, his in-laws, his co-workers and his audience. The film is filled with comedy from start to finish as well, from the scene where Alvy complains about how a fellow movie-goer shouts his opinions too loud, to when Christopher Walken's character explains how his mind works, this is the funniest film I've ever seen. It's amazing what Allen managed to do with such a small budget. He made a film filled with all the wonder you could ask from a big-budget high profile comedy, but used dialogue that matters instead of gross-out humor.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This is the best romantic comedy that will ever be and is one of the most entertaining experiences of my lifetime."
"Det_McNulty","9","2","4","28 May 2007"," I Think Of ""Annie Hall"" As The Cynic's Parallel To ""It's a Wonderful Life"". I Like That Contrast
","Revisiting Annie Hall is like meeting up with a friend you have not seen in years, it really is that personal. I find it hard to comprehend as to how anyone could not find some sort of connection with the film's honesty. The film's bond with its viewer is quite possibly the key basis as to why the film is so globally admired, as it is a film which both men and women can relate to. Not only this, but Annie Hall offers the viewer the idea that they are not alone in their disillusion of love, and that it is human nature for the majority of love to quite literally fade away with time.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is another bittersweet, charming and identifiable tale of romance, but from Woody Allen's cynical point of view. Set in New York, Woody Allen is arguably performing as himself, a neurotic comedian named Alvy Singer, who is struggling to balance his love life, while tackling his own self-reservations and negative outlooks on life. The film charts his erratic lifestyle by looking at his experiences, exaggerating them and attempting to understand where he went wrong. Woody Allen accomplishes all this through hysterically unique narrative-cuts, including questioning the viewer and showing his urge to of spoken his mind in a particular situation.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is both a bleak film, while also being an oddly uplifting one, and a film which I find considerably therapeutic. Bursting with intellect and philosophy, Annie Hall remains Woody Allen's definitive masterpiece, the film which defines both him and his career. The film's beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and although there is a fair amount of bleak cinematography there is still no denying the beauty that lies in the film's final montage. The charming sequence defines everything Woody Allen wanted to say about life and how everything is a series of frantic events.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is widely regarded for possessing one of the finest scripts of all-time, and rightly so. Few scripts burst with such a fierce amount of fiery, sharp humour and cultural knowledge. Using devastating heart-break to side-splitting one-liners, the film continuously succeeds in letting each actor and actress deliver their line with perfect comedic essence. Flowing with misery and negativities the script feels so true to its form. Mixing tragedy with humour is a technique Woody Allen has mastered. The brutal honesty is highly effective as it sufficiently represents moments that we all go through in life. The script's use of sexual irony and sexual innuendo is apparent in almost every scene, delightfully representing both genders' outlook on sex. The script pontificates over its characters, which are all flawed in some way, yet all so delightfully charismatic. Rather than being a one-track, simple-minded comedy, Annie Hall develops its themes, rather than carelessly glossing over them.<br/><br/>In Annie Hall the actors and actresses do not look glamorous, or even close to Hollywood stars. They look natural, and that is what helps the film slide away from being the clichÃ©d American romance. It is actually a method which enables the film to become a symbol of the average person's life. Not only this, but the narrative is presented in a revolutionary manner, altering the average occurrence (such as a dinner party) into a study of a person's physical gestures, this is a way of representing what a person is thinking. Woody Allen is offering the viewer a psychological analysis of the lives we live. Woody Allen uses time as a method of gaining a perspective of the events in Alvy Singer's love-life. Even when the narrative is told in a non-linear style the film still pieces itself together through editing, hence the film is not chaotic, but the romance is. The disconnected editing and transitions actually help to embody the sporadic and nervous relationship, while seemingly portraying the varied speed and detachment our lives move at.<br/><br/>The performances all help to make Annie Hall the film it is today, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen have perfect chemistry and both create emotional parallels for their characters. To add to the organic experience of Annie Hall, all the stutters, unfinished sentences, delayed responses and mispronounced words are used during conversation. Do not forget to look out for the variety of small, yet highly amusing cameos from some of America's most famous actors and actresses.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, Allen's awkward humour is an acquired taste and I would recommend it being a necessity to become familiar with his work before being able to appreciate Annie Hall to its best extent. To some, the humour is subtle; to others, it is openly hysterical. Although, the one thing everyone can agree on is the film's innovation, even if you do refuse to believe that love does not prevail. But really, Woody Allen is aware that Annie Hall is funny because everything about it is all so true and he can see the humour behind his own unhappiness."
"MOscarbradley","10","2","4","6 May 2007"," This could well be the Woodmeister's finest hour
","When I first saw ""Annie Hall"" back in 1977 I voted it the most over-rated film of the year. As Alvy and Annie would say, 'God, what a schmuck'. What I didn't realize then was that I was watching a masterpiece and one of the funniest films ever made. Time has been kind to ""Annie Hall"" and I guess I must have been suffering from anhedonia, that inability to experience pleasure and the title Woody was originally planning to use. Seeing it today, the jokes not only seem funnier but legendary with it, (hindsight is a great thing). Perhaps they have passed into our sub-conscious and it takes very little to bring them to the fore. But then, in 1977, we didn't really have a yardstick to compare it with. We knew Woody could write good comedy; ""Love and Death"" showed he wasn't just very funny but clever and sophisticated as well but none of his films before ""Annie Hall"" showed this kind of cinematic sensibility. ""Annie Hall"" is great, not just because it is a great comedy but because it shows a great film-maker hitting pay-dirt and in hindsight it may be safe to say he never again quite achieved that miraculous blend of comic timing and filmic brilliance, at least not on this level. The Academy voted it the Best Picture of its year and gave Woody their director's prize, (and another for writing it), as well as giving Diane Keaton the prize for Best Actress; it was to their credit and among their finest hours."
"JamesHitchcock","10","2","4","23 August 2006"," Woody Allen's Funniest Film
","To celebrate my 300th review for IMDb, I thought that I would turn to one of my favourite films from one of my favourite film-makers. ""Annie Hall"" is one of what I regard as Woody Allen's five truly great films, the others being (in chronological order) ""Love and Death"", ""Manhattan"", ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" and ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"". If ""Manhattan"" is Allen's most penetrating analysis of human relationships, and ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"" is his film with the greatest philosophical depth, then ""Annie Hall"" must surely be his funniest. It has a script that is sparklingly witty even by Woody's standards, containing such classic Woodyisms as ""I was thrown out of N.Y.U. my freshman year for cheating on my metaphysics final, you know, I looked within the soul of the boy sitting next to me"" and the unforgettable ""Don't knock masturbation. It's sex with someone I love"".<br/><br/>Like ""Manhattan"", ""Annie Hall"" is a study of relationships set among New York's bohemian classes, but is simpler in its structure. Whereas ""Manhattan"" was centred around a sort of eternal quadrangle that at times threatened to become a pentagon or even hexagon, ""Annie Hall"" is very much based on the relationship between one man and one woman. It is probably Woody's most autobiographical film. His character is named Alvy Singer; the name ""Alvy"", short for Alvin, was probably chosen because of its closeness to ""Allen"". Diane Keaton, who was his real-life girlfriend at this time, plays Alvy's lover, Annie Hall. (Hall is Keaton's real surname). Like Woody, Alvy is a Jewish New York comedian. Like Keaton, Annie is a Gentile, originally from the Mid-West, and is working in New York as an actress and singer.<br/><br/>As is normal in Woody's films, the two main characters are very different. Alvy is the typical neurotic Allen intellectual, meeting every situation with angst-ridden humour. Like many Allen characters he can be described as passive-aggressive, but perhaps with less passivity and more aggressiveness than most. (Annie and his other girlfriends frequently characterise him as ""hostile""). Annie is both more extrovert and more easygoing, and Alvy often envies her more relaxed attitude. Keaton, in what was probably her best performance in a distinguished career, plays her with great naturalness and charm; her ""Best Actress"" Oscar was well-deserved.<br/><br/>The plot is a simple one; it chronicles the development of Alvy and Annie's affair from their first meeting to their eventual break-up. (Alvy compares their relationship to a shark which dies if it cannot keep going forward). Annie then becomes involved with a Hollywood producer and Alvy travels to California to see if he can win her back. (Woody clearly does not care much for California in general and Los Angeles in particular; the film contains some of his most barbed contributions to the East Coast/West Coast culture wars, along the lines of ""I don't want to move to a city where the only cultural advantage is being able to make a right turn on a red light"".) The simplicity of the plot, however, does not mean that this is a simple film. The story of Annie and Alvy's relationship is told in a non-linear manner with numerous flashbacks, including some to Alvy's two earlier marriages. Woody also makes very effective use of such devices as a split screen (in order to show Annie and Alvy simultaneously when they are not together) and subtitles (in order to show how his characters' true feelings do not match their words). There is even a brief cartoon sequence.<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" was, of course, the film that beat ""Star Wars"" to the ""Best Picture"" Oscar, something that was very controversial even at the time. Woody himself won ""Best Director"" ahead of George Lucas. Like any film lover I frequently have my disagreements with the Academy (such as when they failed even to nominate ""Manhattan"" in 1980) but I have to say that 1978 was one year when they got things completely right. I have nothing in particular against ""Star Wars"" itself, which is a well-made and entertaining science-fiction adventure, although I do dislike some of its sequels and the quasi-religious cult which has grown up around it. ""Annie Hall"", however, is far superior in its script, its characterisation, its acting and in its innovative techniques. ""Star Wars"" is superior only in its special effects, and the day when the Academy starts handing out ""Best Picture"" awards on the basis of special effects alone will be a sad one for the cinema.<br/><br/>The irony is that Woody Allen probably appreciated his Oscar far less than George Lucas would have done if he had won. He famously absented himself from the ceremony, preferring to attend his regular jazz session instead, and the film itself contains some satire at the expense of such prizes. (""What's with all these awards? They're always giving out awards. Best Fascist Dictator: Adolf Hitler.""). In a sense, however, Oscars do not just belong to those who win them. They also belong to all those who appeared in or worked on the film and, in a wider sense, to all those who love it. On behalf of all those who, like me, admire ""Annie Hall"" and Woody's work in general, I hereby thank the Academy. 10/10"

And it's not a sad film either - we know from the start the relationship is over but that doesn't stop the viewer from enjoying every moment as if it were afresh.

","""Annie Hall"" seems to be everyone's favourite Woody Allen picture. It was his first masterpiece as well as his crowning work. When people think of Allen, even if they are not familiar with this, always picture him in his famous green jacket he wears here. It is not my favourite film of his (my favourite of his is the 1986 masterpiece ""Hannah and Her Sisters"") but this has the most instant identity among all his films. It is also the one that packs the most hilarity with philosophy.<br/><br/>Allen loves basing characters on himself, especially his early films. In this he plays insecure New York comedian Alvy Singer. He doesn't really suffer from depression, but he's hardly ever happy. He only sees the worst in things and never wants to belong to a club that would have someone like him as a member. As a child his parents fought constantly and they literally lived underneath a roller coaster in Coney Island. He's been seeing a shrink for fifteen years and still goes. He's been divorced twice by great women whom he over-analyzes.<br/><br/>Alvy soon meets his seeming perfect match: performing artist, Annie Hall. Annie is almost the opposite of Alvy, making her the perfect woman for him. They fall madly in love and their blossoming romance is quite beautiful. With their love blooming, ditzy Annie changes for the better. She develops confidence and does well in college too. But Alvy is not the kind of person that changes that easily. Part of the comedy is Alvy not changing, but it's also pretty sad. Annie's self change is wonderful.<br/><br/>Alvy loves Annie and Annie loves Alvy, but their romance just fizzes out (mostly due to Alvy's inability to be happy). There was really nothing either of them could have done to save their relationship. But what Alvy realizes about it is great: despite Alvy and Annie never going to tie the knot, lots great things and fun times happened when they were together. That is the central theme in this film. Annie develops success thanks to Alvy and Alvy writes a play based on his relationship with Annie. Of course, Alvy writes the play with a happy ending. We all want art to come out perfect because it is so hard for reality to be perfect.<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" won the 1978 Oscars for Best Picture and Director, besting out ""Star Wars."" I am not at all a Star Wars geek, but the sci-fi opera really should have won the gold; at least Best Director because this wasn't a special feat in filmmaking. This is a gigantic feat in writing and acting, not filming.<br/><br/>Woody Allen is a genius and he makes one of the great staples in American cinema.<br/><br/>4/4"

","Thank heavens I know about enough of people like William Buckley and Marshall McLuhan in order to enjoy ""Annie Hall""; thank goodness I know who Federico Fellini is in order to laugh at one of its jokes whereby his name is mentioned. ""Annie Hall"" is like that - it's in and out with a joke or a reference or a line of dialogue and, before you've even been granted the time to absorb it; digest it; appreciate it, it's flown on to the next one. It plays, in fact, a little bit like a stand-up comedy routine - it has a certain flowing evanescence to it, an absorbing self-confidence. It isn't flippant or chaotic - moreover, it is a film under almost the complete control of those who have made it; its poise refreshing and its influence on its genre coming to it now quite evident.<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" is, in essence, a somewhat conventional love story told in an unconventional, even peculiar, manner. It breaks the fourth wall; hops around two different equilibriums; plucks famous people out from behind house plants and speaks to them; interviews people in the street; uproots the action from one end of the United States to the other halfway through and, perhaps most jarringly, departs for an animated sequence involving the film's protagonist and an old Disney villain. And yet, at its heart, is a relatively simple exploration of love; relationships and what it means to really feel something for someone else.<br/><br/>Alvy, played by the film's director and writer Woody Allen, is a stand-up comedian living in New York with a kind of C-list celebrity status whose life is characterised by his comedic routines; games of tennis with his best friend Rob (Tony Roberts) and a persecution complex that all Gentiles secretly hate him (he mishears when someone asks him 'Did you...?' and 'Did Jew...?') He has already been married twice.<br/><br/>His story is one about a relationship with the eponymous Annie, played by Diane Keaton, who, just to complicate a film already dripping in postmodernism, happened to be Allen's partner at the time of the shoot; whose surname was originally Hall and whose real-life nickname was, indeed, 'Annie'. It cannot be a coincidence that, when they are first introduced to one another at a tennis club, they quite literally undertake this process of facing off over the net with one another, going head-to-head in what is a sport characterised by back-and-forths. Later, when they head back to hers for a drink and she serves wine, one of them must consume theirs out of a half-pint glass due to a lack of proper wine-glasses. It's a small detail but it cleverly infers Annie is not used to hosting.<br/><br/>The pleasure, in fact, from watching the film derives from the fact the subject matter is handled with a surprising amount of maturity, which clashes with the approach but never sees one overwhelm the other. It also derives from the fact the film, exemplified in the above, is made like a proper film: the camera is an active participant in the action and the message; the edits are rarely invisible; the approaches it takes to shooting specific scenes appear carefully chosen for specific reasons.<br/><br/>Take, for instance, the scene fairly early on, though deep into Alvy and Annie's tryst, whereby, in the dead of night, they lie in bed and talk over one another, unsure if they want to make love, and are shot from a perspective which is so far away, we are able to see the entire room and all its clutter. Eventually, a siren roars past outside and they call the whole thing off. The language of the scene infers degrees of chaos and mess in their relationship, a sharp contrast to an earlier scene under exactly the same circumstances when they are shot from a tighter angle, reflecting closeness, and in tones more synonymous with scenes of romance - low lighting and soft shadow.<br/><br/>But the film is more than a mere love story, the likes of which we may have seen a hundred times. It philosophises on relationships; concluding that while some are just doomed, irrespective of what is tried, you need them in the first place in order to move on to life's next stage. Alvy, for instance, encourages Annie to study an adult course in something, but this only pushes her closer to a lecturer. When he tells her to take her singing more seriously, this just pushes her into the eyes of a record producer, thus dooming the relationship. And yet, what would Annie really be if she'd never even met Alvy?<br/><br/>
Dorling Kindersley's ""Movie Book"" of 2014 concludes that the film is, at its heart, an exploration of what makes a relationship successful, even resorting to asking people in a New York street what they think. But, the review concludes bleakly, there is no real answer: one couple remark that they're happy because they're shallow and don't have 'anything interesting to say' to one another. Compared to modern comedies about sex or relations or a combination of the two, this stands head and shoulders above most in the genre and is unsurprisingly looked upon as the springboard for Allen's fame."

","Alvy hasn't much confidence. He must be some kind of loser in the bedroom. He's no big muscular bruiser. He is browbeaten by Mother, and is such a dweeb elsewhere. He's a know it all who doesn't know much. It's called ""Annie"", but it's about Alvy's glaring insecurities. It's a personality study about his life, notwithstanding his several sexual partners who as a group find him sort of an underwhelming nobody. Annie, on the other hand, seems to be his major failure. In real life, these two actors had a relationship a few years before this film was made. Question: Do all/most of these women have to jump into bed with Alvy the minute they've laid eyes on him? What's his secret? Millions of men want to know."

","At the time it came out, it was a huge hit. At that time in his career, Allen's neurotic persona was the main character of his films. His ethnic neurotic shtick was different than what everyone else was doing, and came off as fresh and funny. He brought in Diana Keaton to play her WASP neurotic persona as his love interest. Allen and Keaton had a winning formula for the 1970s Jewish neurotic plus WASP neurotic, equals successful comedy. ""Annie Hall"" was Allen's first deeper satire and it was successful to the extent of Oscar possibilities. Keaton won the Best Actress Academy Award as the title character and while he didn't win for his performance, Allen won for directing & co-writing the screenplay."
"IanIndependent","8","0","0","4 October 2019"," Still Crazy After All These years?
","It's still got it. We're now at October 2019 and Annie Hall is still funny, engrossing and relevant. I first saw this film as a teenager when it came out in 1977. I've seen it four or five times since but not in the last 10-15 years. Allen's film is still different enough to seem new and is not embarrassing because of it's age. Jokes, opinions, filming style even clothes fashion haven't dated. Diane Keaton for instance still dresses amazingly in places with looks that wouldn't be out of place in a films or even bohemian life today. In fact what has changed for me over the years watching this film is Keaton. When I first saw Annie Hall I saw her as Allen's stooge. Someone he used to bounce jokes and ideas off but, now, gradually, over the years, I've come to see Allen as more like just the gag man. I watch Annie Hall now and think the film is so aptly named because it is the character Annie Hall, even more than Albie, who is central to the film and Keaton's playing of her is such a perfect mix of the naive, ditzy and girl wanting to experience life. Yes, still a film I would watch again."

"RagingDraugr","10","0","0","24 August 2019"," ""Irrational, And Crazy, And Absurd..."" And I Love It.
","Annie Hall is a film that surprised me quite immediately by how eclectic it was. It was eclectic in its cinematography, its humour, its editing, its elaborate breaking of the fourth wall...and it went by so quickly that I felt like re-watching it immediately after the first viewing. Will I? I very well could. And not many films I've watched have ever instilled me with that feeling.<br/><br/>Maybe it inevitably comes down to the fact that many of the more intertextual jokes in Annie Hall are ones I don't completely understand. Possibly it's the jokes and little details that pass you by before you even get the chance to fully take it all in, like the photos Annie (Diane Keaton) took of Alvy (Woody Allen) with the lobster in a later scene or the pedestrian crossing lights changing to 'Walk' as Alvy leaves the frame after saying goodbye to Annie, literally and metaphorically indicating their relationship is over...maybe I'm reading into that too deeply.<br/><br/>But perhaps its 'rewatchability' results from the chemistry in its cast. The story of two neurotic but very different people who fall in and out of love is strange, compelling and oddly sweet, and the ""fidgeting"" and insistence of the narrative to go all over the place is as if Alvy is trying to piece together what went wrong in his and Annie's relationship - but the audience has vague ideas of why just by being outside observers. So the portrait the film paints of its characters could be why I like it so much. I can't honestly say, I would need to stew on it for a lot longer to come to a more definitive conclusion.<br/><br/>But what I do know is that, somehow, I love this film. Like it's final line, my interest in Annie Hall seems ""totally irrational, and crazy, and absurd..."", but something tells me I will keep revisiting this film for a while yet.<br/><br/>Overall: 10/10 - as with all my ratings, it's just an arbitrary number and may fluctuate."
"r-yasemi","10","0","0","20 July 2019"," Modern Love Story
","Annie Hall is founded upon couple of modern perspectives of life presented to the viewer in Allen's jokes. the validity of these ""jokes"" unravels throughout the movie up until that last kiss preceding Allen's monologue.
People start to see each other for one reason or another and soon they sleep with each other even though they can see from the day one that what in the other person's personality would start to bother them very soon, but they proceed regardless because we are all afraid of loneliness. It is portrayed after Alvy and Annie first break-up.
How a relationship ends up to be is much affected by chance and sort of mysterious randomness. Allen is the master to picture that. When we see flashbacks of previous relationships of characters we notice that each of them could be equally meaningless or fulfilling. There is no majestic glow of eternal love in any of them, and I believe this is what characterizes modern love."

","This is easily my favorite Woody Allen film I've seen- it's incredibly smart, thoughtful and funny. There are a few gags that also run too long. One particular gag is when Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are standing in line waiting to buy movie tickets, and during this scene a cinephile spouts his opinions on the films of Fellini and Samuel Fuller (nothing like pandering to the audience).Though I have a few minor qualms, that's what they are: minor. A majority of this movie is absolutely astounding, really funny, and undeniably influential.

Those were captivating and totally situational. This one is best ..<br/><br/>I feel that life is divided into the horrible and the miserable. That's the two categories. The horrible are like, I don't know, terminal cases, you know, and blind people, crippled. I don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me. And the miserable is everyone else. So you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's very lucky, to be miserable."

","Prior to this film, the only things I knew about Woody Allen I'd heard through 'The Simpsons' - all his films have 'that nervous fella' in them and, apparently, he's 'a neurotic nerd who likes to sleep with little girls'. The nervous fella certainly was there and Allen is certainly a nerd, but, thankfully, there was no indication of the third statement. This film was a brilliant spin on a traditional romantic comedy. Allen's address of the audience throughout the film took it away from that of a corny narration, whilst its content was witty and intelligent. There were several lines that made me laugh aloud ('sex with you is Kafka-esque' being one of them). The direction of the film added to the humour, with quick cuts contrasting previous situations, yet also added a significant beauty to the production. The montage of moments between Alvy and Annie at the end, accompanied by 'Old Times' was very touching, and a strong end to a highly enjoyable film."

","I loved this film! This is a film primarily about the rise and fall romantic relationship. However, Woody Allen's creative genius allows it to become so much more. From the non-linear timeline to the subtitles telling the audience what the characters are actually saying, Allen's decisions keep the movie interesting and fresh. My favorite scene is the one in which Annie, who is brilliantly portrayed by Diane Keaton, and Alvy (Allen's character) are having intercourse, but Annie is bored, and a manifestation of her mind is sitting in a chair near the bed. I found this to be a very inventive and imaginative way to depict Annie's boredom; it stuck out to me as one of the most memorable moments of the movie. This movie examines the realities of relationships; it reflects the happiness they bring as well as the boredom, anger and heartbreak they cause. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and would love to see more Woody Allen films."

","I really enjoyed this movie, although I must say, I felt slightly disappointed. I think it is likely because the comedy community hypes Woody Allen to the point of unrealistic expectations. There were some instances of humor I didn't enjoy, certain one liners seemed somewhat dated and corny for example. However, there is another side to the movie's humor...Allen seems to write a kind of depressed nihilism into the character that I found amusing. It perfectly represents the personality of most comedians. A need to turn to jokes because of their miserable outlook. But there is a part of all of us that can relate to this."

","An amazingly heart felt tale for what it is, in the technical aspects the film is perfectly fine, excelling in set design and the creation of an immersive atmosphere. Following the romantic tales of a smart Jewish comedian falling in love with a ditsy woman trying to get herself straight. After many fallouts the plot comes to a wonderful conclusion, it wraps rather nicely, I'd go into more detail but spoilers are a no- no, so I'll stick to describing it. It's another true to life scenario with how things go, focusing on the complexity of relationships and how much then can go to affect how somebody does things, and how much one can change a person. A good watch for those who enjoy romances, and also to those who can appreciate the deeper plot elements seeded into it."

","I love Woody Allen and his awkward humor. The opening scene is very fascinating and I love how he breaks the fourth wall. This is just a really cool technique. He just sits and talks to the audience in an almost rambling. This allows him to establish a relationship with audience. He really just seems like a regular guy who is talking about his problems and his distress. The rambling just makes it authentic its easy to connect. I also enjoy the use of flashbacks. The scene when he is a kid who has already given up is funny. He has like adult depressions as a child. This was a great movie to see since I love stand up comedy and I have never seen a woody Allen movie so this was a good experience."

","Ahh, the feeling one gets while watching this Woody Allen Classic. He completely breaks the rules of ""Hollywood Invisibility"", and at pretty much every time he gets (Allen is also a main actor in this film) the chance to, he steps out of the film world to interact with us. It's almost as if we were standing in the room, and whenever something that would garner a reaction out of us, Allen reaches out and addresses it, directly with us. He also breaks the rules of a typical flashback very early on in the film, and personally, I think it's one of the best scenes I've seen in a long time, let alone this film. The way Allen handles the chronology, the realism (lack thereof), and acting is what makes this film so great. Which brings me to the next part, the acting. While viewing this film, I didn't feel as though I was watching actors perform roles on a screen. I couldn't say, ""The way Diane Keaton played Annie was really great, I think if they cast actress X though it may have been a bit better"". And I don't feel anyone could logically, thoughtfully make that assumption. Because the film focused on what was real, what was raw. None of the actors ""fit"" into any particular role, they all had their quirks, obsessions that in film, can either be a core focus of the film or play towards the film's underlying meaning. In Annie Hall, not so much. They were just people. And their person-hood wasn't to some greater goal. I feel like Allen couldn't have directed this film any better even if he tried."

","I was apprehensive going into a Woody Allen movie, as I have heard mixed things and many have told me that he's just plain odd. However, after viewing Annie Hall I have a newfound appreciation for Allen as a director. He really utilizes the space of New York City to his advantage, and some of the scenes are just plain iconic. There were some really neat and jarring editing tricks throughout the movie that really broke the fourth wall and yanked the viewer from getting too immersed in the world of Alvy. Woody Allen's characters have an odd charm to them, and some are sure to find Alvy to be a bit too whiny and Annie may be seen as a reflection of that, but I felt that these characters played off of each other very well, and were very entertaining. Allen's films may be an acquired taste to some, but they are definitely worth the watch."

","Woody Allen's professional integrity has held fast for over a quarter century. Commercial concerns have never deterred the artist from pushing through on a particular idea or project. It is well known that over the many years of filmmaking, he created an insular production company and connected himself to people (producers) who would accept any film proposal on face value - sometimes merely on the bases of one telephone conversation. This is not just a good film but a great film. Every scene has at least three to four gags that seem to never grow stale. When Alvie Singer (Woody Allen) meets Annie for the first time, she's obviously quite nervous and fills the pregnant silences with ""La ti da, la ti da..."" He says, ""I'm dating a woman who says, ""La ti da"". This reminded me of Seinfeld's famous, ""Yada yada yada..."" In and around all this, the film tells the story of a mismatched relationship between neurotic, intellectual New Yorker Alvy and Wisconsin transplant Annie Hall (Diane Keaton, in an excellent performance). The details of the relationship are delineated with aching realism: the tentative getting-to-know-you stage, the petulant break-ups, the warm making-ups, the mundanities (like getting rid of spiders in bathtubs), the arguments, the hilarious private moments that can't be repeated with anyone else (like their attempt to cook some lobsters), the boredom, and finally the wearing-out of the whole thing. This is all superbly done.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."

","Woody Allen is one of my favorite comedians, so pretty much anything he does or is in I really enjoy. But I remember watching Annie Hall with my dad when I was younger and laughing pretty hard at some of it. The great thing about Annie Hall with Diane Keaton, who is also a really great actor, and her and Woody Allen play great off each other, is that this movie broke the invisibility gap in films that no other films have ever tried before. For example in the very beginning we see Woody Allen talking directly to the camera as if he is talking to us, the audience. Where he also says one of my favorite lines from Charlie Chapman, "" I wouldn't want to be part of any club that would have me as a member."" Which is kind of like Woody Allen's motto in life. Another example is that they used two different split screen shots in the film, Allen added subtitles in the movie at one point, and he even had a cartoon version of himself in the movie."

","Woody Allen's Annie Hall is arguably his best film. Annie Hall hit the big screen in 1977. Woody Allen directed the film and it was co-produced by Jack Rollins and Charles H. Joffe. The film stars Woody Allen and Diane Keaton as the principle characters Alvy Singer and Annie Hall respectively. The film Annie Hall is one of the most innovative movies of all time and is also in the conversation, as well as many other films, for the greatest film of all time. The film begins with Allen, alone in front of the camera, talking to the audience about the story they are about to watch unfold. The beginning in itself is revolutionary because audiences hadn't really connected with characters in a ""face to face"" setting before this film. The bulk of the movie is focused on Alvy Singer falling in love with a woman named Annie Hall. Their relationship is quite tentative and unbalanced throughout the film and it ultimately leads to the demise of the relationship. Alvy tries to fill the void in his life with women who don't really mean much to him. He is married twice before meeting Annie and neither of the women seem to please him. He makes excuses throughout his marriages but fails to realize his excuses are the result of him wanting something more. Then he meets Annie. Everything seems to make sense for Alvy when he meets Annie. The fall instantly in love and Annie seems to be everything he ever needed. The main issue between the two is that Alvy obsesses over death while Annie is all about the beauty of life. Problems begin to sneak in to the relationship, of course, when Annie wants to move in with him. Alvy blatantly hesitates at the idea and that bothers Annie because she truly loves him and doesn't understand why he hesitates. Alvy also dislikes both facts that Annie needs to smoke marijuana to have sex with him as well as her lack of higher education. Annie becomes attracted to one of her professors after Alvy persuades her to go to college. They argue and break up. Annie than realizes she misses him and they get back together. It doesn't work and they peacefully decide to leave each other. Annie moves to California to pursue a singing career and Alvy attempts to date another woman which doesn't work. Annie left a hole in his heart that he cannot fill. He flies to California to get back with Annie but she rejects him. He ends up in jail and the experience allows him to accept the friendship him and Annie decide on. They meet again in New York and Alvy sees her happy with another man. They meet for lunch, as friends, and reminisce on old times. The film ends with Alvy realizing that relationships are absurd but we need them to carry on. We have to accept them for what they are as well as what they are not. This film is a perfect combination of comedy, love, drama and resolution. The film is highly regarded for its shots and editing. Some of the shots are of Allen talking to the audience while the film is going on which, at the time, was a rather new occurrence. The editing was revolutionary as well because the producers added a scene of animation into the film which was unheard of in the 70's. The new additions to the film were risky but were ultimately the deciding factor in the film winning an Oscar for best film in 1977. This film was highly regarded by audiences and critics. Its innovations were well received and the storyline captured audiences across the nation. This is one of the best films I have ever seen and if given a chance to recommend it to someone else, I would in a heartbeat. I feel as though I not only enjoyed the film, but I actually learned from the film. Annie Hall is an inspiration and shows that without that one person we are looking for, we are not completely whole. Annie Hall is one for the ages."

","This film is a landmark in film and is a classic that goes deep into the nature of relationships. Alvy and Annie are a odd and mismatched couple that butt heads at times but ultimately cared about each other very deeply. While this is well and good we begin to see the characters change and see how the relationship they have have affected them emotionally. We see them losing ambition, settling, getting comfortable, and unwilling to change even if it's for the best. This is true for many relationships today so this makes the story very relatable and funny. The chopped up story telling play a huge role on how we perceive the characters. We see one scene while they are together or another scene when they are broken up and this helps to show how the relationship has affected certain aspects of their lives so it's interesting to see how much love can affect who we are. Every aspect of this film from the camera work to the sound,and even some brief wacky moments thrown in make this a classic. It applies to the time it was filmed (1977) to today. This is a funny and brilliant way of expressing modern relationships and the idea of love and how it affects us on deep emotional levels."

","I thought this film was incredible. I've never seen a film created the way this movie was created. I've always heard of Woody Allen as a director and an actor and that he was a bit quirky, so I'm really glad I got a chance to see his style and what he was all about. This film was literally all over the place and it just felt really raw and real and how life is. It didn't make life seem like every other movie makes it seem. It wasn't an ""and then and then and then"" kind of a film. Life is not like that either. Life is messy and we go ruminate on the past and ruminate on the future and the present is muddled in there as well, and I think this film did an amazing job of showing just how messy life really is. I also LOVED the scenes when Woody Allen broke the fourth wall and talked right to the audience, for some reason it made the whole film seem that much more real. It was a really great film and I would definitely like to see more films done by Woody Allen."

","Believe it or not, I had never watched a Woody Allen film before this. I'm not much of a film buff, as you can imagine. Now, I'll definitely find more of his work.<br/><br/>That major caveat aside, I absolutely loved this movie. <br/><br/>PLOT AND CHARACTERS<br/><br/>The characters were very, very nicely fleshed out- we explore their lives in the present, as well as their childhoods and families, and their motivations and thoughts are nicely exposed to us keeping in line with the psychoanalysis theme (one of the major themes of the movie). What that ends up meaning is that we see their relationship evolving naturally every step of the way. It never feels odd or out of place. We actually buy that these two end up together and, at the end, it makes total sense for them to separate. <br/><br/>Alvy is a neurotic, quick-witted, funny, obsessive-compulsive, incredibly pessimistic Jewish man approaching his 40s who dreams of becoming a famous comedian and writer/playwright, and Annie is a free-spirited, open-minded, more optimistic, small-town girl in New York City who has hopes of becoming a singer. The beautiful thing, is they're both complete oddballs. They don't fit in anywhere. And that's why we buy their relationship. When she makes a royal screw-up of herself at their very first meeting (""do you need a lift?""), for instance, we are forced to contrast her with Alvy's ex-wife, who hung out with the most pompous of intellectuals only and made HIM feel like the screw-up. Annie, we understand, is the opposite of that. She chooses, at every turn to experience life, to wear the ties and huff the blow. He also encourages this, just as much as she encourages him. She laughs at all his jokes and he finds her initial fumbling genuinely charming. <br/><br/>We also understand on both parts, why it doesn't work out. The dark cloud of pessimism that we practically see hang over him, his obsession with timeliness and detecting antisemitism, his paranoia about her teachers, the fact that he makes her feel unintelligent... All of these sour him for her. As for him, her need for socializing ends up being too much, as do her habit of smoking marijuana before sex, her emotional detachment and later liberation, and her openness to new experiences like rock concerts and right-wing magazines.<br/><br/>It seemed to me a sad ending, but one that makes sense. He tries to get back with her, and we know that he doesn't fit with anyone else he dates, but he's spent the whole movie sabotaging himself (believing it would never work out with someone who would want to date him in the first place), so his pessimism ends up being the downfall of the relationship in the end. Even if he fantasizes about it working out. The reason he keeps trying, though, even after it's over, is that of every person who keeps trying at their relationships: he needs the eggs.<br/><br/>GENERAL REVIEW<br/><br/>Both Woody Allen and Diane Keaton turn in wonderful performances here. Woody's comic timing and delivery is impeccable. He's so good at portraying the neurotic, obsessive facet of Alvy, I swear I had an ulcer by the time Alvy and Annie break up for good. Diane is his perfect match, of course. Amazing how she plays almost the complete opposite - relaxed, free-spirited, open to the big wide world - and yet has perfect chemistry with him. I like the way the film played with time and how there were abrupt cuts from scene to scene sometimes and lots of breaking of the fourth wall. It's a non-linear love story, and playing with time like this is crucial to the film, I think, because that's not only why we get to know the characters so well (we get to see their past and in-between romances, their childhoods and families), but why we understand that 1) they don't fit with anyone else and 2) they fit so well with each other. As a final note, I found the script to be fantastic. Full of great banter, humor, wit, and ideas (all well-delivered, of course). I adored that it doesn't stay away from, say, drugs and sex, but I also liked that the script doesn't try to exaggerate or find any shock humour with them. All the jokes are mostly understated even when they're raunchy (like the cunnilingus joke), and I like that. Sex and drugs to me are not taboo or shock subjects, and in this movie they genuinely don't feel like they are. Just a normal part of human life.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>This film offers a good-humored, fairly pessimistic view on relationships. It's a funny, well-acted, witty view into romance that is utterly unique and I recommend it to everyone and everyone."

","This movie is all about the life of Alvy Singer and how he reflects on his life. He had always believed that love was overrated but from some reason also desired it. After meeting singer Annie Hall, he realizes that love may not be as overrated as he thinks. Singer talks about the struggles he faced while dating Annie. He briefly talked about his childhood and how his life led up to where it was with Annie. He takes the audience on an emotional roller coaster when we watch the ups and downs that take place between him and Annie. I would recommend this movie for others to see, especially those who are lovers of romance movies."

","The 1977 romantic comedy, directed by Woody Allen, will make you laugh and cry at the same time. The film is shot in a way that you feel as though you're there as an onlooker watching Alvy (Woody Allen) and Annie's (Diane Keaton) relationship unfold. The film is from Alvy's (Allen) perspective and we hear and see his own commentary to the camera, breaking the ""fourth wall"" during the movie. The story starts with Alvy (Allen) telling us how he can't get over his last girlfriend, Annie Hall (Keaton). We then see their relationship play out, from the first time they meet, to their first break up, to them getting back together, to their last break up. Although the movie doesn't have that standard ""happy ending"" where both characters end up back together, I still felt happy knowing that they could stay friends and that not all was lost. The movie is very realistic of modern and past relationship culture. Which leads us to some themes in the plot; love vs lust, city vs country, New York vs LA, woman vs man, and the theme of second chances and mistakes. The film shows the difference between the sexes, but also between the geographic characteristics of a Jewish man from New York and a woman from the Midwest. We see how different living and standards are from the east coast to the west (NY to LA). The film shows us that relationships aren't perfect and neither are people, but that there is always something good in that other person. Allen gives us comic relief throughout the film, and ends with a montage of all the good memories Annie (Keaton) and Alvy (Allen) had shared together. I really enjoyed this film and would defiantly recommend it to anyone into romance or comedy or both. It's a feel good movie that you'll remember for a long time. Rating 9/10"

","The acme of Woody Allen's work, Annie Hall is a biopic of not only New York neurotic Alvy Singer, but also of Allen's own wit and intellectualism. Cleverly written, the jokes are heady enough to delight even the most serious thinkers while approachable enough to sate the general armchair cinephile. Allen's direction of Annie Hall jumps from relatively simplistic cinematography to brilliant uses of breaking the fourth wall, even, at times, jumping genres in style. While the production is as sporadic as the soupçon-psychotic protagonists, it never interrupts the flow of the narrative<br/><br/>Sweet, enrapturing, and frustrating at times, Annie Hall is a portrait of absolute romantic pessimism that somehow makes you feel content even when things don't necessarily ""go well"" in the end. From the iconic monologue at the beginning to the lonely street corner at the finale, Allen's character Singer knows that he doesn't have a prayer, but that's okay. It's not about the ending, per se, as it is about the journey of romantic Beulah and high-brow humor to get there. From the onset you realize the inescapable outcome of Singer's predicament, but that doesn't stop you from cheering him on in the meantime. Only Allen could craft a work that makes human emptiness feel so satisfying."

","The way woody Allen tells the story of his character's relationship with Annie Hall has something special about it, even if they broke up in the end. The way he broke the fourth wall, flashbacks to his past and also the two screen shots of different things happening is actually visually good. I understand that it won best picture against Star Wars IV A New Hope, but I think that the Academy do not want a risk and put a Sci-Fi film winning best picture, but I think is OK. I understand that Diane Keaton's character has even tackle the fashion culture, which also put itself in pop culture. It is actually a perfect film even though it is simple. Unlike most films which are big blockbusters, this film is simple but perfect. I think that the screenplay, cinematography, costumes and even the visual effects are good. So that is why this is 10/10."

","At the very beginning of the movie, I fell in love instantly with Woody Allen's character with his opening monologue. The idea of the film telling the story backward seems like a spoiler, but it actually keeps you more engaged. Diane Keaton's role as Annie Hall seems to be perfectly fit for her. This film truly depicts what a modern romance is like. Very awkward and uncomfortable. Annie Hall is a woman that every woman can identify with, and Alvy is a man that every man can identify with. Both of these characters are perfectly imperfect in every way. This movie gives hope to every average person that hopes to fall in love someday. Woody Allen is simply a genius."

","I was 16 and I hadn't seen a single Woody Allen film. I didn't even know how he looked, just had a vague recollection of his name. I got a pirated DVD of American films from the 70s and it had Annie Hall in it. It was the last film from the DVD that I saw. A lot of the philosophy in the film went over my head at that moment, but the humour left me in splits. There are times when you more than just like something, but you can't exactly give a reason why. I felt like that for the film. Of course I can give a thousand different reasons to like every Woody film now, but at 16, I couldn't. I just knew that I loved the film. And what I liked best in the film was the guy who played Alvy Singer, and when he broke the 4th wall to address us directly. I hadn't gone through the credits and didn't know that the guy was Woody himself. I had a slow dial up connection and made good use of it to find more information about the film. And that's when I learnt that Woody didn't just direct it, he wrote as well as acted in it. And Diane Keaton was his one time girlfriend. Hell, I wanted a girlfriend like Diane Keaton, its a completely different thing though, that in my teens, I ended up with someone like Mia Farrow, which pretty much messed things up a lot !! Anyway, after reading more about Woody and his many talents, I became fascinated with the man. Even more so because I could personally relate to him. He was short, shy, neurotic and had a lot to say. That pretty much summed me up as well. I so wanted to be like Woody Allen. The next plan of action was to watch as many Woody films as possible. I didn't have enough pocket money to buy over 35 original DVDs worth over 500 bucks each, and Downloading wasn't an option then. So I went around pirated DVD stores looking for films directed by Woody and within 2 months I managed to find around 20 !! Its been 9 years since then, and I've seen every single film written, directed or acted by Woody and I love every single one of them. Woody means different things to different people, but to me, he is the man who taught me to laugh at myself. And because I have a similar cynical world view to his, it was a terrific thing to learn. Also, I don't think anybody else understands Women better than Woody and watching and re-watching his films meant entering inside the mysterious minds of the fairer sex. Trust me, for all the guys who don't look like Brad Pitt or aren't sons of Warren Buffett, and want to get laid, watch Woody Films. His films also subtly introduced me to the intriguing and revealing world of Freud and Psychotherapy, and I've been hooked. Given a chance, I would exhume his brain and build a shrine around it !! Woody Allen and Annie Hall specially, mean the world to me."

","Annie Hall is the film notorious for beating out Star Wars for Best Picture. So, is this a case where the Academy picked the right film and those plebs just lack in good taste? Or is this one of those films where the bourgeois all pretend to think it is great, but it is not really? Well, that is too much build up for this film. Annie Hall is a fine film about two people that are just fine together, except that makes it too good to be true, so we will have to figure out something to go wrong. This is a humanist romantic comedy: intelligent, witty, insightful, etc. Well, it works just fine there. It is good cerebral entertainment, and is at times playfully surreal in an everyday way. While I do not think it is the best Woody Allen film (Stardust Memories stands out to me) or the best film ever, it is a good film. (Is that OK? Can we just be happy with that?)"
"Medysofyan","Null","0","0","22 August 2015"," Annie Hall, Woody Allen's Best Movie Ever
","I didn't expect much before watching Woody Allen's Annie Hall, given the fact that this movie was released 37 years ago. I was a fan of Allen's works that only out in the 2000's era, such as Vicky Christina Barcelona, Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine. However, many movie-critics state that Annie Hall, which made Allen took home Oscar for directing and writing, is Allen's best and one of the best films ever.<br/><br/>After watching this film I couldn't agree more with those reviews. And I knew that writing a review for this perfect movie would be a hard one. So I read those reviews again, and a very good one came from Roger Ebert. He wrote an interesting analysis about what Allen intended through the movie and put a conclusion: ""Annie Hall"" is a movie about a man who is always looking for the loopholes in perfection. Who can turn everything into a joke, and wishes he couldn't.<br/><br/>Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), a gag writer and stand-up comic is frustrated that his relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) has ended. For Alvy, Annie is an insecure, carefree gal but the only person who can keep up with his wit and negativity. Even though they always argue and fight, that makes them inseparable. Once they argue about sex life while standing in line for the movies. Then they fight because of Alvy's jealousy on Annie having affair with her college professor. Their fights often contain randomly hilarious jokes, a memorable one for me is this: Alvy Singer: It's mental masturbation! Annie Hall: And you would know all about THAT, wouldn't you? Alvy Singer: Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.<br/><br/>Go ahead, judge me for highlighting this of all the gags.<br/><br/>I love this movie because it is not an ordinary comedy about love that makes me giggle but it explores loves and all the emotions involved, the characters don't hide their true feelings and deal with others' weak point in an absurd and hilarious ways. They even ask random people on the streets about relationship things and talk to audience.<br/><br/>Allen and Keaton has the real chemistry in this film, I guess it's because they were playing themselves. The former real life couple portrayed unique ways of spending time together. In their first date, Alvy cheers up sad Annie by offering a kiss so they can digest their food better. Then they try to make meals boiling live lobsters. And yeah, the sweetest thing he ever say to her in the movie is ""Love is too weak a word for what I feel – I luuurve you, you know, I loave you, I luff you, two F's, yes I have to invent, of course I – I do, don't you think I do?"" A line from this movie that sticks in my head me the most is when Allen says a joke about his relationship with woman: ""I don't want to belong to any club that will have me as a member."" It makes my mind blown. If you don't want to be a member of any club, then why bother entering? I mean if there is any club that you enjoy, how come you don't want to join? I mean as a member, you will get some advantages, like discount or membership card or social status. I think it's really important for us to have a sense of belonging for something we love. But wait, some people are just different and irrational, including me. I think my ability that always frustrates me is unconsciously distance myself from everyone I love because I'm unconsciously ""looking for the loopholes in perfection."" I tried to push myself to believe love is not about finding the perfect one unless I want to end up being alone. I'm getting there, I guess.<br/><br/>So, that's all I can say about this movie, and I know I could never top Ebert's review with a great conclusion, but at least I tried to show my love and appreciation to this rare gem made by Allen. How about you? Do you also think that the movie is Allen's best? Feel free to comment and discuss, especially if you are Allen's fans!"

","Annie Hall is one of those rare romantic comedies that manages to hit the exact note with its tone throughout and it starts with Allen and Brickman's Oscar winning screenplay. It brims with topical 70s references and the biting wit of the former stand up comedian's material, which makes for many laughs, but even more importantly it's a stunningly authentic and wistful insight into the failed relationship of Alvy Singer and Annie Hall. The film makes no mistake telling you this from the start; Alvy begins with that opening monologue and you are left trying to figure out exactly the reason for this unhappy ending. It's non-linearity at its best and edited with brutal honesty; Alvy wants Annie to experience the wonders of adult education, which cuts to a while later, a jealous Alvy now bitterly against the idea when another man turns up. <br/><br/>Perhaps Allen wanted the main focus of the film to be from Allen's perspective, lamenting the spotlight of the couple's relationship. There's signs of that too. Alvy at heart is just a boy who discovered nihilism a little early, and somehow he never grows out of that mindset , giving into his sexual curiosity and kissing his classmate. Allen portrays the extents of this short neurotic comedian with such honesty - sometimes petty, from his youth pessimistic, always cynical. He's cultured to a degree - there's that famous scene where he drags a theatre-goer criticising Fellini and McLuhan and produces the latter from behind a sign, with an exasperated air of authority. Yet he also zones out at the complex musings on Bob Dylan from a Rolling Stone reporter (Shelley Duvall), and feels dismissive of the high aiming Allison. There's disdain for California show biz that he often voices (""That's because they don't throw their garbage away, they turn it into television shows""). That's displayed by Willis in the contrast between the golden dazzle of the party and the muted greys of New York, ever gloomy like Alvy. <br/><br/>It begs the question exactly what Alvy sees in the free spirited and scatterbrained Annie Hall, played to perfection by Diane Keaton (and impeccably dressed too). There's wonderful little mannerisms that add to the persona, no better than the initial meeting where she stumbles over her words, shakes her head playfully when prompted of her weekend availability, and later struggles to hold in her laughter retelling a family story, which is ordinary made wonderful by Keaton. Their chemistry is apparent from the start and is most evident in the first post-breakup scene where Alvy is called over in the midst of another one night stand to kill a spider. That shockingly real moment where Annie breaks down and confesses that she misses him is perfect. And Alvy reacts how at first? By cracking a joke of course, after his furiously awkawrd slaying of the spider.<br/><br/>The non-linearity and the constant shifting of the tone and the dynamics of the relationship are aided by the impressive number of Allen's visual techniques. There's the yellow subtitles exposing both of the pair's nervous inhibitions that encapsulates their opposing perspectives and manages to be both sincere and humorous. Later the voice-over on the plane does the same, in a more wistful way near breakup. There's the attempts from Alvy to confront and complain about his relationship to random passer-bys, at times more honest than he is with his doctor. It's genuine; the audience can empathise with his plight. And there's the long roving takes that are pervasive throughout the relationship; sustaining real time emotions and tensions and allowing the pair to shine. By the end of the film, we know exactly why the pair broke up in the first place.<br/><br/>What else are we supposed to wish for than that Hollywood ending that Alvy acknowledges as his first play, and thus, his first real desire for an unattainable woman? He painstakingly tries to recreate the lobster fiasco, and in doing so cracks a joke and creates even more awkwardness. But that's Alvy. His own brand of humour is his self defence, and in this miserable world, even finding a brief window of perfection with Annie, cannot change. Even more, he's self-loathing, jealous, and insecure, like a lot of us. Annie Hall might have become a complicated murder mystery, or in the hands of another director or writer, end on that glistening kiss under the bridge. Thank god it didn't."

","Woody Allen shows what a masterful artist of directing, script writing, and acting he is in this romantic comedy drama. The script is honestly so funny, clever, and witty I could read it as a book over and over again. This movie is not for the dim witted as they wouldn't understand many of the jokes. You have to stay on your toes to keep up with this film, but you won't have any trouble paying attention with one joke rolling in after another. The cinematography and use of shadow in this film add to the artful and quirky feeling of the film, while also adding deep meaning to it through shadows. The plot portrays two unique and different people who are struggling to find their way in life and both completely over analyze they lives which makes for a funny comedy and drama about life, love, and being Jewish in NYC."

Unlike most comedies, this film does not go for cheap laughs. Every line is very well thought out. There are many references to literature and film that make the film all the more rich with different levels of comedy.

The movie was very different from most movies that I've seen by including scenes that had dialogue at the bottom of the screen and times when Allen would turn and talk to the audience. As I said before I haven't seen any other Woody Allen films, but this film has made me interested in possibly seeing other ones of his to see what kind of filming techniques were used and just to see a film that is out of the ordinary."

As part of class we watched Annie Hall, which I hadn't seen before. Even though quirky movies typically aren't my thing, I enjoyed it, and seeing young Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum (very brief cameo) was kinda cool. The dialog was very funny at times, in a chuckle not bell laugh kind of way. The movie makes you wonder how two people can ever really stay together. After all we all have our issues and Alvy and Annie certainly have theirs! In the end, as in many relationships, hopefully you can appreciate and love the person, even if you are no longer in love with them."

","I never would have expected to like Woody Allen. There is just something about his nasally voice that sets the expectation of boredom. When watching Annie Hall for the first time I wasn't really sure what to expect. I knew this was a film about a man and a woman and I knew it was set in New York City, though beyond that I assumed I was either about to watch an hour and a half of neurosis or an existential art film. It turns out I was right. What I was wrong about is how much I enjoyed it. There are so many unconventional storytelling methods used here. Despite many of them now considered being trite, breaking the fourth wall, they all feel original in this 1977 classic.<br/><br/>The general plot of Annie Hall wasn't particularly interesting, but the characters created and the conversations are strong enough to make the story feel fresh and clever. There are plenty of gags here that turn this romantic comedy into a film that will make you forget you're watching a romantic comedy. In a traditional sense of course since modern romantic comedies have soured the term.<br/><br/>Annie Hall has opened the door to Woody Allen for me. I'm not sure if I'll like anything I find inside, but what I do know is that I'm interested to see what else I can find from a director that I've ignored for far too long."

","Almost immediately, you can tell that there is something different about this film. Woody Allen talks directly to the camera multiple times which is pretty uncommon in films. He seems to almost narrate, however he is shown talking instead of an omniscient voice talking over different scenes. This direct connection to the viewer is a significant point in this film. I enjoyed the variety of settings in this film. While most of the story took place in New York City, Annie and Alvie were also seen at the beach and in California. There is also a beautiful shot of the Brooklyn Bridge shown as Annie and Alvie walk through the city. I enjoyed this film due to the acting style of Woody Allen. Before this film, I had never seen a work done by Woody Allen. His awkward humor really makes this movie great.

I thought that both Annie and Alvy's awkwardness was hilarious and in all honesty I thought they made a perfect couple. The film opens with a mildly devastating thought about life, however it fits with the tone film wonderfully. Allen really captures the essence of life and love with every line that's written. The film stands on its own two feet so well because it's a mature and realistic. He uses animation, subtitles (which tells us what they are thinking, instead of saying (a very funny scene), cross overs, flash backs and he even talks to us. Asking us our opinion and making us feel like we are really there. This formula for a romantic comedy is one that works, and can actually relate to the audience, instead of being fake and giving the audience silly ideas of what a relationship is like. Overall it was an enjoyable film with laugh out loud comedy."

","An amazingly heart felt tale for what it is, in the technical aspects the film is perfectly fine, excelling in set design and the creation of an immersive atmosphere.

After many fallouts the plot comes to a wonderful conclusion, it wraps rather nicely, I'd go into more detail but spoilers are a no- no, so I'll stick to describing it. It's another true to life scenario with how things go, focusing on the complexity of relationships and how much then can go to affect how somebody does things, and how much one can change a person. A good watch for those who enjoy romances, and also to those who can appreciate the deeper plot elements seeded into it."

","Annie Hall directed by Woody Allen wasn't really an interesting movie to me. It was a very funny and very creative movie though. There was comedy throughout the whole movie that was really funny. He has a lot of dry humor that will make everyone laugh. He was very creative throughout the movie using many different techniques. In the beginning, he starts with him in front of the camera telling jokes to the audience. He talks about his life and all of it has nothing to do with the movie. Also in the beginning, he is in the classroom and he kisses the girl. His younger self goes up to the room while his older self sits in the desk and tries to defend him self. It was brilliant. At some points, he would stop the film and talk to the audience about what is happening. He also uses subtitles when he is talking to Annie on the balcony. She starts it off by being funny with him being Jewish. They are both talking to each other with subtitles underneath with words that they really wanted to say. It was brilliant and funny at the same time."

Another example of how it was unique was Woody would stop in the middle of the scene and talk to the audience. I thought that was very special to the movie and it made it work really well.

","Annie Hall is a such a different type of movie. The entire layout of the movie is so unforgettable. Woody Allen, a household name for movie directors appears as the main character as well. The way he interrupts and breaks the fourth wall is comedic, as well as it doesn't completely take away form the movie. He continuously breaks the fourth walls in ways I've never seen. If he has a flashback, the present him is interacting in the flashback, he points out otherwise unnoticed things, and he still narrates it. the story line is also a different kind too. the dialogue in this film is so casual and common sounding that it's like we're really there feeling what he is feeling."

","I don't necessarily remember ever watching a Woody Allen film. I've heard him here and there from my parents but I don't think I knew who he was. For the first film I've watched him in, it was actually quite well done.<br/><br/>The dialogue was especially the most enjoyable. I'm a fan of witty dialogue and a lot of movies can't pull it off as well as Woody Allen did. His character is hilariously awkward and almost ironic since someone like him could be anything but a catch. The women he's seen with are all 9's and 10's, yet they end up with a balding skinny guy with glasses. The whole thing seems kind of funny to me. Yet even with that funny dynamic I found it actually quite realistic since it stuck closer to real life and how life changes at the drop of a hat, rather than following a storyline. I think the haphazardness of it all was what made it a good movie.<br/><br/>The photography was very pretty as well, but I didn't find it as interesting in my opinion. It focused more on the characters and less on how it actually looked and portrayed certain environments. The camera angles were there and sometimes showing them in certain areas that are purposefully blocked out by the camera (like when Annie and him were talking in the bedroom together, etc.), but most of the time was spent on fleshing out and retelling a flashback of Woody's character.<br/><br/>8/10 for an overall good performance."

","After watching this film it is easy to see why it won Best Picture; the love story between Alvy (Woody Allen) and Annie (Diane Keaton) provided the audience with hilarious dialogue and very funny scenes. The creative elements of the film brought it over the top. As Woody Allen's character, Alvy has been stuck in therapy since he was a kid, it's not surprising that he feels the constant need to analyze his relationship with Annie, it's eventual demise and his part in their breakup. Allen breaking the 4th wall to talk directly to the audience was brilliant and made you feel like you were part of the action. The split screens, subtitles and the Wicked Queen cartoon added additional layers to the story. The scenery of Manhattan was pretty awesome too. If you want to see a clever, well written and funny movie you cannot do better than Annie Hall."

","I thought this movie was incredible, the editing and humor was great. I loved how Woody Allen would talk to the audience like we were in the movie. The editing was very unique in Allen's sense. I loved how he was looking back at his life with his family and him and the characters were in the screen too, talking about it but the family couldn't hear them. The flashbacks were unreal and i love how Allen did the split screen effects in some of the shots.I loved the opening scene how Woody Allen was talking about himself and he was sitting in his elementary school class with all of the kids that he used to know and speaking about what they are doing now in life. This movie really kept you interested, from the plot, the humor and definitely the editing, it was a great movie all around."

","It's beyond discussion that this is Woody Allen's masterpiece. It's so identical to aaaall of his movies, yet it takes all the distinctive marks to a higher level. The classical Woody Allen playing as himself, the lovely Diane Keaton being a mess, New York, intellectual parties with pretentious conversations, hilarious dialogues that mix Jew jokes with literary references; not to mention the beautiful cinematography, the sudden scene changes and the kind of intemporality in which the movie takes us into. There's no cohesive plot line, it's a bunch of scenes put together without before or after, exactly the way memory works. Exactly the way one thinks of a relationship during a break up: just individual pieces that somehow tie together, beautiful, lovely, unreal memories. So unreal that in Singer's memory it makes perfect sense that he starts talking about Annie to passers-by, or that he breaks the fourth wall and starts talking to us the public, or that Annie's family can have a conversation with Singer's family at different moments and places. <br/><br/>Annie Hall is the ultimate break up movie. Forget 500 Days of summer, The Notebook, or anything that came after 1977. They stand as ridiculously fake, Hollywoodesque, cheesy. This movie does not have any pretensions of rightfully portraying reality, but in its crazy and surreal way it is far more loyal to the mood of somebody who is going through a break-up."

His interpretation in this movie as the comedian Alvy Singer was also great but I have to admit that the interpretation that I like most was Diane Keaton's who played as Annie Hall. One more thing that I liked in this movie was that it shows us the difference between people personalities and how this can change when they are in a relationship. It shows us also which has to be the priorities of a person and that is depending on who that person is and what he or she wants for hi or her life.<br/><br/>Finally I believe that ""Annie Hall"" is one of the best Woody Allen's movies because is not shows us only the above things that I mentioned but also the most important, ambition for life and evolution as a person.

I'm a sucker for 70's movies, and I might like just about everyone I'll see, except maybe romance. Some people say this was a typical love story, and it was, I won't lie about that. But there's something about it that made it work. Was it because Allen's character was weird? Not so much, I think it was the love interest that really got to me, more so in the end with the montage of their relationship and the song. For some reason, that had me a little bit emotional? There was just something about those scenes that had me really feel for the couple. It'd be a typical romance movie, if not for the flashbacks and what not. It's what really made the film for me. Needless to say, the montage at the end was my favorite part, and it's a good watch. I'm not a fan of romance movies, but I'm a small fan of this film, for sure."

","Diane Keaton's character was by far my favorite out of all of the characters in the film. I liked this film, it was interesting on some level. I think it has a lot to do with how the story unfolds, Woody Allen is telling a story and we're watching it come about while he is apart of it. The wall between the inner world of the film and the audience's world is constantly being broken down. I think this is what makes the film though Woody's jokes are funny, it begins to become a little annoying. Keaton is what made the film, she played her role so way and it made the film easy to watch and enjoy. The plot had a nice flow, though at times I felt that it dragged on a little. The camera work was standard, with the exception of the disoriented car rides with Annie, she really knew how to move ha. In all, the film was good and I would recommend it."

","I love the various editing strategies used in this film. I like the constant flashbacks that are used to tell the back story but the interesting aspect of this is that the two main characters, Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, are always in present time having a conversation about the good old times in the flashback. These flashbacks told the story of how they got to be the people they were currently, and how they got to be in the relationship they currently were in. I though this was a cool and interesting way to tell the back story. I also like that Woody Allen is the main character, but also is doubling as the narrator. The camera will focus on him, and the background will go fuzzy and mute everyone else out, while he talks to the camera and engages the audience (you) into the story. The editing strategies, I think, made the movie."

The movie was about a man (Alvy Singer, played by Woody Allen) searching for love while not believing in love.

The soundtrack was perfect, but I was expecting that, I mean it's a Woody Allen, what else could I expect?

"launsbachc","Null","0","0","9 May 2014"," Romanic comedy standard
","Old Hollywood was brimming with movies that had a romantic comedy subject matter. Starting with Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin's early silents, into the late 1930's with The Women, and on from there romantic comedies were a hit with audiences and usually provided a clever way for director to bypass Hayes Code restrictions. However, with the end of classic Hollywood and the new film era brought about the opportunity to set a new standard for the romance and comedic film combo. Director Woody Allen rose to the challenge. The significance of this movie is how much it differs from the old style and subject matter of romantic comedies and how several aspects of the films structure, plot, characterization, and mise-en-scene are still used today. In classic Hollywood comedies we see a ditsy young women either infatuated by a man or has one infatuated with her. They proceed to tease and lure men in via sexual innuendos, silly childish flirting, and of course pulling the damsel in distress card. The man is usually a weak self-conscious underdog, a well-intentioned good hearted down on his luck type, or the masculine every girls dream man. Overall they are always generic and seemingly artificial characters that lack true human qualities. What we have in Annie Hall is a drastic change-up from the this usual setup. The movie is narrated by the main character Alvy (Woody Allen) who plays an awkward, cynical, arrogant little man who works as a comedian. despite not appearing to as dreamy wonder boy type Alvy has quite the ego. Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), although somewhat ""ditsy"", plays a women who attempts to hold her own and maintain a sense of confidence. Throughout the film there is drug use, premarital sex, inappropriate interactions, and essentially everything else that would have made code era regulators and old Hollywood audience gasp with horror, disgrace, and overall shock. However, the commentary, uncomfortable and awkward sex scenes, and character attitudes are undeniably similar to what we would see in any romantic comedy released in the past few decades. The significance that is more clearly evident is the drastic desensitization of film subject matter and how characterization and interaction was the key to making it apparent in romantic comedies. Furthermore Annie Hall seemingly provides guidelines to what a successful romantic comedy should entail."

","I've liked Woody Allen and his movies since the moment I knew who he was and what they were like. I find it hard not to like him, in pretty much every aspect. I'll admit, I understand his neurotic side to a degree, which I think can definitely help add to my fondness for him, and either way, he's great at what he does. It took me a long time to finally get to see Annie Hall, but, when I did, I was glad that I got to. I have also always liked the chemistry between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, and I found their characters in this movie to be relatively more normal than in, say, a movie like ""Sleeper"". And of course, Woody Allen's wit is just smart and sharp in general, and in my opinion, it is irresistible. Ultimately, this is one of my favorite comedies, especially from the era, and I think that it will continue to be loved by many generations to come. I hope so, at least."

The best way to describe this film is to go see it, because it is funny on so may levels. Diane Keaton almost made me fall in love with her because of this film, which is due solely to how she acts in this film. I took a piece of life advice from this film as well, pertaining to love.

","""Annie Hall"" (1977) is one of those films you just can't go through life without seeing. It's very important for its aspect of the romantic comedy genre, but also for its cinematic importance. <br/><br/>Cinematically, ""Annie Hall"" marks a turning point in Woody Allen's career and his influence on the development of film, which includes the use of cinematic techniques such as a split screen to show differences in scene and characters rather than people talking on the phone, a non- linear narrative, and breaking the fourth wall by speaking directly to the camera. The continual allusions to psychoanalytic study are emphasized with these plainly neurotic techniques. Woody Allen set a trend with the last of those, for which he became famous, and ""Annie Hall"" is an epitome of who he is and what he means to the history of cinema. <br/><br/>In this film, Woody Allen plays an insecure, pessimistic, paranoid comedian and Diane Keaton plays the titular self-conscious singer Annie Hall. Their unconventional romance is shown in flashbacks, such as when they meet during the well-known and borderline painfully awkward meet- cute where Diane Keaton's character says the famous line ""la-dee-da, la- dee-da"". ""Annie Hall"" plays jump-rope with the line between charming and uncomfortable. This is a romantic comedy where instead of two love interests being brought together, they grow apart and don't end up together. It's awkward, neurotic, and funny, and although its ending may not be a common staple of romantic comedies, it is a frank observation of realistic romance."

","Woody Allen's dry comedic genius, existential observations and relationship witticisms make for one of the classics of 70s cinema. Annie Hall is much emulated, much copied and quoted and Diane Keaton in the titular role is her charming, quirky and bashful self. The chemistry between them is natural and seemingly genuine and it makes for a great film.<br/><br/>Allen, playing Alvy Singer, a neurotic, hypochondriac, somewhat egocentric, stand-up comedian/writer, falls for Annie Hall (Keaton) when introduced at a tennis game, and their diverse characters make for ups and down of their relationship. The humour is intelligent and typical of Allen's self-effacing style, and often he engages the audience in straight to camera conversation. He narrates, as the style of the film is autobiographical, and some of the narration is told through flashbacks where up to date characters observe what went on in the past. It's a clever mix of styles, and the direction and script are sharp and tight. It's not aged particularly well but the wit of the dialogue, Allen's timeless narrative and comedic wisdom hasn't aged at all. His observations about relationships and people's behaviour is as true now as it was then. A true classic of cinema and I can't believe it's taken me this long to see it. Not disappointing. Look out for some very familiar faces... Christopher Walken, Colleen Dewhurst and Carol Kane."

Lately, there have been way too many ""rom-coms"" that are telling the same sort of love story with different actors and actresses, and ""Annie Hall"" was a nice break from the. Woody Allen, crafts a love story that creatively plays with time and stream of consciousness. The viewers hear about the relationship between Alvy Singer (played by Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton), through Allen's mind, and direct communication with the audience. I feel as if this directness that Allen uses grounds viewers and reminds them that love is bittersweet, but doesn't have to be irrational.

It was a real story; filled with symbolism and dream sequences and allegories. It was sad because it showcased more so the falling out of love instead of the falling in love part of relationships.

","Scrolling down the main page for this film, I noticed under ""taglines"" the movie is described as ""A nervous romance."" I think that is just the PERFECT way to sum up this film. Because I was definitely going to bring how nervously the two main characters, Alvy and Annie, acted the whole time. They just spoke awkwardly to each other. This was an oddly funny film, directed in weird ways. I really liked how Alvy would talk to the audience or to strangers on the street. The people on the street would give him answers like they knew his situation, but they were only strangers who would actually have no clue. The humor was sarcastic and observational. It made fun of real life; for example a stranger talking loudly behind you about something they think they know about, but don't. Or even what really goes through peoples minds when they are having a conversation. This movie poked fun at reality using unrealistic methods. It was really interesting."

I also have a strong feeling that Woody Allen isn't playing a character in his films, he's playing different versions of himself. Not that it's a bad thing, but at times you could almost sense that he's just being himself and not really playing a character. <br/><br/>Woody Allen is really great in a creative sense. I loved how he communicated with the audience, made one part of the film animated, and did multiple editing tricks where older versions of characters would literally be looking in on events in the past. I thought it was really great how he made the two interact, for example, the little girl in the beginning and his present self were having a conversation. His editing techniques were incredible and made the film really interesting to watch. <br/><br/>His cinematography is simple, but is done very well. Many parts of this film were simple, but it worked perfectly. One thing that was not simple, however, was the dialogue. I actually found myself getting annoyed at times because of Allen's run-on sentences/rants. Though they were usually quite witty, there were just too many and they ended up making his character seem annoying and pretentious (which he kind of was anyway). Keaton's character however, I loved. I thought they were both relatable characters, but in very opposite ways. <br/><br/>All in all, I loved this film. I thought it was a great story. Keaton and Allen have great chemistry on screen and it's easy to tell they enjoyed working together. I would highly recommend this film.

","""Annie Hall"" is like a how-to book on the dos and don'ts of relationships. Well, not all relationships so much as Woody Allen's relationship with Diane Keaton, both of whom star in the film. This film is the most well known of Allen's ""Woody Allen plays himself"" films. The fact that the film was such a hit with American audiences in 1977 - and remains just as beloved today - is a testament to the film's legacy. That ""Star Wars"" performed so poorly is perhaps a bolder statement, though it is hardly the ""better"" film.<br/><br/>The editing and cinematography by Gordon Willis define ""Annie Hall"". Many shots in the film consist of long takes wherein the camera sweeps through the room, following Allen and Keaton as they have long conversations about every topic imaginable. Allen consistently breaks the fourth wall by either addressing the camera directly or by literally walking in to scenes from his past. The split-screen photography during some of these scenes is remarkable.<br/><br/>Both Allen and Keaton's personalities are so ingrained in their characters that it's a wonder why Allen didn't simply keep their first names the same while writing the script. I suppose it is all just a part of his sense of humor. This sense of humor pervades the film. Much of the jokes are more gags than jokes, centered on Allen's lofty soliloquies about the nature of death and the beauty of New York, as well as his frustration with people less intelligent than him, which seems to be everyone. For someone who enjoys this type of humor, ""Annie Hall"" will no doubt entertain. The fact is, though, this story (the story of love and loss) has been done before, many times, and with more subtlety and grace. Still, it is worth a watch."

","The comedian Alvy 'Max' Singer (Woody Allen), opening his monologue, is trying to understand why his relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) ended a year ago. Growing up in New York, he had vexed his mother on the emptiness of existence while also being preoccupied by his own sexual curiosity.<br/><br/>It would later show Alvy as a grown up, now with Annie but getting into an argument as they went to queue up in a movie theatre watching ""The Sorrow and the Pity"". There would be someone in the queue just behind them who would especially annoy Alvy on interpreting loudly on the works of Marshall McLuhan. It would be not long the real man himself steps in to correct what the man in the queue behind Alvy had been talking loudly about.<br/><br/>Later that night, Annie had no interest in having sex with Alvy. Instead, the two would discuss about Alvy's past two relationships. The first was Alvy's first wife Allison Portchnik (Carol Kane), the second was an intellectual. It is different when it comes to his relationship with Annie, along with Alvy mocking the men Annie had once being involved with before it would show how Alvy and Annie first came to know each other. Things started to get tense when both were beginning to like each other, in terms of their view of the world and their respective family backgrounds which Alvy found out when he met Annie's family.<br/><br/>While Alvy did try to see other people after breaking off with Annie for a period of time, he still finds himself coming back to her, but after Annie was calling him for help on the phone. But separate meetings with their respective therapists showed that there is still a divide between them.<br/><br/>If one is able to follow the story well, one is able to understand the story Woody Allen's character Alvy is trying to tell about especially his relationship with Diane Keaton's character Annie, and the two's views on love and relationships in the film itself. The interchangeable scenes as Alvy is trying to explain his own life and past relationships, inserting with the present-day version of himself when revisiting something from his past, may seem confusing at times to some in terms of trying to catch what he is trying to put across.<br/><br/>But the quirkiness of Allen's character speaking directly to the camera at times, seemingly trying to emphasis or tell the viewing audience something is definitely something refreshing. And the randomness of Keaton's character randomly breaking off into 'La-dee-da, la-dee-da' when she has nothing else to say brings out the spontaneity."

","Before viewing this movie, I saw that this film is a much-liked American classic and a Best Picture winner at the Oscars. I never seemed too interested in Woody Allen movies but after watching Annie Hall, I think I might just be interested. This film is a really good film with very witty dialogue and great lead acting.<br/><br/>This film is about a stand-up comedian who falls out of a relationship with the girl he loves. Now he must piece together the facts on why their relationship ended.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's character started annoying at first in my eyes but in the end, I grew on him. Diane Keation was very good in her role. Her performance was almost perfect. The two leads had very good chemistry between them.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a borderline great movie that goes in-depth on relationship issues. There were times when I thought this film was a bit slow, but I could see the masterful techniques used in the making of this movie. I loved the fact that this film has very memorable lines and funny moments. I rate this film 8/10."

","I love Woody Allen. He's one of my all time favorite filmmakers, and one of my main influences. What I love about Woody Allen's films is that they're so simple that they're ingenious. Annie Hall is the prime example of that. The film is simply about the relationship between Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, and that's pretty much it. But here's where Annie Hall differs from other romances; it goes into great detail about relationships in general. This movie gets how relationships work down perfectly, and captures every little detail. Any one who's been in a relationship can relate to what happens in this movie. It's definitely not 100% realistic. This movie bridges together Allen's early, over the top, cartoony films, and his later, more dramatic, realistic films. Which is why a lot of people say this will always be his best movie. The film has a realistic tone and setting, but there are a few moments that contrast perfectly with the realness of it. Woody Allen talks to the camera, he becomes a cartoon character, the characters enter flashbacks, and at one point, there are subtitles that show what the characters are thinking while they're talking to each other. It's moments like that that make this movie so fun to watch, and Woody Allen's classic social commentary dialogue really brings up some good points about love and relationships. I also love how this movie's paced. It's only an hour and a half long, but it gets so much done in so little time. A whole relationship condensed into a little over 90 minutes, and it's still one of the greatest on screen romances of all time."

","Woody Allen is funny when he is just being himself, so give him time to write, direct and star in a movie he is absolutely hilarious. this is basically the story of this dorky guy played by Woody Allen and his relationship with a girl named Annie Hall. the story really isn't anything special, but Allen really makes the movie great with his subtle and completely ridiculous dialog. he also has a couple moments in the movie where he just looks right at the camera and addresses the viewer directly, which is kind of surprising to see in movies sometimes, but i think he did this very well and didn't make it too weird. the one bad thing i could say about the movie is that i felt that he sort of used all his funnier material in the beginning and ran out a little towards the end of the film. but all in all it's a very funny romantic comedy, and ill definitely be watching some more Woody Allen movies very soon."
"jamescgallagher","10","0","0","14 November 2012"," One of the greatest romantic comedies of all time.
","It seems somewhat insulting to describe 'Annie Hall' as a romantic comedy, simply because of what that genre implies. However, that's exactly what it is – one of the most intelligent, heart-warming and realistically raw romantic comedies of all time. It's consistently hilarious, it dissects the complexities and peculiarities of love apart so perfectly and the two lead characters are just magnificent. To call 'Annie Hall' timeless would be a complete understatement. It more than stands its ground against any of the cliché-ridden, populist garbage that passes for romance in Hollywood these days, simply by being so human.<br/><br/>What makes 'Annie Hall' so great is that it doesn't insult the intelligence of its audience or try to pretend that everything in the World is all chocolates and roses. The lead character, Alvy Singer (Woody Allen, in without a doubt his best role) is a condescending, neurotic, paranoid, spiteful, jealous little man who is wholly unable to make any sacrifices in his life or face up to change and progress. He's also sweet, charming, quaint, hilarious and thoroughly likable because in Alvy Singer is a little bit of everybody who's ever fallen in love and found themselves unable to move on. Annie (Diane Keaton) is the original 'girl next door'. She's committed, she's kind, she's generous, a bit kooky and – despite everything Alvy does to stop her from breaking free and becoming her own woman – she cares about him deeply. Their relationship is absolutely mesmerising and the chemistry between Allen and Keaton is simply perfect. It's impossible not to become invested in these characters because they are so well-written, so well- performed and so believable that the film's surrealism seems distinctly normal. On a number of occasions, the characters break the fourth wall and address the audience directly. After a while, you almost stop noticing that it's even happening because you're so involved in these characters' lives. The many creative techniques Allen utilises – from animation, to split-screen, mental subtitles and a cameo by Marshall McLuhan that left me in tears of laughter – keep the film current and fresh and were, for their time, highly innovative. The supporting characters, too, are brilliant little pastiches of real-life people that help the film flow so naturally. Seriously, I cannot heap enough praise on this film, it's just utterly wonderful.<br/><br/>However, even without all of that, Annie Hall would still be a pretty decent film because it's just so funny. It's one of Allen's best ever scripts and some of the interactions between the characters are hilarious. Unlike the countless attempts to rip it off, the humour in Annie Hall is subtle and intelligent. There's no pleasuring oneself with a pie or defecating in a sink here. It's just pure class and pure wit from start to finish. Similarly, the film isn't afraid to shock. Allen's analysis of the culture of both anti-Semitism and his beloved New York City is razor-sharp and some of the one-liners are hysterical (watch out for the joke about Alvy's grandma and the Cossacks, as an example). But ultimately, what makes 'Annie Hall' so great is that it is consistently bittersweet. We love Alvy, we love Annie and we love them both together. They're made for each other. Except, when push comes to shove, everybody knows, deep down in their hearts, that their relationship can never work. Allen's never been one for saccharine resolutions and 'Annie Hall' is no exception. It's the type of film you can watch again and again and again and never get bored because there's a little bit of Alvy and a little bit of Annie in every single one of us and the humour is so subtle that you're guaranteed to spot something new - a facial expression, a quirky little bit of cinematography or a killer one-liner - every single time.<br/><br/>If you think a film such as 'American Pie' or 'Superbad' is the best comedy ever made then perhaps Annie Hall won't be for you (though funnily enough, I think both of those films are reasonably enjoyable, so I don't want to generalise too much here) but if you're looking for a film that can explore love, loss, friendship, family and that sense of emptiness we all feel now and then, whilst also making you wet yourself laughing, then you can't go far wrong with this film."

","Woody Allen's brilliance is on full display here, in a picture widely considered his pinnacle work. It's easy to see why. <br/><br/>THIS is what I call a romantic comedy. One of the most consistently funny flicks I've ever seen, featuring characteristically sharp writing and a cast which delivers stellar performances from even the smallest roles. I enjoyed the very 40s-esque static shots and 4th-wall-breaking dialog close ups, which is significant considering I usually prefer more dynamic camera movement in my motion pictures.<br/><br/>Final Word: Annie Hall is worth your time if you've ever been in love, or ever wanted to be."
"mcfinley_10","Null","0","0","1 October 2012"," Annie Hall
","Annie Hall is a classic 1970's film that has many different elements regarding relationships, interpersonal issues, and city life. This movie is classified as a true American romantic comedy, but I also think it can also be classified as a drama. I classified it as a drama because the intense problems that Alvy and other characters bring to the film. <br/><br/>New York is not known from being the most uplifting cities in the world. It is known to be negative and gloomy, yet full of strange quirks. Alvy Singer represents the city of New York; he is negative, gloomy and has plenty of strange quirks. An example of his negative behavior is best represented in his pessimistic view on life, ""Life is divided up into the horrible and the miserable"". He goes into further detail explaining how the horrible people are those who have some kind of terminal illness and the miserable is everyone else. Another example of Alvy's negativity is his inability to grow as a person. He has been going to the same analysis for 15 years now, just to complain about how awful life is. The point of attending the analysis is to better yourself and develop a more positive outlook on life. Whereas Alvy used this time to vent his negative opinions of the world. The upside to Alvy's personality is the strange, yet fun quirks that are evident throughout the movie. Some of these are things like talking at a rapid pace, making a joke out of everything, always wanting to participate in sexually activities with his partner. <br/><br/>His imagination starts to break away from the original story telling type of movie; this imagination created a strong interaction between the audience and Alvy. Oppose to presenting all of the information in a bland and direct fashion, Alvy brings the audience into his situations that he is dealing with. Many times throughout the movie, he has a random conversation with other people when something goes ""wrong"" in his life. He talks to these random strangers and they reply as if they know what is truly happening in his life. This is because Alvy's character feeds off of social interaction as a comedian. On top of this, his false sense of reality that is emphasized by these interactions with strangers shows his mental and emotional instability. <br/><br/>Alvy, Rob, and Annie are all grouped in the entrainment industry. They are all entertainers; Alvy is a well-known comedian, Rob is an actor for a major T.V. series in California, and Annie is a singer for a local night bar. These three people are grouped in entertainment but yet are divided into sub-sectors. <br/><br/>The main thing that I noticed when watching this movie is the attitudes change when Alvy is around. His negativity doesn't just smother him from enjoying life, it also affects the people he is closest too. Annie Hall is a great example of this; she started out as a bright and outgoing person, but once Alvy and Annie grew closer together, she became negative and neurotic, just like Alvy. (Induction) Just like most romantic comedy films, Annie Hall is a romantic comedy that also deals with relationships, even if they are crazy and neurotic. <br/><br/>Characterization was something that was new to me; I understood the concept of how to analyze the characters, but I had never applied it before. After doing this project, I have learned how to analyze characters more in-depth. Earlier, I analyzed Alvy's personality is the city of New York. It allowed me to further a concept that I knew little about. <br/><br/>Annie Hall touches on neurotic behaviors and its effect on relationships in a humorous manner. This movie represents New York and the people within the city. The romantic comedy touches on the reality of relationship and allows the viewer to see the unfolding of a relationship gone badly."
"fritzgagi","9","0","0","5 August 2012"," The neurotic romance
","Annie Hall tells the story of Alvie Singer, played by the big neurotic of cinema himself, Woody Allen, and his relationship with the title-giving Annie. Woody Allen who also directed tells the story through direct-to-camera narration and episodes from his relationship with Annie.<br/><br/>Alvie Singer is a neurotic New-Yorker who spends his days lost in confusion, pondering the big questions of life and love. He is continuously looking for something, emotionally and intellectually and makes his living entertaining people as a comedian with his neurotic obsessions. He dislikes the intellectual establishment and instead looks for his own answers. Woody Allen's excellent comedic performance is the center of this fantastic film.<br/><br/>He falls in love and gets into a relationship with the singer Annie Hall and as their relationship gets more serious she feels suffocated by his obsessive intellectual urge and looks for a more mellow lifestyle, which Woody Allen's character can't stand. It's unbearable for him to see her turn her back to intellectualism and to a more relaxed lifestyle. In perhaps one of the funniest moments in the film Alvie Singer even tries to replicate his relationship with Annie in a play but instead of her turning her back to him in his version she comes back to his intellectual island because for him it's obvious that that's what the world needs. <br/><br/>Looking back on his romance Woody Allen concludes that relationships are always going to be confusing and heart-wrenching and soul-crushing but yet they are an essential part of life and we keep pursuing them. Like Alvie Singer we should always keep pushing forward, explore and get lost. This film is heartbreaking and extremely funny it has excellent dialogue and an outstanding performance and is a must see for anyone who has had his heart broken or will in the future."

","This was my first woody Allen film and I must say that I am impressed. To be more precise his acting was amazing. In the starting of the film woody Allen talks directly to you and then starts the amazing ride towards the personal life of two couples. I read on the Wikipedia that he denies any similarity of the film with his own but this thought comes to everyone. This is I suppose because woody Allen himself acted and he acted so well along with a top notch direction. The film also looked as if it had been shot like a documentary but that seemed only for a few moments in the starting. In the middle there is a lot of talk between the two major characters and they were talking a lot related to nonsense and I kind of drifted away that instant but that was for a moment and now I think that was apt according to the story. For the story I would say that it is fairly OK but the direction and the acting along with the dialogs made the film an unforgettable experience.<br/><br/>""A must watch film for film lovers."""

","I remember watching ""500 Days of Summer"" and commented how good, typical the story was.

Ironically I had the film before ""500 Days of Summer"" and the irony is that I first saw the latter than the former being owned first than the latter, so that's ironically confusing. Anyway I had Annie Hall before because I heard it was Diane Keaton's award winning film. After watching this film I never thought of smiling and recollecting most of the best scenes in the movie. While washing dishes it made me smile unknowingly how I recall they played tennis, quarrel over killing two spiders the size of a Buick, horribly driving a Beetle, toyed over scattered lobsters, and broke up and make it up. Seriously, Woody Allen had to be one of the brightest mind I've ever saw, no wonder he fished three Oscars for that brilliant talent! This is his second film I saw since ""Whatever Works"", though it should be noted that Annie Hall preceded it, well I'm a modern guy, I saw nowadays before classics, that's pretty normal. And Diane struck me like ever. She's so much better in this film, not only I saw her dashing archetypal beauty but her acting skills were so natural and refined. She indeed deserved the Oscar.<br/><br/>I thought I would go weary watching films after 10 hours in the office, but I had the accidental choices I never thought would bring so much as an ""accident"".

","Easily the most entertaining Woody Allen movie I've seen, Annie Hall makes use of genius comedic techniques, which frequently coincide with the film's unique editing techniques. Allen uses tricky techniques, which I love to see in movies. More absurd and hilarious than any other is the film's use of the 'literary aside.' On more than one occasion, the characters break away from the film's reality and speak directly to the camera (and subsequently the audience). These asides create a sort of complex situation which frequently results in hilarity. Another of Allen's more defined comedic skills is his capability of making ordinary situations extraordinarily funny."

The camera work, acting, and writing are all great and meld together well, though there was a scene or two I felt was so dark it was difficult to see the actors.

I did find this movie to be rather slow moving in some places, but the sheer amount of comedy in this film was able to make up for it quite nicely. The characters within the film also break the 4th wall several times in the film, talking to the viewers and breaking their reality, pausing the events around them and starting a whole new ""reality"", as if they are embodying their thoughts.

The way that Woody Allen would come out of character and talk to the camera was amusing at times but what I really found amazing was the part where Annie has an ""out of body"" experience so to speak and is sitting in the chair when in reality she is in the bed and the main character wants to simply have sex without the use of drugs before hand. I found that the most interesting of all the scenes, not because of the content of what was going on but how it was filmed.

","Actually that is a brand-new thought since before last Saturday I would refer to THE PURPLE ROSE OF THE CAIRO as my favorite Woody Allen. Watching ANNIE HALL again was marvelous; it was only my second time with it, and the first one was years ago, when I was a kid. I didn't fully appreciate it and I even thought of it as probably Allen's most over-rated film. Last Saturday night was pretty much incredible: there's a new drive-in theater in my city (first one in many years) and I went for the very first time, with my girlfriend to see ANNIE HALL on the big screen (for the very first time). It blew my mind. It has everything. It is Allen's masterpiece, by far. And I have to thank my girlfriend since without her almost new love for Allen I would have not been re-watching this or watching for the very first time minor works like ANOTHER WOMAN. <br/><br/>Anyway, like with any other real classic I ask myself: what else can I write about it? Maybe I will just share how I was blown anyway with some moments. I recalled some classic stuff, like Allen (as character Alvy) suffering in the line for THE SORROW AND THE PITY thanks to an annoying and supposedly clever guy! I mean, when you are in a similar situation, that IS the scene you always recall! But I had forgotten other elements, and I was completely marveled by it (and I had forgotten also some jokes – everybody always recall the opening of the film or some lines, but no one goes for the thing with the African American maid! I laughed my head off!); for instance, I recently watched WHATEVER WORKS (Allen's 2008 picture) and pointed out how things like having the main character talking to the audience and stuff felt pretty much like a pointless element. Here, on the contrary, everything that is in that same vein feels -in a word- brilliant. And yes, ANNIE HALL features a quite beautiful take on relationships; obviously at this point in my life, I thought of it in a much different way than years ago. There are some really touching moments, and certainly there's nothing better than this when it comes to thinking in Allen and Diane Keaton together. But the greatest thing about this film is how it feels just like an example of Allen's genius. Certainly what's in his mind is always present, like his not very kind opinion of Hollywood (I didn't remember, by the way, that Paul Simon, from Simon & Garfunkel, is here pretty damn cool!), but sometimes we even have a visual representation of it. He is doing whatever he wanted to; he is bringing Marshall McLuhan to the screen and he is not caring too much about Bob Dylan! Hell, there's even some animation so yes, think of this as the finest example of why Woody Allen is one of the masters. <br/><br/>*Watched it (again) on February 11, 2012 (at a drive-in theater)."

Recently the thought that I want to be a writer has popped into my head, and no one does writing, directing and acting better than Woody Allen.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is about the relationship between cynical Alvy and ditzy Annie. While the film is a rom-com, it's more of a rom-com*. The * is because it's darkly funny, and the level of romance goes up and down like a roller-coaster. It's very honest, there's no closed doors in our viewing of the relationship.<br/><br/>Annie Hall came very close to getting the Oscar Big 5, only losing the Best Actor, and while I haven't seen the winner, it must've been a good contest. Of the 3 films to achieve this, I think Annie Hall would be the most deserving. Allen and Keaton are believable and lovable. Allen's directing is superb, with tricks I was floored by. As said before, the writing is rich and so... complete, all coming together in a grand package. Also funny to note, the quote I used, Alvy's description of LA, is ironically fitting to the film it's from.<br/><br/>Several things are worth noting. The 4th wall is broken, a lot and it's perfect. How many movies do you wish the main character would just stop and tell you what he's thinking? My favourite example is the movie theater line, where Alvy verbally dismantles the man behind him in line, even making one of the topics appear (it's fantasy). Other fantasies include Alvy asking random people on the street what happened to his romance. I personally love his references to all kinds of things, even if I didn't get some of them: I do that myself. Lastly, one scene has subtitles, and I had to shake my head and rewind. It was brilliant.<br/><br/>Lastly, the setting. Annie Hall is a New York film, except when they stop in LA twice. Alvy Singer is a New York guy, and he feels very uncomfortable in such a foreign place. Only after did I realize what a great job the film does of making New York feel like home. The scenes in LA were UNBEARABLE. I haven't loved hating something so much.<br/><br/>Annie Hall was surprisingly good, and far smarter than I expected. An all-around AAA film that is relatable, comforting and charming, all in 90 minutes. 9.2/10"

","You know this awkward and uncomfortable feeling when you just finished a joke and yet everyone looks like waiting for the punch line, inviting for a humiliating ""That's it"" that tolls the bell of a benign but painful failure? Well, my worst memory comes from a joke that I swore I would never speak about again, but let's exorcise the inner demons behind the mask of anonymity. There's a guy who comes to his friend and tells him ""I have two news for you"" His friend says ""Well, start with the bad news"" to which the other replies: ""They're both bad news""<br/><br/>This summarizes the first feeling I had with Woody Allen's most acclaimed and praised film, ""Annie Hall"", the movie still famous, or infamous, depends on the POV, for having beaten the much more spectacular, groundbreaking and popular ""Star Wars"" in the Best Picture Oscar competition.<br/><br/>I was not the Woody Allen fan I happen to be now; I was totally unfamiliar with his 80's and 90's work and probably more compliment-oriented towards his slapstick period. I expected from ""Annie Hall"" a romantic comedy between the eternally neurotic Woody character and a sort of hip and free-spirited woman played by Diane Keaton and named Annie Hall. Well, I wasn't disappointed on that level, but while I wanted to see a movie really worthy of a Best Picture Oscar, something that would provide a nice mix of wit and emotions, I could only see a pretentious ego-centered movie with no point, no structure, no appeal, the movie left me with a very flat feeling, and God knows how I've always hated flatness. So indeed, 'they were both bad news.'<br/><br/>But I guess I was victim of the 'Illusory Time' concept. You know what the illusory time concept is? It's this revolutionary idea that time doesn't exist, not quite the way we interpret it as a reality conditioned by the existence of a past, a present, a future but more the combination of the three into one perpetual present. This theory relies on the universe's inner property: its expansion. And while you can define a point on Earth by three spatial and one temporal coordinates, if you take a more universal approach, you realize that the three spatial dimensions will never be static considering the expansion of the universe. In other words, we're never in the same point. This doesn't really make me feel as anxious as young Alvy Singer, but this explains why I disliked Allen's ""Annie Hall"".<br/><br/>When you take ""Annie Hall"" as a whole, no pun intended, it's just a movie about a guy who thinks himself as the center of this expanding universe and analyzes the world from his own perspective, he pompously and pretentiously expresses a cynicism disguised in wit to better hide his own self-loathing nature. At the end, it's all about talking and talking, it's a succession of good lines, of creative plot devices, something was lacking, but I couldn't point my finger what and where. I didn't really dislike ""Annie Hall"" but I disliked the fact that it was Allen's most popular film, the winner of the Best Picture Oscar, and I hated the fact that I couldn't get why this movie was great, what makes it such a gem. I almost wished I could have the real Allen with me to tell me what was so great about it.<br/><br/>Three years have gone, I've seen almost all Allen's films, he became one of my favorite directors, I gained some cinematic maturity, and before I could watch ""Annie Hall"" again, I could at least put it in a chronological map in both Allen's filmography and History of Cinema. ""Annie Hall"" is the cinematic transition between Allen's slapstick period and his glorious streak of unique and creative films with autobiographical undertones that would reach its pinnacle in the 80's. It plays exactly like ""City Lights"" for Charlie Chaplin, the time we discover a character we're familiar with, involved in a more mature material, but never losing his appeal. It's not drama Woody, or romantic Woody, it's the same neurotic Woody with something new, that would defines his future work. Dr. Woody and Mr. Allen.<br/><br/>""Annie Hall""'s year of release is also significant because it coincides with the new era of blockbusters that would put an end to the extraordinary New Hollywood wave, in a way, the story of Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, the beautiful singer, is the swan song of a form of artistic expression that can only pass for pretension because, now, we, modern or younger movie viewers are more familiar with characters who never display hints of intellectual superiority toward their audience, not in romantic comedies anyway. Would we ever have characters talking about stuff we don't know about, even if it's made to sound sophisticated and pretentious, like Freud, McLuhan or Swedish Cinema. Never, even Harry and Sally were discussing about ""Casablanca"" a much more approachable movie. I guess we blame Allen for being so indulgent because he can't make us feel indulgent toward his characters. But this is the gutsy aspect of ""Annie Hall"" and the contributor of its unique appeal.<br/><br/>So, as a movie to enjoy on the present, ""Annie Hall"" is tricky, but if you have enough patience to let the film grow on you, it reaches the level of a valuable gem, and its victory over ""Star Wars"" is only the last agonizing breath before Cinema d'Auteur could take a big dive. And I hope you won't knock the previous intellectual masturbation about the universe, thank you.<br/><br/>There was a joke I've always liked, about a little boy asking his father ""Dad, are we in America yet?"" to which his dad says ""Just shut up and keep on swimming"" Well, I guess this sums up my new feeling of ""Annie Hall"", its greatness is probably like this America, and I guess right now, I'm starting to see the coast."

","This is an unusual but very entertaining film. <br/><br/>It frequently flouts customary movie rules: for example, the characters often break ""the fourth wall"" and confide directly to the camera (we, the audience) their thoughts or have subtitles on the screen telling us what they're really thinking. In one brief scene while standing in line waiting to get in to a movie, Woody gets in an argument with a man just behind him, a professor proclaiming his views; so Woody summons a world famous expert (Marshall MacLuhan, not a part of the narrative otherwise) to make a brief appearance in support of Woody's opposing views. Plus MANY other fun ""floutings.""<br/><br/>I completed a 5+ year psychoanalysis (as did many of my colleagues in Topeka in that era--it helped our advancements as well as our psyches) and this film pokes gentle fun at analysis, analysts, and clichés of that therapeutic process. One of my colleagues who viewed it with us, a close friend and an analyst, rated it 8/10 while I give it a 10/10. All the non-shrink others viewing it averaged in the 7-8/10 range. (FWIW, in IMDb's demographic ratings (q.v.), males consistently rate it slightly higher than females, regardless of age.)<br/><br/>Woody, in a brief prequel, speaks to us (as the comedian, Alvy Singer, his film character, but really consistent with and little different than almost every neurotic character Woody's played). In this, he repeats Groucho Marx's famous retort on being offered membership in the very exclusive Friars' Club: 'I refuse to belong to any club that would have a person like me as a member.'<br/><br/>Similarly (in my therapy experience), people who've never experienced (or never experienced enough of) things vitally important to them--such as acceptance, loving and being loved in return--often continually seek it out but then, just when it's in reach or, somewhat soon after it's grasped, manage to push it away. <br/><br/>It's as if, never having received it, it's okay and VERY important to PURSUE it but NOT okay to actually possess or maintain it. <br/><br/>IMO, they're much like the circus clowns with the big shoes, repetitively trying to pick up some desired object from the floor, but who--just before grasping it--always kicks it farther away. (Or, sometimes, they CAN find and savor it but typically only in those relationships that remain illegal, clandestine, or forbidden. The marriage of Woody with Soon-Yi in 1997 is probably an excellent example of this on both sides.) <br/><br/>That searching, pursuing, and typical disappointment is the underlying plot of ""Annie Hall"" but with lots of jokes, laughs, and chuckles spread like oodles of whipped cream with sprinkles over this underlying sad truth.<br/><br/>DELIGHTFUL!! Much fun -- MUCH truth."

","Woody Allen's Oscar-winning film which at the time was extremely thought-provoking and took him from just making funny movies into becoming hailed as something of a cinematic auteur with something to say. It's a very funny interplay between a neurotic and pessimistic stand-up Jewish comic named Alvy Singer (Allen, naturally) and his equally screwed up girlfriend Annie (Diane Keaton). These two eccentrics seem made for each other, and through a series of consistently well-written humorous dialogue and New York situations, we watch their relationship begin and fizzle out. I'm not sure there's as much of a point about the nature of relationships here as some reviewers make out, but what works is simply Woody's cynical character and the unrelenting humor. Some of ANNIE HALL's effectiveness may be reduced these days, since after its success and Woody's Oscar, he began repeating himself with future films and so there's a good chance you've already seen Annie and Alvy in other later Woody Allen movies by now. But for its time, this was quite an innovation. I wouldn't consider the movie worthy of its Best Picture award though; I would have given that honor to THE GOODBYE GIRL. A slight demerit is also added because I don't feel the character of Annie Hall herself is very likable or even interesting; it makes one wonder why she was significant enough to have the movie named after her. ***1/2 out of ****"
"hrsvelgr","Null","0","0","13 May 2011"," Comedy and then some.
","Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"" is a romantic comedy that likely defined the genre after it's release. The style of comedy found in ""Annie Hall"" sets itself apart from many other comedies that come before it in that it employs more social commentary and ""big questions"" (such as the meaning of life)throughout the writing. Woody Allen has a affliction that possesses him to be overly neurotic in everything he does. This ultimately leads to his films having more messages and meanings to them then one would find in a more traditional comedy. ""Annie Hall"" itself employs a variety of devices that make it stand out as film, comedy or otherwise. The fourth wall is broken often and characters have a tendency to break out of their scenes to explain a concept or situation, sometimes stress a point, and talk to the audience. This is sometimes used in a different manner such as flashbacks. A scene in particular takes our lead character back to his childhood and he describes his first jumps into romance and the significance of the human race. However instead of being a recount of events it is merely the characters as they are only in their past situations and remarking on what events were like. This method is clever and funny, meaning it is essentially doing it's job. The film explores Woody Allen's life, even though it is not meant to do so, and is a film that touches the lives of anyone who has experienced romance in the same manner as Allen and those who have feelings similar to his. The clever and intelligent writing along with reality sometimes being thrown out the window makes ""Annie Hall"" a wonderful comedy that not everyone will enjoy but can generally understand."

","This romantic comedy was the first Woody Allen film I have ever seen. Right from the beginning it's as if you can sense a connection between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton that seems to go beyond acting. This film deals with the nature of relationships which is not only easy to relate to, but it is a topic that transcends time. Woody Allen uses a variety of techniques such as animation, flashbacks and subtitles to tell the story. The way he talks to the audience through the camera creates a real intimate connection with the movie and character like he is talking straight to you. Perhaps this is the reason why Annie Hall has received so much praise and remains many peoples' favorite Woody Allen film to this day."

","If you love New York City and you love comedy then you must love Woody Allen's Annie Hall(1977). Allen's presentation of the Big Apple captures everything that makes it the greatest city in the world and Allen's sense of humor ranks with the greatest comedic minds in cinematic history. The way that Allen is able to incorporate so many jokes into what is basically an existential examination of romantic relationships is revolutionary and has influenced a generation of comedians to explore deeper issues through the use of comedy but none have been able to match the genius of Allen and his work in Annie Hall. Woody Allen's comedy is something of an acquired taste but I have a hard time believing that anyone who watches Annie Hall and doesn't enjoy it isn't an anti-Semite."

","Annie Hall was funny and very cleverly written. The film doesn't feature very much music, and the editing is unique in the way it skips around through the characters many topics of conversation, as well as the way Woody Allen is constantly breaking the fourth wall. The humor was really ""dry"", which I like. I just feel that Woody Allen's character was (although funny) a little depressing. It was funny to hear the point of views he had,and the way he delivered those views was good. I just can't say i completely agree with him. In some instances I feel he was much too critical of a character, and seemed insecure with himself. Overall it was an enjoyable film with laugh out loud comedy."

","Although this film is a romantic comedy, it has a different feel to it than other. While most romantic comedies portray relationships in a hardly believable, lame, fake Hollywood clichéd way, Annie Hall captures the highs and lows of a relationship in a serious and honest way, and relies on Woody Allen's wit for the comedy; including breaking the fourth wall to interject commentary, or sum up his feelings on what is happening in his life through a joke or anecdote. This formula for a romantic comedy is one that works, and can actually relate to the audience,instead of being fake and giving the audience silly ideas of what a relationship is like."
"CriticalCondition","Null","0","0","11 May 2011"," A Personal Favorite
","Woody Allen is one of these rare comic geniuses. Annie Hall is funny, interesting, very different from any other romantic comedy that has ever been made. Woody frequently breaks the 4th wall to speak to the audience and its rare for the kind of intrusion to feel comfortable, but the intrusion is always welcomed with Woody. The most significant part of the film, for me, is the writing. It's one thing to write a funny line or some witty dialog, but Woody Allen is able to capture moments that I think most of us have shared during a relationship with a significant other. The scene where Woody's character tries to recapture a moment he had once had with Annie in the kitchen with the lobsters, he tries so hard to recreate some sort of magic that just isn't there. Woody is able to capture the subtle this isn't right moment that every failed relationship has.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. Its funny, emotional, poignant and oddly charming."

","Woody Allen did a great job Directing and Acting in this film. Keaton was Allens muse. Her wardrobe is hilarious. It is all her. This is how Keaton chose to dress and Allen told them not to argue that. He thought she was amazing, natural and talented. Because their chemistry is so real, it really comes out in the film. Allen had a really creative way of showing the two sides in every relationship. Using a split screen while talking to their therapist, it shows their different feelings about their relationship. It is so realist. Two people fall in love, then are falling out and face the hardships of this because they do not want to hurt each other. If things do not work out, at least you had learned something. After time apart they find their way back to each other. I loved the message. Woody uses his usual sarcastic ways and good irony. He takes steps out of reality and takes a look at things from a different light. He questions life. He mocks psychology, with ""you learned all that."" Funny, Romantic, highly recommended!"

","Whether you like Woddy Allen as a person or not, I'd have a hard time believing you can't find this film funny. He plays an incredibly sympathetic character, Alvy (who closely resembles Allen) whose constant narration gives you a unique look at the inner workings of his mind. This narration, coupled with the subtitles in the scene where Alvy and Annie Hall get acquainted are prime examples of Allen's ability to push the boundaries of reality all while keeping things fresh and funny. He plays his typical Woddy Allen role as a man chasing a girl, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) but if you've seen previous works of his you'll notice that this film is much more serious than earlier ones, he poses questions about fate and destiny but he still adds his little touch of humor (a great example is the flash back to the younger Alvy, the kid who played him is hysterical given the coupling of adult feelings with a child's dialogue). The film is shot beautifully and you may notice some similarities to the Godfather in this area as both films used Gordon Willis for cinematography."

The acting was pretty well acted, Woody Allen is an amazing actor, to me he is kind of goofy, I think the best word for it is goofy.

","This was a great movie. This was a Woody Allen Classic. Annie Hall was so unconventionally entertaining and humorous, like most of Allen's films Annie Hall combined screwball humor with romantic sexual jokes. This movie was amazing. The movie also had a very high end Manhattan artsy like feel to it. The shot composition was very independent like and the acting and overall mood of the movie had Manhattan all over it. It's always funny how an artsy New York Movie can look so different in terms of style compared to a higher budget box office hit, usually shot in California. This movie also had Allen's style written all over it. Classic lack of invisibility. Allen loves to play it out as if he's aware of the camera the entire time, sometimes even narrating to it randomly. In Annie Hall you'll see some examples of this, their is no real definitive line between the films diegesis, in some scenes. He also played out Annie Hall as if he plays himself and his everyday life and a camera is documenting him and his relationship with Annie. It's fascinating actually how unconventional Woody Allen's style is, but it always works. Not to mention the movie had very artsy photography and hilariously absurd humor, like usual I'd expect nothing less coming from Woody Allen. Genius."
"batskitbomb27","Null","0","0","31 March 2011"," Review of the movie, ""Annie Hall""
","Annie Hall is an excellent film about the trials & challenges of people in relationships. Woody Allen's character seems to go about his life questioning every one around him. He can't just passively let anything natural happen without picking apart at the situation and figuring out why it's happening. There's a scene where Woody Allen is about to go to bed with Diane Keaton's character, Annie. In that scene, Annie wants to smoke a little grass before she can enjoy the rest of the night's festivities, but Woody Allen's character goes on a long rampage trying to figure out why she has to be high in order to go to bed with him. All he seems to do through this entire movie is psychologically figure out every other human being around him. It's just like in the movie theater scene when he's standing in line waiting to go to a movie, but a man standing behind him is rambling about his opinion on almost every movie. It all drives Woody Allen insane until eventually, he breaks that 4th wall of the movie and begins to start talking with the audience about why that man has those kind of opinions. The ME decade was a time of self-awareness, and this movie really dives deep into the main character's realization of why him & his girlfriend (Annie) have broken up. The movie is in scattered order showing us a glimpse of how their whole relationship came to be, and how it all fell apart. This movie also reminded me of the French New Wave. Everything about this movie seemed real to me. I could totally relate to it and understand it. There's a scene where Woody Allen meets up with Diane Keaton towards the end of the film and asks her to marry him because he feels absolutely miserable with out her. She feels for him, but doesn't agree with him on the whole marriage deal. She just knows it wouldn't be right for the two of them. It's not the happiest ending in the world, but definitely an ending you can understand and relate with your own life. Not everything works out the way you want it to."

","I have never seen a movie reviewed more than this one. That fact alone should say it all but it doesn't. This is not a review as such but just some commentary. The first is that I haven't thought about the fact that there are reviews here from people who were not even born when this movie was made. Never thought about that. Hmmm, I was a grown up 21 when it came out. Since I was born and raised in Brooklyn and NYC and lived here my whole life, I had always felt that this was ""my"" movie. Woody was considered, in my era and age group, an alien being in the land of Hollywood. He WAS one of us. I felt threatened that he made a real ""movie"" when AH was released. I had always considered him an underground NY guy, so, no one was gonna take him away from us. This is the reason I felt threatened. My only consolation was that now the rest of the world would finally ""see"" what an amazingly gifted artist we had here. OK, enough. You get the point. Now on to other goodies. First and foremost, Tony Roberts. I love this guy. That they (Woody & Tony) called each other Max thruout the movie was to me, an inside joke because best friends usually did this. In my case, my best friend Frank and me (rob) called each other Dukey. Always! Still do 55 years later. TR is such a natural, gifted actor that it was not acting he did, it was living! His oneness with his characters were incredible. Never for one minute did I see any of the actors here acting! That is how great Woody Allen is. He brings it out of his actors. Their characters are living human beings! Diane Keaton nailed it. Not only her beauty, for which she is one of the prettiest, sexiest and most gorgeous creatures ever seen on screen, look at her today, hasn't lost a drop! This trio - WA, DK and TR, who worked together in Play It Again Sam, could have been a rock group they are so great!! The last point I'd like to make is that Woody's genius is that he can make inanimate, animate! Unreal - real, funny-sad and so on. What a gift to be living in the same era as these three. Nuf said."

","Wildly imaginative, surreal, and sophisticated, Annie Hall is one of Woody Allen's most high quality and finely tuned films. It is a reflection on himself, society, and the ideals of relationships. In the film Allen plays comedian Alvy Singer, a neurotic and pessimistic man whose views on the world are dark and brooding, yet displayed in the most sardonic and sarcastic kind of dry humor that Woody Allen is known for. His girlfriend is Annie Hall, played by Diane Keaton. She is equally neurotic, yet much more optimistic about the world which leads her to very ditsy and almost naive. These two polar opposite personalities somehow fall in love, creating an adorable, awkward, and very real relationship. The film is an insightful and innovative look into 70's romance.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's unique film techniques that almost cannot be defined in words are extremely prevalent in this movie. There are many moments that existentially reflect the characters relationships with each other and the world around them. Allen employs things like breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the audience. Various times in the movie the characters will visit one location and see themselves in scenes that took place in the past. It's weird to put it in words like that, but the way it is used in the film is incredibly effective and interesting, while also giving me a good laugh as the characters non chalantly react to their own memories. The characters continue this feeling of, in a way, self awareness that they are in a cinematic vision, allowing the director to show them what he pleases, when Allen even uses subtitles in one scene to reflect what the characters are thinking when they say certain things, once more conveying a self reflection of their own subconscious. The incredibly creative things Woody Allen puts in this movie are some things that you really just have to see for yourself, and describing them simply in words doesn't at all do it justice.<br/><br/>Annie Hall wouldn't be such a great movie if it wasn't carried so well by the two lead actors. Woody Allen's three way talent between a director, writer, and actor is absolutely amazing. He and Diane Keaton drive this film so well, and the amount of strange and authentic chemistry they have together is something so unique and fantastically unconventional. This on screen romance plays out and is orchestrated with such simple brilliance, setting this film far apart from most romances. Woody Allen is an expert with characters, and a lot of that is due to his own bizarre and complicated personality. So many of Allen's films can be interpreted as autobiographical, giving them all a very personal experience reflected for the audience. At the same time, if films like Annie Hall are self reflective of Allen, they are also very self critical. Allen exemplifies all of his characters flaws so strongly, often pointing them out himself. But its this kind of dedication and personal importance of Allen's films that make them one of a kind.<br/><br/>You'll never find a director quite like Woody Allen. All of his films have their own unique spark, and odd quirk to them. Annie Hall is no exception. It is so strange, yet at the same time feels so normal because Allen's unique ability at constructing the most authentic character studies seen in cinema. It's difficult to put some of the originality of Annie Hall into words and it is one of those films you have to see for yourself to understand its subtle and estranged brilliance."

","Woody Allen meets Diane Keaton in New York and they fall in love, move in together, try a separation, move back in with one another, and finally split up -- Allen to remain stuck in New York City with his neuroses and tunnel vision of life, Keaton to move to Los Angeles in search of tofu and fresh air.<br/><br/>It's arguably Woody Allen's best film. Yes, he's a version of his usual self-centered character, filled with ontological dread, paranoid, frightened. And, yes, Keaton is a naif from Chippewa Falls, self conscious to the point of nail biting, undergoing a course in Sophisticated 101 from Allen. But both characters are explored in enough depth to flesh them out and give them more than one dimension. They're not stereotypes. They don't have just one shtick.<br/><br/>Before ""Annie Hall"", Allen produced these reckless and relentlessly funny comedies. Afterward, instead of one dyad, as here, the films dealt with so many characters and their multiple misunderstandings that it became hard to keep them straight or, frankly, to care very much about any of them. Allen's mind was still that of a tribal whirling Dervish but instead of flinging out gags he was flinging out puzzles and mazes, most of them not very amusing.<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" is a nicely integrated story. It follows Allen and Keaton from their first meeting to their last, and it's filled with comic lines. At a party of extremely wealthy nobodies in Beverly Hills, the camera slowly glides past Jeff Goldblum, looking very concerned and speaking into the phone, saying, ""I forgot my mantra."" (There are lots of recognizable faces among the bit parts.) In fact, as is often the case, Woody endorses his own life style as the worthiest, though he's not blunt about it. It's just that everyone around him seems so dumb, so phony, so suicidally deranged, that he comes closest to representing normality. That's not saying much because he makes fun of himself routinely.<br/><br/>Anyway, the result of all this is that we can identify with both of the leads. Woody's position makes sense. Beverly Hills is full of rich, gibbonous morons who are mahogany colored and festooned with jewelry. As Allen remarks, Beverly Hills is so clean because the people don't throw out their garbage, they turn it into entertainment.<br/><br/>At the same time, the movie makes clear in sometimes unexpectedly subtile ways (a fleeting expression) that Allen is smothering Keaton. He tells her to take night classes, buys books for her to read, pays for her analysis. And when she grows up enough, she's able to make her own choices despite Allen's objections. If she wants to go to Los Angeles and live in a Day-Glo purple mansion with minarets and garden gnomes, that's her business.<br/><br/>The movie ends with a hoar-encrusted but poignant comic observation that neatly encapsulates the atmosphere of the movie itself. We all need the eggs."

","Woody Allen's firmly established himself as one of the best auteur's/directors ever in my books. What I liked about the film most was how much I could relate to it, the portrayal of relationships is very realistic and there were numerous scenes where I thought to myself ""I know I've been there"". I also saw a lot of myself in the Woody Allen character, the ultimate pessimist always worrying about one thing or the other. On top of all that the film was frickin' hilarious, doesn't rely on dumb jokes like most of today's comedies do but rather relies on wit and irony, you can tell a lot of craft was put into the writing. I especially loved the scene where he's standing in line for a movie and there's a guy behind him spouting crap about Fellini. Christopher Walken's scene was great too, loved Allen's response to him, ""Right. Well, I have to - I have to go now, Duane, because I, I'm due back on the planet Earth."" <br/><br/>Not as good as ""Manhattan"" or ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" but I can confidently say it's one of the best comedies I've seen. It's packed with great lines and one liners without ever coming off as forced or stupid. If you're a far of intelligent comedy and you haven't seen this, well, what are you waiting for?"
"webmaster-3017","10","0","0","18 July 2010"," HK Neo Reviews: Annie Hall
","Tagline: Woody Allen – you little genius...<br/><br/>Upon watching Woody Allen's Oscar winning 1977 Best Picture – Annie Hall, I just realise how late I was. Being late to a packed classroom is rather embarrassing, but it is still better than the lad who is still at home sleeping, missing out the action all together. That is precisely the feeling I ended up feeling. It is not easy for a romantic drama/comedy to still be relevant in exactly 33 years later. Like many of the gen Y, Woody Allen plus Scarlet Johansson is already what we known him as. It is little wonder why nearly everyone have become disappointed in Allen. He is certainly capable of much more. Annie Hall have all the trademarks of Mr. Allen's witty dialogue, monologue and basically people talking, talking and more talking. He likes to linger a shot longer and let the audience inside the movie, rather than the other way around. Sometimes, I wonder how a movie is going to affect me, but interestingly, it is the lack of musically impact that make Annie Hall more powerful and relating. The characters are quite simply humans. If the movie is about a lot of things, it is essentially a love story. The number of memorable scenes and dialogue is simply unforgettable. Understanding and following Woody and Diane Keaton conservations is like a re-dux of our own lives. It may not seem much, but for once, a film justifiably lusted out Star Wars for Best Picture and rightly so.<br/><br/>The movie goes like this: Woody Allen begins the movie heartbroken and from there the tale of his past relationships are shown in spades of time. However, the focus is really on his love story with Annie Hall. The connection, the meeting, the moments, the sex, the table talks, the cinema lines, the harbour views, the departure, the ending and the cafe are all essentially part of making up who Allen is trying to portray. Essentially a movie about a love lost, the difficult to find that compatibility, but portrayed in the wittiest of manner.<br/><br/>There are moments that you seem as though you are the characters in the movie. Talks like a couple at a restaurant talking about the family table next to them or the couple walking along the way. Small talks are what couples do and Allen conveys exactly that. There is another scene where after his first time sex with Annie, he smartly remarks: ""There goes another novel."" Other classic scenes that stayed in my memory would be the long cinema line, where the guy behind Woody keeps talking about a certain movie and it got to the point where Woody approached the camera and ranted out his frustration of the guy knowing nothing. The guy in return confronted the camera to explain himself and Woody pulls out the producer of the movie to explain that the guy is wrong. It may sound tedious, but it is these subtle moments that makes the movie work. Being able to keep up with Allen's character and the things he say is a vital part of relationships. Towards the end, when he is picking up lobsters with a new muse, he did a witty remark and the fact that the girl didn't understand him, it compels his instincts that reminds him of the connection he had with Annie is irreplaceable.<br/><br/>Woody Allen is one of the wittiest film-maker around and his performance here seem extremely realistic. Whether or not, the reason for this is because of the way he plays around with the audience, constantly talking to them, looking at the camera, dreaming of events and simply through continuous talking. On surface and appearance along, Diane Keaton does not match with Woody, but as the movie goes on, you know exactly why they were a couple. There is that connection of words and minds between the two. As the movie continues the audience can look back or forward to their relationships and realise it is precisely the flow of conversation that make the relationship unique and work. For me, I cannot comprehend a girl that does not understand the manner, the tone of something I am trying to say and for Woody it seems true. That is why Diane Keaton is so amazing, she speaks her mind, she understands Woody and she knows when to move on. After-all the film does end with something like – ""but love fades"".<br/><br/>All in all, Annie Hall is a masterpiece. It is a timeless movie on many different levels. The dialogue is top notched. The direction and editing are suitably creative. Comedies hardly ever win Best Picture and for it to win over a blockbuster of a film in Star Wars, it is an unprecedented achievement. Perhaps what Woody did in Annie Hall may never be repeated and nor should it ever be. Full marks for Woody for saying that he will never direct a sequel to this, as some films should have been left as it was. Like Before Sunrise, the film is about people talking, living, eating, talking, sexing and more talking. It is a film that you need to let go of the boundaries of the movie experience and let the joy comes along the way. Movies like these are magical and grow onto you more and more after the credit rolls. What I really enjoyed is the fact that the movie somehow affected me without the usual gimmicks of emotional soundtrack, but rather through witty and relevant dialogues and real human characters that interacts to make Annie Hall, the romantic comedy of the century...(Neo 2010) <br/><br/>I rate it 10/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

","Just to add my voice to the choir: Quite simply one of the best films about romantic relationships ever made. Brilliantly written. Brilliantly acted -- Diane Keaton is tremendous, the supporting cast is full of gems and Allen himself takes the leap to present himself as a real (if funny) human being and not a walking joke. And brilliantly photographed by the great Gordon Willis of 'The Godfather' and many of most important films of the 70s and 80s. <br/><br/>Wildly funny and ultimately heartbreaking. It's hard to imagine anyone who has ever been in love, or struggled through grown-up relationships NOT identifying with a lot of this film. I loved it in my late teens when it first came out, and I love it even more 32 years later. Every time I see it I notice different details, depending on my own current life experiences. A film of enormous wit, humor, invention, and understanding of the human heart. Its completely unique, playful and idiosyncratic in style and approach, but that experimentation somehow only makes it more accessible and universal. If you haven't seen it, you owe yourself a try, even if you're not a Woody Allen 'fan'. And if you saw it long ago, it may be time for another look."
"lewiskendell","8","0","0","31 May 2010"," The kind of movie that makes you feel smarter after you watch it.
","Before Annie Hall, I had only seen the more recent Woody Allen movies. Vicky Cristina Barcelona (very good), Match Point (good), and Scoop (awful). Needless to say Annie Hall was a bit of a shock. It was was very different from those later Allen films. <br/><br/>I love how Woody is unafraid to throw any and everything at the viewer. Any story-telling device or technique that he wants to use, he just goes for it. Talking directly to the audience, flashbacks, asides, they all combine to tell the story of a relationship - piece by piece. This isn't a straightforward narrative, and it's a better movie as a result. Every time I thought things were beginning to bog down a little, some awesome joke or interesting narrative flourish would come out of nowhere and jolt my interest back into what was going on. That's how you make a relationship movie interesting for those who typically avoid these kinds of flicks.<br/><br/>Take all those complimentary things I've just said and wrap them in the kind of bittersweet, memorable ending that I love, and you have Annie Hall in a nutshell. I never really appreciated how smart Woody is, before i watched this. It's funny and intelligent and full of the kind of references and jokes that makes me wish I could write this kind of thing. Great movie."

","Woody Allen's greatest film. A work of art and shows that script writing is equal to a theater or a novel. The script reads better than many novels.<br/><br/>Throughout the story flashbacks come in of his failed relationships. This is familiar Allen territory. His inability to hold a relationship tog ether as a metaphor for life. In less adept hands this would be self indulgent drivel. But Allen who developed his art from the 1960s onwards brings charm and warmth that would upset any of his therapists charging a $100 an hour to prove that the patient is a nut job. Of course there is the equal Allen insecurities, so to say, of psychotherapy being an answer to everything or does it cause more anxiety which needs more analysis and that costs more money which could be spent on building relationships an do you need money for relationships and so on.<br/><br/>Once Alvy and Annie have broken up he tries to piece his life back together and its Annie that shows that once he lets go of his selfishness life is a lot easier."

","'Annie Hall' is not just the best film by Woody Allen, but also one of the best films of all time. It is about the way from a relationship to a friendship, because the characters are unable to love each other having problems loving themselves.<br/><br/>Alvy Singer is one of the best stand-up-comedians of Manhattan and desperately concerned with himself. He is the stereotype of the neurotic Intellectual. The Film tells us about his past relationships to other women and of course to the singer Annie Hall. Both seem to be the same type and to have the same problems, until Annie gets the chance of develop herself. She meets the music producer Tony Roberts (played by Paul Simon)and leaves Alvy to move to L.A. ...<br/><br/>What at first sight seems to be a rather romantic comedy, is eventually a critical view at the egocentrical behaviour of the modern man. In the last scene of the film, Alvy tells a joke about a man going to a doctor. He tells him, that his brother is crazy, as he thinks he is a chicken. The doctor tells him to move him into a hospital, but the man explains, that he needs the eggs. And that is the way, the modern, neurotic man thinks about relationships to other people. Many of us are not in love with a person, but with the feeling of this love and engagement. We need the eggs to feel better and not to feel the loneliness and desperation of our lives and the incapacity to be happy, which was the original title of the film.<br/><br/>It is a very dark and critical view, but it is the truth. The balance between comedy and tragic makes this film one of the best of all times and deserves every one of its awards, not to forget the brilliant performance of Diane Keaton."
"Sandcooler","9","0","0","28 March 2010"," As real as romance gets
","Has romance ever been captured more perfectly? And furthermore, is there anything more beautiful than the extreme awkwardness that comes with falling in love? ""Annie Hall"" is a very unconventional romance movie, by which I mean that it's not as distant as the average movie romance. You actually care about these people, because it appears as if they could actually exist. That's probably why this movie is so effective. The melancholic cinematography also gives it a raw power that is hard to describe. I've never really gotten into Woody Allen's filmography, and his neurotic character rarely stays interesting for an entire movie, but here it fits in perfectly. This is probably his most accessible movie, if not just his best."

","Let's first admit I am not among Woody Allen's fans, but after having seen and liked ""Whatever works"" and discovered its script went back to the same period as Annie Hall, I felt like seeing it. Let's also admit I watched it in company of my parents who constantly repeated to themselves how it was possible to award it with the Oscar as best movie, and how it was possible to found a movie on talking, walking, talking while walking, walking while talking.... quite a funny condition to see one of Allen's best creation. <br/><br/>The movie is a romantic and ""cerebral"" comedy about man-woman relationship, seen from the point of view of a neurotic, nerve-wracking and too a self-conscious man, Alvy Singer, the prototype of many of Allen's characters, you may love or hate him abut he cannot leave you indifferent, and I would like to cite Roger Ebert when he says that Alvy is ""a seeker of the unattainable and an expert at making it unattainable, he is not a victim of forces beyond his control, but their author"", as they can best summarize the condition of this eccentric, almost border-line man.<br/><br/>There are extremely funny moments, as when he says that has been attending an analyst for fifteen years, and he will allow him another year before going to Lourdes: what strikes you as odd and disarming is the naturalness and immediacy when he pronounces such philosophical sentences or quotations, so that you can either laugh or despise him. I liked him, although I must admit that his neurotic talkativeness sometimes gets annoying, but in the end I cannot deny the movie is involving and innovative for the seventies. As I had said in my review of ""Whatever works"", old age make people, if not wiser, more disillusioned, and more at ease with the bitterness of life, I think that in Annie Hall's script we could have never found the idea that ""Every temporary measure of grace"" is the best we can obtain from life. Annie Hall reveals a yearning for life, even only for a speculation about life that ""Whatever works"" puts aside in favour of a more disenchanted view and comforting final happy ending, but it is undoubted that the neurotic and sometimes pedantic nature of Allen's movies, characters, and probably nature, belong to both movies. <br/><br/>You may love or hate it, but I think ""Annie Hall"" is a must see movie for all those who like thinking about life and about the ""irrational"" quality of man-woman relationship."

","This one is a must for serious Woody Allen fans. Those wanting to explore a new genre or trying to find out why Allen is hailed as a genius filmmaker shouldn't miss Annie Hall either. <br/><br/>Annie Hall is set in New York and Los Angeles in the mid-70s. The story is about Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). The relationship between the two protagonists is the crux of the movie. In between, we are given snippets of their lives before they met each other. Alvy Singer, a comedian, with two divorces runs into Annie Hall, a budding actress-singer, during a friendly game of tennis. They start dating and have a passionate affair, only to find out later that they have little in common. An amiable split, getting back together, being friends, trying to get back together; theirs is a see-saw relationship of two neurotic characters clashing with one another. <br/><br/>In true Woody Allen fashion, the characters are far from normal. Alvy Singer is perpetually nervous (a trait he attributes to growing up under a roller-coaster), while Annie Hall needs to smoke grass to enjoy sex. Throughout the film, Woody Allen, through his character, talks to us, the audience, and on a couple of occasions brings in someone else from the plot to talk to us as well. <br/><br/>The central genre of the movie is comedy. With Woody Allen at its helm, one can expect goofy sequences and numerous one-liners. Woody Allen's comic one-liners have achieved cult status and here are a few one-liners from the film: Annie Hall saying, ""I can't have sex tonight. I'm singing tomorrow and need to rest my voice."" Alvy Singer saying, ""Don't knock masturbation, its sex with someone I really love."" And, ""Sex is the most fun I've had without laughing."" And, on Beverly Hills being clean, ""They don't throw their garbage away, they make it into TV shows."" And that's just a sampler.<br/><br/>Annie Hall was released in 1977 and is one of Allen's most loved and appreciated movie. At the 1977 Oscars, it won numerous awards like Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Woody Allen was also nominated for the Best Actor award."

In fact, in the most important areas, this could have been made today, not over three decades ago. The pieces of truth and commentary are compelling, and the delivery of them is spot-on. Editing and cinematography are good. This is marvelously directed. The long takes are impressive, and the form doesn't draw too much attention to itself. Breaking the fourth wall is used to great effect. The acting is excellent. This is perfectly paced, and this shark does not die. Nothing is excessive or out of place. The humor is utterly hilarious. This is about forty-ish TV funny-man Alvy Singer, and more specifically, his love-life. The characters are interesting and well-developed. Every line of dialog is pure gold, and flawlessly delivered. Language is mild, with a few references to sex. There is drug content in this. I recommend this to everyone, as long as they have a reasonable base of the knowledge required to understand the references and such, and are not turned off by the neurotic lead. 10/10"

The greatly nostalgic ending gives you that longing yet satisfied feeling of what love brings into life, and the completely silent credit-roll is another stroke of genius from Allen as you simply want to see it again and again and again."

Sometimes it can be annoying when an actor comes through in their character, but when it works like it did in this movie it cannot be any better.

","Woody Allen's Annie Hall is an entertaining look at how humans deal with relationships. Alvy is slightly lovable but also deplorable, and only figures out what he thinks he wants after he's alienated it away. The nonlinear story is enjoyable to follow as we get to know Alvie and Annie and what they mean to each other. We see them changing and growing apart while still having an undeniable connection in the relationship. Allen breaks the fourth wall repeatedly and in doing so brings us in closer to these characters until we are almost a friend he is confiding to. This film forces us to look at our own defects of character through seeing Alvie stumble along in his relationships. There are similar problems throughout his relationships and he of course is the greatest common denominator, as we often are when we step back and look at the patterns in our lives. Compare and contrast were tools used often in this film as illustrated by the use of a split screen shot as the couple sat in their individual therapy sessions. the audience gets to see as the dynamics in the relationship shifts and we get closer and closer to the end of their chapter together. The lighting and production design in this film played an important part in helping the audience follow the transitions in the characters lives, particularly when Annie Hall moves to CA and everything is brighter and harsher outside. Annie herself though looks lovely and healthy and happy as if to show how she has finally grown into the woman they both saw her becoming. A stand out scene for me was when the director used an effect to show Annie's spirit physically removing itself from her flesh and bones during sex with Alvy, and the characters discussed whether it was okay for her to be removed in that way. Allen brings humor and discussion to everyday life moments that we can all relate to. Whether we like the characters or not in this movie, we see reflections of our own awkwardness and the insanity that comes with being in relationships. This is the type of movie that is timeless because it centers around the common thread of how imperfect we are as humans, and how reassuring it is to not be alone in the insanity that we create in our minds."

"Mishmuns415","8","0","0","16 February 2009"," Variation from conventional romantic comedy
","Although this film has been proclaimed as one of the best romantic comedies, I see many distinctions between ""Annie Hall"" and the conventional romantic comedy. Conventional comedies are expected to end with the romanticized, ""happily ever after;"" like a fairy tale, where the two lovers end up together. The traditional narrative of romantic comedies involves: the introduction of characters the two protagonists (Alvie & Annie), the separation due to an argument or other contrived obstacle, and the ultimate reunion. ""Annie Hall"" is an example of a film that varies on this basic plot line, ruminating on the impossibility of love. Thematically and technically ""Annie Hall,"" is known as a major turning point in Allen's films. This film took a deeper emotional and romantic approach, while still maintaining his comedic style, though in a different way. ""Annie Hall"" was the first of Allen's films to utilize long takes, where one continuous, un-manipulated shot makes up the entire scene. Long shots have the capability of adding to the dramatic power of the film. Annie Hall's symmetrical yet non-linear narrative flows according to the emotional desires of one protagonist, Alvie Singer (who symbolized Allen himself). By spoiling the resolution in the beginning, the film invokes empathy in viewers as Alvie recounts his relationship with Annie, and self-deprecating revelations of self-doubt and absorption, paranoia, and intolerance/unacceptance of all things not including New York. Alvie's obsession with New York, its gradual decline, and outright hatred for California establishes the psychological setting of this film as a story of love amongst the ruins. Annie, on the other hand, is an anxious, skittish and scattered woman, whose flaws are also revealed in the film. Their imperfections make them charmingly human, emphatically drawing in the audience. It is very important to add another element in which ""Annie Hall"" does not follow the rules of conventions conventional romantic comedy or realism, known as ""Breaking the fourth wall."" The fourth wall is the boundary between fiction and the audience; when it is broken the character reveals his/her awareness to the audience, addressing the camera directly. Allen's use of split-screen imagery, double exposure, and subtitles expounding the characters' real thoughts also drifts further from realism. The film conforms its material to realism, however has the tendency to lean toward formalism. Allen chose to ""break the fourth wall"" because he felt that many viewers experience the same feelings and problems, and in this way he could confront them directly. ""Annie Hall"" was intended to appeal to viewers on the basis that they could relate. It was not meant to follow the classical romantic comedy, but instead focus on the anatomy of the relationship between Alvie and Annie."

","Academy award winning film ""Annie Hall"" immediately introduces us to Alvi (Allen), with his trials and tribulations with Annie (Keaton). From the beginning of the film, he breaks the fourth wall by talking directly to the audience so we can establish a connection with his character. His quirky personality and comedic jokes (""don't knock masturbation, it's sex with someone I love"") produces a cheerful atmosphere and allows the audience to favor him. The film uses a non-linear narrative which assists in portraying the awkward and sporadic relationship between them. He continuously criticizes everything he encounters with his witty remarks, which is why I get the sense that Woody Allen is playing himself as his character seems so natural and carefree. This steers away from the predictable formula of a Hollywood film as it opens with Alvi informing us of his break up with Annie. The film generates a realistic appearance since the characters feel natural and unglamorous, unlike a typical Hollywood film."

He allows us to take the journey through the relationship with them, even though he does talk straight to us he makes us his friend so it peaks our curiosity as to why they split. The editing off course made this movie because even though it is non linear story telling the plot still hit the necessary plot points to have the same effect on the audience.

","The editing style of Ralph Rosenbloom in Woody Allen's full-length feature film entitled, ""Annie Hall,"" is what struck me to be the most peculiar and noteworthy in regards to this comedic movie. Ralph Rosenbloom's narrative style of non-linearly editing the film helps to accentuate the storyline relationship between (the main character) Alvy Singer and Annie Hall. The method of how the events in the script are presented is odd, however this adds to the uniqueness of the movie. We're instantaneously aware of the director's formalistic approach to Annie Hall in the opening scene, as the self-proclaimed 'b*st*rd' Alvy Singer tells his tale of his relationship with Annie Hall. The story unfolds in a collection of extremely well-though out non-linear and emotional cuts, as he focuses more on the bond between Singer and Hall, rather than Singer and his past relationships. The underlying subtext that I can deduce from the film, is that some of the best relationships come unexpectedly and when you're not looking for it; however, these relationships can also end as fast as they started."

","Having seen only Woody Allen's recent films such as Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, viewing Annie Hall forced me to reevaluate what ""a good Woody Allen film"" really is. Annie Hall has already compelled me to go out and rent films from this director's lengthy archive. From the very beginning until the end of this film, through Allen's use of breaking the fourth wall and his clever techniques of exploiting humor, Allen forces the audience to become active participants in the film, rather than having it be a passive experience of sitting back and watching a story unfold on screen. The acting comes off as realistic and genuine, and perhaps is a good example of the saying that all art is autobiographical, considering Allen and Keaton's former relationship at the time the film was shot. Taking a look at a few of the somewhat highbrow romantic comedies of recent times, such as High Fidelity, the influence of Annie Hall is more than obvious.<br/><br/>Allen, armed with an exceptional talent for writing and dialogue, shows what it feels like to be left behind by those he has thoroughly invested in. This is a story between Alvy and a significant romantic relationship of his past, but also a story between the relationship between Alvy Singer and himself. Although Allen starts the film with the line that he ""would never want to belong to any club that would accept someone like him for a member"" the majority who see this film would most likely disagree and would very much like to sit down and have a tea with Mr. Alvy Singer."

","Annie Hall is a film that taught me as a young filmmaker that all rules are meant to be broken. From the non linear way the story is told, to Woody Allen breaking the fourth wall, this film keeps the viewer on it's toes. Woody Allen's character is in search of love, yet seems to have the same problems in every relationship. We follow mainly his relationship with Annie Hall, but flashback at points to other previous relationships he has had. This movie makes you realize that if you seem to be having the same problems in every relationship, the problem is not the partners you choose rather the problem is you. Woody Allen chooses women who feel they are not as educated as him and he takes it upon himself to educate them. When the women get to his intellectual level they leave him, for they no longer need him. It became apparent to me that in order to have a successful relationship both partners need to see each other at an even level. That way they can challenge each other and no one is a dominant force or teacher. This film touches on the complex confusing notion of relationships, in a funny entertaining manner that only Woody Allen is capable of doing."

","This film can be characterized as a movie about the roller coaster love life between the protagonist, Alvy Singer, and the title character, Annie Hall. Comedic, tragic, and even a little philosophical, the film portrays what could have simply been ""another Hollywood love story"" in a highly stylized and engaging fashion, reminiscent of the French New Wave. To start, the opening scene tosses the concept of ""suspension of disbelief"" out the window when Woody Allen speaks directly to the audience, foreshadowing the ending of the film itself. Yet, suspense is only heightened, rather than diminished as we come to pay special attention to each scene as they are individually displayed rather than viewing them as a collective sequence building up to one formal climactic event. As such, this movie breaks a lot of barriers in a lot of ways. The fourth wall, linear progression, and the properties of time and space are broken throughout the movie, adding much more to the film than that of a traditional love story.<br/><br/>This movie is anti-climactic in establishing Alvy and Annie's relationship. Every traditional-looking love scene is blundered by brilliantly written awkward dialogue. In fact, the two main character's ""first kiss"" scene could not have been any less emotional or deep. Yet as a 3rd person viewer, I could not have perceived the event any more realistically.<br/><br/>In the end its not about what happens to these characters, but why. This is Woody Allen's explanation that one can try to control and change the people around him, but this may change the person into a someone very different than who he had fallen in love with. The only constant in this highly volatile and jumpy film is Allen's character, who suggests at the end that possibly it is he who needs to be the one to change.<br/><br/>Watching this unorthodox film was an extreme pleasure, and I have to congratulate and thank Ralph Rosenbloom for his less acknowledged, yet vitally important role in the creation of this film through his ingenious editing.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Woody Allen's classic, Annie Hall is a masterpiece of the romantic comedy genre. Based around the love story of Alvy Singer (Allen) and Annie Hall (Keaton), we can do nothing but laugh and sympathize with Alvy as he struggles to find and keep love in the city that is New York, his biggest problem being himself as he forces those he loves to change, and than upon doing so, find no need for Alvy any longer. <br/><br/>From the opening moments of Annie Hall we are introduced into Allen's unique style of formalistic story telling, when we learn that Alvy will not be ending up with the woman he loves, Annie Hall. With wish fulfillment lost, our interest becomes just who and how was the relationship destroyed. Furthermore our introduction of the characters breaks all the rules of romantic comedy genre as we had known them. During a date scene at the cinema where we our first introduced to Annie and Alvy, Allen chooses to have Alvy break the fourth wall of cinema in a comical monologue addressed directly at us, the audience, and even goes so far as to pull a character out from behind a billboard to prove a point about philosophy. <br/><br/>Allen's choice of a non linear narrative, culminated with a classic style of realist cinematography adds to the foreword momentum of the story as we learn about the characters through a standard lens coverage, with flashbacks and flash forwards. Allen continues to break the rules with his wardrobe design placing Annie's feminine character in masculine attire and Alvy, a stand up comic, in Ralph Lauren. Allen breaks so many Cinematic rules that we never are kept wonderfully off balance, never knowing where the story will go next. Breaking the rules has never been so much fun.<br/><br/>The idea of Life imitating art is full affect here, as we learn that Alvy and Annie will remain better off friends, and in the end, the two actors Allen and Keaton remain close friends to this very day."

The editing, however, was what made the movie. It is edited in such a way, almost like a humans memories of different events that took place within a specific time frame.

The movie is based in New York as comedian, Alvy and aspiring singer, Annie fall in love.

","Who wouldn't find this film funny? Who doesn't fine Woody Allen's character funny? Humor truly is the driving backbone behind ""Annie Hall"" The film is primarily about the relationship between Woody Allen's character, Alvy Singer, and Diane Keaton's character, Annie Hall. Both who are in which constantly completely flustered in their everyday lives coming from two different spectrum's because Alvy is the smart one and Annie is the silly pot smoker who doesn't necessarily operate on Alvy's level of intellect.<br/><br/>Primarily however, the films main idea is about Woody Allen's perspective of true love and its tremendous roller-coaster effects. The film does a great job breaking the 4th wall and a prime example is when we get a 5 minute monologue of Allen's character talking to the audience in the opening shot. You get a very true sense of connection when you're watching because you feel like you're a part of what's happening, not just an observer who witnesses two lovers breaking each other's hearts. Also, I feel as if this film is about the transformation of characters as they muck through their way in a love bound relationship. Annie starts out as this floozy character who ends up, after being in a relationship with Alvy, becomes this attractive high paying singer artist who gets all the attention. Both characters are transformed and in the end of the film find happiness in their earthly friendship they both share.<br/><br/>Cinematography speaking, this film is executed through extremely long takes and intimate character proxemics, and constant humor dialogue which wraps the film in a bullet proof romantic comedy blanket which makes every moment an enjoyable sit-through."

","The first Woody Allen movie I've ever seen and i was not disappointment. The film is not a typical love story in which the protagonist does not end up with women (Annie). At the beginning of the film, Alvy (Woody) tells a joke about how he would not want to belong in a club that would accept him. This line could summarize the theme of the movie. The movie then becomes about the journey that Alvy takes and not about the outcome. At the beginning of the story Alvy tells us the outcome of the relationship. The writing of the film is very corky and it is presented in the same way. Woody Allen breaks the fourth wall by speaking to the audience directly. Alvy says what we are thinking during the scenes in which he breaks the fourth wall. The scenes are done in a slow pace which is a great change from the modern romantic films. I usually don't look romantic film, but this film not an average romantic film. The scene in which the couple is trying to cook the lobster and then starts chasing it around the kitchen is very believable ONLY because the Keaton and Allen film relationship. AT the beginning of the film, Alvy is standing in a movie line, while a pompous film teacher talks about the meaning of a certain film, and then Alvy is so annoyed that he pulls the director of that film, the guy tells the pompous teacher that he has no idea what he is talking about and he is surprised that he is a film teacher. The description does not make it justice, but that one scene is when you know that you are watching a Woody Allen movie and not a regular romantic film. I enjoyed watching this film because it takes a different approach in showing a romantic relationship."

","The film asks many questions, one of the biggest is, is it right to think you should ""improve"" your partner? Allen's character, Alvy Singer, meets Keaton's character, Annie Hall, through some friends. Alvy is much more of the intellectual type than Annie is and when they start dating he insists on her attending classes, and read books he suggests, and brings her up to his level. Once he is no longer dominant, he begins to feel threatened by her new found self, and she gets sick of his same old self. Which brings up another question, after your partner has ""improved"" you, do you owe them anything?<br/><br/>The acting is impressive, Keaton, who was awarded the ""Best Actress"" Academy Award for her role as Annie, deserves it 100%, she fills her character with a multitude of interesting emotions, and ideas. Allen, as usual, plays a fictionalized version of himself, and even though he is portraying ""himself"" he does a great job of it, filling his character with just as much emotion as Keaton does for hers. Something interesting to me, the film is filled with many jokes, many punch lines and comedic reactions, but there is at least one dramatic moment for every one of those funny moments. The film-making here is also top notch, the cinematography interesting and pleasing to the eye, the music is really well chosen, the production design creatively changes over time to subtly assist the plot, and the editing pretty much makes the film what it is.<br/><br/>I think that two jokes Allen tells in the film perfectly summarizes what he wanted to say. The first is ""I would never want to join a club that would have me as a member."" and ""Two old ladies are at a catskills resort, one turns to the other and says ""Boy this food is terrible!"" and the other says ""and such little portions!"". According to Allen that sums up his opinion on life, and relationships, its all full of misery and awfulness, and its all over much too soon."

","Annie Hall is a story about intimate relationships where Woody Allen breaks down the fourth wall, and talks directly to the camera, which at first glance appears awkward, but later conforms to the average movie goers comfort level when he pulls out a person playing himself from behind a life size cardboard figure. The story is shot in New York, and then transfers to Los Angeles for a short time. There is a comparison of each city's lifestyles which is very interesting. It appears that Allen dislikes LA more than New York because of his negative depiction of the bright sun suit his good friend wears to ""keep healthy"", and Allens negative rant about how LA always gives awards out.<br/><br/>The writing is presented in a way which conveys Allen's unique perspective on life, and his courage is displayed to the world when he compares the old Marx brothers joke by saying, ""Maybe I don't want her because I don't want to be part of a club who would have me as a member"". We can better understand his dilemma dealing with relationships. This frankness makes him more lovable and able to connect with. Another example of great writing is when the captions appear during a conversational scene between Woody Allen and Keaton. Most people have experienced this subtext when we deal with human interaction, so we can relate with the actual on screen translation of their thoughts. <br/><br/>The acting is some of the best out of all of Woody Allen's movies. The real life concurrent relationship Allen had with Diane Keaton (Annie Hall) helps to convey a true on screen relationship. The gift the audience will receive is a unique relationship we can all relate to. Perhaps most subtle is the performances by Christopher Walken, whom creates one of the funniest scenes ever to be captured on the big screen. It is typical for Allen to create awkward tension between himself and other women, but seldom has he written such an endearing thoughtful film which has transcended genre and time."

There really wasn't any slow moments, they kept my laughs/smiling going through the whole show. The editing charged the comedy even more so I think.

","I am a Woody Allen nut but you don't have to be in order to love this movie. Winner of four Academy Awards, the film brought Woody Allen and Diane Keaton to the top of mainstream Hollywood. Woody Allen was already a successful filmmaker and actor so when this film won 1977 Best Picture becoming a better picture than Star Wars that was all he needed to skyrocket to the top. Even now he remains an acquired taste and a sort of love him or leave him filmmaker. With Annie Hall the quirky barriers were broken down and the movie crossed over into a blockbuster film.<br/><br/>There is little question that Woody Allen is a great writer and filmmaker. Even those that don't care for his high brow comedy will admit to his certain brand of genius with a camera and his keen scripts. Along with Marshal Brickman, Allen was also able to secure and Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director. Allen chose not to be present at the awards.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is about the romantic adventures of neurotic New York comedian Alvy Singer and his equally neurotic girlfriend Annie Hall. The story follows their relationship from first meeting and the documents their rocky romance while making comments about love during the 1970s. Throughout the movie Allen uses different and innovative ways to tell the story from speaking to the camera, entering other people's narratives and even the clever use of some animation. <br/><br/>Of course just like the later Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Radio Days, Annie Hall clearly has its share of semi-autobiographical elements. The film is total Allen representing the his socially inept and pessimistic view of dating and people bringing all his New York raised bias to bear. The relationship between the two main characters is also autobiographical as Allen and Diane Keaton dated and had a breakup in the early 1970s.<br/><br/>Annie Hall gave Woody Allen a chance to capitalize on the success elements from his previous films with the subjects of anti-Semitism, life, romance, professional angst, drugs and death, his obsessive love of New York. Themes that would continue in his films until present day. This film allows his neuroses to take center stage and along with his pessimism and distorted memories of his childhood creates an alter ego for the screen that he refines and which the public comes to think of as actual Woody Allen. This film along with other Allen work combined with his personal life he had chosen to make public come together and make up the true but sort of fictional Woody. <br/><br/>Few movies come through American culture and stand the test of time. Annie Hall is a fresh movie today as it was 30 years ago. The comedy is still just as relevant and the New York centeredness still exists 100%. The film has transcended just a flick at the metroplex and is now taught as part of film history at most universities. Annie Hall the character became an iconic figure in the late 1970s just as Annie Hall the movie has become an icon in film and American culture."

Not only is the story line fabulous and so funny, but its structured so wonderfully, and arranged in such a fashion that it never gets boring. Aside from the comedic factor, this film is wonderfully crafted. There are many creative shots, and it is so wonderfully edited.

The refreshing candidness early on in the film gives us a hint of it's virtues of honesty and openness. Using his rather unique style, Mr. Allen almost confiding in us, the audience, talks to us as if we are amateur therapists and I found myself responding internally at his plight. At the same time we are taken to a lighter place with these potentially heavy issues of love as they pertain to relationships. I almost get a sense that these are the very issues that he holds close to his own heart and life experience, so much so that it allows for a relationship with this dominant character, beyond the sweet love story he tells.

","The film Annie Hall is not only the story of a couple's relationship of absurdities and irritations; it is perhaps about the teacher-student journey of such a relationship. But it is told mostly through the disjointed prism of Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), a neurotic comedian- writer obsessed in philosophical and intellectual masochism, in juxtaposition to Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) whose character expresses a flighty, yet passive acceptance in ""becoming"" every lover she is involved with. While Alvy impresses the importance of adult education, Bergman films, and his general concern of maintaining a certain level of New York snobbery in the face of Hollywood, Annie becomes his understanding, nurturing muse, who attends the night school courses Alvy wants her to take, often wears the same clothes/fashion sense that Alvy does, and with Alvy's encouragement, sings jazz standards in a club. <br/><br/>Although we do notice at times Annie's charming transparency of innocence and wisdom, the film does tend to weight the point-of-view of Alvy more heavily. Despite sharing each other's breaking-the-fourth-wall memories of family, former relationships, and views on life, a lot of Annie's interior soul remains unanswered, while Alvy's is more in the forefront. This is the story of Alvy, in any case: it is his inflexibility and private/public obsessions that seem to doom every relationship of his, without the ability to empathize and accept consistently throughout the course of relationship the ""growing-up"" of his muse/student, Annie. We also notice that the more Annie rebels or questions him (even to the point of the suspicion of a small affair Annie has with the instructor whose class he told her to attend), his fear and possessiveness rises in proportion. <br/><br/>Alvy's loss of ownership of Annie is at its height when she leaves him to pursue a career in music in Hollywood, as we see their love relationship crumble. It's not because Annie physically left him for another city or lover, but because Alvy remains steadfast as wanting to remain Annie's teacher. One wonders whether this relationship is the expression of Alvy and what he wants his significant other to be and enjoy - a sort of authoritarian, human behavioral project to mirror himself in his lovers."

","The film ""Annie Hall"", written and directed by Woody Allen, is a romantic film that wonderfully utilizes witty humor in order to depict a somewhat pessimistic view on life and relationships. This was the first Woody Allen film that I have ever seen, and it will not be my last. Within the first minute of the film, the audience is already aware that this is not your everyday predictable love story. By initially ""breaking the fourth wall"", Woody Allen connects with the viewer as though he's telling you a story personally, while his comical narration keeps you captive throughout the tale. In terms of writing and subject matter, Woody Allen does a great job in keeping the obstacles of the relationship believable and pertinent, while his undeniable chemistry with co-star Diane Keaton fuels their drive to comical genius. It would be a mistake not to acknowledge the fact that the first draft of this script was over 180 pages long (3 hours of film), with Woody Allen having multiple relationships all in a single story; this why the editing in ""Annie Hall"" is so important. Through his decisiveness and creative expertise, Editor Ralph Rosenblum transformed Woody's lengthy film into a 90 minute masterpiece, while still wisely incorporating long and enjoyable takes in which the actors simply walk, talk, and laugh. By taking a non-linear approach to the editing process of ""Annie Hall"", and adding a touch of reminiscence to the aura of the film, the editor undoubtedly played a significant role in turning Woody's humorous ideas into a visual art form."

","One of the most original films I've ever seen. Woody Allen uses a bounty of different techniques in the film to the point where it almost feels experimental, but he doesn't base the film around these techniques. He breaks the fourth dimension (in a very High Fidelity fashion), has the characters walking around in their own flashbacks, has subtitles detailing the characters' thoughts and fragments the story but he never overdoes any of the techniques. He makes them all feel natural and doesn't use anything for the entire film. In doing this it all feels very fresh and vibrant and moves at a quick pace. It's ninety minute running time was also quite nice with so many films running well over two hours these days. Allen integrates these techniques into a very relatable story of the relationship between the neurotic, self-destructive Alvy Singer (Allen) and the beautiful, intelligent aspiring singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). I found Alvy's nervousness and cynicism to be very relatable to my own personality and that really helped me to connect with this character and feel his emotions as the film progressed.

","The film starts with Woody talking to camera (This should fail but doesn't) about going through a mid-life crisis while reflecting on his break up with Annie (in the title). We see his early life living in a house under a roller coaster and a number of comedic moments here set the tone for the rest of the movie. We move on to see the latter stages of his romance with Annie as they get to the point where they can no longer stand each other and together through the ease of the relationship, rather than endure the struggle to find someone new. This should be pretty depressing fodder, but due to Alvy's mixed up nature and his knowledge that he is messed up but trying leads you to liking him when really, you shouldn't. Add to that a superb early appearance from Christopher Walken (who almost nicks the scene from Woody and sets the tone for every character he'd play from this point on) and every single director's trick in the book and this leads to the best written romantic comedy ever put to page that has yet to be bettered. <br/><br/>Whilst Manhattan is regarded as Woody Allen's love letter to New York, for me, this is his love letter to life itself. Free of some of the over-referenced, literate attempts at later movies, this is a film free of form that achieves effortless brilliance, and yet from details of the making of the film, you know it was anything but. The lines and situations are brilliant from the moment that Alvy Singer delivers his dialogue about his feelings on life, and his views on women, following swiftly with the details of his early life, including his first realisations that life will end, cut to the chase 30 years later and he is still worrying, but in spite of the worry and the despair you never feel depressed and even the bitter sweet ending (How many film-makers would try that today ...Apart for Kevin Smith?) feels wonderfully satisfying.<br/><br/>To say this is the best comedy ever written is perhaps overdoing it.

","Annie Hall is a story about two individuals. Both a like but have different personalities and faults. The movie starts off revealing the tumultuous gathering in which Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) and Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) first begin their courtship. The foundation of the plot is basically told through the eyes of Alvy (Allen). We get the first insight on who he is, how he carries himself, and what his main objective is throughout the film. Alvy is slovenly, curious, intelligent, and wildly analytical. The first scene introduces us to his first encounter with Annie Hall (Keaton). The beginning of their relationship is examined. Alvy is irate about the fact that Annie is arriving less than is scheduled. While he waits, he involuntarily has a conversation with 2 obvious fanatics of his work. Eventually when Annie arrives, he feels saved by her and the world is right as it should be. This could indicate that, even from the beginning, Annie and Alvy live on different times. He's on time and orderly and she is the sloppily late one from the start. But as the film progresses, we see a change occur; in Annie. Alvy appears to be the one with all the answers in the start, all and all, he is utterly clueless as to how Annie could be so different. As Alvy gives Annie some advice on how to change her life, it backfires. He grows jealous and wants to stay within the same place and never change. Alvy appears to be a flat character in this case. Where as Annie is more rounded individual.<br/><br/>She makes the changes to better herself and he remains constant and sullen about ""what went wrong?"". towards the beginning of the film. The struggle in this film is about being satisfied. Alvy is incredulous through the entire run and even goes as far as breaking the 4th wall to talk to the camera. The split screen effect gives the audience a two-sided view in how the story is told. There was even animation to justify Avly's feelings on the issues. As Annie and Alvy break up, he starts getting more and more voracious. Even to the point where he was absentmindedly asking strangers on the street for advice about what went wrong. He appeared desperate to find answers. When we reach the end, he makes one drastic change. He flew to Los Angeles to where Annie was and met with her for lunch. Annie had completely changed since we last saw her. She is more self-assured, defiant, and willing to speak her mind on any subject. Alvy doesn't seem to notice this until he asks her to move back to New York with him. She says no and leaves with dignity. Alvy, at first, is more than confused. Here he changed everything in his life to try and fix what was broken with Annie and it whiplashes him while knocking a little sense in the mix as well.<br/><br/>Alvy suddenly realizes what was going on all along. He was afraid of change. The message of the movie for me was sometimes when you want some things to happen, there has to be an understanding of where you are first within yourself."

","Merging those two ill-fated styles of comedic wit and sincere bite as seamlessly as any legendary comedy would, Allen's Annie Hall is every bit deserving of it's towering stature and as one of the high points in his brilliant career. Delivering scene after scene of convincing, multi-layered, and hilarious insight into our tragic hero's neurotic mind via a series of failed relationships, the analysis of the title role post, pre and during our negative one's crazed narration guides the viewer through an intensely enjoyable romantic comedy that is as unique and genuine as it is funny and tender. The blistering script will hardly ever loose relevance (except for those that just refuse to ever enjoy Allen's style) and the two lead performances are very real, accentuating the fast pace. In such a great career, it is still small wonder why this one will always be up there on lists with Woody, although the fierce originality he brought to the table that shines so brightly in this movie, eventually became his Achilles heel when that originality stopped being so original, and later altogether abandoned to an apathetic new generation. Hopefully his last rebirth of popularity via Scarlett will actually let him do what he does best on screen in this new one with her, albeit with much less force and gripping psychological relevance then the good old days used to provide."

"Incalculacable","8","0","0","29 June 2006"," That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
","""That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing"" is just one of the witty lines from the 1977 comedy classic Annie Hall starring Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. Woody Allen pretty much plays himself (just disguised) as Alvy Singer, a surprisingly but successful but neurotic comedian. When he meets Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), a pot-smoking unsuccessful night club singer, his world changes. Although awkward at first (you have to see the famous subtitle scene  hilarious), their love turns into a bitter sweet romance with well-balanced chemistry. It's entirely realistic  definitely not a fairy-tale romance.<br/><br/>This has made a significant impact on the film industry  Keaton's wardrobe alone (which were in fact her own clothes) started fashion trends. It was also very unusual in the use of techniques. It also discussed sexuality, fake intellectuality, Manhattan and death (all common themes in Allen's movies).<br/><br/>I don't want to over analyze this movie  instead, I recommend you go out and rent it now. However, I will finally say that Annie Hall is a movie certainly not to be missed. There is hardly any space to catch your breath from laughing. Allen and Keaton are glorious in their roles, and as much I was laughing I couldn't help but reflect on the bittersweet nature of this movie. Hasn't dated at all. Just a fantastic movie."
"EUyeshima","10","0","0","1 June 2006"," ""Polymorphously Perverse""....and One of the Best Romantic Comedies Ever
","It's great to see how timeless this 1977 movie still is after nearly thirty years especially after seeing Woody Allen's more challenging later work in the interim. But nothing beats a perfectly written script (courtesy of Allen and frequent collaborator Marshall Brickman) and the undeniable chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton in the title role. Scene for scene, it represents the most consistently engaging comedy Allen ever directed, and his wonderfully creative stream-of-consciousness narrative is filled to the brim with detours into flashbacks, animation, split-screens, fantasy scenes and speaking to the camera. It all blends into a movie that remains emotionally resonant and even bittersweet behind all the laughs.<br/><br/>There is little plot to speak of as it focuses on the evolving relationship between Alvy Singer, a successful stand-up comedian, and Annie Hall, an aspiring singer. Interspersed throughout are episodes in Alvy's angst-driven life - his shaky childhood next to the Coney Island roller-coaster, his desultory days as a comedy writer, his previous failures in relationships and marriages, his ongoing resistance to the West Coast. No longer playing just the romantic loser of ""Play It Again, Sam"", Allen is constantly kvetching in his search for intellectual fulfillment but finally finds his first true love in his diametric opposite, an unaffected, self-deprecating girl from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Their relationship is played out in clever episodes, none more so than their first meeting at a tennis game followed by Annie's reckless driving and a subtitled conversation on her terrace. It is really the contrast in their approach to life that brings them together and provides the impetus for their dissolution.<br/><br/>Whether she is playing herself or not, Keaton is an unadulterated joy even as her character sadly grows apart from Alvy. Allen is himself or at least his public persona and even manages a sense of unexpected pathos toward the end, especially when he desperately proposes marriage at the health food restaurant. There are so many memorable moments that it's difficult to choose a favorite - Marshall McLuhan at the movies, the lobsters, the sneeze into the cocaine, Christopher Walken's bit as Annie's headlight-obsessed brother Duane. A movie as perfect as this deserves a deluxe DVD treatment, but the 2000 release has simply a decent print transfer and unfortunately only the original trailer as an extra. The title of my review was actually the phrase Alvy used to describe to Annie her bodily pleasure in lovemaking."

","Woody Allen and Diane Keaton star in this film about two lovers who appear as complete opposites. Woody, who plays Alvy, is a man consumed by depression and sad thoughts. He is a Jewish man in New York who seems to have every characteristic possible of the stereotyped people in the city. He thinks the worst of himself, and yet expects the best of everyone around him. Diane, who plays his girlfriend, Annie Hall, is an upbeat girl from an upstanding family. She uses phrases such as, ""La-dee-da"" and ""neat,"" and she even tells a story of death as if it were a big joke. She is happy with the world, and sees no reason to be sad. However, both of these characters border on neurotic. Alvy has been seeing a therapist for 15 years, and encourages Annie to see one as well under his payment. These sessions proved an outlook on how each one deals with things. In a split screen, Woody Allen shows the difference in their thoughts on the same events. Eventually, Annie notices that Alvy and she are not the right mix for each other, and they split up. In the end, Alvy has written his own play where he gets to decide the ending of their love story, which concludes with them staying together. Interestingly, they might not have been made for each other, but she has provided him with the means of looking at something with an optimistic eye. Annie Hall is a film that broke out of the norms and the linear approach to film making. The actors began addressing the audience, even in fantasy sequences. They crossed the invisible line of the audience silently watching the movie as disconnected from reality. Woody Allen expertly combined the actual with the fantasy. He introduced the novel notion of speaking to the camera, and letting the viewers ""see"" his thoughts. There are people on the streets that know intimate details of Alvy's love life, his girlfriend's spirit leaves her body and talks to them as they have sex, and he is suddenly drawn into a cartoon when he mentions his love for the witch in Snow White. He shows the parallel between his jokes and his life story. The opening comic scene provided humor, with an underlying truth in terms of his life, such as, ""Those who don't know nothing, teach. Those who don't know how to teach, teach gym. And those don't know even that, teach at our school."" This film serves its audience intellect as well as humor which is an admirable quality of that time. Just after the conspiracy films, realistic endings, and serious links to history, Woody Allen offers a comical view which is said by his viewers, not by him, to be autobiographical. The original name for the film was ""Anhedonia"" which is the inability to feel pleasure. This name does not seem entirely accurate though. While Alvy initially has this inability, he has shown that with Annie Hall he feels passion (wanting her to experience love-making without the use of drugs), and he is sappy enough to end his play with the two of them getting together. The name was compromised, and rightfully so, since this movie shows how his anhedonia was cured by Annie Hall."
"nsutherland-1","7","0","0","28 April 2006"," Annie ""Miserable"" Hall
","While viewing the film Annie Hall there was no doubt in my mind that it was an actual autobiography of the protagonist and director Woody Allen. Although he uses the name Alvy Singer, and much denied it after the film's release, I am convinced that the film is a portrayal of Allen's life. Although I have no exclusive evidence for my conviction, whether the film was an autobiography or not isn't the point. The point is that I am convinced the film is autobiographical, which is what I consider to be the aim of the film. I believe Allen was trying to relay aspects of his life, while adding fictional twists to the film. These fictional parts were very evident; the ""if life were only like this.."" excerpts, the very well synced doubling of clips scene, and the subtitles revealing the character's thoughts.<br/><br/>Alvy began his life as a ""stupid little kid"". From the beginning I got the impression that Alvy is just a hostile person who over-complicates situations. He is always on the brink of making a comment, and only needs the slightest push to be sent over the edge. One of the finest examples of this was during a date between Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) and Alvy. The two are standing in line at a theater, and although the man behind them is speaking loudly, Alvy can't help but fixate on his conversation because he believes the man is speaking of things he does not know about. Alvy over indulges in people's smallest faults or what he believes to be faults. He is also a walking contradiction. He skews his views to be that which only favors himself. He pressures Annie to attend college, and when she becomes too close to a professor, he calls the institution stupid and states that it's only a bunch of mental masturbation.<br/><br/>An interesting aspect of the film was Alvy's profession. He is a successful comedian, yet he never indulges in his after show glory or any recognition he receives. This was hard for me to grasp at first, but as the film progressed I slowly understood that Alvy is inherently driven into his profession. Alvy is a cynic; therefore the comedic niche is perfect for him. I believe if he sought any other profession he would slip slowly into insanity or end up going on a shooting rampage. Comedy is his outlet.<br/><br/>The contrast between New York City and Los Angeles was incredibly obvious. New York City is presented as being gritty, over populated, and loud. Compared to other films of this time, I found NYC to very much cleaner than its usual trash littered reputation of the seventies. Putting this aside, when the film shifts to California there is a definite change in ambiance, physically and socially. It is sunny all the time, people are most commonly dressed in bright clothes, and the streets are immaculately maintained. As for the people themselves, they are vacuous and materialistic. The scene in which Alvy's friend, Rob, is editing his sitcom is a prime example of the cheapness of the L.A. lifestyle. He edits the show by dubbing laughs! By the end of the film Alvy is left alone due to the ""mutual"" break-up between him and Annie. Alvy quickly regrets the decision, and makes a not quite honest attempt to get Annie back. He fails, yet filters his anguish through writing a play about the botched relationship he had. Although I felt bad for Alvy, I couldn't help but come to the conclusion that Alvy is a ""miserable"" person, and no one wants to be with a miserable person."

","Written, directed, and starring Woody Allen, Annie Hall is a hysterical movie about a relationship that was never really meant to be. Allen plays a memorable role as the Jewish comedian Alvy Singer, who is unlucky in love and completely neurotic about the rest of his life. He falls for a beautiful young girl named Annie, played by Diane Keaton, but the relationship falls apart. Alvy takes the viewer back through time, to his relationship with her, his childhood, and his other romances, showing the viewer the wild and funny ride that has been his life.<br/><br/>The films flies in a variety of directions, flashing back at odd times, and the chronology of events is sometimes hard to follow. Basically, Alvy is from Brooklyn, a young Jewish boy who grew up with a pessimistic view on most aspects of life. Because of his interesting upbringing, his Jewish heritage, and his short, wiry frame, he grows up to be a successful comedian. He is married two times, both unsuccessful, and during a tennis match with his tall, bearded friend Rob (played by Tony Roberts), he meets the long-legged Annie. She gives him a ride home, and although he is terrified of her driving skills (or lack thereof) they are attracted to each other and develop a relationship.<br/><br/>Allen shows us bits and pieces of the relationship; high times, low times, and everything in between. Allen shows us a silly scene of the two of them trying to boil lobsters, and having some trouble since both of them are somewhat afraid of touching them. When one lobster gets stuck behind the refrigerator, Alvy tells Annie ""maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side."" Another scene, after the two have taken a break, is when Annie calls Alvy over to kill a spider in her bathroom. This scene shows both character's fragility, and how much they still rely on each other.<br/><br/>However, in the end, Alvy and Annie's relationship can never work out. Alvy is too stuck on New York, and Annie wants out, wants to try new things and move around. Alvy tries proposing to her, flies out to California to see her after she moves there. But it never works out. Alvy is eventually arrested for tearing up his driver's license when it is requested by a policeman (he tell the cop he has a ""problem with authority""), and goes back to New York, trying to forget about Annie.<br/><br/>Many people wonder what this film is about. Because it is so disjointed, and seems like more of a 90 minute joke than a movie, people have trouble finding a point to it. However, Allen seems to tell us something pretty valuable about life, and the human experience. Relationships are a part of life. They're funny, and heartbreaking, and terrible and wonderful. At the end of the film, Allen speaks to the audience, and tells us another bad joke about a man thinking he's a chicken and somebody keeping him around for the eggs. He says this joke is a lot like relationships. He says ""they're totally irrational, and crazy, and absurd but, uh, I guess we keep going' through it because, uh, most of us... need the eggs."" Despite how crazy and weird relationships are, and although they don't always last, humans need them to experience life. I think Allen portrays the idea of relationships perfectly in Annie Hall. However, he uses comedy to disguise the importance of this film. Despite this, it is still powerful, enjoyable, and certainly deserving of its various awards."
"sgreenan-1","Null","0","0","26 April 2006"," A Critique of Film and genre
","Scott Greenan April 28, 2006 New American Cinema Annie Hall<br/><br/>The film Annie Hall brings to light the idea that film can now critique other media, including itself. Set in New York City, it portrays not only the pretentious literati of the Upper East Side, but it shows the contrasting West Coast pretension of the film and television industries. These two enterprises are entirely different in medium but completely reliant on one another in the 20th Century. Annie Hall uses different filming techniques to critique on other genres of film. The cartoon, for instance, was a once innocent genre. Now, it is shown in a less guiltless light depicting the witch in Disney's Snow White portrayed with accentuated breasts and screaming about her period. It plays on the flashback technique in film as well. The flashback sequences allow the characters to travel back to the time being recalled and interact, not only with the audience, but the past characters themselves. The use of these techniques plays with a very modern idea of art not having to be conventional or even comprehensible at times. What it ends with is a film that is oddly romantic and representative of the common man. The common man is not always attractive, he is usually strangely quirky. The love of these two characters lies in the audience's ability to relate to them and not to gorgeous Hollywood actors/actresses. Woody Allen's film Annie Hall marks the time when we can begin to reference films as cornerstones of modern American expression, the new medium of the 20th Century, and thus becomes the very cornerstone that he is critiquing. <br/><br/>One of the first, most prominent references to film comes early on in the film when Alvy (Woody Allen) is approached by two men that he says remind him of the ""cast of the Godfather."" Ironically enough, this was a message to the audience that connected two worlds. Not only was a movie referencing another movie(s) of that decade, thus bringing audience members closer in relationship to the characters, but the cast of the Godfather (1972, 1974) also included Diane Keaton. Our ability to differentiate between actress and character was slightly skewed for a moment but passed off just as quickly. What is interesting is that we see the shift from the literati of NYC to the showbiz of LA, the two cities that represent the main characters. Alvy is the cold, dying island whose main inhabitants concern themselves with literature. They are over-medicated and psycho-analyzed when they should be out experiencing life rather than critiquing it from a distance. Alvy, like the New Yorkers, also relies heavily upon his language. His life is governed by his mouth and not his looks. Diane Keaton, however, belongs with the sun and the stars of LA, meant to be shown to the world on big screens. Her eccentric dress and singing ability allows the audience to fall in love with her innocent ways. <br/><br/>Woody Allen's film Annie Hall has this sense left over from the 60's. This sense is that love is free, that drugs are mainstream and natural. There are numerous scenes that make light of both marijuana and even cocaine. The sacrament of marriage and even religion in general is not sacred anymore. He constantly critiques his own life, allowing for the younger generation to see that there is indeed life and sex after 40. His love-life, however, should not be taken seriously as he did marry his adopted daughter (an act that reflected poorly in box office responses). The movie becomes a critique of his life and his encounters with women, including his brief love affair with Diane Keaton, herself. This account of his life is also critiqued by the film as evidenced when we see the play he creates in the end of the scene we just previously saw in the health food restaurant. This time, however, he changes the story around to see what his own life could have been. He is in full control of where he takes this picture and can thus swing the story around to his liking. He can add voice-overs, split screen, subtitles and the like to depict his own life. That is what makes this film great. It takes all the abilities of film and all the plot-driven and characterization of literature and somehow binds the two together in a modern piece of comedic visual artwork."

","Annie Hall happens to be one of those strange little films that can tell its story in a jagged way but audiences will still feel satisfied and most importantly, know what's going on. Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a neurotic Jewish comedian who is short on romance. He chronicles his relationship with a ditzy and fairly neurotic girlfriend, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). The film starts in the middle of their relationship, showing how similar Alvy and Annie are and at the same time how different they are. Alvy loves New York, as Annie wants something more, seeing that she wants a singing career.<br/><br/>Allen, who co-written and directed the film, uses film like it was never used before. His character, Alvy, often talks to the camera, imagines a scene that may include animation, text on the screen that show what the characters are thinking, split screens, walking through a certain scene from the past and not really having the thoughts go in a certain coherent fashion. But that is when his originality shines. He is able to mix all his ideas plus constant dialogue. I don't really remember a scene where there is a huge moment where the characters aren't interacting to each other or muttering because this is something that film really needs today. I think there are too many films where the characters just give so-called meaningful glares at each other  talking is what people do and Allen emphasizes that into his script perfectly.<br/><br/>The performances are a great breath of fresh air. Woody Allen, who is very much underrated as an actor is really good here. His character has the most lines and he really transforms into this character. If Allen is really like this, I don't know. One of my favorite actresses, Diane Keaton, is what we are missing from actresses today. She has versatility that is really hard to find and she shows how her resume can span from The Godfather to Annie Hall. Personally, I think Keaton has more versatility than Johnny Depp. So why did Star Wars lost Best Picture in 1978? Because Annie Hall simply had better performances, a greater insight of late-1970s relationships, and made every single scene quite memorable if not meaningful.<br/><br/>One thing people must know is that I absolutely hate romantic-comedies. Watching a romantic comedy to me is like burning myself alive in the fire. But I rather enjoyed this story  it was nice, sweet, and surprisingly likable. I like how it was not told in the traditional form of how other films usually have done it. I like the addition to the split screens, the animation sequence, the ""talking to the camera,"" etc. Even though this film has those ""wtf?"" moments, I still happened to like it very much (yes, I loave it). Those are the tiny delights that are rare in today's film-making society."

","If you look upon all Woody Allen's movies, I still think that Annie Hall is one of the best. Every time I have seen it, it has opened for a new way to understand it. And simultaneously it is like a person you've known as a good friend, whom you like to see again and again. And it is in no ways made as a masterpiece. It is maybe good as a cliché of all what Woody Allen has made, and I think he has later repeated himself in later movies which are not so well known as this. The psychological syndrome named after Mr. Allen owes probably to this movie. What makes this movie to what it is, is really it's simplicity in the middle of all the many words which characterize the Allen movie and it's syndrome. Compared with ""When Harry met Sally"" it has something that makes it much more serious and less mainstream. This movie takes place in what is in a different world than where I live in. It is close to ""Take the money and run"" or better, ""Play it again Sam"", but a milestone better than that. ""Manhattan"" is a good drink but much more ambitious and artistic and therefore not as natural or down to earth as this: ""You are New York""!"

","I'm a huge fan of Woody Allen, and Annie Hall marked the beginning of my obsession. It makes me laugh every time I watch it, but it's comedy that doesn't rely on slapstick for laughs. It uses witty dialogue and surreal circumstances to achieve its purpose - and I admire Allen for pulling it off. Aside from this, Diane Keaton is a stand-out as the title character - it goes to show just how versatile her acting ability is, from The Godfather to this... Allen has been criticised in the past for using odd camera angles (such as the 'long-shots') and the like, but I think such techniques add to the enjoyment of the film. He has certainly created a trademark, even though he'd probably look back on the film full of distaste - it seems like that's the way he is."

","I wouldn't go as far as say this deserved the Oscar for Best Picture, but I liked it nonetheless.  It's entertaining and original, and like all of Woody Allen's films there are many memorable quotes.  My favorite is when Woody discovers a bar of black soap in the bathroom and says to Annie, ""What are you, joining a minstrel show?""  That line had me laughing for about 5 minutes straight!  I'm not going to be a snob and say I don't like low-brow sexual humor, but it's always good to see a film that doesn't rely highly on it--and ""Annie Hall"" is one of those films.  Even the jokes that contain sexual references are done tastefully and intelligently, like when the couple are trying to make love, but she finds the sound of airplanes flying by distracting.  Woody rants, ""What are we supposed to do?  Tell 'em they can't fly any more planes so we can make love?""  In other words, the jokes and gags in this movie don't insult your intelligence.  A person with an I.Q. of 30 would have a problem finding the humor in this movie.  The meandering plot structure, if you can call it that, gets a bit jarring at times.  However, there's enough entertaining moments in the movie to make it worth seeing, especially if you're a Woody Allen fan.  Some people don't get him, but I'm a neurotic myself, so his humor doesn't fly over my head. <br/><br/>

","Well, I thought I hated Woody Allen.  I didn't like his style, I didn't like his mannerisms, and well, there was nothing at all I could think of that I liked about him whatsoever.  I don't hang around a ""well-watched"" crowd so I haven't heard first-hand about his comic originality.  However, I am unable to say anything negative about him now because I've seen this flick and I am extremely impressed.  The aspect of this film that impresses me the most is the way the characters are portrayed and the way we see them change.  I wouldn't say the plot takes the back seat, but discovering more about Annie's personality and the way she comes together as a character is done flawlessly.  I like that Woody has no fear of confusing his audience with his changes in perspective.  I see this movie and I know it's hard for others not to make their own movies similarity-free to this one, as small as they may be.  I don't know the specifics on the originality of his methods or what was already considered conventional in comedy films in his day, but it is easy to see that his style is definitely his own, and it is funny. I want to type in some specific events from the film that I find remarkable, but I don't want to ruin the experience for you.  I just suggest watch it if you haven't already.  Why not, watch it again if you have seen it.  I don't even want to like Woody, but when you get down to it he's downright hilarious, and this movie is undeniable proof."

","In my book, there are two types of great films. One type is in the class, of say, The Godfather. This type of film is technically maginificent, featuring superb performances, wonderful direction, a riveting story line and is effortlessly entertaining. There is another type of film, the type that Annie Hall fits into. This is the type of film which I call my ""favourite"" films. They may not be as technically proficient as ""the Best"" films ever made, but there's something to them which make them irresistible.<br/><br/>Annie Hall, plotwise, is a pretty typical Woody Allen movie. It is a bittersweet romance between a balding, neurotic comedian (Woody Allen) and a sweet, if somewhat goofy (and younger), lady (Diane Keaton). The film focuses on their relationship from the time they meet taking the audience through some wonderful setpieces on the way. Annie's family is somewhat eccentric, for example, leading to a wonderful (and slightly Deer Hunter-esque) scene with Christopher Walken. The parties she attends are also something new for Alvin (Woody's character) leading to more moments of comic genius (an age old type of comedy- the comedy of manners- with a 1970s spin).<br/><br/>Arguably Allen's best film, Annie Hall is immediately accessible to the non-Woody fan. His use of innovative techniques (for the 1970s) can be admired by even the most stern of critics- and used in conjunction with the wonderful performances and some of the funniest one-liners to have graced celluloid, Allen creates his masterpiece. Keaton is superb as Hall, obviously inspiring performances for female comediennes everywhere for years to comes (Phoebe's character from Friends, is a direct homage to Annie Hall). Allen's tried and tested neurosis is wonderfully appealing here melting even the coldest of hearts.<br/><br/>In this reviewer's opinion, Annie Hall is one of the finest romcoms ever made, and certainly the most innovative. Even the uncharacteristic (for a romcom) ending feels upbeat and enriching. A film that cries out to be seen, Annie Hall holds a place in my heart- which is more than can be said about some of Allen's most recent work, or some of the pretender's to the throne of Annie Hall."

","This is no doubt an intelligent and innovating movie with a strong cast, but like most Woody Allen movies, at times it can be a little annoying. The movie is like one big conversation and along the conversations you see slowly a plot moving. Maybe that is where its strength and its weakness lies.<br/><br/>Woody Allen's Character 'Alvy Singer' is a neurotic comedian who is very cynical about life. This shines through in every conversation and demonstrates a particular type of humor which I personally liked, but you may find annoying.<br/><br/>Diane Keaton plays the character 'Annie Hall', who gets involved with Alvy and has very interesting and plausible character development along the way. Not like the usual I like him - I Like him not - I Like him again, but in my opinion much closer to real life.<br/><br/>Therefore, if you like Woody Allen, see it, if you don't like him, leave it and if you don't know him, try it! You may like it."

","Woody Allen is a master humourist, few would argue that.  His jokes and observations are so well constructed that it would take more skill to mangle them than it would to get the laughs and recognition they were created for. Ironically, for me, Woody Allen actually proves this HIMSELF a couple of times here.  Wisecracks that seemed faultless on the page are reduced to being merely very funny by Allen's patented nervous delivery.  Some might find that this character makes his humour all the more amusing, but to me, neuroses get old unless they themselves are the target of the funnies.<br/><br/>The material is strong enough to ride these slightly irritating tics - what it wasn't strong enough to do was convince me fully that this was an authoritative take on modern social mores and manners.  This is only Allen's perspective, it isn't everybodys - and whilst there's nothing wrong with that if you're only looking to laugh heartily and repeatedly, it does handicap Annie Hall's ambitions to be 'more than just a comedy' somewhat. <br/><br/>
The structure contributes partly to this, often feeling as it does more like a string of improvised skits than a cohesive movie.  This is just one big Allen standup routine with a basic 'relationship' theme.  I see nothing wrong with that as a concept, but should it really have won Best Picture?<br/><br/>I don't understand people who say this film has such a broad scope. Infrequent references to drugs and minor celebrity to illustrate the discomfiture Woody has with the whole issue of 'belonging' aren't enough to qualify it as 'wide-ranging'.  Things like this do the opposite in fact, they are insular details that remind us that this is ""Woody"" we're watching and not some anti-hero that has the same problems we do.<br/><br/>What fools people into thinking there's more going on here than 'just' romantic comedy?  Oscars certainly helped (The main ones never having been dished out to so 'vulgar' a genre either before or since) and the idea that this was a 'personal' film from Allen.  It's not, I felt as removed from his character - if not his wisdom - by the end as I did before I began watching. Do I care if I enjoyed the experience and was greatly amused?  Not a jot. Just don't try to sell it to me as some kind of 'profound meditation'.  It's no more that than any other good comedy.  Good comedy does that, though, it deceives us into thinking it's opening up new vistas when really it's the audience that does all the spadework by turning the mirror onto society.<br/><br/>Allen's comedy is hilarious enough to be its OWN justification.  It doesn't need lumbering with any kind of 'social significance'.  We do that all too readily ourselves as an audience - as has been shown."

","Annie Hall strikes an emotional chord because it is real. The relationship isn't like some fairy tail where everything gets screwed then comes together nicely. It's a harsh look at life yes but it's always a very funny one. Woody Allen, who rightfully took home Best Director and Best Original Screenplay plays Albie, a nuerotic comedian who just can't seem to enjoy the things in life. He's constantly complaining and delivering these one- liners in such a fast- pace and he also frequently side tracks and talks to the camera. Diane Keaton who also respectfully earned an Oscar plays Annie Hall, a bit of a hyper girl who shares a troubled but special relationship with Albie. They play off each other well, giving a sort of distant yet closeness at the same time. There are some minor funny cameos by Christopher Walken and Shelley Duvall that really add to the substance of the cast. They all come together extremly well and never fumble over their lines. What stands out the most is the rapid- fire script, which never takes a break from Albie's constantly ramblings about death, New York anti- Semitism, his past, etc. etc. It's random at times, funny at times, and heartbreaking at times. But it clicks, it definitely clicks and this alone could drive the film. Allen's direction is a bit too straight forward to be considered on par with the script's brilliance, but it still holds out well and never gives up. It's hard to find flaws in something like Annie Hall, but sometimes the over- the- topness never quite works and the scenes feel a bit strained. After a while it just gets old and you want it to end. However, it's rare that films such as Annie Hall come along and they should be vastly treasured. 9.5/10"

","We all have moments where we are disheartened by the mundane nature of life and the lack of any clear directive of what to do.  The world is a very large place and we wonder if our actions are of any consequence, or is it all for naught.  While most of us are able to get past this depression and focus on pursuing a self-fulfilling existence, Woody Allen finds himself mired in morose thoughts and constant pessimism.  He has used this to craft a successful career as a director/actor, usually portraying characters as miserable as he.  Annie Hall was his breakthrough film which shows a philosophy of life uncommon to modern film and freshly unique.  It is full of characters that are endearingly flawed and presents a story easily identified with by the audience.  Annie Hall is a love story without all of the syrup pervasive in most `romantic comedies.' Diane Keaton plays the title character, a slightly aloof Wisconsin woman living in New York who seems to be in the process of `finding herself.' Allen is known for his references to philosophers/psychologists such as Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Freud, and the Hall character seems to be pursuing self-actualization as often described by these men.  Allen's character, Alvy Singer, helps her along in this by setting her up with a therapist and giving her books on death.  Indeed, as the movie progresses Annie Hall grows from an insecure/nervous type into someone who is comfortable with herself and feels a need for independence and self-determination. The theories of Freud and existential philosophy are present in most Woody Allen films, yet they are particularly emphasized in Annie Hall.  Perhaps because it is the story of a woman who is completing herself dating a man who has come to terms with the fact that he never will that introspective issues are so evident.  You can't really understand the story without at least thinking about the internal forces these characters are dealing with, and it's no coincidence that a courting scene features subtitles of the characters inner-thoughts.  This is a story as much about two people's relationship with themselves as with each other. Part of Kierkegaard's book Either/Or is set up as the journal of a ficticous character who is struggling to deal with life as a daily mundane journey.  There is a series of seemingly random statements that appear to have the general theme of you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.  To borrow Allen's style and paraphrase Kierkegaard, it goes roughly; `If you give your love to a woman, you will regret it. If you don't give your love to a woman, you will regret it. If you either give your love to a woman or don't give your love to a woman, you will regret it. If you laugh at the world's follies, you will regret it. If you weep at the world's follies, you will regret it. If you either laugh or weep at the world's follies, you will regret it.'<br/><br/>It goes on like that for many more pages, but I think that's enough to show the similarities between Allen's films and the existentialist philosophies of the 19th Century.  Somehow, Allen's stories alert us to the fact that the world is full of despair and sorrow, yet we don't become saddened by this fact but rather contented.  This may be due to the sharp humor of Allen but likely playing into it is the audience's realization that other people have the same general worries and insecurities as them. Allen's slightly exaggerated character indeed presents an insight into all of our neuroses and, at the very least, it encourages us by portraying someone even more messed up than we are.  He reaffirms the doubts and fears we all have yet at the same time shows how ludicrous and insignificant they are.  The use of humor in telling the story is key to this.<br/><br/>Allen's comedic style is one of dry wit and quick humor, and one quickly realizes that his films would be completely unwatchable without it.  It would make many people nervous to watch a humorless, insecure, paranoid man struggle unhappily through the daily grind of life.  At the very least Allen's sense of humor shows him as a charming rather than pathetic character.  A man who goes through life feeling sorrow for himself won't receive much sympathy from others, while a man who goes through life making fun of his self-pity will. Annie Hall seems to be representative of the baby-boomer generation and their coming of age in the 1970's.  Drug use and casual sex are constant issues in the film, yet it neither glamorizes nor vilifies them.  They're simply there.  Family and childhood are core themes of the movie with numerous flashbacks to Singer's life growing up under a Coney Island roller coaster and a visit to Hall's family in Wisconsin.  In a split-scene the families of Singer and Hall are compared eating dinner around a table and the importance Allen places on heritage, background and experience is obvious.  Here he is, dating a woman not as well-read as he, who comes from a rural family in Wisconsin.  He turns to the camera and he can't seem to believe it.  He's the complete opposite of this woman, yet he loves her. This really personifies Alvy Singer and portrays him as a realistic character to the audience. The realism of the movie is really one of its stronger attractions. Romantic comedies to that point seem to have been glamorized stories of two almost-perfect people falling in love.  Annie Hall took this convention and turned it around.  Every individual in the movie has at least one major flaw and their common insecurities allow the audience to make a connection not present in many films.  It is then, with the viewers drawn in by the `everyman/woman' characters, that Allen can get into deep existential philosophies without fear of polarizing the audience."

","The structure of Woody Allen's Annie Hall, while not exactly going chronologically, still makes sense and keeps things interesting.  We are shown how things turn out, for example the ultimate ending Alvy Singer and Annie Hall's relationship, but we never lost interest, and in the end I was still surprised to see the break up of the two main characters.  Starting the film with the end, and then going back into these flashbacks that don't go in any decipherable order really shows great editing, because as a whole the movie really does make sense. Besides the film being in what seems to be a stream-of-consciousness narrative, it includes a lot of eye-candy like techniques that seem innovative for the time of the film.  The use of split screen, for example when Diane Keaton and Woody Allen are at their psycho-analysts, showing the difference between their views of their sex lives, has been referenced to in almost every film class I've taken.  Also, the use of the mock-Snow White animation, and the double exposure of Keaton when she was high seemed very innovative.  The idea of using so many different forms of media in a film, and the fact that it didn't seem to be too much, is phenomenal.<br/><br/>Another strong aspect of the film is the direct address to the camera. Whether it was just Alvy, or a couple of a people from the line at the movie theater, it's like he's letting us know he knows we're there.  This also happens when he is going back to his childhood and just kind of watching. He's putting himself in our shoes as the audience.  It's obviously a narrative film, but because of these techniques and that a great deal of it was based on real life events of Woody Allen, it gives the film a pseudo-documentary feel."

","Annie Hall<br/><br/>
`Annie Hall' is a comedy about relationships from the point of view of the main character portrayed by Woody Allen.  Directed by and starring Woody Allen, `Annie Hall' addresses the issue of relationships and religion from a realistic rather than a romantic viewpoint.  Throughout the movie the director, Annie Hall uses many flashbacks and multiple comedy techniques which work together to form an extremely funny movie. Woody Allen plays a paranoid Jewish liberal in a quest to find a woman with whom he can settle down with.  When Woody Allen becomes involves with the character Annie Hall played by Diane Keaton the seem to be complete opposites but end up falling for each other even though their relationship is doomed from the beginning.  Therefore throughout the entire movie `Annie Hall' becomes a slapstick comedy about how they met each other, their lives before, and their past relationship. The filmmaker's decision to use flashbacks in order to portray Annie Hall and Woody Allen's lives before they were together and their past relationship provides a way for the audience to grasp the characters personalities and some background information.  The use of flashbacks also becomes important in portraying Woody Allen's family and their religious culture.  Woody Allen illustrates the Jewish religion in a way that is clever and witty regardless of the audiences demographic.  The brief animation based on the tale of `Snow White' during a flashback, shows Woody Allen's insecurities with women and how he tends to believe that they are all shallow. Another issue that Woody Allen takes on in the movie, `Annie Hall' is that of the working class and his beliefs that all workers lower on the social stratosphere shows how he believes himself as a celebrity and above all of this friends and love interests, therefore placing them as selfish and shallow.. A particular example of this is when Woody Allen and Annie Hall are at one of their friend's houses and they are asked to do cocaine. Everyone else engages until Woody Allen sneezes and it all blows away. The film does seem to take a turn at the end though when it seems that the message is that everyone is all selfish and shallow at one point regardless of their social status. Therefore, the film `Annie Hall' proves to be a success in developing a comedy that appeals to everyone who has ever been in a relationship, a just a slight bit neurotic."

","Woody Allen's Annie Hall is a disturbing yet funny comedy between two lovers and the differences that keep them apart.  Woody Allen plays a sarcastic, ego-centered, and obsessive over the misery of the world comedian, who meets Diane Keaton, whose character is based on the stereo-typical mid-western girl, who moved to the big city.  Though I felt the film displayed many loose comical stereo-typical views of the time setting of the late seventies. I can not escape the feeling that there is an underlining message of society's negatives during this time period of American culture by Allen. The story line is of this film a meeting between the two in which they engage in a game of tennis with friends.  Soon a relationship follows and the start of their problems begins.  Allen's character whom obsessed with death and many other enlightened thinking pushes his ideas upon her slowly smothering Annie till she breaks.  When Annie tries to confront Allen's character he only avoids her questions and comments by trying to move the subject to a sexual nature.    In the end, the two break apart mutually, because of his smothering and her desire to have freedom.  She lives in Los Angels while Woody whom refuses to live anywhere else stays in New York. His character's problems are the sole entertainment of the film and without his absurd behavior the film would be nothing but a sappy lover story.<br/><br/>Allen does a wonderful job in adding the desired affect a highly sarcastic, socially disabled comedian who fears change and can only be happy when misery is involved.  His use of direct confrontation in acknowledging the audience only adds to the film.  His use of it is not over done and usually unexpected.  In one scene he and Annie are standing in line for a movie when a man disturbing him about the work of another man is forced to hear how his Harvard opinions are totally off based by the man whose work he was describing.  Diane Keaton however is to Allen's character as yin is to yang. Though she makes the character believable, there are too many accruing stereotypes of the Midwestern girl in the big city.  Citing a specific example of her constant old sayings, like la-de-da, which drives Allen character crazy, along with the undertone of her intellect compared to his of a Jewish man in New York, which displays a stereo type in itself. Woody displaying an intellectual Jewish man whiles her being from Wisconsin she is a sub-cultured, basic educated woman. Other stereo-types which can easily be seen are of the people of the time period, mostly when the two visit Los Angeles, though these are found comical never the less the films subplot of pointing out all the negative stereo types cannot be denied.  In one scene at a party there are numerous stereo types of Hollywood, for example the people are all on drugs, or a more specific example, the shot of Jeff Goldblum talking on the phone to his spiritual advisor saying, `I have lost my mantra.'  Though this only adds to the comedic level of the film there is something to be said of Woody's own personal opinions possibly being sent through this film.<br/><br/>To paraphrase my point Annie Hall is a magnificently hysterical film, though its humor acts as a double edge sword.  Through the use of a cynical New Yorker whose only fate would seem is to be miserable, Woody Allen comically expresses his views of the total loose American culture of the late seventies.  His stereo types of this time period and the people of this time period though undoubtedly a riot also can be seen to portray his own views of this time as though he was that cynical and shallow of a man."

","You know, it's like that old joke, a midget, a nun, a whore, and Elvis walk into a bar and the bartender says `have you guys ever seen that movie Annie Hall?  It rules!'  Or something like that.  That can probably sum up any review of this movie, but I suppose I should do a little more.  At its simplest, Annie Hall is a movie about an off and on romance between Woody Allen and Dianne Keeton.  Allen is a neurotic comedian and Keeton is a small town girl from Wisconsin living in New York City.  The romance is great; the tension is real from the first awkward conversation after their tennis match to their final fight at the health food restaurant. It's hard for me to write about this film, there are so many things done so well that I get lost.  That is how the movie leaves you at times too, it is told in an almost rambling way.  The chronological order of it makes very little sense.  We go back and forth in time constantly in the film and flashbacks are so long we forget they are flashbacks.  Allen may have been talking to audience qualms about this in a scene where he and Annie are in line to see a movie and a pompous intellectual behind them pontificates about Fellini's latest film and complains how it is too `indulgent', a claim that could be made about Annie Hall as well. The movie is almost an interactive experience.  You are brought into the movie.   The very first thing you see is Woody Allen (or is it Alvy Singer?) talking directly to you.  It's like if your friend was a standup comedian and he tried to tell you a serious story.  It is a serious story, but it comes from a comedian, so it is full of jokes.  This breaking of the fourth wall is just one of the many innovative techniques that this movie used. To list a few: transformations, subtitles with what a character is really thinking, animation, breaking the fourth wall (and NOT just by one main character), adult time travel back to childhood (interjecting adult selves into flashbacks, AND interacting with the flashback), dialogue between two voiceovers, and conversation between split screens.  Just to name a few. The biggest innovation for me however is the successful intermingling of drama and comedy.  There are times in the movie when you don't know whether to laugh or cry.  Maybe that is just a more accurate view of real life than most films will give you, or maybe it's just Woody Allen's own experience. There is no doubt that the film is at least semi-autobiographical, Diane Keeton and Woody Allen dated before the making of this film, her real name was Diane Hall, and she did have a Grammy Hall, and Woody Allen did play somewhat of a mentor role to Keeton.  Speaking of the mentor role, that is another major part of the movie.  When Alvy meets Annie, she is a ditsy Midwestern girl, but by the end of the film Alvy has helped her mature and sophisticate.  So much so, that she eventually can't deal with his refusing to grow out of his insecure shell.  In the end, the movie is just a look back at why a relationship didn't work out, but it is not only applicable to Allen/Singer's own relationships, but it is indeed a problem relevant to modern urban society as a whole and it is a revealing look into the psyche of not only one man, but of people in general through this `indulgent' and self reflexive movie."

","Woody Allen's Annie Hall is an outstanding accomplishment in filmmaking that portrays a simple, romantic foundation to create a dramatic portrait of not only 70's pop culture, but of the human nature.  Throughout the movie, we see how the course of Alvy and Annie's relationship turns out and his past loves in his life.  Weaving flashbacks of his failed relationships illustrated the differences between his past and present with Annie.  The sarcastic humor and comedy not only enlightens the film, but the characters as well.  Woody Allen plays the role of Alvy Singer who is a neurotic, death obsessed comedian who has trouble with his love life.  His ironic humor and drama seem to make his love life incomplete and difficult to deal with. This holds true through different parts of his life until he meets Annie Hall.  Annie is portrayed as a beautiful cheerful person who wants more out of life, but not for sure what.  Eventually the romantic buildup begins between a pure Midwestern girl and a strong New York Jew who grew up under a roller coaster.  There likes and interests seem to oppose one another, but their love holds them together.  For example, Alvy has been seeing a therapist for sixteen years where Annie only needed one session.  Annie wants to pursue her singing career where Alvy is a withdrawn rascal.  The times they spend together seem never-ending as their happiness together seems to increase by the moment.  By the end, Annie enlightens Alvy's life for only a short moment as his selfishness and conceded persona shows him how relationships are a win-loose situation.  You try to give the best of yourself and take the bad features of the other in small doses.  Alvy also learns that certain times and actions with a person can only last once. When Annie and Alvy were struggling with the live lobsters on the floor, they both were laughing and having a great time.  After they broke up, Alvy unsuccessfully recreates the live lobsters on the floor with an uninterested girl illustrating no laughter or comedy.  Even though their love was solid at times, their differences were too strong to continue the relationship. Annie was just too alive for Alvy portrayed by her love for the Los Angles weather compared to Alvy's rejection to leave dreary New York. Eventually, their relationship ends quietly as they part on their own paths.  The story does not end like a fairy tale like Alvy dreamed it would be, but he learns to deal with his failure and other relationships in his life.  Alvy's slapstick behavior combined with romantic relationships did not work shown through different stages of his life.  Annie and Alvy seemed perfect for each other throughout their relationship, but also terrible for each other in ways already explained.  This is a story not completely about a relationship between two people, but also on drugs, East Coast/West Coast rivalry, human nature, and religion which makes Annie Hall a masterpiece."

","One of the aspects in film that always amazes me is the relationship between those who take the screen and those behind.  From the make-up artists beautifying the actress to the lighting crew casting that perfect mysterious shadow, so much goes on unnoticed from an audience standpoint.  What is most amazing is the fact that with work shifts of over 12 hours a day for a duration of six to nine months that cast and crew do not argue and resort to violence.  One of the easiest ways to avoid confrontations as a director is to cast your self in the leading role.  Over the past this has proved to be a daunting task. One success story is Woody Allen.  Allen is a comedic director who brings brilliance to both sides of the camera.  In the movie Annie Hall (1977), Allen plays a comedian by the name of Alvy Singer opposite Diane Keaton. Woody Allen made directing history with the scene where both characters have a flirtatious chat that is subtitled with what each other's honest opinion is about each other.  This humorous scene along with others helped jolt Annie Hall past Star Wars to win the 1977 Oscar for Best Picture. Multitasking is a skill that sociologists have proven to be more woman-oriented.  However, Allen defied the odds and was able to direct, write, and act in an effective and entertaining manner.  Not to be pessimistic but capabilities of another man finding this much success look gloomy in the near future.  Arnold Schwarzenegger is scheduled to direct the up and coming Terminator 3 and it has also been rumored that Sylvester Stallone may be directing another Rocky movie.  This pessimism just goes to show that on grounds where athletic glory is unnecessary for entertaining, that brains outweighs bronze.  If another Woody Allen were to surface, it would probably be in the form of a woman for this very reason.<br/><br/>Others have failed in the past and Stallone and Schwarzenegger will hold steadfast in proving that others will probably fail in the future.  Woody Allen is unmatchable in creative genius, especially since he had to battle the `handicap' of being a man."

","Woody Allen's 1977 film Annie Hall is a story of love found and lost in New york and Los angeles. Diane Keaton plays the title character, a breezy happy go lucky midwestern girl in N.Y. who falls for Allen's character Alvie. Alvie is a stereotypical neurotic Jewish New Yorker;  he sees a therapist, doesn't drive and never leaves New York.  The film details the relationship between Alvie and Anie from their first encounter which portrays the two as completely incompatible. Of course that means they must fall in love. Alvie's intellectualism helps Annie to educate herself which eventualy leads her to no longer need Alvie and she pursues a singing career in L.A. Alvie tries to win her back but their time is past and the film ends on a bittersweet note.  Allen was able to reinvent the romantic comedy with Annie Hall.  Prior to this film Alvie and Annie wuld have ended the film in a warm kiss and fade out, but Allen has a more bittersweet world view.  Some may call it pessimistic but that misses the point.  Allen sees romance as not only two people together but romance is also that which tries and fails. Part of what makes romance worthwhile is the is the fantasy.  Longing is a key component of love and at the end of the film Alvie's longing is what makes the film so powerful.  This film set the standard by which all romantic comedies following it are measured and part of the reason is that it identifies with the melancholy that is a large part of love."

Maybe modesty prevented the Academy from giving Allen the award for best actor too - although he was nominated. Co-star Diane Keaton won the Best Actress award largely on the strength of the material.<br/><br/>The world-class wisecracks of Allen make the thing worthwhile by themselves (""don't knock masturbation it is sex with someone I love"") and the fact that Allen (the director) feels he can do anything from subtitles (giving his secret thoughts) to going back in time to revisit his own childhood. He is like a stage magician, we sit not knowing what tricks he is going to pull next, applauding because his tricks are not only a surprise, but often fantastic too.<br/><br/>To complicate the matters even more, Allen and Keaton once had a brief affair (which ended before filming started) and we are left wondering if some of the scenes are not autobiographical. It all seems to make the soup that bit thicker and spicier.<br/><br/>Like Dickens, Lennon and Shakespeare, Allen is an author visited by genius in being able to make the everyday and mundane in to something epic. I can't explain it (certainly not in a paragraph or two), but I am glad it is there. There is 93 minutes of film in Annie Hall, but there isn't one moment of boredom or scene that falls flat. <br/><br/>

From here Woody graduated from the slapstick silliness of ""Bananas"" and ""Love and Death"" to the more emotionally and intellectually mature mature films he has been making since then (save one or two). The film takes on the major subject of romantic relationships in the sway of big-city life, and how two people who are perfect for eachother in so many ways can be terrible for eachother in so many others. The film stars Woody Allen as Alvy Singer and Diane Keaton (who won as Oscar for her performance) as the title character. The entire movie is centered around how Annie enlightens Alvy's life for a brief moment, then is driven away by his neuroses and selfishness, and how Alvy learns ultimately from the experience that relationships are a matter of give-and-take: you give the best of yourself and take all the bad parts of the other person in stride. If I'm making this film sound like a pathos-spouting art-film retread, I'm sorry. Because what makes this film alive is how Allen's whipsmart wit and eccentric characteristics color the film. The film is, simply stated, flat-out hysterical. Like the scene where Alvy produces Marshall McLuhan to dismiss a film-buff cineaste snob, or Christopher Walken's small, but hysterical role as Annie's space-cadet brother. Or the scene where Annie and Alvy struggle with a live lobster in the kitchen (later used as a payoff as Alvy tries unsuccessfully to recreate the moment with an uninterested woman interest after the breakup with Annie), and the famous cocaine sneeze. And what about Alvy describing a cockroach as ""big as a Buick"", Tony Roberts lecturing about his ""anti-aging"" head-sunroof, and a young Alvy losing all faith in existence in grade school (""If the Universe keeps expanding, one day it's going to break apart-and then where will we be?"")? Through it all, however, is the inevitable truth that Annie is just too alive for Alvy-characterized by her yearning for the Los Angeles sun as opposed to Alvy's refusal to leave drab New York. The bittersweet ending has Alvy mining his heartbreak for Broadway success, and meeting Annie for lunch one day. At the end of the get-together, we see, in long shot, Annie and Alvy say their goodbyes at a street corner. As Alvy narrarates, we see Annie, then Alvy leave our sight. But the narraration continues as we look at the empty street corner. The movie ends up as Alvy tells us the ""my brother is crazy, he thinks he's a chicken"" joke-a humorous anecdote symbolic of his entire relationship conundrum. It's this quiet ending scene that ends ""Annie Hall"", one of the funniest movies ever made, on a perfect note. The film where Woody showed that he was a master."

","In his prime, Woody Allen has made masterpieces. They mostly make us laugh, but then came Annie Hall, and we are so entranced by the fact that this is not just a comedy, but while being extremely funny, also has a deep message to it, with an amazing love story, questioning parts, and a wonderful ending. It becomes clear in the first 15 minutes of the film that this is an auto-biographical film, where Mr. Allen shows us his life as he would like to have lived it, where he could easily waltz back in time to re-live some of his more happier memories, and where he can make whatever he wants happen. But he doesn't abuse the privilege, as there is a story to tell. Through many unusual camera angles, various music breaks, and lots of humor, the plot unfolds, and we find ourselves most captivated by Mr. Singer's love for Mrs. Annie Hall, played by the lovely Diane Keaton, who won an Oscar for her role. This film can get a little confusing at times, mainly because it is not chronological, but rather skips around to many various points in the story until the very end where everything comes together in a finale fit for a king. This picture scooped up Best Picture, Actress, and Director Oscars, and is still hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time by movie goers everywhere."

","Annie hall is Film-making at it's finest. Annie Hall has everything great cinema aspires to be. It is more than worthy of the 1977 Best Picture Academy Award. First Annie Hall had some of the finest cinematography i have seen in a long time. The simple beauty to the shots, to me at least, were amazing and enthralling. One of my favorite shots of all is towards the end of the film where it shows Annie and Alvy, yet we see them through a restaurant window, with the chairs up etc. To me this is pure brilliance, they could've have simply shot it straight-forward  but the fact that it was slightly obscurred by the surroundings is beautiful. Second the themes in the film were great. How we all need ""the eggs"" or rather love in our lives. Also how the one great love of our life might only last a few moments. Third the acting was great. Diane Keaton was more than worthy of her Best actor, and Allen playing his normal dysfunctional character was great. TOny roberts and Shelley Duvall were also great. And lastly, and to some most importantly the jokes. Throughout the film's glimpses into societal issues, and themes was the great Woody Allen jokes. THis is definetly one of his funniest films. I especially like the Joke ""I'm standing next to the cast of GOdfather here,"" at first we think he's referring to the two Italians near him, but then we realize it's really about diane keaton. 10/10 a must see for everyone and anyone, If you like this i would also advise seeing: Manhatten and Love and Death"

And of course because I only saw this last night I am handicapped in enjoying its seminal aspects as I've seen them in so many other works by now.

The asides to the audience, the folks in the background who suddenly interject into the dialogue, the disjointed timeline replete with flashbacks, all interesting and demonstrate Allen's esemplastic abilities as a movie creator.

I shake my head in disbelief and walk away....how can you argue with someone who says that? I had an instant disliking to ""When Harry Met Sally"" because it was TOO MUCH like Annie Hall (and other Allen films).  Even the opening credits smacked of Woody Allen.  Since Rob Reiner is a talented director, I'm sure he made the film as a Woody Allen homage, but don't tell WHMS fans this. <br/><br/>So much has been said about Annie Hall by others on this site, and the general MOVIE LOVING public in general, that I don't need to repeat any comments.  The film is still hilarious and what Alvy Singer and Annie Hall go through seems real, despite some surreal touches in the film. <br/><br/>Allen's method of breaking the ice on a first date by asking Annie for a kiss so they can ""digest their food"" is absolutely genius, and I'm sure other Allen fans have tried this on their first dates.

"Valley_Of_Fire","10","0","0","30 December 2001"," Without a doubt the GREATEST romantic Comedy EVER MADE!
","Woody Allen's ANNIE HALL is my favorite movie of all time. Simply because it manages to keep the perfect pitch throughout it's length. The film is very funny throughout, without repeating jokes, or even going down the road to sick toilet humor. It is hard to say why I and thousands other people like this movie so much, I think its because the more familiar you are with it, the more you like it. Some movies, even great movies get old the more you watch them, but with Annie Hall, you get excited every time you know a great line or great scene is coming up.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with great moments, not surprising considering that the plot not only centers around Woody Allen's character's relationship with Diane Keaton's character (Annie Hall), but with themes of obsession, religious differences, loneliness, and if there's a price to pay for love. Every romantic comedy made since this movie owes it something (especially ""When Harry Met Sally""), and if you are familiar with a lot of modern sitcoms, especially the TV show ""Friends,"" you'll notice how much was derived from here. (For six million dollars a week, you'd think they could afford orignal scripts) There are thousands of scenes and lines in the movie worth calling attention to here, but if you haven't seen the movie yet, you deserve to see them without expecting them, so I won't mention them here.<br/><br/>Annie Hall won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Woody Allen), Best screenplay written for the screen (Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman) and for Diane Keaton's performance as Annie Hall. Her performance is without a doubt one of the greatest performances ever done by an actress, actually, but anyone, take notice of the scene where Annie tells Alvy Singer(played by Woody Allen) that she misses him. She starts crying, then hits her bed with her fist. She loves him, but is ashamed of being weak. That is such an honest, subtle, and perfect motion that I really start to care for Annie at that point-and so does Alvy, because we start to overlook her flaws (her carelessness, immaturity, and her naivety and so forth), and really start to care about her. Woody Allen also gives a good performance, but unline Ms. Keaton, he knows he's performing (when he breaks the forth wall by talking to the camera), but still gives one of the best monologues I've ever seen. (notice how his hands never stand still, yet never make the same movement twice- every physical comedian should take note of this, from Jim Carrey to Groucho Marx)<br/><br/>I first saw this movie when I was in 7th grade, and laughed uproariously at the animated segment, and all the one-liners and jokes (its amazing how with this amount of jokes, every single one of them works, none miss their mark) when it was over, I rewound it, and started over again. Now that I'm older, and hopefully more mature, the movie is even better, and the last scene never fails to inspire me, and the jokes that used to make me laugh, still do, with the added bonus of my also getting the more subtle ones as well.<br/><br/>Woody Allen is one of the all-time great film-makers, and this is his masterpiece in my opinion, there are no flaws in the script, even though it has flash-forward, flash-backs etc, etc. He makes one movie a year on average, and he writes, directs, and usually stars in them too. If there's one person who I'd want to continue working, it'd be him. If you want to start watching Woody Allen movies but are unsure where to start, Annie Hall is a great place to start, its modern, yet a classic.<br/><br/>If I haven't made the movie sound as good as it is to me, that is my fault, and not the movie's. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you go out and watch it now, making sure you don't read its IMDB quote page. Best to watch this movie, and be wonderfully surprised. I would be surprised if you don't love this movie. You've have to have a heart of stone to resist it. It is very funny, quite moving at sometimes, inspiring, perfectly acted and written. It deserves it's awards, and it's place on AFI's 100 best movies of all time (I think #32). Movies like this are the reason cinema was invented.<br/><br/><br/><br/>NOTE: If you like ANNIE HALL, here are some other great Woody Allen movie you might enjoy: Manhattan, Love & Death, Stardust Memories, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Crimes and Misdemeanors."

But Woody does, and you either love him or hate him for it.<br/><br/>This is a good Allen film, no denying it. That said, you'll know beforehand whether this film is worth your time. Already, in the mid 70s, Allen was starting to look too old to play a guy who wins the heart of a younger girl. (This problem only gets worse in later films where he insists on wooing Mira Sorvino or Helen Hunt.) Here, the age gap is still OK. Soon after, it's not. But any guy who can roll Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy into one line of dialogue, well, I'm OK with it. <br/><br/>It's snooty. It's intellectual.

Man, this is the hardest critique I've ever had to write.  How can I describe the joy and satisfaction I get from watching Woody Allen's masterpiece?  To me, ""Annie Hall"" is more than a movie.  It is an event, and experience.  From the very seconds the black-and-white credits roll, I feel an overwhelming sense of pleasure wipe over me.<br/><br/>Every joke is brimming with creativity.  In fact, ""Annie Hall"" is the only film I've seen where not one joke misfires.  The script must have taken many meticulous hours to perfect.  How Marshall Brickman and Woody Allen finished it I'll never know.<br/><br/>The love story between Diane Hall (sorry, I mean Annie Hall) and Alvy Singer is so true and so human that it has always touched my heart.  There are so many scenes that stick in my mind: the lobsters, I lurve you, the subtitles of the odd first date, the sneeze, the two dinners, Marshall McLuan, stopping to talk to strangers about his problems, let's kiss now, etc., etc., etc., etc.....<br/><br/>As always, Gordon Willis does a splendid job.  Each shot is spare and simple.  Gordon Willis was one of the few guys who could make simplicity into art.  The film is very beautiful.  It presents New York very well.<br/><br/>And of course, there are the fantastic actors.  Diane Keaton and Woody Allen give the performances of their lives.  Diane Keaton is great as a giggly neurotic who slowly, gradually realizes herself.  And Woody is fantastic as the Woodman.  The neurotic Everyman.  Those glasses, that devilish grin. His appearance is as funny as Charlie Chaplin.  In fact, you could call him the verbal, modern version of the Tramp.<br/><br/>This paragraph shall be about the greatest scene in the entire movie and in cinema history: the ending.  Woody Allen gives a humorous voice-over as we see him and Annie saying good-bye to each other from far off.  They walk off.  Then we see about one minute of traffic.  For some reason, I almost start to cry about the beauty of this scene.  Meanwhile, Woody Allen gives a very poignant speech about why we need love although it's silly and ridiculous.<br/><br/>After that I let the credits roll and sit in my chair still and silent and think for about ten minutes.

","This was Allen's first popular success and the first of a series of films that used what seems to be autobiographical material to dissect New York angst. Annie Hall seems to be a comparatively straightforward account of Allen's affair with Diane Keaton, who plays the part of Annie Hall in the film. <br/><br/>Both main characters comment on the relationship by directly addressing the camera or by stepping out of their bodies and observing themselves or, at the beginning of the relationship when they are trying to impress each other, by using subtitles to reveal what they are really thinking while we hear them saying something completely different. <br/><br/>Keaton's playing is initially irritating although, when the film was first released audiences were amused by her vacant manner, her erratic dress sense and her habit of trailing off sentences with `...oh well, lah de dah'.  Her later scenes after her transformation are more successful.<br/><br/>
Jeff Goldblum has one line, in what must have been his first film appearance. Sigourney Weaver also appears as `Woman in cinema queue', but I must have blinked because I did not see her. Marshall MacLuhan, the media guru also appears as himself. Paul Simon  has an amusing cameo as an oleaginous Californian who lures Keaton to California. In fact Allen is most venomous when he is depicting California and Californians. His identification with New York is total. Annie Hall says `Alvie is like New York: he is an island'. In retrospect this film can be seen as marking the end of Allen's slapstick period and the beginning of his long series of films that depict his love affair with New York, and, by implication, with himself."

","Woody Allen's breakthrough as a filmmaker is a loose, episodic look at a modern relationship and it combines the best of Allen' earlier films with a melancholia that would turn exceedingly dour in his later work. It's aided immeasurably by the winning Diane Keaton in the title role; she's fresh and funny and although the story is not told in a linear fashion, you can see her maturation and self-determination as the film progresses. Much can be made about Allen's vindictive treatment of women (and, in his later films, there's plenty of justification to criticize his views) but it should be noted than Allen skewers plenty of men here, most notably himself; he's always castigated himself in order to elicit your pity but this time there's a self-flagellation that seems hard, unforgiving and realistic. He also manages to make this one of his funniest films: many of the lines (by Allen and Marshall Brickman) are unforgettable. After `Manhattan' Allen's consistency would dry up (he apparently never recovered from `Interiors' and `Stardust Memories') but here his talents are in full bloom."

My favorite time he does it is when he argues with Annie about the phrase ""my wife.""<br/><br/>But for all it's humor, Annie Hall offers some really telling insights into Allen's head.  The speaking directly to the camera only makes the story more intimate and personal.  Alvy, Annie, Max, they seem like real people not characters.  Everyone is relatable, and I can see a lot of myself in Alvy especially.<br/><br/>Bittersweet but not sad, touching but not sappy, Annie Hall strikes note after perfect note.

","Long after its release, ""Annie Hall"" has certainly earned all the accolades it's received over the years.  I don't disagree with the Oscar attention it garnered in 1977, but I am surprised; given how Woody has always been an acquired taste for many.  I don't consider this to be Allen's best film (neither does he), but it certainly is one of his accomplished, entertaining films.  Here, Woody plays Alvy Singer, a professional comedian reflecting on his relationship with the title character (wonderfully played, as always, by Diane Keaton), as well as reminiscing on his own WWII childhood in Cony Island and how it's molded him into the person he is today.<br/><br/>This truly is one of Allen's most ambitious works from the 70's.  It molds together many different stylistic elements (split-screen, animation, directly addressing the camera, ""mental"" sub-titles), which is unusual for Allen.  His popularity over the years has been partly built on the construction of intricate worlds & relationships conveyed heavily through rapid dialogue, without an abundance of visual & musical elements to take in (with the exception of ""Manhattan"" and a couple of others).  What also makes Woody such a unique talent is that his films are so urban, the people in his work and the discoveries they experience do not regularly occur in Ohio or Texas.  That may make many corn-fed Americans understandably weary of the Woodman.  Many people also think they're seeing the same film over and over, Woody so often plays neurotic, Jewish New Yorkers whose occupation typically has literary or cinematic connotations, and the strengths of his films deal with adult relationships.  This all may be true theme-wise, but Woody rarely repeats himself.  He's always exploring different facets of the urban adult life.  Always very adult and very urban.<br/><br/>The narrative strength of this film isn't as cohesive as other films partly because Allen jumps back and forth time-wise, detailing his childhood, women of his past, Annie's own adolescence, as well as Annie & Alvy's first meeting and their eventual split.  ""Annie Hall"" has been credited with being the chief influence on late 20th century romantic comedies, and it's influence is quite evident.  Even if some scenes seem out-of-place or too long, they have their moments.  Who doesn't love the scene in line at the movie theater that culminates with the classic statement ""Oh, if only life were like this!""  One reason why Woody's films are so easy to enjoy is because he presents his problems and complexities in a comfortable manner, you feel as if you're participating in his world instead of spying on it, he's always quick to let the audience in on the joke (for example, the sub-title sequence).  If you love Woody's vernacular, you could pretty much love anything Woody does.  ""Annie Hall"" is a great laugh."

","You really have to hate Woody Allen not to like this movie. There are some who find Allen's Humor too drab or neurotic. Others feel that he's a bit narcissustic, casting himself as a love interest to pretty women. However, as Allen is quick to point out in this classic comedy, Narcissus is not a Greek god he most identifies with, he's more likely to identify with... Zeus.<br/><br/>This is a great piece of work with terrific comedic innovations, such as the scene with the subtitled thoughts, the flashback to school mates (tell them what you're doing now) and the bringing out of Marshall McLuhan to make his point (wouldn't it be great if life were like this?).<br/><br/>The acting is superb and the character's are interesting from Christopher Walken's (crazy brother)to Paul Simon's (personification of L.A) this film simply works.<br/><br/>A must see comedy, even if you hate Woody Allen, you may still be enamored with Alvy Singer."

","Woody Allen's comedy about a comic named Alvey Singer(Woody Allen) who meets a girl named Annie Hall(Diane Keaton)and fall in love. Its a brilliant comedy which certainly deserved the pest picture over star wars. It is my personal favorite film of all time. It is the best portrayal of a relationship on the silver screen ever. Very, well written, very well directed, and very well acted. Alvy Singer meets Annie through a friend at a tennis match and instant karma emerges between them. After tennis Annie needs a ride home so of course woody wouldn't let her down and offers her a ride which soon turns into going to his house for a drink and that's when one of the most honest and hilarious scenes takes place were alvy and Annie are talking and in subtitles below translate what they are thinking about what one another is saying and what they are thinking, I have to say that is the best written scene ive ever seen, in any movie. They soon begin to go out and then the brilliant story goes on it is very funny as it is touching and real. If you haven't seen this ingenious masterpiece yet I highly recommend you see this film. Even though most Allen films offend something or someone and a lot of people don't like him for this and the fact they cant watch his movies without making a comment I really think you should give this one a try and maybe if your a star wars fan, don't you want to see why it one best picture."

Woody Allen goes from slapstick comedy (the ""lobster scene"") to self-sarcasm to bitersweet romance, never forgetting to spout some often hilarious one-liners (""in the case of war, I'll be a hostage"").

","Annie Hall, a film from back in 1977 and winner at the 1978 Academy Awards of the coveted Best Picture prize, is a film directed by Woody Allen. It tells the story, or rather shows the viewers scenes from the story, of how Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) falls in love with and carries on a relationship with none other than Annie Hall (Diane Keaton).<br/><br/>The most innovative part of this film is its screenplay, so very unique in its randomness and in its straightforward quality. Allen isn't afraid to show exactly what Alvy is thinking, even if its means having him speak directly into the camera or showing his thoughts directly on screen. The film isn't about exciting moments and beautiful love scenes; rather, it's about two normal, abnormal people whose relationship is just as interesting as Hall and Singer themselves.<br/><br/>The direction, although it too won an Oscar, is rather simple, but just as direct as the screenplay is. Really, the screenplay is the only element that is complicated and unique, but Allen wants that screenplay and all that introspective dialogue to be the viewer's focus. This explains the lack of music and lack of flamboyant camera techniques.<br/><br/>For all the very, very funny parts of the film, there also seem to be a few large chunks of dialogue that leave the viewer scratching his head. The film isn't focused really, but I believe that it's focused in its blurriness. It focuses on Hall and Singer alone, not on a certain atmosphere; but what relationship does retain the same atmosphere throughout its entirety? <br/><br/>The film is so fresh in its exploration of all relationships, not just that of Annie and Alvy. Allen is obviously frustrated with elusiveness of pleasure, especially emotional pleasure in relationships between men and women. It forces the viewer to reminisce on both the bad and the good, just as Singer himself does, even though most of us may not be quite so innovative in our display of memory.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A-."

I would not classify this as either comedy or romance. It's an ode to the narcissist New Yorker. I will give some credit to Allen, despite my loathing. The camera work in this film, portraying the true grit and raw beauty of New York City, and the beautiful sunset on the beach. It was nice to be taken away from the nightmare that was watching the actual film. All-in-all, the most surprising thing about Annie Hall, is how it managed to win an Oscar for Best Picture."

","This won best picture? Was I watching the right movie? All I would need to write to explain what I thought about Annie Hall would be ""Neurotic and tiresome."" But I guess I can try to stretch that out a bit.<br/><br/>First of all, could Woody Allen have had a higher opinion of himself? You remember that ""What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation."" ""Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about."" part? That's the whole movie. Woody Allen's love letter to himself. It felt like he wanted to write a relateable version of himself but ended up just trying to convince the viewer that he's better than everyone else by explaining that all of his flaws just make him more genius. It began to physically hurt me every time he spoke. Stop stuttering, you weasel-person.<br/><br/>Another thing that made me hate this irritating gremlin-man was his style of directing. Why did anyone like this? It was so disjointed, every scene just hurriedly chopped into the next like Allen's boney little arms were trying to force together two puzzle pieces that didn't quite fit. It had no cohesion, there was no flow to this movie. I guess he might have been trying to make the film feel neurotic like its protagonist? Even if that were the case, that just didn't work for me at all. It reminded me of my favorite film from this year, Birdman. That film was shot and presented like it was all done in one long shot, so it flowed together and the structure was relaxing. Annie Hall was the antithesis of that. Every transition felt like a collision. Maybe it was meant to represent Allen's use of the bumper cars to let out his frustrations. I think I've grown to hate this man on a personal level.<br/><br/>Films are a great joy to me. I love watching movies. Usually, even if a movie turns out to be bad, I'll still enjoy the experience. There are a few exceptions to this, however. Annie Hall is one of those exceptions. This film brought me no joy, it provided no entertainment. It was a chore for me. If this film was a banana, my favorite fruit, it would be black and mushy, and I have no plans to make any banana bread, Woody Allen."

","Review: This is yet another Woody Allen movie about a troubled relationship. I did enjoy the scenes when Allen and the cast were talking into the camera, but I must admit, I did get a bit bored with the whole film. The constant questioning about his love for Keaton's character, Â becomes a bit tedious after a while and it just seemed like a New York fashion show half of the time. The flashbacks of his childhood were quite funny, along with the lobster scene in the kitchen, but the constant questioning of there past relationships and there weird sex life, which relied on weed, takes its toll after a while. Anyway, I was expecting something better after reading all of the great reviews, but I did struggle to stay awake. On the plus side, it is better than some of the other Woody Allen movies that I have seen. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I know that I'm really late with seeing this movie, especially as I was 4 when the movie came out, but it's very relevant to nowadays as it's about a couple who has its ups and downs, which happens in everyday life. The childhood scenes were actually about real moments in Woody Allen's life which show what type of upbringing he had. Definitely nothing that I can relate to! Anyway, on the whole, the movie is a love story set in New York, like most of Woody Allen's earlier work, and if your into his warped sense of humour then you wont find it hard to enjoy this movie, but I'm still finding it hard to understand his wit.<br/><br/>Budget: $4million Worldwide Gross: $38.2million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there Woody Allen movies about relationships and growing up. 4/10"

Her Hollywood friends are into lines of cocaine and constant parties. The best ""gag"" of all is when Woody sneezes and spoils about $2000 of cocaine. Alvy Singer (Woody) makes love to several neurotic ""skinny"" women. He is a stand-up comedian and writer. He has appeared on TV and with Johnny Carson. It features a ton of ""stars"" like Paul Simon. Also future stars like Christopher Walken, Shelly Duvall, Carol Kane, and many more, all so very young. Allen carries tons of ""Jewish Guilt"" around with him. He eats an Easter ham dinner with Annie Hall's family and imagines himself a Rabbi. A doctor suggests that pork and shellfish might have made him sick (non-Kosher ""forbidden"" foods). Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) is kind of a ditzy character and can't get aroused by Woody's character unless she is high. What women find attractive about him remains a great mystery to me! It starts out slowly and builds into a comedic classic. Of course it will not appeal at all to Millennials and Blue-Eyed ""Wasps"". It's a acquired taste, just like The Marx Bros. and W.C.

","Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"" works despite some flaws mostly in Allen's direction. This is likely due to the fact that Allen wasn't entirely sure what the film was going to be about but the film editor Ralph Rosenblum was instrumental in putting all the pieces together. It doesn't matter how it was put together: the final product is terrific. I wish I could watch it fresh all over again. It's comedic scenes are unpredictable, Allen's one liners are often priceless. It is partly an autobiography (of sorts) about Allen that morphs into focusing on his relationship to Diane Keaton as Annie Hall. Keaton is tremendous here. She possesses everything a star actor needs: she's charming, pretty and smart. She captures the audiences affections early on and that is key to the film's success. ""Annie Hall"" is the only one of Allen's films that really feels human. The ending is truly touching, an achievement that Allen rarely was able to achieve (though he often tried very hard to)."

Allen and Diane Keaton really make the film work, their rapport is so smooth, easy and genuine. We want to see them tough it out together, because their good times are so pure and true, but we know that fresh infatuation has a relatively short shelf life and the characters' essential differences make a longer, more serious relationship impossible. We see it all in a string of short snapshots, an expert mix of vital moments that anyone who's been through such a whirlwind will no doubt recognize. Those early, sunny memories you won't forget and the later, stormier ones you can't.

","I am, unapologetically so, a big fan of Woody Allen's work. Annie Hall, directed by Allen in 1977, was one of the great masterworks of his career. Starring Woody Allen, and Diane Keaton in the titular role, Annie Hall presents the lives of socially awkward, incredibly neurotic individuals, who are perfect only for each other, from the beginning to the end of their relationship. Woody Allen always injects a bit of himself in each film he has directed, Annie Hall, however, may be the most self-actualizing of Allen's films that audiences have ever seen. Idiosyncracies and nuances commonly known to be those of Allen's himself, give the audiences an insight into one of the most famed directors of our time.<br/><br/>Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) has the only career he could possibly have, he is a comedian. Not that Alvy isn't intelligent, he is, or that he isn't capable of doing anything else, he would be, it's just that Alvy is an incredibly introspective and pensive individual who uses his own self-realizations to influence his comedy. At the beginning of the film, the audience learns that Alvy has broken up with the titular character and the succeeding film is his exploration of that relationship, in hopes to discover why it ended. Alvy is so stricken by the ending of his relationship with Annie because he truly believes that his 15+ years of psychological analysis has solved his problems which should have ensured his relationship with Annie would last. On the surface, the high-brow New Yorker Alvy, and the flighty Midwestern-born Annie would have no success in a union, yet, their peculiarities were such that they ended up being perfect for each other, or so it seemed. Perhaps it's his much discussed Jewish guilt or just his introspective nature, but Alvy just can't let go of his relationship with Annie Hall until he has come to a logical reason for why it ended. <br/><br/>The introspective nature which Allen used as a vehicle for Annie Hall was brilliant and surely added to the host of reasons in which Annie Hall took Oscar's top prize for 1977. Annie Hall does something movies rarely get away with by breaking the 4th wall. Annie Hall breaks the wall so perfectly because the breaks add to the film, rather than take the audience away from the film. The technical aspects of this movie make it a dream to watch. The film is done almost exclusively using long takes, which are gutsy, but suited the conversational nature of Annie Hall to perfection. Another great technical attribute of mention is the title cards to input English on the ""foreign language"" scene on the roof. The script in which Allen penned in cooperation with Marshall Brickman was pure cinematic gold. One of my favorite scenes of all- time is contained within this film; the scene in which Alvy and Annie are in line at a movie theater and a guest behind them is loudly giving his sanctimonious opinion of the film in which they are about to see. Alvy is unable to hold his tongue any longer as the diatribe continues and he interrupts the gentleman to give his opinion, point out the flaws in his argument, and introduce him to the writer of the source material to further prove how wrong he was. This moment, though it happened only in Alvy's mind, was perfect, because who hasn't this happened to? Speaking of relatability, Alvy's character is one in which most everyone can relate to. Though probably not all of Alvy's mannerisms are present in one person at any given time, there are certainly many idiosyncracies one can identify in themselves that is present on screen in Allen's Alvy. <br/><br/>As noted, I am a huge fan of Woody Allen's work. His ability to pull the worst parts of himself and humanity from his own being and put it on screen for others to realize they also possess are extraordinary. I can't think of any other modern director who nails the human aspects in their films like Allen can. Everything about Annie Hall works, even the parts that shouldn't. The split-screens, the breaking of the wall, the ""meeting the past"" it all works the way Allen puts it together. Has there ever been any criticism of this film? I'm sure there has been, I'm just not aware of it. It is for good reason Annie Hall won Best Picture, Best Director, a Best Actor nod for Allen, and Best Original Screenplay; and one doesn't even have to be a fan of Allen's work in order to appreciate his master work, Annie Hall."
"chaswe-28402","5","1","2","5 September 2016"," Two remembered scenes
","One is when Marshall McLuhan makes a personal appearance. No memory of what he said. I saw this film several years ago, but could only remember this scene, and when Woody turns into a Rabbi at the Hall family dinner table. The jokes come thick and fast, but they are not really very funny. American one-liners. They don't travel well; and some are quite old and re-cycled anyway.<br/><br/>It's highly self-referential. Embarrassingly self-pitying, I fear. There isn't a lot different between this Woody, and the unfunny comic he makes fun of. He used to write jokes for other comedians, and I suppose that episode reminded him of the tedious, unrewarding business. What he's doing here is putting us, the audience, in the place of the psychotherapist, and then stretching out on a cinematic couch and telling us all his problems. In fact, that's what he says in the opening scene, when he addresses the viewer directly. But are his problems of more than passing interest to the world ? Reminds me of Two-Way Blacktop, where the hitch-hiker says he doesn't want to know about GTO's history.<br/><br/>Still, I did watch it all the way through. Perhaps I was waiting for it to improve. But it didn't. Critics have called it dated, although I don't associate it with any particular date. Other Woody Allen films that I've seen are streaks better. The Purple Rose of Cairo is a very good, inventive, moving example."
"luke-a-mcgowan","8","1","2","30 March 2016"," Delightful and whimsical
","1. Its very easy to see the influence Annie Hall had on Larry David and therefore Seinfeld. You could smack George Costanza in half the scenes replacing Alvy Singer and the movie would run much the same.<br/><br/>2. This film is an absolute delight. Woody Allen's performance as the neurotic New York comedian with a constant ear for Anti-Semitism is actually quite endearing in its tiny 90 minute run time. That being said, he's a completely arrogant about himself and his city, and thanks to Allen's marvellous performance behind and in front of the camera, we can see just how his relationship ended.<br/><br/>3. That's what Annie Hall is really about; it is a black box for a relationship that crashed somewhere over Utah. With that in mind, no scene feels wasted in either establishing their relationship or establishing the breakup.<br/><br/>4. That scene where Alvy sneezes into the cocaine is one of the most hilarious unscripted moments in history. Apparently the test audience loved it so much that Allen had to put in fluff scenes afterwards to give them time to laugh without missing anything. That was a wise call.<br/><br/>5. Allen's directorial decisions are amazing - spots of animation and split screen and fourth wall breaking, but most of all the way he can bring his intricate screenplay to life is the most impressive. A director not intrinsically linked with the screenplay would have found it almost impossible to weave the overlapping dialogue together.<br/><br/>6. The screenplay is utterly wonderful, full of delightful gems like ""hey don't knock masturbation, its sex with someone I love."" <br/><br/>7. Dianne Keaton is a delight as the titular character. She's a cute free spirit who is both completely right and completely wrong for Alvy Singer. <br/><br/>8. The ending for the film is so perfect, especially Alvy's foray into theatre and how he manipulates events. His wry acknowledgement to the audience makes him more human than most rom com protagonists.<br/><br/>9. It is actually hilarious to see brief appearances by Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and Sigourney Weaver.<br/><br/>10. Annie Hall is a worthy Best Picture winner. Though I love Star Wars more, I weigh up what each film's legacy in the film industry is and I can't begrudge this little film. Star Wars has inspired lots of CGI crap and Annie Hall inspired Seinfeld and Meet the Parents."
"i-fraher","7","1","2","18 December 2015"," Annie Hall review
","Annie Hall was a solid movie. I just saw it for the first time the other day after I heard about it before and it had struck my interest. I thought the movie was pretty funny. Woody allen had me laughing with the things he says and how he says things. He's negative, sarcastic, and kind of a smart ass, but man does he get me laughing. I don't think its meant to be super hilarious but i found his character pretty funny to watch throughout the movie. The picture of the movie looked phenomena,l when i saw it i kept forgetting how long ago the movie came out. I wasn't even close to being born yet. I've always heard about this movie but i had really no idea or care until recently when i heard about it in class. A few people told me it wasn't good but i thought it was a pretty damn good movie. Diane Keaton is in it as well and she's solid as usual. I think she's one of the best actresses. The movie won academy awards for best picture, best director, best screen play, and best actress for Diane Keaton. I don't know how you can't like this movie but everyone is entitled to their own opinion. its a good movie to watch no doubt"

","Annie Hall, was absolutely amazing. best part by far is the narrative take, and interruptions by the narrator, who is also the main lead. other best thing is the questions Allen randomly asks passer byes, and the answers they give. hahahaha cracks you up. the acting of every-last person in the movie is so real, and you can see this happening. it has an impact because it is about a relevant thing and it stars real people, doing everyday things. when your watching it, you forget its a movie, its that good. and its poignant and thought provoking, the clincher for me is that its not about finding a love, but who he lost one and how to move on from that. as well as tackling a lot of other issues that were the main concern of the 70s"

","It's easily one of the most comical Woody Allen Films and almost everyone's favourite and very understandably so.<br/><br/>I have seen this earlier and now I watched it again today, just to review it and when you look at a movie you will see it completely and observe each detail. So now, I loved the experience more than ever. Woody Allen made movie before this and after this, but this stands as his own in every which way. This is where he began, coming to his own and showing us a film grammar that many of us were not acquainted with.<br/><br/>It's the relationship between Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) an Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) that the film is all about and how they stick together and even move on in different paths. Now, it's a relation of a middle aged couple in their forties and yet it's so innovative that they behave much worse than even teenagers today. They are immature, innocent, indulgent and running for their own egos making up their own reasons. It's all funny and so very innovative too. <br/><br/>Woody Allen makes us audience indulge into the film by talking to them too. It's those long monologues or those fast paced and stammering dialogues, and those intelligent innuendos. The ""Death In Venice"" dialogue was a great one to laugh at. And there are so many too, I don't want to reveal them all here please. It's fun to watch them and laugh at them. <br/><br/>Two superb performances, with great editing work done and superb dialogues and brilliant direction that is what makes it a masterpiece. There is a lot of incoherence and yet it's very very good indeed. Diane Keaton and Woody Allen are funny and cute while others have supported well. Look at the way Woody Allen asks the people in the film asking question on road side and that's a thing only he can do, salutations to Allen again and again and again.<br/><br/>It's a 5/5 for not so perfect film but it's one that will stay in the memory for long time an it will get you back to it for it's dialogue and for the Allenish touch. It may work for you, if you like romance as it is."
"stephenlovelette","10","1","2","30 June 2014"," Subtlety Upon Subtlety
","What sets Woody Allen movies apart is the prerequisite.<br/><br/>You must be a certain age to truly appreciate them. I think you need at least two decades under your belt before you can grasp the implications behind the character interactions, the political banter and all the cultural references.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is only the third Woody film I've seen besides Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine. And I like it just as much.<br/><br/>The plot is basically a self-narrated character study of Alvy Singer (played by Woody) during the time in his life when he loved Annie Hall (played by Diane Keaton).<br/><br/>This thirty-six year old movie holds up! I watched it with my Dad yesterday and we were both having a laugh.<br/><br/>It took home the Oscar for Best Picture in 1977 as well as three others: two for Woody himself (Best Director, Best Screenplay) and one for Diane (Best Actress).<br/><br/>Christopher Walken must be bummed because he was in two best pictures in back to back years (Deer Hunter nabbed the Oscar in '78) and hasn't been in one since.<br/><br/>What makes this film great is the humor and the style. I get the feeling that every beat, every complete thought contains some sort of joke. It's all about subtlety, nuance, irony and implication when it comes to the funny.<br/><br/>At times I'm consciously deciphering the wording of a dialogue exchange, and will give up because the discussion's moving ahead without me.<br/><br/>For example, there is a scene in which Annie and Alvy are talking on a rooftop, and subtitles translate the implications of each statement. I try to digest each sentence and corresponding subtitle, but can't keep up.<br/><br/>And that's how all of Annie Hall is: Packed with material and moving along at a lightning-fast pace.<br/><br/>The subtitles are only one example of the many occurrences in which the characters break the fourth wall. Alvy, Annie and Rob (Alvy's best friend) revisit the scenes of his memories in a number of ways.<br/><br/>Rob, played by Tony Roberts, is great. There's a scene where Alvy watches along disgusted as Rob orchestrates the laugh track for an episode of his sitcom. And, again, this is exemplary of the entire film, which keeps the audience chuckling ironically from a distance.<br/><br/>One narrative quirk that confuses me is an interaction between Rob and Alvy. Early on in the film, Alvy says, ""Don't call me Max,"" and Rob replies, ""Why? It's a good name for you."" For the remainder of the movie, Alvy and Rob refer to each other as Max. It's hilarious, and I'm sure it's written that way for a reason, but these types of stylistic oddities are scattered throughout.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the settings of New York and Los Angeles, and compares/contrasts the traditional Jewish and Christian families of the main characters.<br/><br/>I love how Alvy grew up beneath a roller coaster, and the scene where he's introduced into the psychotherapy that never seems to work out.<br/><br/>There's a smart scene in which the frame is split in two and the main characters conduct therapy sessions concurrently. In this dichotomy the monetary, sexual, emotional and psychotherapeutic health of each individual becomes a form of currency in their relationship. It's a fascinating, not to mention pessimistic, method of breaking things down.<br/><br/>The discussion with his elementary school classmates, whose hair is similar to his adult self, is nothing short of brilliant. They remain children in his mind, but morphed slightly over time to better reflect himself.<br/><br/>I bet that sounds complicated. What's not complicated is Jeff Goldblum's cameo. He's on the telephone at a party and says, ""I forgot my mantra.""<br/><br/>Larry David pays homage to the Wagner joke in an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. And that animation scene was probably very original filmmaking for its time, but if I hadn't heard about it previous to viewing, it would have blown past me.<br/><br/>The ending is fantastic. Like the rest of the film, it's nothing short of brilliant.<br/><br/>Hopefully Woody's got a couple good ones left."
"ThomasDrufke","9","1","2","16 May 2014"," love fades
","Annie Hall is filmmaking at its best. Its Woody Allen at his best. And its a romantic comedy at its best. Instantly from the beginning it reminded me of the recent 500 days of summer. Not only because it basically gives away the ending from the opening scene, but because it did a lot for the rom-com genre as a whole. It has a lot to say for life, romance, and even to a certain extent death. But really the trademark of the film is that love fades, and it is extremely difficult for people to continue a relationship for a long period of time.<br/><br/>Out of the small amount of Woody Allen movies I've seen I think this one might be my favorite. Allen is always good at writing characters that seem to work perfectly together even if on the outside it seems far fetched. Alvy and Annie don't seem like a regular couple in fact in real life I'm not sure their personalities fit. But for some reason it makes sense in the movie. The sense of realism that Allen brings to his characters is always refreshing. Everyone has flaws and sometimes in movies we fall in love with the perfect human being, when nobody is perfect, not even close. So when a filmmaker helps us realize that perfection shouldn't be expected for a relationship, you really appreciate the guts they have. Too often do we get our happy ending that isn't realistic at all.<br/><br/>As Allen tells us from the opening scene, him and Annie aren't the same as they used to be. Love just fades, and there's not much we can do to stop that. We should just all hope we find the person that the love is everlasting instead. I think Diane Keaton was the best part about this film, and for me she created one of the coolest movie characters of that time. For many people, the parts of the movie that see the characters jump back in time and flat out talk to people is the funniest and most entertaining scenes. But in my opinion its the only time that I was taken out of the film. The movie has so much realism that when you throw in supernatural like elements it distances me.<br/><br/>By the way the cameos from Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Walken were funny and random. The movie is highly re-watchable and is definitely one of the best romantic movies we've ever had.<br/><br/>+writing and characters<br/><br/>+Allen & Keaton chemistry<br/><br/>-weird out of place flashback moments<br/><br/>9.0/10"
"Hey_Sweden","8","1","2","12 January 2014"," Woody Allen's fresh, intelligent, and innovative romantic comedy.
","With this film Allen had successfully made the transition from comedian to full blown auteur, and here he employs a variety of techniques and gimmicks - even animation - to create an unconventional way of looking at human relationships, and the neuroses that can ultimately damage them. It's very much his distinct voice, as he offers many musings on many topics, not just how people relate to each other, but the whole idea of N.Y.C. vs. L.A. He offers some juicy roles to a variety of familiar faces, and the actors make strong impressions no matter how brief their screen time might be. Certainly he gave the role of a lifetime to the endearing Diane Keaton, who firmly establishes a quirky and lovely screen persona.<br/><br/>Allen plays Alvy Singer, a successful comedian who, through his friend Rob (Tony Roberts), makes the acquaintance of nightclub singer and aspiring actress Annie Hall (Ms. Keaton). The film charts the evolution of their romance and the various events that transpire to drive wedges between the two of them.<br/><br/>In the meantime, there are some absolutely brilliant moments, especially as Allen plays with the conventions of movie-making, sometimes falling back on that old tradition of acknowledging the audience and really *involving* them. Particularly witty are the way Annie ""removes"" herself from a bout of lovemaking, the cameo by Marshall McLuhan, the flashbacks, flash forwards, subtitles to indicate the characters' internal monologues, and split screen. It's then no wonder that fans consider this to be the actor / filmmakers' finest film.<br/><br/>Of course, it's also fun to play ""spot the familiar face"" with this large cast; the cast also includes Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall, Janet Margolin, Colleen Dewhurst, and Christopher Walken, and in featured roles and bits the likes of John Glover, John Dennis Johnston, Laurie Bird, Jeff ""I forgot my mantra"" Goldblum, Shelley Hack, Beverly D'Angelo, Tracey Walter, and in a long shot near the end, Sigourney Weaver in her film debut.<br/><br/>One will notice that there's no music score, but you'll hardly miss having one: the comedy and drama work well enough on their own without any sort of accompaniment.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

","Watching a film like Annie Hall is a breath of fresh air. An breath so fresh, it changes your outlook on life. Annie Hall is an unparalleled romantic comedy and sets a precedent for films to come for ages. With its scattered narrative structure and outrÃ© characters, Annie Hall settles right at the top of the list of romantic comedies that are actually worth it to the audience. Woody Allen infuses his peculiar, masterful script with different strategies and innovative methods of storytelling.<br/><br/>Allen's biggest ally in Annie Hall is himself. Writer, director, and protagonist. Allen invents his own style to create irony and make the adult audience laugh. He is wonderful at thinking up the most strange, unusual things that are hilarious such as eating soup in a house under a subway and the many Jewish jokes. Allen knows what he's doing, all aspects of his work is dynamic. The main character is a difficult person, who knew that difficult people in life could bring send such positive vibes to the world?<br/><br/>Humor. Humor. Humor. Annie Hall forges strength from the humor. The film opens with a mildly devastating thought about life, however, but it fits with the tone film wonderfully. Allen really captures the essence of life and love with every line that's written. The film stands on its own two feat so well because it's a mature, realistic, adult film at heart. Diane Keaton is as cute as a smiley face on a cupcake the title character and creates a dignified female character. Allen is genus, but you can't help wonder who was the real life Annie Hall that inspired this film.<br/><br/>Woody Allen proliferated the genre and film audiences expectations of romantic comedies. The beauty with Annie Hall is with all the crazy spins Allen puts on the genre into his short, clean film is that it never feels as weird as it actually is. It's a movie that still resembles a movie, and not an attempt to make something so far out there it's unreachable to the average moviegoer.

","Woody Allen is one of the most renounced comedy and romance directors around and iconised my many. His heyday was in the late 70s to the mid-80s and Annie Hall is often considered one of his best films.<br/><br/>Alvy Singer (Allen) is a neurotic, paranoid, pessimistic, left comedian in New York City, with a thing for intelligentialism and lives a life of romantic self-sabotage and the film follows his relationship with singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), from the start to the end.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is a dialogue driven comedy with a surreal edge to it with the ways it breaks the forth wall. Annie Hall is constantly witty with the jokes and dialogue exchanges between characters as it somehow finds the right balance between naturalism and comic thanks to the strength to the acting to making the writing as believable as possible.<br/><br/>Allen uses a simple direction style, using as few cuts as possible and many scenes were played out in long takes. It is effective for letting the comedy and dialogue play out because the actors could interact without breaks or disruptions. It made the performances more organic. But Allen does bring in some directional flourishes with the way characters appear in flashbacks and how a couple of times how to scenes play out at the same time in a split screen. Annie Hall is a film that has been referred a number of times in numerous TV shows such as The Simpsons and Family Guy and for good reason.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is made out to be a charming woman whom Keaton plays with ease. It is easy to see the appeal of this woman to men. But Alvy comes off being very selfish and self-centred despite his neurotises. He is really more concerned about himself and what Annie was able to bring to him. Annie was felt compelled to stay with Alvy.<br/><br/>As well as the theme of romance, relationships and love Allen does also introduces themes about culture, both low end and high end. Allen is critical of both, with how Hollywood functions and the lifestyle, particularly how TV shows manipulate audiences in a very unsubtle jab against the industry. He also takes on takes up the pretentiousness of pseudo-intelligentialism showcased by some of Alvy's set and he looks down on it, yet he is also a part of this set with his ability to over thing.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is a funny film that blends a natural, grounded situation that many people can relate to whilst telling it an unconventional way with its fourth wall breaking style and elements of insight into various characters minds in many different ways. It is a fine example of an excellently written script whilst telling a simple story. This is Woody Allen at his best."

","I really enjoyed this movie. It was quirky and funny and an overall great story about a dysfunctional couple who can't seem to stay away from each other. I thought that both Annie and Alvy's awkwardness was hilarious and in all honesty I though they made a perfect couple. I thought it was really cute when Annie moved to California and Alvy said that he would go over there and get her himself. I thought he was just playing around but he actually flew out to California to coerce her into coming back to New York. He even rented a car which he drove horribly, even worse than Annie. I also loved all the cool things Woody Allen did while they were filming. Like when he and Annie were standing in line to see a movie he approached the camera and started talking to audience as if they were also in the room. Also other things like when he and Annie were in bed and he wouldn't let her smoke pot before they made love and a ghost of her representing her mentality walked away and sat on a chair; he acknowledged the fact that she was not mentally there and talked to the apparition of her to represent that. It was just interesting the things he did to represent certain situations and how he made the audience feel apart of the movie and knowing his inner thoughts."
"StevePulaski","9","1","2","3 June 2012"," Some experience required
","It is a common feature of myself to allow some films simmer after I watch them, meaning taking a significant amount of time before I sit down and begin to review them. Woody Allen's Annie Hall is definitely one of those films that needs to come to a full stop before I can fully analyze it. Getting up from it, I was convinced that I had seen something relating to the concept of ""art,"" but couldn't quite magnify it in a reasonable context. I think I finally found the proper way.<br/><br/>The plot is paper thin, with characters who make up the structure of the picture by their eclectic personalities. Woody Allen is Alvy Singer, a neurotic, self-loathing comedian always putting himself on the lower end of the pedestal. He meets Annie Hall (Keaton), a beautiful, refreshingly different woman, one who dreams of being a devout singer, who seems to be just what Alvy needs; an outgoing, adventurous, yet too somewhat neurotic, woman, fearlessly different and shamelessly content.<br/><br/>Inevitably, Alvy's paranoia consumes him, and his angst towards people and society, which leads to a certain hesitation with dating Annie. She seems to be almost too good for Alvy in the respect that he is so jittery and paranoid, that she deserves better, and he deserves inferior. He explains that among other points through the film's most unique features. As a method to actually talk to the audience, Allen's character will provide narrations, give lengthy monologues to the camera, bravely breaking the fourth wall, showing us brilliantly crafted fantasies (one of the funniest takes place in a movie theater), and even giving us a well drawn animated sequence.<br/><br/>One can see why the film bested Star Wars for the Best Picture win in 1977. The Academy always seeks out the most diversely original and esthetically different picture, and they always try and tactfully avoid giving out awards to a big budget blockbuster, much like how The Hurt Locker bested Cameron's Avatar in 2009.<br/><br/>As a whole, Annie Hall is a delight, but I believe it's one of those films that will become better, at least for me, with age and personal experience. It seems that at this point in time, I haven't hit the proper notes to be able to personally connect with this film, in terms of being self-conscious in a relationship and constant fear of societal inferiority because of motifs. While I thoroughly enjoyed Annie Hall, and found the performances, writing, and direction and tone to be all of top notch and commendable status, the personal connection, which I believe the film depends rather heavily on, is unfortunately not present. I can see this being revisited optimistically in ten or so years with experience.<br/><br/>Starring: Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. Directed by: Woody Allen."
"dzuber32","Null","1","2","11 May 2012"," Woody is funny
","Woody Allen made a more very good film. Annie Hall is as innovative with voice overs, animation, fantasy, and the use of breaking the 4th person boundary. Allen makes us characters into his story by talking to the camera, telling us jokes, and sharing his opinions with us. I found the part with subtitles hilarious and laughed throughout the entire film. The characters themselves are so well defined that they feel real to the viewer. Great filmmaking. Allen is one rare individual in the film business, he can act direct and produce. Put him in a category with Charlie Chaplin and Orsen Wells, as the few that can do it all. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great made comedy."
"hall895","7","1","2","28 January 2012"," Woody being Woody
","Woody Allen, for better or for worse, is always going to be Woody Allen. He carved out his niche in film history just by being himself. Annie Hall is a film which he wrote, directed and starred in. The character he plays is named Alvy Singer but let's be honest, it's Woody playing Woody with all that entails, all the quirks that are part of the Woody Allen package. Alvy's a neurotic, Jewish comedian who calls New York City home. New York is more than home really, it's a big part of who Alvy is, the only place he could ever be. Alvy insulates himself from the world, the woman he loves embraces it. That woman is of course Annie Hall. She's a quirky, ditzy aspiring singer. Eventually she will set her sights on California. California? Oh no, this is something Alvy is just not equipped to handle. So the relationship falls apart. But we already knew that because Alvy told us right at the beginning of the film that the relationship was already over. Allen plays with time throughout the film, jumping from the end to the middle to the beginning and back to the end again. Flashbacks to Alvy's childhood shed some light on what made this man the neurotic bundle of nerves he has become. Along the way there are plenty of laughs but some serious moments too. This is not just a slapstick farce, it's a movie that's got some real heart to it. You can't help but feel for poor Alvy Singer.<br/><br/>Of course Alvy is not the easiest man to embrace so you certainly sympathize with Annie too. Loving Alvy Singer is quite a challenge. If anyone's up to the task it's the supremely flighty Annie. In playing the part Diane Keaton is the wonderful yin to Woody's yang. Opposites really do attract I guess. Keaton and Allen have wonderful chemistry, playing off one another beautifully. There are times when Annie is perhaps a little too much of a ditz to really take seriously but you remind yourself that this is after all a Woody Allen comedy. Seriousness is appreciated at times but certainly not always required. The film is not just one joke after another, in fact there are plenty of stretches with no jokes at all, times where the story is allowed to breathe. And simple though it may be it really is a very good story.<br/><br/>Annie Hall is not a film to leave you doubled over with laughter. Oh sure, there are some truly hilarious moments. Alvy's skewering of some pretentious twit standing behind him in line at the movies is as good as comedy gets. Allen makes use of all kinds of comedic devices, paying no attention to the rules most Hollywood filmmakers adhere to. In a Woody Allen film there are no rules. He'll break the fourth wall, he'll use subtitles to reveal characters' thoughts, he'll even toss in an animation sequence. Anything goes. Not everything works perfectly but it all works well enough to make the end result very satisfying. There are so many little moments, throwaway lines which are unimportant in the grand scheme of things but which add great flavor to the comedic stew. The guy who forgot his mantra? Priceless. There is the sense that once the movie settles in it could use a few more laughs along the way. It never quite hits the heights of that movie line sequence from very early on in the film. But there is plenty here to embrace, not least the two great characters of Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, portrayed so wonderfully by Allen and Keaton. Two great performers creating two unique characters in a love story only Woody Allen could tell."
"Red-Barracuda","10","1","2","5 December 2011"," Brilliantly inventive comedy
","Like many peak directorial achievements, Annie Hall was made at an artistic crossroads. It was the point where Woody Allen was coming to the end of his 'funny' period and beginning his comedy-drama one. This movie, is so good because it is a glorious amalgamation of those two strands. While on one hand its a movie that has realistic characters and acute observations about male-female relationships, it also still incorporates much of the visual and narrative invention of his earlier 'funnies'. Its essentially a hybrid film in this respect. Its central drama is played relatively straight but it is enlivened considerably by a fragmented non-linear narrative replete with flash-backs and absurdist moments. Allen often addresses the audience directly and even wheels on Marshall McLuhan in one inspired moment. The style includes standard romantic comedy, slapstick, surrealism and even an animated segment. Characters from past and present speak to each other, split-screen is used to compare and contrast, while subtitles reveal the underlying meanings in the double-talk that men and women subject each other to. Annie Hall is post-modern in a way that always seems to benefit the material. Its an experiment that doesn't break the test tube.<br/><br/>The story-line itself is very simple really with little in the way of major plot developments. Like many great films though the interest lies in the detail that is extracted from this straightforward template. The central narrative is basically about a relationship between a comic Alvy Singer and a part-time cabaret artist Annie Hall. In combining the humour with the autobiographical, Allen's film is by turns hilarious and insightful. And this aligned with the cinematic inventiveness is what makes it a masterpiece. Its not just a romantic comedy of course but a rumination on other Allen concerns such as New York vs. California and his views on contemporary culture. What makes this all so good is that he never gives out simple biased answers to any of this. For example, despite having a number of hilarious digs at California's expense, he has Annie head off to find happiness there anyway; while the central relationship doesn't have a happy ending, although valuable lessons are derived from it. Of course the reason that all of this works on screen so well is due to the performances of everybody involved but special credit has to go to Allen and Diane Keaton who both excel here. They have the requisite chemistry as well as beautiful comic interplay. While it almost goes without saying that the writing is top drawer; equally funny and intelligent, usually both at the same time. Allen has never produced anything better than this."
"Desertman84","10","1","2","29 October 2011"," A Great Classic About Relationships
","Annie Hall is a romantic comedy that stars Woody Allen and Diane Keaton.It was co-written by both Marshall Brickman and Allen as well about the up and down relationship of two mismatched pairs in New York. The film is also directed by Allen that makes Annie Hall the great ""Woody Allen classic"".<br/><br/>The story is about a Jewish comedy writer Alvy Singer,portrayed by Allen ,ponders the modern quest for love and his past romance with tightly- wound singer Annie Hall,played by Diane Keaton. The twice-divorced Alvy knows that it's not easy to find a mate when the options include pretentious New York intellectuals and lifestyle-obsessed Rolling Stone writers, but Annie seems different. Along the rocky road of their coupling, Allen and Alvy romance weigh in on such topics as endless therapy, movies versus TV, the absurdity of dating rituals, anti- Semitism, drugs, and, in one of the best set pieces, repressed Midwestern WASP insanity versus crazy Brooklyn Jewish boisterousness. Annie wants to move to Los Angeles to find that fame that finally does in the relationship but not before Alvy gets in a few digs at vacuous, mantra-fixated California.In the end,Alvy and Annie end up with different lovers.<br/><br/>This is of the best movies I have ever seen.It is a film that is characterized by great humor and great performance by both Allen and Diane Keaton in her Oscar-winning performance.Also,the movie takes a look at relationships at both male and female perspectives as well as the differences from each other and the problems and obstacles to make it work.Aside from that,the story consists of many arguments and reconciliations that both Alvy and Annie has had only to find out how two different people can never be together and sacrifices have to be made to make one relationship work. <br/><br/>Definitely,the movie was full of smarts and wits together with humor that makes the picture a great classic and the four Academy Awards it won for Best Actress for Keaton,Best Picture,Best Original Screenplay and Best Director not only proves that but cements its place in modern cinema."
"blanche-2","Null","1","2","4 September 2011"," One of the best-remembered films of the '70s
","In 1977, everyone was talking about ""Annie Hall,"" Woody Allen's film about a romance gone wrong. There was the ""Annie Hall"" look, ""la-di-da,"" and TV shows ripped off the lobster scene. Thirty-four years later, ""Annie Hall"" still holds up as a great Allen film.<br/><br/>Allen breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the audience. The film is shamelessly biographical - the main character is a neurotic comedian, Alvy Singer, who is well-known. Diane Keaton, for whom the screenplay was written, plays Annie (Keaton's real last name is Hall and people call her Annie). The two meet and make an unlikely couple: she's from the midwest, and he's a native New Yorker and Jewish, growing up under the Coney Island roller-coaster. She's an aspiring singer; he's been in therapy for 15 years. Gradually their differences overwhelm their feelings for one another.<br/><br/>The script is fabulous - witty, hilarious, charming, whimsical, and bittersweet. And the chemistry between Allen and Keaton is wonderful. Both are perfect. Tony Roberts plays a friend of Alvy's, Carol Kane plays Alvy's ex-wife, Allison, Paul Simon is Tony Lacey, and Christopher Walken is Annie's brother. His short role is responsible for one of the most hilarious scenes in the film.<br/><br/>The film has a very modern perspective - relationships are next to impossible but we need them so we keep trying. As Woody says at the beginning of the film: ""Life is full of loneliness, and misery, and suffering, and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly."" We just have to keep slogging through."
"jzappa","10","1","2","20 October 2010"," La-Di-Da, La-Di-Da, La La
","Annie invites Alvy up to her apartment for the first time. They have a drink and chat. Subtitles tell us what each person's thinking throughout. We see that what they're saying is not what they're thinking. More particularly, because they're essentially preoccupied with impressing each other and forming a new relationship, we see a dialogue wherein they're both too engrossed in assessing their own performance to totally partake. They censure what they're saying as they're saying it, and accordingly, their actual interaction becomes practically hollow. What makes this scene hilarious is the incongruity between what both people are saying and what they're thinking. Normally, we don't get such an advantaged spy-hole on a conversation. And watching this scene, we become conscious that these discrepancies between thought and speech surface along with the prospect of romance. The deeper connotation's that romantic relationships are somehow very different from friendly ones, that romantic ones characteristically involve deception on some level.<br/><br/>Alvy ruminates on his elementary school days, where there's an off-the-wall incorporation of the present with the past. We hear him narrate about his class as we watch the action. At some point though, the adult Alvy steps into the scene, intermingles with the children and teacher of his past, who then act like they're living in the present along with him. The wittiness here's rooted in the peculiar temporal absurdities regarding him and his classmates, who are hilariously children and adults simultaneously. And it nurtures vital issues about the connection between our childhood and adult actions, between genetics and culture in shaping behavior. When we hear the kids talking about what they've become as grown-ups, we instantly start to laugh in wonder at how they got from this to that. How do innocent seven-year-old children, with like cultural backgrounds, grow up to be so different from each other? What inborn temperaments and fusion of occurrences in their lives led to such wide-ranging identities? Allen proposes no answers for these questions, but he undoubtedly instills these uncertainties. They encompass the background feel for the rest of the film. To be sure, one of the key ideas of Annie Hall is our powerlessness to ever get a thorough grasp of how and why people change. Periodically, we're offered self-spoofing philosophical masturbation about this multifaceted subject, but never are we given an ultimate resolution of it. The insinuation's that we may never have a complete one.<br/><br/>Like Seinfeld, Annie Hall taps reflexive humor from everyday occasions: quarrelling about whether it's tolerable to enter a movie after it's begun; withstanding tedious cocktail parties. I can conceive of George relating to Alvy's slant on romance: He doesn't want a woman who'd want him. And mightn't Kramer have been disheartened as a kid over the expansion of the universe? Why does dialogue always seem more real in Woody Allen films? Because he doesn't begin conversations with someone arriving, end with them leaving, transposing trite formula onto an otherwise good story. Instead, it works to conceive variations, opening scenes in the middle of things, ending dialogues without prolonging them, without people straining to bring things to a finish. He keeps characters' words from delineating the sense of opening and closure. As well, many comedians kill jokes by giving too much or little information that gives us our grasp, or by either hastening or prolonging the pace of the information delivery. Consciously setting us up to laugh needs a sharp familiarity with a scenario, including delicate particulars about the vibes and expectations of an audience, then making them abruptly conscious of an unanticipated change, such that some initial notions about the situation are spontaneously changed.<br/><br/>Slimly built, anxious, rambling, bespectacled, wildly gesturing, highly strung, and a ceaseless wit, Woody as an actor is both familiar and personal, and with her ditzy proclivity for men's clothing, WASPy background and airy exhortations, fish-in-the-Manhattan-sea Annie is the spot-on counterpoint to Alvy's Jewish NYC valetudinarian. Though she's remembered more for her fickle naivete, it's Annie's obscurely morose tendencies---she requires pot to take pleasure in sex, her analyst proposes five sessions a week---that gives her profundity. And what gets us stuck on her is the breezy sweetness, idiosyncratic beauty and natural comic timing of Keaton herself. Whether she's playing herself or a variation on herself or what Woody envisioned, it's all her. Even that iconic look. And yet the word I believe best describes her performance is effortless. She simply doesn't hide her reactions, doesn't seem to have a fixed Method-style concentration on character, motivation. She's just herself in 1977.<br/><br/>Allen uses broad comedy, breaking the fourth wall and even a cartoon sequence to break comic distance and allow us to see from Alvy's point-of-view. It's an unassumingly compelling vehicle for imparting philosophically valuable ideas, highlighting unanticipated incongruities in each scene, using them to reap fresh thematic understanding. Joking's not subject to the same criticism as other exchange of ideas, and this makes it viable to persuade the audience to consider thoughtful subjects generally not dealt with. In so many scenes, nearly every one, Allen draws on absurdist humor straightforwardly to broach fascinating theoretical doubts, and gets the audience to contemplate them. Indeed, it's repeatedly the case that the raising of such questions is a central part of the film's subject matter.<br/><br/>Creating a stream-of-consciousness narrative, Allen uses an intellectual style of editing, but also a buildup of cutting based on the mind's distortion of time, multifaceted visual arrangements and stage-managed chronological length of shots to fuse the film's effect on us for a more concentrated, conceptual effect than eliciting our most straightforward, reactive sleepwalk through a standard formula. At the end, we're left with more questions about subjects like love than we had at the start of the film. It looks to be Allen's aim to point up that there are no simple answers to particular crucial questions about life, to cultivate our understanding of the complexities involved in grasping such complicated matters."

","Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) recounts his love life and how he failed with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). This film is generally considered to be somewhat autobiographical, though only to a certain extent.<br/><br/>This film has a lot of strengths. Appearances from Jeff Goldblum, Marshall McLuhan, and Christopher Walken... some cartoon work, some breaking of the fourth wall. Interesting subtitles. Allen used every gimmick available to make this film unique, and it won him some Oscars.<br/><br/>Personally, for me, I don't know... I like many of the jokes, but the material just doesn't touch me. I found the humor in ""Love and Death"" a lot more witty. Relationships are complicated and Allen sure does make light of many of the serious things that fail a relationship. But I don't know, not my film.<br/><br/>Despite this, I would still encourage you to see it. I think ""Love and Death"" or ""Sleeper"" are funnier, but ""Annie Hall"" has a seriousness to it that shows a more mature side of Woody Allen that was probably absent up to this point."

","Annie Hall is a brilliant movie with a very well written plot and a terrific cast. Some of Woody Allen's finest work, the film explores relationships beautifully, in a blunt manner that shows both the good and the bad of being in love. We get to see all the spirals of Alvy ahd Annie's life together, getting such a good feel that the characters truly become human, as we are watching two people who are in love in real life. <br/><br/>I did find that other characters were not developed enough, I understand that it is Alvy and Annie's story, but I would like to have seen more scope from the likes of Tony Roberts character, whose potential was never used fully, I felt. Giving these characters more time to shine would have made the film more realistic, cause having it focus so much on the couple made it a little dream like, it would have made sense for them to be with friends more. <br/><br/>The cast is all around terrific with load of great cameos throughout, but the credit goes to, of course, Allen and Diane Keaton. It is difficult to say that their performances were brilliant cause it's difficult to know how much of it was really acting, as both of them were involved with each other at the time, which really makes for great authenticity, they can be serious, but they also have fun with one another, and it's very sincere play. <br/><br/>Manages to be both goofy and meaningful.

Best Performance: Diane Keaton"
"khanbaliq2","10","1","2","17 December 2009"," Annie Hall set a new standard for romantic comedies, its name alone becoming synonymous with the sub-genre of the intelligent, New York-based romantic comedy.
","Annie Hall is perhaps the best example of Allen's early work, and one of his most popular films; winning numerous awards. In it against the neuroses of New York and Los Angeles, a Jewish comedian (Woody Allen) has an affair with a mid-western girl (Diane Keaton).<br/><br/>The film is a semi-serious collage of jokes and bits of technique, some of the former very funny and some of the latter very successful. A hugely appealing film, it was a box-office smash, and turned its creator, of whom it is very typical, from a cult performer to a superstar. Allen had previously been known as a maker of zany comedies; the director has described Annie Hall as ""a major turning point"", as it brought a new level of seriousness to his work. The narrative supposedly mirrors the real-life affair of the stars, who separated before the film came out (Keaton's family name is Hall)."

","Annie Hall was very interesting because Woody Allen broke the fourth wall by talking to directly into the camera, and other random characters in the film who happened to know his life. It gave the film funnier because those choices were so random in the midst of the story unfolding on the screen.<br/><br/>This film to many people is a classic because of all the moments Woody Allen shows in this film make other people think about their own crazy experiences with someone they were in love with and how it didn't work out no matter how much they tried.

"jpschapira","10","1","2","16 December 2008"," ""Write about what you know""
","""Write about what you know"", or so they say. In ""Annie Hall"", one of Woody Allen's first films, we can sense the application of that common phrase. Allen and Marshall Brickman wrote the script of the movie, but we can never imagine Brickman's collaboration or influence. I say this meaning no disrespect, but Woody is the man we've always seen; the beautiful neurotic we've learned to love and recognize in many characters he never even played (Mia Farrow's character in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" or Jason Biggs' in ""Anything Else"", to put to examples distant in time). And that man is the same Alvy Singer, the protagonist of this movie, to whom Allison (Carol Kane) says: ""You're cute"".<br/><br/>And how can he not be? A comedian who divides life between the miserable and the horrible, Alvy looks at the camera and talks to us, wondering why Annie (Diane Keaton) left him; trying to understand what he did wrong. So he takes us through their relationship, and we learn that once he tells Annie about his division of life: ""You should be happy that you're miserable"". We learn about Annie and about him, but mostly about him, and we instantly understand what went wrong. There are a million ways to look at it, but Alvy, an irreparable egocentric, passed his depressive view of life to Annie: he bought her books about death, told her to visit an analyst, shut down her social life little by little. <br/><br/>But that's not the point, because Alvy we'll never admit it, and he'll never understand. His prejudiced view of everything, his need to always teach the rest something and the thought that he knows better will never change. He tries hard to show us his childhood, which he revisits once in a while as if he was daydreaming-by himself, with Annie or with his best friend Rob (Tony Roberts)-, his previous relationships and a mix of what he did as a comedian in the past and what he does now. In a monstrous editing work by Wendy Greene Bricmont and Ralph Rosenblum, we share Alvy's disappointment in life. He looks at the camera in the middle of conversations so he can analyze a situation, and stops people in the middle of the street to look for solutions.<br/><br/>As I already said, it's in vain; and maybe Alvy's relationship with Annie was doomed from the beginning. We also get a look at Annie's previous relationships and we can understand what drove her to a man like Alvy (yes, he's a man in his forties, who tells us about being in the middle of a life crisis as he looks for explanations to what occurred to him). So if everything was lost, what is it there to find? Well, contradictorily, everything. <br/><br/>I'll tell you...The first encounter they both share, which involves a whole afternoon, is a lesson of cinema; of character creation and writing in a genre that exists no more. The romantic comedy we watch today and that I love is so different from this fantastic piece that shares its genre definition, that if you walked today into ""Annie Hall"" and they told you what kind of movie it is, you'd come out of the theater saying you've been fooled. <br/><br/>The psychological reflections, the moments of quiet observation, the scary plausibility of the performances and the risk of making something so seemingly autobiographical (that makes you hate and love a character/human being in different moments of the ride) and re- declaring it again inside of it make ""Annie Hall"" the masterpiece it is. And it's also a masterpiece because it's the essence of a cinema that has disappeared or is at least in extinction, and that Woody Allen tried to keep alive.<br/><br/>Never taking the easy way out, always in the search of an unpredictable surprise, the writer/director bet on characters, writing about what he knew, knowing that, that way, he could never go wrong. And he never did."

","This is the quintessential Woody Allen film and defined a generation of people at the time it came out in 1977, many of his later films repeat the same ideas and themes of this one. Great romantic comedy, possibly THE romantic comedy of romantic comedies. The film centers around Allen in his typical nebbishy character, and his romantic involvement with Diane Keaton. Very funny, great 1970's feel, really captures the mood of Manhattan at the time, a time capsule which feels slightly dated but in a fantastic nostalgic way, not in a outdated campy way.

I guess though one must hand it to Woody Allen for the way he done the film by telling the struggles of relationships in life and for his comparing of situations to the use of flashbacks to draw references. This film shows the differences between male and female ways, the dialogue is sharp and intelligent with references often to art and pop culture and Allen isn't afraid to show that most of these characters have strong liberal beliefs in dealing with social and political matters. My favorite line is masturbation is I love myself! The acting performances are good with Allen as a neurotic and nervous New York city comedian Alvy Singer who finds enjoyment finally with love by romancing a woman named Annie Hall a city club singer. I must say that Diane Keaton gave a bold and strong independent performance here with this role of Annie. Really this isn't the greatest film made, but it's good with a unique and intelligent take from Allen for the way he did it by flashbacks, monologues, one-liners, and even cartoon animation really a wacky way to showcase love and romance."

","This movie is thirty years old but stands the test of time, meaning that after all these years the movie is still watchable. Now why is is still watchable? Because it deals with the nature of relationships, a topic which transcends time. Also, the acting is wonderful, especially Diane Keaton's performance as Annie. Diane Keaton has to be one of the best comediennes Hollywood has ever produced, and Woody Allen goes the extra mile to show the audience the fundamental absurdity and irrationality of romantic involvements. Far from being some corny, superficial farce, this movie presents an interesting character study of a woman who undergoes emotional and intellectual growth while her partner struggles, unsuccessfully, to cope with the change. If you want to watch a movie about someone who changes for the better, then this is the movie for you."

","Annie Hall is one of the best movies Woody Allen has done. It's witty, intelligent, realistic, beautiful, touching, and unique. It toys with our concept of time, as we see a relationship and the beginning, middle, and end of it, not always in this order.<br/><br/>The screenplay, as in all Woody movies, is great. The romance always sounds so real- with its bad and good times, and no forced happy ending- that you root for them to stay together. The characters are amazing. Annie Hall is wonderfully developed. She's truly beautiful, sweet, humane and quite odd, which makes her endearing. Woody Allen is just himself, nervous and paranoid. The jokes are always thought provoking and incredibly witty and ironic. The dialogs are about as good as you can get; not just they keep you interested, but they're full of references to another movies and books and have a lot of criticism to our society and ourselves. The way the story is told gets you even more interested, with all the flashbacks giving you insight in who the characters were and who they become.<br/><br/>The acting is stunning. Diane Keaton, as Annie, gives one of my favorite performances ever. Her character is well written, but it's quite difficult to pull off. She can just get the right quirky, messy look,. with a lot of sweetness and beauty. She has an amazing delivery, speaking about everything in a light, cute way. The supporting actors are all good, but no one can get close to Keaton. Woody Allen, even if just playing himself, is particularly good.<br/><br/>The direction is one of the best Allen has done, with the hand held camera and his way of starring at the camera and saying what he thinks or wishes. The editing makes the movie much more interesting; it runs smoothly an it's easy to understand, and at the same time it helps you to get a full understanding of the relationship. The music and photography are good, but not remarkable. Overall, this is an obligatory movie for everyone, and what every romantic comedy wishes to be."

","The feeling in that ending scene, the irony of his casual attitude. He says, ""It was great to see Annie."" The feeling inside him that motivates that statement is closer to the opposite of the literal meaning of those words. It wasn't great to see Annie. It was a reminder of all that has been lost, that he has lost, that it did not all turn out okay, that the impossibility of love is no longer a terrifying nightmare of skepticism, that it is actually the truth. All of Allen's jokes come from that terror, that terror that after all, in the end, life, from the widest and most real perspective, is empty, and that meaning is thin and contingent and constructed, rather than intrinsic and independently valid. Life is divided into the terrible and miserableÂ…if you're miserable you should be grateful that you're not terrible."

","Annie Hall is a very interesting and very funny movie by Woody Allen. He uses a variety of techniques to tell the story. He uses animation, subtitles, cross-overs, flash backs and also talks to us (the audience). It is a huge accomplishment in film-making and writing. It offers insight to death, religion, sexuality, drugs, relationships, families, sex, college courses and even lobsters and bugs. In my opinion, this movie started the now very common romantic-comedies.<br/><br/>Annie Hall follows Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), a neurotic, over-sexed comedian, and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), a ditsy nightclub singer (who is a terrible driver). They first meet at a tennis match set up by friend Rob (Tony Roberts). In no chronological order, we follow the ups and downs of their relationship.<br/><br/>This critically acclaimed Best Picture winner is a very odd movie. Having been the first Woody Allen movie I've seen I can already tell he is an extremely influential filmmaker. His style reminds me strangely of Quentin Tarantino's style. <br/><br/>He uses animation, subtitles (which tells us what they are thinking, instead of saying (a very funny scene, mind you)), cross overs, flash backs and he even talks to us. Asking us our opinion, making us feel like we are really there, watching their relationship unfold. Keaton and Allen have great chemistry on-screen, which makes this so much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Alvy's views are very interesting, and sometimes very true. This movie is extremely funny, granted, it's not side-splitting. It's more subtle, but it is very effective.<br/><br/>This may not be everyone's type of movie, but it is a huge accomplishment in writing, directing and acting.

THIS work announced that Woody Allen would never again return to slapstick comedy, and would instead draw from deeply personal sources in the manner of other serious artists. It's innovative for his use of still camera shots that allow it's characters to leave (or never enter) a scene (yet you hear their conversation), subtitling of thoughts vs words, movies within movies, the use of animation within a ""normal"" film, giving the dialog to other actors on a stage, characters who leave their bodies and still carry on conversations, characters who break from the film and talk to us the audience, split screen depictions of different times or places with the characters speaking to one another across the splits, flash backs of characters that describe their futures...it's a superb break from what was expected. It's interesting on more than artistic levels, as Allen delves into references far beyond the mundane, and presents them with wit, humor, and awkward honesty. It's insightful for his honest and thoughtful look at how humans behave under different realities. ""Annie Hall"" is a masterpiece. (And watch for many lucky young actors (such as Jeff Goldblume, Christopher Walken, Shelley Duval, etc.) who, thirty years ago, could only dream that ""Annie Hall"" would help kick start their hopeful careers."
"ACitizenCalledKane","9","1","2","2 February 2005"," A classically intellectual, yet heart-felt, approach to romantic comedy.
","Intellectuals tend to over-think things sometimes, well, probably more like most of the time. This obsessive compulsion to analyze often brings nothing but disappointment, frustration, and cynicism. This, is Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), famous comedian ""looking for love in all the wrong places."" Or are they the right places, but Alvy won't let them be right? Is he afraid of a real relationship? Is the commitment too much for him? Does he fear the rejection and the disappointment? Who knows? Chances are, it's all of these things, and more. Allen's Alvy Singer is neurotic, so lost in his own fears and apprehensions that he cannot live his life. When he meets the beautiful, but awkwardly giddy Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), he decides to give romance another try. Annie, though, has some issues of her own. The two find solace in their similarities, yet the couple's neurotic nature tends to take a toll on them both, as the relationship continues through its ups and downs throughout the film. Told in retrospect, the film is a series of flashbacks and hilarious personal notes, chronicling the relationship of Annie and Alvy. There are plenty of great jokes and uncomfortable moments throughout the movie, as the intimacies of an unstable, but loving, relationship between two complicated people unravel. Allen, in what is often considered his breakthrough film, provides a witty and intelligent look into the irrationality of relationships, while offering humor as medicine to fight the bitterness that can sometimes accompany them. His intellectualization of the couple's time together does not divert attention from the emotions that are felt; the love, the anxiety, the frustration, the excitement, the laughter, and the tears. Diane Keaton's Oscar-winning performance as Annie Hall is truly remarkable. She is so sincere, revealing the insecurities and timidity that comes with trying to find love and acceptance without compromising who you are. Truly, Keaton is spectacular! All in all, I have to say that Annie Hall is every bit as touching and insightful as it is hilarious! Highly recommended!"
"madpenguin41","8","1","2","15 July 2004"," Wonderful film
","Somehow, I just saw this film for the first time the other night. My excuse is that I was born in 1982 and it takes a really long time to see every 'classic' that was made up to that point, especially when I'm barely able to keep up with the ones made in my lifetime. Anyhow, this was an incredibly creative film in many ways: Allen jumps into asides unexpectedly, at one point even dragging other characters into them; the story is told in seemingly random sequence; the characters are complex and every scene serves to develop them (as opposed the Hollywood's usual 5 minute 'crash course' in its characters). Allen takes small jabs at the L.A. lifestyle, which are frequently hilarious (there's no litter because they turn all their trash into TV shows... awesome!), and gives love to sweet, sweet NYC. <br/><br/>As far as the comedy goes, this is one funny movie! I laughed very frequently (a euphoric, free kind of laugh, as opposed to the guilty, cringing kind of laugh that most modern comedy induces). While it may not be fall-out-of-your chair funny, it's sly, wise, original, stylistically varied humor, which is always refreshing.<br/><br/>Watching this made me realize how much it must have influenced the makers of some of my favorite films about relationships (""High Fidelity"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""), and also how much I apparently love this sub genre of melancholy comedies (Shall we call them 'melanomedies'?). Indeed, ""Annie Hall"" is a melancholy film, as it focuses on the full spectrum of a romantic relationship. That spectrum involves a few wonderful highs, but unbearable pain as well. The overall feel of the film as well as its final voice-over keep it from being depressive in any sense, but this is certainly not a feel-good movie. This is a film that dares to venture outside of the very unreal world in which most movie characters seem to reside and into the world that makes up the hearts and minds of most average individuals For that, this movie fan is incredibly grateful.<br/><br/>The only criticism of this film I have (and it's a small knit-pick, mind you) is that it occasionally tends to meander totally off-track from anything relating to its overall story and purpose, as if Woody had a list of funny sketches lying around that he promised himself he'd slip into his next film one way or another. It works out okay, because the film is always entertaining and his transitions are smooth, but there are a few parts that really seem unnecessary in a film that's otherwise so thematically focused.<br/><br/>Whatever, this is still a wonderful little film with extraordinary acting from its two leads and writing more clever than 99.9% of all other films made, ever. Bravo! 8/10"

","Annie Hall is the semiautobiographical tale recounting the real life relationship of its stars, Allen and Academy Award winner Diane Keaton (who started a fashion craze after the film's release.)  During the course of the film Allen reflects on the relationships he's had and what exactly went wrong.  Allen intermixes comic routines, breaking of the fourth wall, a little animation and some actual scenes, ranging from the comic (Christopher Walken playing Annie's brother in a cameo) the serious (most of his fights) to both.  Annie Hall goes up in my top ten movies I've ever seen.  No other Woody film (and not too many other films) I've seen have as much heart or laughs as Annie Hall.  Whereas most romantic comedies are usually tired formulas of beautiful actresses and handsome men bickering even though they're crazy about each other, Annie Hall forgets every formula to these films and makes something much more genuine and gives the audience an unforgetable film."
"Mean_Joe_Weeks","Null","1","2","22 September 2003"," Inarguably one of Allen's Best, perhaps THE best
","This film may be the greatest single study of a relationship ever put to celluloid. It captures two distinct and fully realized characters at a specific time in their lives and shows us, without being too overt, who these people are separately and who they are together. Allen and Keaton have a wonderful neurotic chemistry, which is wonderfully funny without ever being so over-the-top that the characters failed to be believable. Classic scenes abound, including Allen's attempt to do cocaine and Walken in a very early role as Annie Hall's seriously troubled brother, whose monologue to Allen in simply priceless. Also watch for a blink-and-you-missed-it early early appearance by Jeff Goldblum, who delivers what may be the film's funniest single line.<br/><br/>All and All, Annie Hall is hilarious and poignant, a perfectly realized dissection of a relationship and the people who are part of it. A witty jazz score, artfully refined cinematography, and a perfect supporting cast round it out to be perhaps Allen's greatest triumph, well deserving of all the praise and - dare I say it? - even worthy of it's victory over Star Wars for Best Picture in 1977."

","Annie Hall is a must see movie for anyone who likes one liners and politically incorrect humor.  Woody Allen does an excellent job in this film without coming across in a hateful manner.  We need more of these types of films. It seems that many of us get too sensitive over generalities not directly aimed at one individual. We all need to lighten up a bit on this type of humor. It's good medicine."

","ANNIE HALL (1977) **** Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts, Shelley Duvall, Colleen Dewhurst, Christopher Walken, Carol Kane, Janet Margolin. Some say this is Woody's best film and I'm hard-pressed to differ: chronic New York neurotic/comedy writer Alvy Singer can't commit to anything except his own misery and falls in love (and meets his match in psychoses) with Annie Hall (Keaton in her Oscar-winning role), the Waspy flibbertigibbet who wants more out of life but she's not sure what. Oscars also for Allen's direction, his screenplay (co-written by Marshall Brickman) and Best Picture. Gorgeously shot in black and white by Gordon Willis. Look quickly for Jeff Goldblum's cameo (""I forgot my mantra"") at Paul Simon's So. Cal. Party, John Glover in a flashback party scene with Annie, Shelley Hack in a sidewalk scene, veteran character actor Tracey Walter and Beverly D'Angelo in the sitcom tape Roberts is sweetening with a laugh track in an edit bay, Woody's longtime friend and future producer Jean Doumanian in the coke scene, and at the film's end Sigourney Weaver (trust me it's her, but it is in a long shot and no dialogue) as Alvy's latest girlfriend. Best reaction shot: Allen with Keaton and Walken in a car after Walken has proclaimed his sudden urges of death. Also, I too wish I could do what Allen does in shutting up a movie-line pontificator like he does with media expert Marashall McLuhan."

","""Annie Hall"" deserves to be Woody Allen's best remembered film. It is a shining example of comic brillance. When it coes to writing, directing and starring in light comedies about middle aged and neurotic New Yorkers facing midlife crises and desperately trying to make sense of it all, nobody does it better than Allen. This 1977 United Artists release won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Picture while costar Diane Keaton was voted Best Actress and Allen was voted Best Director. Several future stars including Jeff Goldblum and Beverly D'Angelo make early and noticable film bit appearances here. A highly recommended character study comedy even if you are not especially a fan of Allen's work. This one ranks high above all of his other films."

","One often finds oneself wondering what the voting members of The Academy were thinking when they selected a particular film (or director) as Best of the Year. Not so this time. If ever a motion picture earned its Oscar(s), it was this one. Woody Allen's best. Were I an aspiring filmmaker wanting to delve into comedy, I would make a point of hunting down this one and studying it. Dying, it's been said, is easy- comedy is hard. Allen covers both bases with this observation: ""I don't mind dying... I just don't want to be there when it happens."""

","Up until watching this movie, I never cared much about Woody Allen and his prestigious career. However, his sarcastic wit and paranoid delusions really snared me, and I have come to enjoy his films as of late. Annie Hall stands as one of my favorite comedies of all time, especially when the little kid says `I'm a methadone addict.' Brilliant, and worth multiple viewings, this film puts the idea of postmodern filmmaking into a new realm of understanding and enlightenment. I can't get enough of Alvie in this film, and hopefully, no one else can either."

","This film is among the masterpieces of American cinema.  For all the ballyhoo Mr. Allen has received in his personal life, his testament here to the bittersweet idiosyncrasies of relationships speaks truer to the heart than any movie (outside of Casablanca) that I have had the privilege to see. The wit of his characters' dialogue, the spontaneity of Ms. Keaton's performance, the afterglow of Allen's romance with New York City - each gives the movie a magical quality that resonates into our daily lives, our passionate ambitions, even our dreams.  It is a film to treasure."

","I am an unabashed Woody Allen fan. Now, I know that most of us native New Yorkers are predisposed to liking Woody. I have found many midwesterners and Californians who ask why I like him, and, after a collection of well-thought-out reasons, they nod their heads knowingly and dismissingly if I mention that I am originally from New York City.<br/><br/>This movie, though, is about more than New York vs. L.A. It's about more than Jew loves Shiksa. It's about love, life, and disappointment, and it is put together in a very entertaining and precocious way. This is a film maker stretching the envelope. Only Woody Allen could come up with the idea of pulling Marshall Macuhan from behind a billboard to berate a pseudo-intellectual for him. Leave it to a warped mind to toss in an animated section where his love becomes the evil queen from ""Snow White."" And the subtitled sequence is just perfect.<br/><br/>As with most geniuses, there are many who may not ""get"" what Woody is trying to say. This is a film, though, that can be seen a hundred times, and something new will pop out every single one of those times. Take it from me; I wrote a sixty page thesis on this movie, and after watching it nearly every day for a semester, I was still learning and discovering.<br/><br/>Woody is in the doghouse these days because of some questionable personal choices. Ignore the man. Consider the work. If you give ""Annie Hall"" the chance, you will discover a masterfully wrought film that is hilarious, insightful, and touching without ever slipping into the bog of sentimentality. Movies like this are few and far between."

","Woody Allen's odd structuring of his first serious comedy-- subtitles, animation, fourth-wall devesation, proved that even at his most traditional, the heart of a neurotic rebel still shines through.<br/><br/>Many have called this the seminal romantic comedy of the 100+ year history of movies.  Blending old and new archetypes, it insists on never exhibiting a dull moment in the relationship of Alvy and Annie, always leaning towards quirky sequences and Vaudeville-like setups to deliver the entertainment over traditional plot arcs.  The fact that ""Annie Hall"" used an original framing device of a murder mystery allows the movie to get away with a great deal.  Plus, it helps that it beat out ""Star Wars"" to win Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards in 1977.  If you're reading these comments as a means of recommendation, please do know that from a very conservative filmgoer's POV, ""Annie Hall"" is the real thing:  it won't waste your time.

"PlanNine","9","1","2","10 October 2000"," Allen's Best Work
","In Allen's Annie Hall, he reveals his full potential as a filmmaker.  This is Allen's true breakthrough film.  Although still very humorous, Allen deals with issues of human interaction and relationships in Annie Hall that were not explored in his earlier works.  This has lead to creating a delightfully well-conceived and intelligent look at the lives of two people. 	 Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) is a young, Midwestern woman who meets Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), a neurotic Jewish standup comic.  They are almost instantly smitten, and they fall in love.  What follows is a very non-linear film about their relationship and feelings for each other. <br/><br/>
If one attempted to deconstruct Annie Hall's plot structure it would cause the film to not make sense.  It jumps hyperactively around in time and location and allows its narrator (Alvy Singer) to indulge in anecdotes that can sometimes feel detrimental to the driving plot point of the film: his relationship with Annie.  However, these comical asides all seem to link together as the film progresses and give us a clearer picture of Allen's overall statements on relationships. 	 The fact that Woody Allen is able to maintain the narrative complexity of Annie Hall while keeping the audience perfectly oriented is only one of the things about Annie Hall that make it so impressive.  Another aspect of it that is very satisfying and worth noting is the vivid cinematography by Gordon Willis.  He captures the sophistication of New York city by using a lighting concept similar to the one he used in The Godfather.  In fact, most of the visual elements of the film are very strong, including the art direction by Mel Bourne and clothing designed by fashion designer Ralph Lauren.  All of these elements converge to create a new and interesting New York look, that is at once authentic and slightly off kilter enough for this quirky comedy. 	 Of course, art direction and costume design wouldn't make this film worth watching if the performances in Annie Hall were poor.  Luckily enough for us, they're the opposite.  The interplay between Keaton and Allen crackles on the screen.  Their charisma is a joy to watch.  Although Woody Allen is just playing another version of his ""New Yorker neurotic Jew"" character that we have seen in other films, Diane Keaton really sinks her acting chops into the title role.  Her Annie goes through an evident intellectual transformation that Keaton pulls off very convincingly.  Allen is always funny as his neurotic persona and this is no exception.<br/><br/>	 The rest of the acting in the film is convincing and enjoyable.  Allen has worked with his casting director Juliet Taylor in order to find incredibly entertaining and talented people for even the most minute of roles.  Some standout supporting characters include Carol Kane as Alison, one of Alvy's ex-girlfriends, and Christopher Walken in a brilliant comedic turn as Annie's brother Duane Hall.  His five minutes in the film is worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>I couldn't really find anything wrong with Annie Hall.  All of its various facets converge to create a very entertaining film.  I always find Woody Allen's bickering ""Little Schlemiel"" anti-hero of a persona to be fascinating.  Finally, in this film he gives this little guy something really interesting to do.  We really get to enter Singer's neuroses in a way that is complexly satisfying and may remind us of ourselves and how we relate to others.  The audience is also never allowed to forget how infused these characters' lives are with sadness and comedy.  There are some bitterly funny scenes in Annie Hall that are startlingly reminiscent of our modern day reality.  Most of the audience can't help but identify.  For a thought provoking and highly entertaining video rental Annie Hall can't be beat.  It's the most intelligent movie comedy of it's decade."
"BusterJr","10","1","2","15 October 1998"," One of the ten great film comedies
","People either love or hate Woody Allen, but there are few people who do not love this beautiful film.  When it appeared in 1977, this free-wheeling, bittersweet examination of relationships in the latter half of this century was the funniest film since 1959 (Some Like it Hot), and it has remained the only serious film which has managed to be as funny as the brightest nonsense comedies -- Bringing Up Baby, His Girl Friday, Way Out West, To Be or Not to Be, The Lady Eve, Duck Soup. Allen never before or after managed to strike such a perfect balance between the serious and the outrageously comic: the marvelous Manhattan (1979) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) are not nearly as hilarious, nor are meant to be.  A real gem among gems, and not to be missed."

","A wonderful, funny, painful film about relationships and whether they can laugh.  Annie and Alvy are a little more extreme than most of us, but the situations they face are all too real.  Diane Keaton and Woodie Allen lived together for a quite awhile before this movie was made, and I once read a review in which the author had asked either Allen or Keaton how much of the stuff in the movie had actually happened and been told, ""Oh, maybe 5%.""  The reviewer had then talked to Keaton's family and been told, ""Oh, 95%."""
"Chuck-149","8","1","2","21 January 2000"," One of Woody Allen's best
","I've only seen two Woody Allen movies up to now and I can already state that he is one of my favorite directors.  The other movie I saw from him is ""Everyone says I love you"" which I thought was a very good movie with lots of laughs.  However, then I saw ""Annie Hall"" and I realized just how good a director he really was.  He won an Oscar for best director in this movie and really deserved it.  Diane Keaton also won an Oscar as best actress in the movie which she also deserved.  The movie is funny entertaining and doesn't drag.  Actually it would be pretty for the movie if it dragged because it only lasts an hour and a half.<br/><br/>  The story starts off with Woody Allen telling two jokes back to back. Then, he suddenly becomes a man named Alvy Singer and starts telling us the story of his relationship with a woman named Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Along the flashbacks, we see what kind of relationships he had with other women.  And all along these adventures, he manages to squeeze in a ton of laughs.  He finally gets to how his relationship with Annie Hall began.  One day, after a tennis match with his friends where Annie was playing, he met her after the game.  They talked a little and then Alvy asked her if she could give him a lift.  On the way back, Alvy probably lost the taste of wanting to be in the car that Annie is driving. <br/><br/>Some of you could consider this to be typical Woody Allen stuff, but even if you're right, it's great stuff.  What's also great about the Woody Allen movies is that in a scene in which he is playing but somebody else in speaking, it's always important to look at his face to get a funny figure or a grimace on his face.  The best part of his jokes is how he is able to tell them without even smiling.  Finally, throughout the whole movie, we see the love he has for New-York city.  If it hadn't been for the script-writer, he would have spent the whole movie in New-York.  It's a terrific movie."

This is unquestionably one of the funniest, warmest and most enduring films of the late 20th century, and -- of all Allen's films -- the one easiest to return to time and time again.  In the swiftness of its editing (there isn't a wasted frame in the whole picture), the depth of colour in the cinematography, the fashion-leading costumes by a young Ralph Lauren, and particularly in Diane Keaton's luminous performance, this is a masterpiece of modern cinema.  Allen presents New York as a world in which he (in his own way) is master -- walking the streets with purpose, haunting bars and restaurants, playing out his life against the backdrop of Manhatten.  There are countless moments of inspired invention: the film is bursting with ideas. Go and see it, whether a Woody"

Unquestionably Allen's masterpiece, it does such a great job of capturing the awkwardness, humor, pathos, insanity, futility, and hopeless beauty of romantic relationships that it's almost the only film you need to see on the subject.  There are so many classic scenes in this film that I've almost begun to imagine ""Annie Hall"" was really two or three movies--all of those great bits couldn't really be from the same film, could they?

The movie transcends mere film romance, though, and really attempts to analyze all the intricate layers of love, lust, passion, trust, and the lack thereof, that can make or break a relationship. By the end of the movie you really feel like you know these people, and that you just might have gained some new insights into how relationships might work.

","Annie Hall (1977) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Woody Allen's Oscar-winning masterpiece has him playing Alvy Singer, a paranoid writer who recounts his up and down relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), a wannabe singer. I'll admit right up front that ANNIE HALL is my favorite movie of all time. No matter what type of mood I'm in, I can push play on this film and it makes me laugh each time. Many people say this is the film where Allen really grew up and I think I'd have to agree. While he made several very good movies before this one, I think there's a really terrific structure here that we probably wouldn't have gotten earlier in his career. The film flashes from various points in the story and I really think this jumping around structure made for a much better picture. I love how we start off seeing the couple in happy times and then we flash back to how they met. I also enjoyed the clever little touches that Allen threw in including the sequence where they discuss Annie's previous boyfriends and we see the Allen and Keaton characters go back to those ""dates"" and question what she was thinking going out with these men. Several movie rules are broken here including Allen stopping the actual film with his character talking directly to the audience but this works so well and gets so many laughs that you can't help but love when it happens. Just check out the flashback sequence of Allen in his classroom and the kids begin to talk about where they are currently in their lives. This sequence should have fallen flat on its face but it's just so loving and tender that you can't help but laugh. The film also has some terrificly nice drama, a fine romance and of course the laughs. I would argue that this is without question one of the greatest screenplays from Allen because there's just so much going on and it just comes off as being a full character study. Of course, it also doesn't hurt that the two stars have so much terrific chemistry together. Allen and Keaton were involved with each other at this time so perhaps a lot of the chemistry is real but no matter if it was real or if they were acting, the two characters are perfectly brought to life. I think Allen has never been funnier in his career as this paranoid character is one he's played many times but never better than here. Keaton, who rightfully won an Oscar, comes off so charming and real that you can't help but love her. The supporting cast features some fine performances with Tony Roberts really standing out. Other familiar faces include Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall and Christopher Walken in a hilarious bit. ANNIE HALL is my favorite film of all time but even with a critical eye, I think the film works so well that even those who hate Allen should enjoy it. It's the perfect mix of comedy and drama but it also has fun with the East Coast vs. West Coast. The film is full of laughs but it also has a heart and this really makes it one of the greatest love stories out there."

It doesn't usually seem interesting to me, even knowing that as a dialogue writer it has no equal, but as a director, I find it boring. I am not interested in what you are telling me. I do not see a coherence to anything, it seems that they are all snippets of something that is not known to be.<br/><br/>The actors are in his line, he will always be him, and she is very well. The problem is that they don't transmit anything to me.<br/><br/>He is a director who never uses lighting, as the photo director, whose name I do not remember, who worked with him and with Bermang, who had been the director he had known, who did more than light and the camera. He does not transmit anything with either of them, he simply does not care.<br/><br/>As director, he doesn't exist, he just wants to tell a story as if it were theater. The moments he speaks to the camera, seem horrible to me, you can't get more of a movie viewer than doing that. Surely if I did theater it would be wonderful, but the problem is that they are two completely different media. There is no sequence in which he puts a point of view different from that of a mere observer from outside, he never has the baton.<br/><br/>The beginning of the film is a clear sample of what the whole film is going to be, if you don't see it clearly don't follow."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","15 November 2018"," Smug and condescending - which is of course the joke
","A movie directed by Woody Allen, who's also playing the lead role. A movie about a neurotic New York comedian, who recalls us with tales about his dating history, while constantly complaining about how hard it is to hold a girl when you're an egotistical, backboneless loser with a misogynistic streak a mile wide. And that's the only joke this film has. The only one.<br/><br/>To be fair, there's more to this movie than its humour. Allen has stated that the film is not meant to be autobiographical, but that's a bit hard to swallow watching the film. It's constantly talking about New York, holocaust movies, being a Jew in modern America, death literature, psychoanalysis and every single other thing that you can pin on Allen.<br/><br/>And throughout this all Singer (Allen) and his dysfunctional relationships are under the microscope. To the film's credit it doesn't try to portray Singer as a hero. The character himself thinks that he's simply misunderstood and not to blame, but the actual film makes it more than clear that the culprit in Singer's case can be found by looking into a mirror. Except when it doesn't. Because there are scenes that shift the blame on society and its way of making people unable to form lasting relationships. Meaning that the film is essentially saying, ""Sorry, Singer, but you cannot get the girl because you're an awful person. But it's not your fault, not really. You had no chance of being anything but an awful person."" And I don't like that the film is contradicting itself like this.<br/><br/>It also doesn't help that I don't really like Woody Allen films in general. They're simply too snobbish and smug for me. If this movie, for example, was a person, it would be a rail thin wannabe artist, who would look down his nose at you unless you could talk with them about the emptiness of human soul caused by the modern information age in relation to Marxist theory as fulfilled in post-war Africa.<br/><br/>This movie has its fan, as has Woody Allen in general, but I can only hope that I don't wake up one day and find myself having become one."

","Woody Allen is the ultimate film auteur. One who leaves his signature on all his films, from his neurotic characters, his leading ladies (usually Diane Keaton or Mia Farrow) and his love for New York . Annie Hall is Allen's most distinguished film of all, an incredible razor sharp script with enough punch lines to knock out his most ardent critics. It tells the story of Alvy Singer, a neurotic comedian who meets Annie, a equally scatty character with whom he falls in love with. During the course of the film with see Alvy trying to figure out about love, about his relationship with Annie and just why people stay together. During the film he often talks directly to the audience, uses animation, and approaches people in the street, giving a wonderfully fresh approach to a film that still feels like the last word in romantic comedy. Beating Star Wars for Best Picture at the 1977 Academy Awards, Annie Hall inspired a new fashion craze thanks to Diane Keaton and a phrase ""La-di-da"" that was said in all the social circles that count. The best scripted romantic comedy ever, forget when Harry met Sally and check out when Alvy met Annie"
"PorridgeBird","9","1","3","15 January 2005"," Great Art Comedy
","ANNIE HALL is art comedy. I took some thought into terming it; ""comedy art"" suggests that its gags are artistic while my belief is that this is ""art comedy"", art that happens to make you chuckle. I consider MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL and AIRPLANE! to be ""comedy art"". I consider ANNIE HALL ""art comedy"".<br/><br/>This is essentially a classic romance told in humorous form. Alvy Singer, played by Woody Allen, is a neurotic, Jewish, New York, stand-up comedian who refuses to change. Annie Hall, played by Diane Keaton, is a capricious, Midwest raised, New York living, fashion setting woman who sings in a nightclub. It's the story of their love, a love which is not perfect but needed. There's happiness, sadness, symbolism, literary allusions, fourth-wall demolition, and even animation. There are struggles between fantasy and reality. There are bittersweet moments of romantic futility. There are two spiders the size of Buicks. It's wistful, it's psychological, and it's even funny.<br/><br/>If you only saw the earlier Woody Allen films, such as BANANAS or SLEEPER, before this movie, as I did, you may be surprised by the difference between this and those. Those films were more farcical, slapstick, and contained more music. ANNIE HALL does not have those sequences where a silent slapstick routine is set to sprightly music. In fact, not even the opening and closing titles have any music of any sort. There's a quick clip of music after a car ride, there's the music heard while in the movie theatre, and Diane Keaton sings twice (the second song is repeated before the end credits). But it's probably just as well. A slapstick routine would seem out of place in this touching, distinctly human story of imperfect but indispensable love."

","Annie Hall is simply one of the greatest, most complete, interesting, witty, funny, romantic, sweet, and utterly intelligent movie ever projected on big, white screen. In fact, it is most possibly the single most intelligent movie ever made. The story follows Alvy Singer (Allen), a new york comedian, and his very odd romance with the tittle character, Annie Hall (beautifully portrayed by Diane Keaton). Both Allen and Keaton deliver two of the most masterfully funny performances ever given. Though the relationship between both Keaton and Allen in real life would seem a little strange, Allen being a middle-aged basket case, and Keaton being a much younger, much more beautiful free-spirit kind of Hippie-chick, the two still have engaging chemistry nad make a surprisingly convincing couple. Annie Hall is, and always will be, my favorite movie, every single second is just purely enjoyable. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ears! 10 out of 10 quality!"
"TheNorthernMonkee","9","1","3","19 July 2004"," Funny yet sad
","SPOILERS<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" is often described as Woody Allen's finest hit. Whilst personally ""Sleeper"" is a superior film, there's no denying the beauty of Allen's 1977 classic. This film is a brilliant piece of cinema which makes us laugh, but ultimately culminates in adding an element of misery to our lives.<br/><br/>In ""Annie Hall"", Woody Allen writes, directs and stars as Alvy Singer. Alvy is a depressive kinda guy who seems to be obsessed with books and films about death. One day, into his life comes the eccentric Annie Hall (the brilliant Diane Keaton). The two engage on a love affair which will forever change their lives.<br/><br/>With this film, Allen has once again combined a pessimistic leading character with a razor sharp wit with a beautiful co-star for him to fall in love with. The relationship between Alvy and Annie develops from their first encounter on a tennis court through a couple of years to a reunion in Manhattan. This film teaches us about life, and it makes us laugh in the process. Perhaps the one flaw in fact is that we come away from ""Annie Hall"" not praising it's comedy as much as feeling sad as a result of it's climax. No relationship is perfect, but perhaps at times Hollywood's fake plan that we all live happily ever after has it's benefits. Irrelevant of realism, this idea of a perfect ending does allow the audience to leave with a smile rather than feeling miserable.<br/><br/>It's unfair on Allen's art though to refer to it as a piece of misery. Despite the ending and it's expression on our lives, the thing to remember is that in ""Annie Hall"", as with all his movies, Allen succeeds in giving us ninety minutes of laughter. Woody Allen is, and probably always will be, a genius.<br/><br/>One final point worth mentioning regarding this film is yet another reminder of Allen's greatness. As well as creating a hilariously funny film which makes us all laugh, if you watch this film closely, there are three future stars who feature as minor characters in this movie. Whilst Jeff Goldblum, Beverley D'Angelo and Sigourney Weaver had all appeared in a few minor films before hand (Goldblum and D'Angelo both appearing in ""Sentinel"" from 1977 with fellow ""Annie Hall"" cast member Christopher Walken), it seems likely that especially in the case of Goldblum, it was their performances as short minor characters in Allen's film that might one day lead to their extensive careers. With a cast of future stars, this film becomes even more poignant.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Annie Hall"" is brilliant. Personally there's no denying that there's a preference for ""Sleeper"", but this film is equally as good and it is worthy of any praise it might receive. Woody Allen was, is and always appears to be a comedy God."

However incredible it seems ""Annie Hall"" is not a comedy but a drama.

","Woody Allen won the Oscar and BAFTA, and was nominated the Golden Globe for directing this romantic comedy, which is a rare thing to happen at the Academy Awards these days. Basically Alvy Singer (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Allen) is a whiny, over-paranoid and neurotic stand-up comedian living in New York. The film focuses on his falling in love and falling out with the equally neurotic and kooky Annie Hall (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Diane Keaton, Annie being Keaton's nickname, and Hall being her real surname). The film streams all his memories in his consciousness of how he met Annie, how they spent time together and how they parted ways. What makes it interesting love story is that the fourth wall is broken in many moments, with Alvy talking to camera, asking unknown characters to give their opinions and they act like they know him, and there is even a moment of animation. Also starring Tony Roberts as Rob, Carol Kane as Allison, Paul Simon as Tony Lacey, The Shining's Shelley Duvall as Pam, Janet Margolin as Robin, Colleen Dewhurst as Mrs. Hall, Christopher Walken as Duane Hall, Jeff Goldblum as Lacey Party Guest, Beverly D'Angelo as Actress in Rob's TV Show and Sigourney Weaver as Alvy's Date Outside Theatre. Allen is terrific with his stylistic film-making, and creating a likable fumbling character, Keaton obviously makes a presence in her award-winning part, and a little known Walken (before his Oscar winning turn in The Deer Hunter) makes a brief impression. With clever, funny and touching insights into living in New York, love, psychiatry, insignificance and the meaning and purpose of life, this is a great alternative romantic comedy. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Allen and Marshall Brickman, and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing, Best Screenplay and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy and Best Screenplay. Woody Allen was number 71, and Christopher Walken number 34 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and Allen was number 80 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 90 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for ""Seems Like Old Times"", it number 55 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""La-dee-da, la-dee-da""), it was number 11 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 11 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, it was number 4 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, it was number 31 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 50 on The 100 Greatest Films.

I don't remember exactly how I felt about 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 'Alice', but I don't recall liking either one a lot.<br/><br/>So my expectations were not that high for this movie. I really enjoyed the surreal scenes, such as when the adult Alvy appeared in the classroom where he was a child, especially when the kids started saying some very adult things. The scene with the wicked queen from 'Snow White' was great and, if it was new animation, rather than just inserting characters into the old, it was perfect. I liked some of Alvy's jokes, but by no means all. And while some of the humor may have been cutting edge way back then, it's not my taste and I've heard it too many times before. I like old corny jokes told well.<br/><br/>I'm sure Diane Keaton did a good job. Annie Hall just didn't appeal to me as a character, and she wasn't that pretty, though I liked her hair and she had a nice smile. I liked the outfit that included the tie her grandmother gave her.<br/><br/>It surprised me that Alvy left a party to watch a Knicks game. I just don't think of Woody Allen, or his characters, as sports fans. I don't like sports myself.<br/><br/>I was confused several times because Alvy seemed to know Annie well at first, then it was like they had just met in some later scenes, and this was never explained.<br/><br/>Something I found curious, which indicates there could be strong language here: the TV station included a stern warning about adult content because this was not edited. And yet the sound went out a couple of times. I don't know what I didn't hear, but I suspect it was bad.<br/><br/>I'm not saying I can't like this kind of humor.

You should know something about the concepts like ""latency period"", ""penis envy"", ""polymorphously perverse"" etc... When you try to create a comedy about love I guess you do not have to make pointed references to sex all the time either. <br/><br/>I sort of liked the techniques used in the film but they don't necessarily make sense. For instance, Allen's character, standing in a cinema queue with Annie Hall and listening to someone behind leaves the line to speak to the camera directly. The man comes to speak to the camera in his defense, and Alvy Singer/Woody Allen resolves the dispute by pulling McLuhan himself from behind a counter to tell the man that his interpretation is wrong.In another scene also when Allen is at a dinner with the family of Annie Hall he just starts talking about the family to the camera directly...ALL IN ALL I SORT OF LIKED BUT IT IS NOt A GREATEST MOVIE AT ALL..."

","Maybe one day when I have a lot more life experience I will rewatch this and think ""Wow! this is so clever and deft and assessing modern relationships and is a hilarious bouquet of daring narrative techniques"".<br/><br/>But for now I am very unimpressed by the minimalist approach. By this I mean two things: the very laisszez fair approach to visualization with a lot of long takes and static cameras and also the simple narrative in which rather than a linear story we get a collage of episodes that illustrate this sometimes passionate, sometimes floundering romance.<br/><br/>The crux of the problem is no interesting characters or intrigue to really get us started. They're in a relationship from the beginning; there's no meetcute or even a meet-painful to subvert that trope. I guess Allen was trying to give us a sort of anti-romance, the thing ""The Break-up"" should have been.<br/><br/>But although I'm a big cheerleader for Allen's vision of the hypochondrical, self-hating New Yorker, he simply hasn't much going for him with the context provided. Annie herself basically has no personality asides old fashioned sweet girliness. Yeah, she wears a suit and she looks fabulous. But it just seems arbitrary.<br/><br/>The episodes themselves are just mundane. They aren't gags, they're just bland slice of life in that unhappy medium between being funny or being poignant. They're neither.<br/><br/>The surrealist gags are sort of interesting but they get old really quickly because they are more gimmicky than clever. To give a couple of examples: at one point they converse and we get subtitles. But these subtitles do not convey the subtext of what they're saying, they just give inner thoughts therefore totally missing the translation element I was expecting. At another point we get an animated section where the sudden animation basically IS the joke.<br/><br/>I suppose this was sort of edgy in the '70s but now it just seems like the same tropes that are the bread and butter in modern relationship humour.<br/><br/>The ""innovations"" like turning directly to the camera are also just gimmicks that aren't used to any effect. Bug Bunny did that and he did it in a funny way.<br/><br/>In fits and starts I sort of want to like it. It's not an obnoxious movie and it comes from a good place creatively. Allen and Keaton play their parts impeccably even if the script is never naturalistic or stylized enough for them to ever do much with it.<br/><br/>The exact romance depicted is agreeable. It neither burns bright or hot but is a convincing meeting of two different types of people having a believable connection even if it isn't a viable one. I like the lobster motif. I did not laugh once.<br/><br/>I would recommend ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"" or ""Whatever Works"" above this movie if you're curious about Woody Allen and, like me, you don't find ""relatable"" humor that funny.<br/><br/>It isn't a high brow movie, it just stepped out of the mould for a bit."

","In the late 1970s and early 1980s watching a Woody Allen film was like a visit to the doctor who gives you some foul tasting medicine. Ultimately it was good for you. Most film critics at the time lionised Woody especially when he started to make his films in black and white.<br/><br/>I last saw Annie Hall some 30 years ago. Nowadays I can watch some low rent movie and completely forget everything about it a few months later. When I rewatched Annie Hall recently I could recall some of the gags and scenes such as Marshall McLuhan being dragged out to dismiss the opinions of some smart alec or the weird outburst by Christopher Walken who plays Annie's brother or Allen sneezing on some cocaine. Of course the film was famous with Diane Keaton's masculine fashion sense.<br/><br/>Annie Hall started out as a murder mystery that morphed into a bittersweet romantic comedy. It sees the shift from Woody Allen making silly comedies to a self reverential continental European type comedy. There is certainly an influence of Fellini here.<br/><br/>Annie Hall comes across as a semi autobiographical comedy and even darkly surreal. Woody plays comedian Alvy Singer. He has just turned 40 and recounts his doomed romantic relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton.) Alvy comes from a loud Jewish family. Annie is from a waspish even anti semitic family. Alvy is educated, neurotic who sees a shrink. Annie is easy going, likes to smoke dope. Alvy encourages Annie to take adult education classes, later he is jealous as she spends more time with one of her tutors.<br/><br/>There is so much to enjoy here. Alvy's rapid fire wit and neurosis. He thinks someone is being anti semitic by the way he pronounces 'do you' to make it sound like Jew. Alvy breaks the fourth wall, there is animation and subtitles. When Aly and Annie talk to each other, the subtitles indicate what they are thinking including Alvy wondering what she looks like without her clothes.<br/><br/>When Alvy is waiting for Annie to arrive for their date, he is accosted by two strange men. When Annie pulls up in a taxi, Alvy tells Annie that he has been harrassed by two men from the Godfather. Of course the audience knows that Keaton appeared in the Godfather films.<br/><br/>There are several stars who make brief early appearances in this film.

","(Flash Review)<br/><br/>For those who can't stand a babbling, cynical, neurotic, intellectual person then take three steps back and run. Run far. For those who can, they will enjoy a film full of heavy dialog that takes center stage. Allen portrays a too brainy for his own good Alvie, in an up and down relationship with Annie Hall. From the start, this is turmoil-filled due to his self-sabotage that is full of his obsessive and neurotic tendencies. He has such a constant negative and pessimistic view is everything large to small that he drives the females he wants to pursue slowly away. Alvie is obviously frustrating and irritating to watch as he shares his options and concerns. While this is not a visually intriguing film, Allen does add dashes of cinematic whimsy as he directs characters occasionally to step out of the scene and talk directly into the camera, called an ""aside"". Will Alvie be able to hold down a relationship with Annie who actually likes him or will he driver her away and himself back into therapy? Overall, this is a rapid fire, intellectual-based script in pure 70s style."

","I enjoyed this as much if not more than any Woody Allen movie I've seen and I've seen most of them. The early titles, what we may call the First Wave were rightly viewed as a series of sketches with little or no unifying theme, reminding us of nothing so much as Oscar Wilde's lifelong desire to write a play with no plot just a string of epigrams. Then came the phase of more linear story lines which lost the one-liners followed by the current phase in which he no longer appears himself but employs actors to play 'Woody Allen' type characters. With Annie Hall the one-liners come thick and fast and 90 per cent of them are thrown away and punctuated by two sequences in which Diane Keaton sings in her own voice; the first time it's the old Gus Kahn standard It Had To Be You, which is interrupted by philistine customers in the club concerned and the second time it a sadly neglected number from 1945, Seems Like Old Times, which does, of course, double as a comment on the relationship of the two principals. In one sense The Way We Were explores very similar territory and would make an excellent double bill. Entertaining, Enjoyable, Bittersweet."

","Annie Hall(1977) Starring: Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall, Janet Margolin, Christopher Walken, and Colleen Dewhurst Directed By: Woody Allen Review A NERVOUS ROMANCE Hello Kiddies your pal the Cupid Critic here with one of the most influential romantic comedies that had it's own and beat Star Wars at the Oscars for Best Picture. Alvy Singer(Woody Allen) is one of Manhattan's most brilliant comedians, but when it comes to romance, his delivery needs a little work. Introduced by his best friend Rob(Tony Roberts) Alvy falls in love with the ditzy but delightful nightclub singer Annie Hall(Diane Keaton). When Alvy's own insecurities sabotage the affair, Annie is forced to leave Alvy for a new life-and lover(Paul Simon)-in LOs Angles. Knowing he may have lost Annie forever, Alvy's willing to go to great lengths- even driving L.A's freeways-to recapture the only thing that mattered-true love. I've been wanting to see this for a while, the first Woody Allen picture I ever saw was Blue Jasmine and I loved that film, granted its nothing like Annie Hall but it was a great character study. Annie Hall was also a best picture winner so that also made me more excited when I put the Bluray in. Annie Hall contains more intellectual wit and cultural references than any other movie to win an Oscar for best picture, and in winning the award in 1978 it edged out Star Wars, an outcome unthinkable today. The victory marked the beginning of Woody Allen's career as an important filmmaker(his work was funny but slight) and it signaled the end of the 1970s golden age of movies. Annie Hall is built on such dialogue and centers on conversation and monologue. Because it is just about everyone's favorite Woody Allen movie, because it won the Oscar, because it is a romantic comedy few viewers probably notice how much of it consist of people talking, simply talking. This is a movie that establishes its tone by constantly switching between tones: The switches reflect the restless mind of the filmmaker, turning away from the apparent subject of a scene to find the angle that reveals the joke. Annie Hall is a movie about a man who is always looking for the loopholes in perfection. Who can turn everything into a joke, and wishes he couldn't. I give Annie Hall a five out of five"

","Probably the best romantic comedy you'll ever see. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, an insecure, cerebral comedian living in Manhattan (hmm), who is trying to understand how his relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) ended. The script is fantastic, and Allen gives us a steady stream of jokes ranging from subtle, intellectual references to physical comedy, and while I only laughed out loud a few times, I was often smiling. He also uses a variety of creative techniques in this film - speaking directly to the camera, stepping directly into childhood memories, giving voice to inner thoughts, and including a brief animation, among other things. He explores love, sex, and relationships, but also the cultural differences between Jews and Gentiles, and New Yorkers and Californians in clever ways. His understated facial reaction as Keaton orders Pastrami on white bread with lettuce and tomatoes is priceless.<br/><br/>The film is sweet, endearing, and sentimental about relationships, and yet it's also balanced, showing the bittersweet pitfalls with just the right touches, including a brilliant ending. On top of all that, it's great to see Paul Simon in a couple of scenes, Allen's references to the 1969 documentary ""The Sorrow and the Pity"", and Diane Keaton's wonderful performance of ""Seems Like Old Times"". Great film, and very worthy of the Academy Awards it won."

","I found this movie to be very confusing and hard to follow. There were parts that were humorous but I ultimately had a hard time grasping the plot. The cinematography was ultimately well done because I could see everything that I was supposed to on screen. Everything was well lit as well so I suppose you could say that the lighting made a difference. The sound including the background noise definitely helped to keep the audience interested at the very least and kind of gave the audience a clue as to what was happening in case they were a bit confused.

","I don't agree that this picture should have topped Star Wars in 1977 at the Oscars' for the Best Picture. In this film Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer who is a struggling stand up comic. He isn't only struggling with the material he has to come up with to keep his career thriving but he also is struggling with the aspects of life and love. Alvy is a strange character obsessed with death. The majority of the plot surrounds the love life between Annie Hall and Alvy. From when they first met at the Tennis courts to when they take their many breaks. I did enjoy the one liners that Woody Allen came up for that were included in this movie."
"bibeaultj","7","0","3","12 June 2015"," Contender For Worst Best Picture
","Annie Hall, directed, written, and starring Woody Allen, begins as a witty, likable, and hilarious film that had me in tears during a few scenes. However, as the film grows on, it develops a certain tedium, and eventually becomes a redundant and repetitive film with an annoying lead performance.<br/><br/>Woody Allen starts off as a brilliantly written character, with tons of neurotic quirks that make him unique. Jewish jokes aside, his comedic performance was very charismatic. However, an hour into the film, I found myself annoyed by the sound of his voice, and the frequency he would complained about the most mundane of things. This is where the shift into tedium begins, because this whole time I was wishing the film would end so I would no longer have to hear him talking. The same here goes for Diane Keaton, who I loved at first, but I eventually grew annoyed with as time went on. And their insistence on being annoying could've been intentional, there's no denying that, but that doesn't make it any less annoying, and it doesn't stop Woody Allen from type- casting himself in his own movie.<br/><br/>One thing I can certainly compliment is the exquisite direction. I've always been a huge fan of long takes, making the feeling of the film more intimate, and this film features tons of those. There is a brilliant shot where, Woody and his friend are walking down the street, and we here them talking, but they're not yet in frame or just out of frame. As the shot and conversation continues, we see two individuals come down the street casually, and eventually we see this is Allen and his friend. The shot then continues and follows them where they're walking. It's brilliant, and in some scenes it even heightens the comedic value, especially in the scene when they're waiting in the line at the movie's with the film snob talking pretentiously behind them.<br/><br/>There's no doubt here that the writing here is also very well done, until the third act, because in typical comedy fashion, it brings in the dramatic plot that you don't care about,and drops nearly all of the jokes, making it even more tedious than it already was. But nonetheless, there's lots of hilarious chemistry between Keaton and Allen, especially in the lobster scene, which I found to be one of the most genuinely written in the film. The characters talk quickly too, so reading the Oscar-winning screenplay is only that much better for helping you catch all of the jokes you might have missed. <br/><br/>This film's winning of the Best Picture Oscar however emphasizes it's rather OK quality. Make no mistake, this is a well directed, well acted, and well written film until the third act comes in. But it's that third act that simply makes the movie OK. A bad ending is certainly worse than a bad beginning, because an audience member is more akin to remember a movie finishing bad, then starting good, and vice versa. This is a bit of a generic romcom the more I think about it, with a few artistic quirks. It's certainly not the worst Best Picture, that honor goes to either Driving Miss Daisy or Shakespeare in Love, but nonetheless, this is your typical overrated classic which people praise but don't watch.I recommend it to someone who's an Oscar completionist or somebody who just wants a quick laugh with an artistic edge, but anybody else, especially people who aren't already fans of Woody Allen, should stray away from this."
"SimonJack","5","0","4","31 May 2015"," Hard to laugh at such neurosis and unhappy living
","Woody Allen is a good comedian and an excellent comedy writer. As an actor, he's just so-so. He's a newer type of character actor. The whimpering, complaining, afraid, neurotic egocentric funny guy that most of us wouldn't mind having for a friend, but we couldn't stand his hanging around very long. That's how Allen and his movie, ""Annie Hall,"" struck me. It has some very funny lines. But that's about all in its favor. What there is of a plot isn't much. There's no great drama, there are no surprises, twists or turns. No great moments. But there is a tremendous amount of the whimpering, complaining, poor-me, down-and-out, hapless, misunderstood, unloved and obviously unfulfilled and unhappy Alvy Singer.<br/><br/>Watching this movie again recently, it struck me that Hollywood must be in the business of countering the mood of the culture at any given time. We know of the great comedies, romance and other entertaining films during the Great Depression. So, then, in the 1970s when life seemed mostly on the up, Hollywood came up with lots of downer stuff. Yes, it's comedy, but how long can people see and feel the funny with so much misery? The downer starts to wear on one. And, judging from the number of people who have rated this movie by 2015, and its high rating, maybe the downer syndrome is still with us. If that's what the public wants, that what the public gets – and we in Hollywood will help them decide what they want. There was a time when some in the movie industry considered what was good and needed for the ethos of society. <br/><br/>As I recall, the 1970s and 1980s were the psycho-pop decades. Anybody who had money – especially in the cities, had a psychiatrist. We were doing so well that Americans and our society couldn't handle well the prosperity and good times that had blossomed. So, now we had workaholics, broken relationships and marriages, multiple divorces, broken families, and kids out of control because their parents were strangers to them. Counselors were coming out of the woodwork to help the suffering successes of society. No one understood them. They had dysfunctional childhoods and subsequent disorderly lifestyles. <br/><br/>So, there were these comedies that milked that for a time. And, there also were a whole bunch of fluffy, feel-good movies to help reassure folks and lift spirits. What distinguished these from the thread of such films that have always been around is that this large group for the most part lacked any great drama and acting. Perhaps it was because there were so many, and so few of substance.<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" earned four Oscars in the 1977 Academy Awards – two for Woody Allen for directing and screenplay writing; and Diane Keaton as best actress. I don't want to demean these or the other stars and movie makers for their achievements. But this film also won best picture for the year. There was so little competition. There were no great films in 1977. One came close – ""The Turning Point,"" which received 11 nominations but no awards. The two big pictures that year were sci-fi films that will be long remembered before any other films of that year. ""Star Wars"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" already have proved their staying power decades down the road.<br/><br/>That so many other people could sit through and enjoy this movie so much might say something about our times and the quality of the entertainment we have now. I enjoyed several of Woody Allen's films much more than ""Annie Hall."" I can't seem to laugh after a while at such neurosis and miserable living."

","""Annie Hall"" is one of those movies you either like or don't like. Woody Allen depicts his love for movies and his innovativeness, especially while engaging the audience by breaking the forth wall in clever segments. I have never watched a movie directed by Woody Allen, at least as far as I can remember. However I remember hearing amongst the students in my Cinema class that they either loved or hated Woody Allen. I thought ""well, it can't be that extreme,"" but it sort of has a truth to it. The movie made me laugh, other times it just seemed that the humor was being forcefully pushed upon me. Some of the content is clever and thought provoking. Not to say it is a bad movie, because it definitely is not, it is an alright movie. It's charm wore down for me within the first 40 minutes or so and just felt like it was doing whatever it could to drag itself along to meet a specific standard of time most movies abide by these days."

","Annie hall has become one of my favorite films about love and relationships because of its level of realism and accuracy. Woody Allen successfully captures the essence of love and how people can grow apart. The film is hilariously funny yet also somber at points because of the sad truth of it all. Diane Keaton's performance as charmingly awkward is spectacular. The film, while long, moves at a good pace though it does seem to drag at times. Allen successfully breaks the rules of movie making resulting in a very unique movie experience. The audience members become participants in Allen's journey. Overall Annie Hall is a must see for any romance fanatics, it may not be what you expected but instead what you needed."

Even the dialogue that he shared between his co-star was witty and face paced to keep you entertained. I just couldn't get myself to like Woody Allen's character. It didn't interest me, and it didn't make me laugh. Finding it hard to like his character made it hard for me to appreciate this movie. The movie was well thought out though.

The story wasn't anything special with it just being a classic love story with them thinking they were for each other but end up just being friends. I also didn't think any of Woody Allen's jokes were funny and just felt like stand up bits put into a romantic comedy script. The only thing I enjoyed was Diane Keaton's performance I thought she was an interesting character and she pulled it off well.

","I thought this film was very pleasing to the eyes and had a great message that can some what relate to everyones love life. At some point in our lives we have all been Alvy Singerand i think thats why this movie is so appreciated by many. However Woody Allen is way to much of a personality actor for me. While his humor certainly has its moments and can get me to laugh pretty hard, it becomes old and stagnant throughout this film. Woody Allen is strongly opinionated and he makes it clear by force feeding his thoughts about society to you countless times in his films. It almost feels like getting stuck at a stand up act that you didn't sign up to go see. Another thing that held this film back was purely the amount of times he steps out of character and acknowledges that this is a film. I think thats a clever method in film making and can be hilarious, however this technique was beat to death in this film."

This is the story of a man trying to put in the grey areas of love out and yet make you understand that it still is love.<br/><br/>Woody Allen, the protagonist, tries to give a narrative of his story of love with Annie Hall. The movie just is a narrative of how they meet, how they make love, what are their sex issues and other things which are common in any relationship. But the idea is to make these common things uncommon with Allen's style narratives.<br/><br/>Where the character pops out of the screen and talks to the audience, where the character goes into his own past and tries to analyse his past etc are tools Allen uses to make the scenes humorous and yet conveying a point in existence.<br/><br/>I cant comment on whether this movie deserved an Oscar cause i haven't seen its counterparts.

Annie Hall makes for a ditsy character, but the whole thing really revolves around Woody Allen. There was one funny scene where Woody's trying to clean up lobsters in his house, and one gets by the refrigerator. He cowards around the whole kitchen. Another scene I got a kick out of is how he used to live under a roller coaster. How could you stand to live like that?

","It is hard to go to see Annie Hall without unrealistically high expectations given the extravagant praise lavished on the movie by so many people. I tried my best to stay neutral going into the experience -- my second viewing of it 35 years after my first -- but even with my restrained hopes I was somewhat disappointed with this film. Part of it is that the ""Woody Allen neurotic Jewish character"" is really quite tired for me. There are some scenes where Allen's nerdy, awkward, overly analytical and hypercritical schtick is quite funny (mainly the scenes in which he is pitted against spiders and their distant relatives, lobsters) but much of the time he is merely tolerable. I'm sure many people would disagree with my viewpoint, but for some of us Woody Allen is not the living end. If that makes us Philistines, then perhaps we can be cast in a future remake of Annie Hall and a 40ish actor playing Woody Allen can pull the real, now-quite-elderly Woody Allen from behind a potted palm tree to tell us how stupid we are for not adoring Woody Allen.<br/><br/>The real reason to see this movie is Diane Keaton's performance. She is quite gifted at capturing a more genuine, goofy kind of awkwardness that is funny and endearing at once. She inhabits her character beautifully and richly deserved the Oscar she won for this portrayal.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the brief scene played by Christopher Walken. He has his own schtick -- playing weirdoes -- but weirdoes is a schtick I can swallow better than neurotic Brooklynites. Here Walken looks unbelievably young and, dare I say, very attractive with his immense forehead in full bloom. It's too bad he isn't given more screen time in this movie."

He was very whiney, and whenever he would say something nice or heartwarming, it didn't come across as genuine. I guess the point of the movie is that relationships have their ups and downs and that they work themselves out in the long run one way or another. Hmmm... what else?

"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","3","27 September 2009"," Has Allen Ever Topped 'Annie Hall'?
","Confessing to not having seen most of his films, perhaps 'Annie Hall' is at least one of his best, if not THE best. It has become my all-time favourite Woody Allen film so far. Not only does it beautifully showcase the 70's American pop-culture such as the politics, drugs and sex and rock and roll but it eloquently tells a poignant yet humorous story. On the surface, it may look like an offbeat romantic comedy but at the same time the writing has so many layers and depth. The clever dialogues are written with humour but there is a quiet intensity that brilliantly touches on themes about relationships, culture and history. The on screen rapport between Allen and Keaton is splendid to watch. Their chemistry feels very natural on screen. Moreover, Keaton looks incredibly sexy and 'Annie Hall' also marks as one of her finest performances to date. The supporting cast that includes Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Paul Simon and Colleen Dewhurst make fine use of their small roles. Allen has written and directed a stunning little film. He captures the essence of the 70s quite wonderfully and he shoots the film with skill. Even though he has assumed multiple roles in many of his films (both on and off screen), 'Annie Hall' is a priceless gem."

","Annie Hall is one of Woody Allen's most original and refined films. Its really too bad he had to put himself in most of the sex scenes. Meh! And hearing him moaning during those sex scenes... Gag! Could someone please pass me a bucket and a copy of Mulholland Drive?.<br/><br/>Allen's horniness was only a minor issue in this extremely funny and inventive comedy. I know a lot of Star Wars fans are annoyed by Annie Hall beating Star Wars at the Academy Awards and winning the best picture prize. To those of us who have seen Star Wars and Annie Hall, and don't have a Wookie bias, its easy to see which is the superior film. Star Wars was not as refined, and the writing in Annie Hall was much stronger.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this gem, you should definitely check it out.

","It took ""Star Wars"" to get the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to acknowledge Woody Allen's contribution to film.<br/><br/>In 1978, the A.M.P.A.S. had a problem: What to name best picture of the year before? High-art dramatic pictures like ""The Turning Point,"" ""Julia,"" and ""Equus,"" didn't really capture anyone's fancy the way previous winners had. And the films that did grab people by the throat were too mass-market for the elite's comfort: ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind,"" and especially ""Star Wars."" Out of duress, the Oscars were then forced to do something it rarely did before: Choose a comedy.<br/><br/>It was thus a perfect year for ""Annie Hall,"" Allen's latest comedy, of a more serious bent than his past comedies but still laugh-out-loud funny. Woody plays Alvy Singer, a stand-up comic who starts the film telling the audience he just turned 40 and is feeling down after breaking up with his latest girlfriend, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). The film then goes back to examine that relationship from its beginning through their development as a couple until a fateful moment aboard a plane when they realize what they have on their hands is not love but a dead shark.<br/><br/>I like ""Annie Hall,"" a lot more often than not. It's not a terribly engaging story, but it contains brilliant comic episodes. You feel immediately affected by Annie as Alvy is, seeing in her not the typical Diane Keaton of past Allen comedies, but someone more vulnerable and alert. The acting is stupendous, very real-feeling line readings that come across like spying on our part. And there is the rare gift of seeing a relationship end, not with recrimination, but a sense of mature grace.<br/><br/>A lot of people say ""Annie Hall"" is Allen's best film. I don't. For pure comedy, ""Sleeper,"" made before, was funnier and a better story besides. Later on, I'd choose ""Zelig"" and ""Hannah And Her Sisters"" over this, and others who have seen them mention ""Manhattan"" and ""Crimes And Misdemeanors."" It was just that 1977 was a good year for a comedy, and Woody Allen had a good comedy out. If it didn't go to him, it would have been Neil Simon's ""The Goodbye Girl"" instead, at least according to my theory.<br/><br/>People say this was the last time Allen made a real comedy, and I agree more with that, but not completely. What happened was that this was the last time Allen made a comedy for everyone, albeit one about the cultural elite. After ""Annie Hall,"" he made films for the cultural elite alone. He later made films more for laughs than ""Annie Hall,"" but not before shedding most of his wider audience with films like ""Interiors"" and ""Stardust Memories."" ""Annie Hall"" is about relationships, with which we can all identify. It contains five or six of his best-known quotes, and funniest situations. Some parts of the film have aged better than others. I still get a big laugh out of the lobster incident and the his/her dichotomy over ""three times a week."" I keep my opinions to myself in theater lobbies out of fear someone will drag out Marshall McLuhan. Parts of the movie, like Keaton singing ""Seems Like Old Times,"" appeals to me more now than it did then.<br/><br/>It would be a better film if the relationship with Annie had as much of a window on her life as it does on his, if there was more done with the Tony Roberts character other than a handful of droll conversations, and if Woody's social commentary was more spot on, rather than revealing how isolated he was getting. Witness his takes on rock music or West Coast culture, which feel horribly narrow.<br/><br/>But you have to love a film that sets up Paul Simon as the other guy, draws laughs from ""The Sorrow And The Pity"", and plays with narrative structure in such an accessible style. I don't think ""Annie Hall"" the best film of 1977, but have no problem with its selection. Woody and comedy got their due."

","****/**** - A masterpiece! Starring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts.<br/><br/>Directed by Woody Allen.<br/><br/>""Annie Hall"" is a hilarious and compelling romantic comedy. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, a neurotic and constantly nervous comedian who has a close relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Annie is equally neurotic, but besides this factor she's mostly opposite to Alvy in many other ways. The film shows Alvy in the aftermath of the relationship, when he is trying to discover what it was that made them drift apart. Through this, the film shows their entire relationship from the beginning, and its ups and downs. Annie Hall is an enormously important movie that is the greatest romantic comedy of all time. The screenplay is truly inspired and has numerous cultural references and is comically brilliant.

","If any one piece of work made Woody the chief target of ""Real Men Don't Eat Quiche"", this is it. <br/><br/>Prior to this (as the 'actor') he played in the space between the movie reality and us - a territory upon which no one else 'in the movie' could trespass. He surrounded himself with characters who were oblivious to the satire, and the jokes centered on pinging away at the 'movie reality'.<br/><br/>Here we have Woody 'playing himself' (under a pseudonym), which isn't really playing...he just ""is"" a bundle of neuroses, and that's enough. But the equation is completely rearranged. This time, Woody frames the movie with a performance to us; he plays within the movie to us; he draws characters from within the movie to join him in 'the movie in his head'; he shifts the narrative from present to past and back, at times for his past, at times for Keaton's 'past'; he plays within the movie to Keaton, which is the only thing resembling a 'story'. However, there's NO satire - every cultural target appears exactly as it really is. Taking the brunt of the hits are the New York intelligentsia, and later, the L.A. Sybarites. It's the rather ingenious multi-layered construction that makes this fly.<br/><br/>This is the basis the of the entire ""Seinfeld"" series, and the launching pad for countless New York stories - e.g., ""When Harry Met Sally"".<br/><br/>Novel, scattershot, mostly brilliant."

Somewhere along the movie, amidst the sketches of phonies, you start smelling some amount of Catcher in the Rye.

","Whether a relationship is good or bad it is almost impossible to forget. There are those that leave lasting impressions and those that hardly scratch the surface, but all leave something behind. There are memories of the good times, memories of the bad times, memories of the times you wished you did something different, and memories of the things you want to take back. If only there was a way to revisit the past.<br/><br/>Woody Allen uses the best tool available: film. Through film, Allen shows us what happened prior, during, and after his relationship with Annie Hall in the film of the same name that turned Allen into a real film maker. Allen wrote, directed, and starred in this odd romance. Allen and Diane Keaton star as Alvy and Annie, a couple living in New York City. Alvy is a fairly well known comedian and Keaton is a singer. This isn't a linear storyline by any means. The film begins with the end and Alvy saying what is going on and how he got there. From there it is a glimpse at his childhood and the events leading up to his relationship with Annie.<br/><br/>Allen's witty, neurotic sense of humor makes the smallest of difficulties seem monumental. Cooking lobster or trying to have sex becomes of war of words with the wise cracking Alvy. Unlike a normal storyline, this is all a flashback. Allen is telling the story as a narrator, but not in the usual way of narrating. In the midst of a scene Allen will pull away from the film and talk to the audience, as do other characters on the street.<br/><br/>Allen's performance is superb. Keaton, who received an Academy Award for her role, is a free spirited, strong willed companion for Allen. Coupled with Allen's knack for writing, the two comic giants feed off of each other's energy to present a wonderful, dynamic couple. No clichÃ© conversations, no unnecessary scenes, just what is needed to tell this modern love story. Allen stays away from the standard formula of making a romantic comedy, instead breaking the mold for the genre.<br/><br/>Annie Hall works on many levels. Its unique presentation of the story, the Academy Award Winning screenplay, its timeless characters, and of course, Woody Allen, for whom this film wouldn't be possible. Without Allen's inspiration, Annie Hall would have fallen in line with all the other love story's and become just another title in the sea that is cinema.<br/><br/>Winner of four Academy Awards (actress, screenplay, director, picture), Annie Hall has made it's mark on the art of film making. It continues to be hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time, including this critic. <br/><br/>Allen has directed over 40 pictures, all with there own unique style and flare. Annie Hall, without a doubt, is the film that will be remembered. It gave the world something to laugh at and understand."
"ingres77","7","0","1","8 May 2006"," Profundity and Pretension clash in Allen's seminal work
","My problem with Annie Hall has little to do with the movie itself, but more to do with the accessibility of it. I consider myself a fairly intelligent man, being able to hold my own in most discussions I come across. Though, I don't often come across New York intellectuals. Which is the problem, here.<br/><br/>Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) frequently tells Alvy (Woody Allen) that he's too smart for her, or that he thinks she's too dumb for him. That's how I felt watching the film - that I was too dumb for Woody Allen. Is that really the feeling you want to convey in your audience? It's not Allen's intelligence that's the problem, it's the snobbish flamboyance of it. In my opinion, wit (which this film has) goes further towards establishing intelligence than lengthy monologues on Fellini ever will.<br/><br/>There's a magnificent scene in the film where Annie and Alvy are standing in line at the movies. Behind them is an academic espousing on the merits of various writers and filmmakers (such as Fellini) to the annoyance of Alvy. This leads to an aside to the audience in which both characters(Alvy and the academic) debate their right to be annoyed or speak their opinion, respectively. To me, this scene is a bit of a microcosm of the movie, with Woody Allen taking the place of the academic and me taking the place of Alvy.<br/><br/>The difference being: I'm not arguing that Allen doesn't ""get it"" (as Alvy does in the scene in the movie). I'm arguing that this script comes off as pretentious - lording its great intellect over us more common folk. For this viewer, it prevents any real feeling developing for the characters. Watching the film, I can't help but be an observer - not a participant. I'm not drawn into the movie, made to feel as though I'm part of this man's life. I feel like I'm looking through the window at a crumbling marriage.<br/><br/>I don't identify with anyone on screen - because I've never met anyone who talks like the characters in this movie. I don't know anyone who talks with this much wit or intelligence.<br/><br/>Both of which can be found throughout this film.<br/><br/>This may come off as a bit insane, but I prefer When Harry Met Sally... to this. This brilliant and popular film borrowed heavily from the style of Annie Hall - with one key difference: the characters were likable. I knew them - because I've met people like them, and see them in myself (to one degree or another). When Harry Met Sally... is Annie Hall with a heart.<br/><br/>I had few laughs in this film. Intellectually, I knew the film was funny. But my reactions were limited to observations. ""Isn't that funny."" Or, ""Allen's a brilliant writer."" I never had legitimate laughs, though I did snicker a couple of times.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think the reason Allen has not appealed to wider audiences is for this reason - his films have too much intelligence, and not enough heart. One of his biggest influences is Ingmar Bergman, which comes as no surprise. Because Bergman is a highly intelligent man, who made highly intelligent films that (for me) lacked emotion and heart (with the exclusion of a few of his films). Bergman is more cerebral, less erudite than Allen (or at least, his scripts are). Bergman's work was more about analyzing life/death through philosophical film-making. Allen's focus seems to be more on overwhelming the audience with his New York intellectualism.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, I think this is one of the landmark films of the 1970s - following a long line of important films. While I don't put it on the same level as The Godfather, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter or others, it should be seen by all cinephiles who haven't already seen it."

","The way Woody Allen used the camera to his advantage in the film added a lot to Annie Hall. When he directly addressed the camera as he was portraying his thoughts, it helped us understand what he was thinking. The other way he used it was to tell past stories. Both these ways added to the effect the movie had on the person watching it.<br/><br/>When Woody Allen stepped aside and talked directly to the camera and portrayed his thoughts about the scene at hand it helped me to understand what was going on. When he stepped back and addressed the camera it was like he was narrating the action going on to help us understand better. I thought this technique added a lot to the movie because the movie was all about his life and by addressing the camera we were able to hear his direct thoughts so it was like we were actually living his life. This technique really showed that the whole movie was about him because in every situation we got his perspective on it.<br/><br/>The second way he used the camera was to narrate past stories. This helped the plot out a lot because it showed us exactly what went on. We didn't have to listen to a story about Alvy Singer's past life; we could see it first hand and really experience it. By doing this we were able to understand his past a lot better then if we just heard him telling us about it. It also helped that he was in the background like a ghost narrating out what was going on in the scene. Between these two things we were able to get a very accurate picture of Alvy's past. So both these camera techniques that Woody Allen used to tell Alvy Singer's story were great ideas because they helped out a lot in the telling and understanding of the story line."
"jcoolum","8","0","1","28 April 2006"," Allen and Keaton are great
","I had never seen Annie Hall until this past week. Many famous critics of the film industry have critically acclaimed this film. I have only seen one other Woody Allen film before, Love and Death (1975). With this film, I was first introduced to the director, the writer, the actor, the comedian, Woody Allen. I must say that I enjoyed Love and Death and its philosophy about the meaning of life, love, and, of course, death. I noticed from Love and Death that Woody Allen often comments on the philosophical and psychological aspects of life in his films. Annie Hall is no different. There are many different facets to Annie Hall that make it a unique romantic comedy from those we see in theaters today.<br/><br/>The film follows a struggling comedian, Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), and his many adventures with women, especially this one sort of eccentric woman named Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). The film does not seem to abide by the rules of continuity because Allen goes back and forth in time whenever it suits him and the story. The film begins with him telling the story and soon flashes back to his childhood. Most times, characters are looking on the action that takes place in the past and they even interact with the characters involved in the flashback. For example, Alvy has a flashback to when he was a child in elementary school. We first see the young actor who portrays the young Alvy (Jonathan Munk) but in the middle of the scene, we see Woody Allen, playing the adult Alvy, conversing with his elementary school teacher. There are several instances where Allen uses this technique of storytelling.<br/><br/>Even though the film essentially centers on the vicissitudes of Alvy and Annie's relationship, it is almost difficult to follow the action. The lack of continuity from scene to scene makes it difficult to know what scene occurs chronologically. Near the end of the film, the continuity becomes much better. Allen also uses some camera techniques that, up until that time, were not widely used. One perfect example would be Allen's use of a split screen. In one scene, both Alvy and Annie are shown seeing their respective psychiatrists, whom they both call their ""analysts,"" and both exchange what appears to be dialogue between them and their analysts but the analysts do not speak, so we only hear Alvy and Annie talking. Today, it is common to see a scene such as this one, but in 1977, these kinds of affects were not widely used.<br/><br/>Annie Hall appears to comment on social culture. Alvy and Annie both live in New York City and Alvy seems very content on staying there. Annie, later in the film, gets the opportunity to live in Los Angeles, California and she jumps at the idea, while Alvy is reluctant. They both leave New York in order to visit California. Annie seems in her own environment, whereas Alvy actually makes himself sick and he complains the whole trip. Alvy also seems very neurotic and paranoid about everything. He always thinks that someone is being anti-Semitic, he always obsesses about death, and he always appears depressed. At a certain point, Annie tells Alvy how she perceives his view on life: ""Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that?"" which describes the character of Alvy, as well as Woody Allen persona in general, exactly.<br/><br/>Allen wants to convey the large culture gap between the East coast of the United States with the West coast with this film. Annie Hall comments on two very different cultures that exist in the United States. Annie tends to represent the Californian culture with her quest for fame and her love of fame. She is trying to become a renowned singer and Alvy seems perfectly content with the way things are. Alvy represents a New York mindset with his seclusion from the rest of the country. New York is such a unique place where people appear to be less interested in being social; this is what Alvy accentuates. In the same conversation where Annie tells Alvy he incapable of enjoying life she tells him: ""I mean you're like New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself."" This explains how Annie perceives Alvy and it expresses to the audience that Alvy will never change. At the end of the film, Alvy and Annie break up for good, but remain friends. We understand that Alvy will never change and that even though Alvy and Annie love each other, they were too different to ever stay together, which is a little saddening.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the film is great. The acting is wonderful with Woody Allen and Diane Keaton giving great performances. The film is very funny and it deals with subjects that may not have been the norm in 1977. Allen is very free when he deals with sex and drugs in the film as he usually makes fun of both of them. I love the camera angles that Allen had cinematographer Gordon Willis (The Godfather) utilize. There is one shot where Alvy and his friend Rob (Tony Roberts) are walking on the sidewalk talking. The actors are far away from the camera, but we can still hear them as if they were standing next to it. The camera never moves as both Alvy and Rob slowly approach it. What a great camera effect. Annie Hall was very good and some say it is Woody Allen's best film. It is a very refreshing romantic comedy as opposed to those seen today, which tend to be formulaic and predictable. Everyone should see Annie Hall."

","Woody Allen's neuroses and introspection were never so finely presented as they are in the classic 'Annie Hall'.<br/><br/>He stars as Alvy Singer, a paranoid New Yorker comedian Jew with a decidedly neurotic view on life. After breaking up with his girlfriend Annie Hall (Diane Keaton, in an Oscar-winning performance), Alvy recounts their relationship, his life and his problems.<br/><br/>This is one of those 'stream of consciousness' films that viewers began to lap up in the 70's. There is a very little narrative structure to the thing, and Allen breaks many boundaries. He often speaks directly to the camera, asking questions of the viewer as well as himself. Animation and out-of-body experiences are also present in this odd mix of a film. I can't really put my finger on what distinguishes this film as a classic, apart from Diane Keaton's wonderful performance and the great script.<br/><br/>At times it is overly neurotic and veers off into unnecessary places, but Keaton brings us back every time. I enjoyed the film most when Annie was at the forefront, being all quirky and nonsensical. The overall product is bittersweet, with Alvy reminiscing the good times he has had with Annie but realising things cannot go back to what they once were. He's a Pygmalion figure, moulding and teaching Annie Hall, but inevitably she outgrows him and must move on. Still, the experience was worth it for Alvy and Allen's overall message is clear: Love's worth it, even if it hurts."

","Virtually every line in ""Annie Hall"" is funny, and virtually every funny line is brilliant. The advantage of watching the movie today on DVD or VHS is that you can rewind to hear the dialog repeated, whereas in 1977 when the film came out, I probably missed a good five minutes trying to recover from the lobster behind the refrigerator scene. You know, the one about using a dish of melted butter and a nutcracker to scare the lobster out of hiding. It's impossible not to picture that, and when I do, I hit the floor rolling.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, watching the film today it doesn't seem dated. Perhaps Annie's (Diane Keaton) wardrobe is, a definite product of the Seventies, but the nuances of love and life's miseries resonate strongly in the story. It's the story of Everyman and Everywoman just trying to get along and have some fun along the way, in a world divided into two parts, the horrible and the miserable.<br/><br/>Irony of ironies, who could have known at the time that Frank Sinatra's appearance to Annie in a dream could have real life repercussions almost two decades later, though it wouldn't be Annie the Chairman would want to suffocate.<br/><br/>Hey, was that Mick Jagger at the party?"

So many pieces to this have been analyzed, it would be pointless to re-hash them. You either get them or you don't. Falling in love is as complex as it gets in life. And this has to rank right up near the top as one of the best relationship pictures ever made. The anger, bitterness, jealousy, frustration, manipulation, selfishness, wonder, awe, beauty; everything is shown and dissected with Allen's superb use of the ""cut up"" technique. Fragments all bunched together in different time frames and points of view. To make up a whole. The humor found here inevitably somehow always turns sad. It's the first of Woody's comedies that casually mixes the funny with the poignant, so you're left both choked up and amused. Probably his best cast, with a glowing Diane Keaton at her daffy infectious peak.

","This is in my Top 10 so don't look for any criticism in this comment. Woody as Alvey Singer and Diane Keaton as Annie run through all the phases of a romance and provide background commentary for marriages. Long before all the psychobabble of Dr. Phil and ""Men are from Mars"", Woody said it all in this movie. From the split-screen therapy sessions of the two discussing their frequency of sexual activities to how they handle their breakup and reconciliation as friends Woody has nailed down real life.<br/><br/>He lampoons Hollywood culture wonderfully and gets people like Paul Simon to play along. Although I don't like the ""NYC as the end all of civilization"" attitude that Woody has in virtually every film he has made, I have to appreciate the job he does of encapsulating it in this movie where he says something like ""the highest expression of culture in CA is a 'right-on-red' "" (in traffic). He does point out the vacuous nature of the entertainment culture (exemplified by CA / LA) and many of its denizens.<br/><br/>Throughout this film Woody hits on nearly every aspect of love and romance. The initial playfulness, full-on lust, the special moments that you will only have with that one person, the typical breakup (where one withdraws emotionally but keeps denying it until it is all too obvious), the longing for your lost love and the attempts at re-creating those special times with new people. I ask you, did he miss anything? I've seen the movie (or parts of it) at least 2-3 dozen times and always ask myself that question. If you read any self help books on marriage problems (I admit to reading a few) and then see Annie Hall again you can't help but feel that Woody has touched on most of the issues in a funny and expert way - and you don't have to wade through 15 examples of ""how couples argue"" or ""how much sex is enough"" or have some phony doctor (who has been married 3 or 4 times himself or herself) giving ""relationship"" advice and exercises.

","Intelligent and still fresh to this very day. The amount of movies it has inspired is amazing - When Harry Met Sally (1989) probably being my favourite comparison.<br/><br/>But with Annie Hall, there isn't really a comparison. It is the best romantic comedy ever. What was initially a three hour long film, called Anhedonia, was cut down to the succinct hour and half comedy we have with us today. The non-linear narrative really gives this film an edge on other comedies. It feels like memories of a relationship, being remembered in patches.<br/><br/>Diana Keaton is great as the titular character, Annie Hall. Teeming with flaws, and quirkiness, Keaton creates a fully believable character - one that is enhanced even more by the appearance of Alvy Singer, Woody's character. Woody Allen is so funny in this movie, possibly Allen at his creative best. The jokes are intelligent, they move along well, and are - most importantly - varied. The subtitle scene, or where Alvy goes to Annie's house for dinner - and Grammy the Jew hater sees him - oh, it's just classic.<br/><br/>I can't say any more than that. It really is funny - there are too many moments to mention. It is well acted, written and directed, with great pacing. If you are a Woody fan, I can't think of many comparisons to Annie Hall. Manhattan, another classic, is nothing like this movie, instead opting for a more melancholy mood. It isn't a period piece like the average Curse of the Jade Scorpion or the fantastic Purple Rose of Cairo. Annie Hall really is unique in his collection, with inventive jokes, the lively nature of the story and the way it involves the audience. Although people call this film romantic, it is actually quite the opposite at the end. Similar to Manhattan in that respect, but at least Annie Hall contained more laughs.<br/><br/>You won't feel cold watching this movie. Go and get it now, it is fantastic cinema."

","So rarely does a film manage to be neurotically hilarious and at the<br/><br/>same time say something so profound and poignant. Through its inventive cinematography it discusses the hardships and elations of relationships without deteriorating into schmaltz or melodrama.<br/><br/>It is also an instructive social document capturing that cultural moment in American history just after the disenchantment with the<br/><br/>sixties revolution and a bit before the emergence of the Yuppies<br/><br/>eighties. By far, one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all times, the<br/><br/>consummate postmodern film, and a moving one as well."

","This is one of the greatest films Woody Allen would ever do. I Think is his beast one, than came Zelig, or something like this. And is a little bit better than ""Manhatten"".<br/><br/>And in the last is Diane Keaton who makes this wounderful comedy to an great moment in the history of cinema..Here nice expression of the chaotic Annie Hall never would be forgotten. In Germany the film is called: ""Der Stadtneurotiker"" who is a wrong title.. because much Woddy Allen Film can have this title, about there is only one Annie Hall."

"khakifrog","10","0","1","12 December 2003"," Best Woody Allen movie ever.
","Not only is this the best movie Woody Allen ever made, it is one of the best romantic comedies. The relationship between the main characters, although dysfunctional, is absolutely magical. More than just a well written relationship study, Hall is an original study in film. Many of the narrative devices used were fresh and innovative when originally released. The movie still feels fresh and will be treasured for generations."
"perfectbond","8","0","1","10 December 2003"," Terrific writing
","I love the writing in this film. It is charming, witty, and often very humorous. The literary, religious, and cinematic references were very much appreciated. And of course the writing's full vitality is reached because of the performances of Allen and Keaton primarily. It takes such strong material to make the generally unheroic appearance of Allen sympathetic. If you are ever in the mood to wash out the bad taste of the latest mindless special effects blockbuster, I suggest popping the erudite Annie Hall into your DVD player 8/10."

","I figure Woody peaked with this one. The New York Angst thing doesn't play well outside New York and college towns. He rehashed several of his idea since then with Selig being his only high point since. Finally his lifestyle put me off so I haven't seen any of the recent ones, nor will I."
"blando3","Null","0","2","25 August 2002"," okay, but not woody allen's best
","I had heard so much about this film and had seen several of Woody Allen's films when I finally rented Annie Hall.  I was surprised to find that it was actually kind of boring.  I didn't care about the love story, and i didn't understand what the big deal about Annie Hall was(why name the movie after her?).  It had some laughs, with Woody Allen playing himself as usual, but I thought Manhattan and Bullets Over Broadway were far more interesting and funny (I admit I've only seen 6 of his films).  I  would recommend it, but don't expect this to be Woody Allen's best."

","Everybody cites this film as a Woody Allen favorite, I really can't agree, though I'd concede it was a critical milestone in his ongoing evolution as a great American writer/director.  It has a few good laughs, a few insights into Woody's psyche (though these are not necessarily general insights), but in the end it doesn't really leave you with much to take away.  I liked ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" much better, it has all the laughs and insights ""Annie Hall"" had but is  much, much deeper, and it leaves you with a life-affirming and *positive* ending unlike most of his movies before!"
"andrew7","10","0","1","25 January 2002"," Essential Woody
","This was the film that made me a fan of Woody Allen.  It wasn't the first Allen film I'd seen (I saw Deconstructing Harry in theaters before I knew anything at all about Woody Allen), but it made me a fan for life.  This film contains everything modern viewers tend to associate with Allen's work: great dialogue, wonderful humor, elements of philosophy, and a playful, inventive tone.  ""Annie Hall"" is the perfect expression of Allen's overall style.  It is the benchmark against which all his other films are and should be judged.  It is his supreme artistic achievement.  <br/><br/>It's a wonderful movie.  Uproariously funny in places, but also heartfelt, poignant, touching, warm, and sad.  Alvy Singer is an instantly likeable character.  The first scene, Alvy talking directly to the audience against an empty background, perfectly sets the tone of the film.  It is the ultimate expression of unreality.  Here we have a character, who explicitly refers to himself as a character (i.e., this is not Woody Allen providing a prologue to a film about Alvy Singer, this is Alvy Singer), talking directly to the audience, from where?  From no place.  <br/><br/>It's not unheard of for a character to talk to the audience.  ""Alfie"", for instance, uses this device throughout.  But usually, there are rules attached.  In ""Alfie"", the title character talks to the audience constantly, but no one else can here what he says.  Occasionally, he gets confused, and says something to another character that he meant to say to us, which they can hear.  But in ""Annie Hall"", this device has no rules whatsoever.  It's entirely haphazard.  Whereas when Alfie steps out of a scene, he becomes removed entirely from the other characters, when Alvy steps out of a scene, Annie might join him.  Or she might not.  (Hmm, Alvy... Alfie... connection?)  <br/><br/>Anyway, the whimsical approach to a very human, universally identifiable story, is precisely what makes the film so magical.  What makes this film so special is the variety of the techniques employed.  We've talked about direct monologue already, but we also get conversations across a split screen, characters physically moving through and interacting with their own flashbacks, animation... you name it!  Gimmickry?  Well, I don't think so, but I would understand if you did.  This manipulation of the form of the film is absolutely essential, in my opinion, to the fullest exploration of the central character (who is not Annie Hall, but Alvy Singer.... we end up knowing comparatively little about Annie by the end of the film).   <br/><br/>
I could go on all day about this extraordinary film, but I'll stop instead. If you haven't seen it yet, do it!!  At the very least, it's incredibly funny."
"Chris-147","7","0","1","16 May 2001"," Quite dull
","Annie Hall was the first Woody Allen film I watched. I expected a funny and fast paced movie, but this film just didn't connect. As others have mentioned; at a certain point in the film you expect something to happen...but nothing does.<br/><br/>I don't think this is a completely bad movie. Some of the scenes are quite original, s.a. the scene were Alvy's having dinner with Annie's parents. But overall I think Annie Hall did not deserve all the praise and credit it got."
"Jordan Baker-3","10","0","1","26 November 2000"," I love it, I lurve it, I luff it
","I saw Annie Hall for the first time when I was in 5th grade. At the time I didn't understand much of it, but I still thought it was excellant. I saw it again the next year and I liked it even better. I have seen it now numerous times, and it gets better and funnier every time I see it. It is my all time favorite film, and it makes me sick to my stomach knowing that many kids my age have never seen it, let alone know who Woody Allen is. This movie is not only one of the funniest I've ever seen, but also one of the greatest love stories ever recorded on film. Forget Casablanca or Citizen Kane, Annie Hall gets my vote for best picture. I love the all the jokes in the script, which I might add, is one of the best I've ever read, but also I think the acting in it is just fabulous. So if you don't mind me saying so- I'll pick Annie Hall over Gone With the Wind any time."

It is a classic tale of Woody falling for Diane Keaton and how their relationship plays out.  Filled with classic scenes /(the lobster, the spider, the sneeze) and cameos of future stars like Jeff Goldblum and Sigourney Weaver.Diane Keaton's wardrobe started a trend so this movies influences are many A must see for smart moviegoers..winner of Best Picture in 1977.. on a scale of one to ten..10"

","The next time you feel tempted to shell out  for the latest Romantic comedy from Meg Ryan/Julia Roberts/Sandra Bullock, do yourself a favor and go rent Annie Hall instead.  There is not another romantic comedy that can compare to Woody Allen's masterpiece in the way of wit, warmth, and impact.  Some of the scenes may seem cliched, but that's only because film makers have borrowed liberally from this gem ever since."
"jacqui-3","8","0","1","23 July 1999"," Neurotic New Yawkers I couldn't relate to...but the point is taken and appreciated............
","Annie Hall thrives on Allen's comic bantering and developing characters as richly as their own narrowness and shortcomings would allow (the only non-cardboard characters are really Annie and Alvie themselves...but Marshall McLuhan has a cameo!) I particularly enjoyed the way the characters' childhood trauma, relationship sore-spots, and personal psyche are played out, while they are on-screen watching themselves and talking to us about themselves. Very theatre-like. One favorite moment is the montage sequence of Alvie's frustration at his stalling romance with Annie, reinforced by shots of a young Alvie going bananas at the bumper cars. Freud would probably have loved breaking apart Annie Hall ;-)<br/><br/>The film tells Alvie and Annie's relationship in multiple flashbacks and vignette-episodes. This drives home the point of their personalities. It's also VERY effective in giving you a migraine from its neurotic structure and characters. This being Woody Allen, I expected a lot of laughs and was not disappointed. The ending is quite bittersweet and the best way, not over-sentimental or romanticized, to conclude a humorous look at relationships."
"Chezo","10","0","2","14 July 1999"," overrated
","this movie is great, no question about it but as a Woody Allen fan I think has been highly overrated. I don´t even think it is on Woody Allen´s top 10 best movies. If you want to see his best film, see ""The Purple Rose of Cairo""his truly great masterpiece. And his other top 10 films, ""Shadows and Fog"", ""Alice"", ""Broadway Danny Rose"", Deconstructing Harry"",""Zelig"", ""Husbands and Wives"",and the justified overrated gems ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and ""Manhattan"". This movie presented relationship differently from many films, maybe that´s why it succeeded so much, Diane Keaton is brilliant here and there´s an interesting cameo from Paul Simon, See it enjoy it, but you know Woody has done a lot better, but if you want to introduce yourself to Woody´s movies, this films and ""Hannah""are the best choices since are the most popular and accessible of Woody´s films"
"beyonder","Null","0","1","26 March 1999"," The King of Comedy
","Woody Allen is the North America's greatest intellectual comedian. No one is able to create comedy with is wit and verve for the metaphysical and philosophical, interspersed with heavy does of freudian motifs concerning sex. This film was particularly important, when I broke up with my girl friend. Even though it was an amicable parting, I still felt gloomy. But in watching this film, it was therapy to feel liberated and proud that we know the people we know in life. It is resonant in its appeal to those who understand the true complications of relationships, and our own ego-centric desires that are helpful and hurtful in our quest for love. Woody is the verbal actualizer for those with an intellectual feel for comedy and life."
"magda-5","10","0","1","13 January 1999"," just watch it...
","Anybody who considers himself a movie freak should see Allen's Annie Hall. This is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable films ever made.  I am Woody Allen's great fan and have seen a lot of his works.  Annie Hall is unique, filled with brilliant dialogues which makes you laugh no matter how often you hear them.  Quickly running sequence of events makes us realize the fragility of our relationships.  It's all about our lives, perfect mirror of our everyday ridiculous behaviour.  Woody certainly knows how to turn it over, take this and that, mix it, squeeze it, put some irony in it and create a masterpiece.  Stunning appearance of Diane Keaton (I dare to say it's her best role) speaks for itself.  Can't miss it."
