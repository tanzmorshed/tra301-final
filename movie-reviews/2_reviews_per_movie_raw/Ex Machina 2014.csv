","This movie is obviously allegorical, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulation and power. It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no ""stars"" appeared in ""Ex Machina"" and ""Eva"", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal."

","Ex Machina has a very fitting sense of false intimacy. This is done visually as many of the close-ups are seen through glass. No matter how close we get to the subject on-screen, there always seems to be at least one wall of glass between us and it or them. The film also makes a very distinct contrast between it's interior and exterior shots. Outside of the facility is breathtaking landscapes. It is big, beautiful, refreshing and vibrant. Inside seems like an endless futuristic maze of glass, mirrors, plastic, chrome and dim lights. It is clean, cold and claustrophobic. A perfect setting for the subject that is explored in this tight, tense sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is the best science fiction film on artificial intelligence since Blade Runner. While Blade Runner is an action thriller that relies more on it's epic visuals to tell it's story, Ex Machina is a dialogue-driven psychological thriller that slowly works it's way under your skin. Thought-provoking and terrifyingly suspenseful, an induced state of paranoia may linger long after the end credits begin to roll.<br/><br/>The less you know going into a film like this, the better your experience will be. Alex Garland has given us a modern science-fiction masterpiece. Performances from all three leads are flawless and every other aspect of the production, from the cinematography to the soundtrack, is perfectly suited for the story. Not only is Ex Machina an amazing achievement for a directorial debut, it's Alex Garland's best written work to-date."
"bob-the-movie-man","8","522","715","26 January 2015"," I think therefore am I?
","Ex Machina has a simple story dealing with a deeply complex and philosophical topic: namely what makes humans human.<br/><br/>The increasingly omnipresent Oscar Isaac plays billionaire Nathan Bates, genius creator of 'Google' - my mistake - 'BlueBook', the world's ""leading search engine"". Bates lives in the middle of the American wilderness (in reality, a very picturesque Norway) and in a property that actually exists (BlueBook the Juvet Hotel). He is leading a one-man research project into the development of an Artificial Intelligence. Leading neatly on from the recent Cumbur-busting ""The Imitation Game"" the eccentric and erratic Nathan needs to share his work with someone external in order to perform 'The Turing Test' - the test to determine if a machine can genuinely pass itself off as human to another human.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson' character (Caleb) works for BlueBook and wins the Wonka Golden Ticket to spend a week with Nathan, becoming the human side of the test. Ava is the beautiful and seductive android subject and the film clinically walks through the sessions between Caleb and Ava, watched over by Nathan via the villa's comprehensive CCTV system. The only other significant character in the film is Nathan's house maid Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), who neither understands nor speaks English so drifts silently around offering various 'services'.<br/><br/>We have been here before: Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and Spielberg's ""AI"" both covered similar ground, but in perhaps a less claustrophobic manner than Ex Machina. This serves the story well, ramping up the tension as an age old Sci-fi plot-point emerges (as covered by the trailer): how will a sentient machine feel about having its plug pulled. (No rain or doves are included in this one).<br/><br/>The acting is all up to snuff, with Isaac - this time hiding behind a Brian Blessed-style bushy beard - looking and acting for all the world like George Clooney. Domhnall Gleeson (""About Time"", ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" and getting all the roles that Paul Bettany is now too old for) makes the journey well from nice but naive employee to a much more world-wise freedom-fighter. Swedish-born Alicia Vikander, currently also leading in ""Testament of Youth"", is deliciously sensual as Ava (albeit - and trust me to notice this - that her significant assets seem to vary in size during the movie). She is also an excellent actress, having to reflect a wide range of emotions through little else than her eyes.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. However, that is on the basis that Science Fiction is one of my favourite genres: I can see some audiences finding the philosophical plotting too slow and wordy to hold their interest. But if you like your films deep and thought-provoking, as well as deliciously tense in places, then this might be for you.<br/><br/>The writer and director is Alex Garland, and this is actually his impressive directorial debut. He is of course best known as a writer, having penned the novel of ""The Beach"" and the screenplays for films including ""28 Days Later"", ""Sunshine"" and ""Never Let Me Go"". Also hats off to the special effects crew (led by Richard Conway) since Ava is a miracle of visual effects. The effective keyboard score is by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury.<br/><br/>The film pleasingly doesn't outstay its welcome, also leaving some loose ends to ponder on after the lights come on and the screeching credits song (sorry, but it's just AWFUL!) drives you from the auditorium. Also be aware that for those offended by full frontal female nudity, or indeed those that enjoy it, that there is a good deal of it in this film. (Lads, practise the excuse now: ""But it's fine dear - - she's not a naked women she's a robot!"").<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see the multi-media version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to receive future posts.

","""Ex Machina"" deals with a familiar theme in a very unique way. It doesn't bombard you with effects or superficial action (although the robot effects are exceptional). Rather, its focus and beauty lie in the subtle and nuanced performances of its tiny cast as the film explores what it means to be human.<br/><br/>Quiet dialogue scenes between two characters are filmed in such an impactful, making them feel hauntingly austere, sweet and innocent, or terrible and frightening, through meticulous use of composition, light and sound. The film really does run the gamut of emotions, surprisingly funny one minute and gut-wrenchingly tense and weird the next, while the script twists and turns, constantly unsettling your assumptions about what will happen. <br/><br/>The performances are excellent, most notably Alicia Vikander as the beguiling Ava, who absolutely passes for being 'almost human'. Her precise movements -walking, standing or stooping to pull on a pair of stockings- have just that slight tinge of the uncanny about them to suggest a mechanical skeleton, yet she is undeniably seductive. You can really understand Caleb's mental plight as she begins to show signs of a sexual interest in him!<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson also delivers a quiet and focused performance as Caleb, which reflects much of the film's over all style. Like Ava, he is relatable, yet has this slight autistic aloofness about him, in complete contrast to the boorish, reckless Nathan (Oscar Isaac). <br/><br/>The dialogue feels real and non-cliché. The pacing for the most part is measured, although one or two scenes might move a little slower than they need to.<br/><br/>The ending probably will not satisfy everyone, and admittedly left me a feeling a bit cold, but it certainly didn't follow the route I was expecting. Overall I found it to be enthralling and disturbing stuff."
"Red-Barracuda","9","224","323","25 January 2015"," Very involving bit of pure sci-fi
","A reclusive CEO of a leading technology company hires a young whiz kid who works for him to test his latest development, a highly advanced android called Ava. Specifically he is tasked with using the Turing test on her to establish if her AI is sufficiently convincing to pass as human.<br/><br/>Despite contributing several scripts for the screen, this is writer Alex Garland's first directorial effort. It's a hard sci-fi movie which examines concepts and ideas above everything else. That's not to say it isn't dramatic or even thrilling because it is both of those things as well but the focus is squarely on the science fiction speculation, and this is a very welcome thing. The central concept that it examines is artificial intelligence. How we interact with AI as humans, as well as how a seductive machine could in turn manipulate us. The very well written script poses philosophical questions such as is there moral or immoral ways to treat AI. It also considers if sometimes part of being human is that we sometimes subconsciously want to be fooled by an illusion, if it is attractive enough.<br/><br/>In many ways Ex Machina resembles last years Under the Skin. Both feature highly advanced female non-humans. In the earlier film Scarlett Johansson played an alien, here Alicia Vikander plays an android. While the very small cast all acquit themselves very well, it is Vikander who stands out in the film's most challenging role. It's a nuanced performance that captures the fine balance between the human-like and machine. Not only this but the marvellous special effects compliment this performance to create a very distinctive character. Aside from the effects, this is probably quite a modestly budgeted film, as the small little-known cast and limited sets suggest. But these restrictions have been used to the films advantage, as the unknown cast surprise more given little is known of them and the restricted setting gives off a claustrophobic feel which works well, while forcing us to focus in even more on the ideas being put in front of us. A scene setting ambient soundtrack additionally creates just the right off-kilter mood to accentuate the events. But it's ultimately the very good writing that underpins the success of this film. All-in-all, very impressive science fiction for those who appreciate the genre's more cerebral side."

","I rarely do this because there is so much rubbish out there but I'm going to recommend a movie. Writer Director Alex Garland has done an amazing job, it's beautifully shot, fantastically lit, intelligently written, brilliantly cast. the edit is original and brave, as is the direction of the edit, There is nothing superfluous, to the contrary it' has a sharp Zen like quality, clearly the application of a disciplined mind.<br/><br/>The movie is's self is engaging, thoroughly watchable, the characters are simple and yet layered with complexity. The film strikes the perfect balance of not spoon feeding and not dumbing down but not being too arty or intellectual just for the sake of it. <br/><br/>Best seen in a cinema I reckon."
"deloudelouvain","8","100","148","16 June 2015"," Robots will take over the world
","This is the kind of movie I really enjoy when I think about science fiction. Movies that make you think if we should continue trying to progress even more. Are we not already smart enough with everything we have? With all our daily gadgets that we can't miss for one second. Do we really need artificial intelligence? Because let's face it, once that will be concrete then we won't do a thing by ourselves anymore. We will send our robots to our job, we will chose and model our life partner like we want them to be. The story of Ex Machina might be futuristic but I certainly can imagine it like that in the future. All actors were good in their respective roles. For a movie that is filmed at the same spot all the time you certainly don't get bored for a second. Nice science fiction like there should be more of them."
"MattBirk","9","193","296","25 April 2015"," A Future Sci-Fi Classic
","Ex Machina is easily one of the greatest movies to ever tackle the ideas of artificial intelligence. Everything about the movie is put together in an elegant and intelligent way, the movie tackles the ideas in a mature way. There are no elaborate human vs machine fight scenes or military overlord presence, instead Machina focuses on the ethical questions that come from 'creating life'. And though the premise might sound unoriginal or derivative, it's when they mix in the idea of sexuality that the movie becomes something different.<br/><br/>From the moment, we arrive at Caleb's estate something seems very off-putting, he clearly is hiding something. And for the entire movie, as we explore his compound things slowly get more off-putting and stirring before boiling over during a wonderful climax. The deception between the two human characters is what makes the movie exciting, both men seem to be playing one another for unknown reasons. And as Nathan begins to understand more and more of what really is taking place in the house the tension rises and secrets unfold. Characters motives and beliefs are slowly unraveled and some seem more logical than others, but that's why the movie works, every character has sound reasons for their actions. The movie makes strong arguments for both sides of the A.I. equation.<br/><br/>However, the movie might be too slow for most audience members, as I said this is a movie where ideas shine not action sequences. Not only do ideas shine, but the acting out of the three leads is incredible to say the least! But it's this move (moving away from action and letting ideas flourish) that makes Ex Machina shine and worthy of being labeled a future sci-fi classic!"

","I don't often feel the need to review films on here, but after I have seen a film I like to see other peoples opinions, as I find it interesting, although very annoying too. It shouldn't annoy me I guess, but when thoughtless, nonsense, throwaway films are given 10 stars, and films that have a lot of thought and effort put into them are picked apart and given low ratings by idiots I get wound up. Anyway, I loved this film. Watched it last night on DVD. It has depth and darkness and leaves you with something, as great writers and directors can only seen to do occasionally. It is very atmospheric, with a great soundtrack, great performances by each actor. If you like action films, why do you go to see this? Reviews are always available online here. It is pretty obvious that this film is meant to be intelligent and thought provoking, rather than all-action Hollywood. If you have a short attention span then you will probably not like this film. Give it a chance and get drawn in... it's great."
"corrinadylan","6","199","325","16 May 2015"," Not quite the cerebral thriller I was expecting ...
","Ex Machina has a simple plot. Nathan, a reclusive programming genius, treats one of his employees to a week at his remote estate with Ava, an enigmatically charming robot who's meant to wow (or seduce) her visitor into believing she has human tendencies. Although this appears to be no real challenge, both Nathan and Caleb, the unlucky employee, egotistically assume they control the experiment. The rest is a foregone conclusion. As much as I like Nathan and his dancing Japanese servant, style is no substitute for ideas. Where other films might explore the potential ironies or paradoxes of artificial intelligence, Ex Machina reduces the human condition to basic animal attraction. When not quoting philosophers or scientists, Caleb is a voyeur and Nathan is the inventor of elaborate sex toys. Ava just happens to be a spectacular example."

","Having wrote the stories to some of his biggest hits, first-time director, Alex Garland, has spent a lot of time with the masterful Danny Boyle: working on such films as The Beach, 28 Days Later and Sunshine. Now, writing and directing his feature debut, Garland proves that he has been paying attention and taking tips as he tackles a complex sci-fi thriller about artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>Featuring Domnhall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac, the stars of the upcoming Star Wars adventure, plus talented newcomer, Alicia Vikander – who stars in three films this month; Ex_Machina is quite well profuse.<br/><br/>Jumping right in, we are introduced to Caleb (Gleeson), a twenty- four year old coder who wins a chance to spend a week at his CEO bosses luxury house. Travelling for many hours over his private estate via helicopter, he arrives at a remote mountain villa. Where he meets Nathan (Isaac) – a prodigy programmer, who at the young age of thirteen created the foundations of Bluebook (our equivalent to Google and Apple combined). Now, middle-aged and extremely wealthy from his companies growing success, he lives a reclusive life at his custom-built smart house, which is insulated by intelligent automated features and billionaire gadgets.<br/><br/>Addressing the concept that life is different at this remote location – which is more of a research facility - Nathan invites Caleb to be part of an experience during his one week stay. An experiment that he classes as the greatest discovering of mankind; to test the world's first artificial intelligence system, which is housed inside the body of a beautiful robot girl (Alicia Vikander).<br/><br/>Of course, the AI' concept has been tackled many of times in contemporary film - most recently in Wally Pfister's directorial- flop, Transcendence. In reality, the closest thing we have to it is Siri. Yet, Garland's vision of AI is extraordinarily superior and physiologically mesmerising to witness.<br/><br/>For Domnhall Gleeson, the premise of his character is similar to that of his characters once played in Frank, or About Time – one that is thrown into a portal of unknown weirdness, and often out of his depth. Over the seven days of testing, Caleb must perform the scientific 'Turing test' on Nathan's AI' system, nicknamed Ava; the idea of which is to deduce God-like theories and philosophical concepts – do robots feel a consciousness? If disguised, would you know it is a robot? Is it ethical?<br/><br/>It's heavy material for Garland, but no stranger to psycho- thrillers, he explores futuristic concepts as if AI's really do exist. Equally, the craft behind Ex_Machina is exceptional. A beautiful piano theme plays methodically, with often mix of silence setting the unique atmosphere. Whilst mainly set inside Nathan's enclosed premise (with no windows), the camera work is mounted aesthetically.<br/><br/>Now, in her third film this month, Alicia Vikander shows that she is able to tackle any form of performance with extreme clause. Whether she is a young-women coming of age during World War One (Testament of Youth), a love-interest of a criminal (Son of A Gun), or now a robot, she is outstanding. Fluxed movements, and facial expressions through seamless CGI, she steals all scenes present.<br/><br/>Compressed into an impressive 1 hour 48 minute running time - considering the ground it has to cover for such a serious sci-fi drama, Ex_Machina, still manages to find time for sublime humour. Taut, fascinating and simply intriguing. Alex Garland's debut film comes highly recommended."

","A great story, with complex yet very relatable characters. <br/><br/>AI has been a recurring theme in sci-fi movies for some time now with varying degrees of plot and execution quality. I feel this movie aces both.<br/><br/>A secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence.<br/><br/>From a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film. Nevertheless some very good effects and acting make for an excellent merge between fact and fiction that lets you concentrate on the philosophical questions the movie asks about the nature of AI. <br/><br/>Conclusion: I'd recommend this film to anyone. Though warning it concentrates on the brain rather than the muscle. Excellent movie."
"petra_ste","9","23","33","13 November 2015"," Turing test
","There is a neat moment in Alex Garland's remarkable Ex Machina when schlubby programmer Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson) objects he is not really performing a Turing test on robot Ava (Alicia Vikander), as he already knows she is an AI; his boss Nathan (the great Oscar Isaac) replies they're already past that: the real test is to SHOW Caleb she is artificial and THEN see if he still believes her to have consciousness and feelings.<br/><br/>Now, isn't that a variation of what movies (and fiction in general) do? They show us characters we know aren't real, and yet for a couple of hours we believe in them, root for them, bestow our empathy on them. There is an interesting meta layer, with Ava beguiling Caleb just as Garland's disquieting script captivates us viewers.<br/><br/>Ex Machina succeeds thanks to strong character work and excellent performances. Gleeson is fine as the audience surrogate; lovely Vikander is both vulnerable and uncanny as Ava; Isaac, who is becoming one of the best actors of his generation, absolutely kills it as smug demiurge Nathan, a brilliant man hiding a sinister streak behind is cool bro facade.<br/><br/>7,5/10"
"eddie_baggins","9","115","202","11 May 2015"," A stunningly crafted Sci-Fi with a star making turn from Vikander
","Nail bitingly tense, terse and most importantly thought provoking, well renowned British screenwriter and author turned director Alex Garland's incredibly competent feature debut is one of modern cinemas most memorable and original Sci-Fi's, a film that you sense will be oft discussed in years to come thanks to its wealth of questions asked and a heralding in of the era of young actress Alicia Vikander.<br/><br/>While Ex_Machina deals with the old aged staple of A.I and the pitfalls of it and what it means to be a human, not a machine, Garland operates his tale with a pinpoint accuracy that mines tension and intrigue from the films first frame to its last and creates a small scale vision that feels entirely in a world of its own. Garland's vision is a sight to behold and his direction is not far removed from the works of greats such as Kubrick, while Machina largely takes place within the confines of reclusive tech genius Nathan Bateman's stunningly designed home/ research facility, there is much visually wonderment to be found wherever you look. From the beautiful surrounds of the wilderness outside, the handle-less rooms that operate Nathan's lavish digs through to the flawless design of Ava the artificial being at the centre of this cautionary tale, Garland has created a small scale yet undeniably impressive universe that manages to mix the smarts, the visuals and the performances into one.<br/><br/>Filled with heart and humour (a trademark of Garland's works) Ex_Machina features what will be one of the years most accomplished trio of acting turns with well-rounded and pitch perfectly played acting turns. In another sign that he is quickly becoming as good as his father, Domnhall Gleeson plays kindly tech guru Caleb with the right amount of smarts and heart while his scenes with his upcoming Star Wars co-star Oscar Isaac are brimming with underlying motives and tension suggesting that their pairing in this year's space adventure will be a sight to behold. Isaac shows off a dark side to his growing screen powers and his Nathan is in equal measure sad and dangerous and while the two leads excel, they along with the film itself pale in comparison to Vikander's star making turn.<br/><br/>With a beguiling beauty and a truly remarkable ability to possess the charms of a human and the persona of an artificially created living entity, Vikander's Ava is without doubt one of the year's most stunning creations in both a CGI sense and characterization sense. Ava's ""sessions"" with awe struck Caleb may be purely dialogue driven but it's here that Garland's study of the not too distant A.I advancement comes to its greatest fruition and it's in no small way built almost entirely on Vikander's turn, as Ava is hers through and through, thanks to motion capture abilities. While it's some time off one would hope that Ava see's Vikander find just rewards come awards season but Ex_Machina may be slightly to left of centre for the sadly outdated and out of touch Awards ceremonies that dominate the industry.<br/><br/>While it's not flawless, some motivations and scenarios remain somewhat underdeveloped or questionable; Ex_Machina is a stunning Sci-Fi vision that is also a fully formed thinking man's thriller. With a jaw droopingly good turn from the soon to be megastar Vikander, Ex_Machina is another excellent example of what makes the Sci-Fi genre such a harbourer of thought provoking classics and further proof that Garland is one of the most consistently good storytellers working in the industry today.<br/><br/>4 and a half dancing showcases out of 5<br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into -<br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","Just saw the film and am still gob-smacked, so this review may not be as clear as some of my earlier ones.<br/><br/>A few notes: <br/><br/>1. Wow <br/><br/>2. As far as AI goes, this is the film that Spielberg wishes he would have made. It covers the same weighty questions but in a way that grabs the viewer by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end.<br/><br/>3. The I/B (impact to budget ratio) is off the chart. A full length feature that has what, 3 major characters, the same set, and some nice CGI? The backer who wrote the first check must have been crying tears of joy because they were in profit before the cameras rolled.<br/><br/>4. Wow.<br/><br/>5. Not merely a thinking-mans sci-fi, also a horror flick. Riffs off themes from classics like ISLAND OF DR MOREAU (where the daughter of the mad scientist is much more than she seems) and even the original Dracula (where the innocent young man gets invited to a castle for a job and discovers the owner and his servants are more than they seem).<br/><br/>6. Wow <br/><br/>7. Director Alex Garland is a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>8. Riffs off Sleuth (1972) where two men who are having seemingly simple conversations end up in a battle of wits.<br/><br/>9. Is it just me or is Oscar Issac as Nathan channelling Mandy Patinkin from Homeland, including voice mannerisms, even the beard? <br/><br/>10. Also borrows from Frankenstein (the created wanted to destroy the creator) and even Pinocchio (the puppet who wanted to become a real boy).<br/><br/>11. The pacing is extraordinary. It never peaks or plateaus. Every time you think you know what is coming, it just takes the story up a notch.<br/><br/>12. Even the ending -- a riff on the ""cuckolded boyfriend"" -- is unexpected and mesmerizing.<br/><br/>13. Cinematography is breathtaking. Musical score is perfect.<br/><br/>14. Did I mention Wow?"

","Don't mean to insult here, but who else wants to love a machine. Bear with me: this movie has a deep insight to communicate, whether intended or not is open to question. <br/><br/>The story is a modern telling of Bluebeard's Castle as the correct version of Beauty and the Beast. In other words, it seems to be about impotence. Except that this is geek love, love at an impossible distance, that is eroticism. And the movie itself tells you all you need to know about eros.<br/><br/>The insight. Ex Machina is ostensibly about Turing's Test, the thesis that a machine might be so human as to fool a human being. Does Ava pass this test? Depends on how you perceive the test. Ex Machina actually implies a more relevant Test: could a machine seem so human as to make the human being inteacting with it come to believe that he himself is a machine?<br/><br/>And the insight? It might be that the solution to the AI/human interface may not involve the humanising of robots, but the robotisation of humans.<br/><br/>Only 8/10 because it is not clear that this insight was actually part of the plot. But whether you find eros or AI in this movie, you will have a rewarding journey."

","Rarely have I felt myself the ""one-eyed man in the land of the blind"" as when I was reading the plethora of positive reviews for this film.<br/><br/>What so many critics praised as ""minimalist"", I found shallow: A one-dimensional, clearly ego-maniacal villain creates a flawlessly sympathetic A.I., with whom our equally-flawless protagonist cements an attachment. That, plus a fairly pedestrian game of cat-and-mouse between our 'tagonists, followed by an unsatisfying ending, defines the bulk of this film.<br/><br/>What so many critics praised as ""thought-provoking"", I found nonsensical. The chance to parlay the dichotomy between evolved vs. designed intelligence through Ava's character was squandered by the decision to render her ultimate motives entirely inscrutable: a contrivance that may have been---but should not have been---the point. There were times when this film showed real promise, the potential to give real weight to the blurred line between human and synthetic self-awareness that will doubtless challenge us in years to come... but, alas, in service to its Pollock-painting motifs, it chose easy ambiguity over genuine insight.<br/><br/>Superficially, this film is meaningful: It certainly tackles the questions of intelligence, of person-hood, of agency and of sentience in a world where all of the above can be designed by a psychopath.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, those questions are damn important ones to tackle... and, in the end, ""Ex Machina"" in no way does them justice."

"kattegat","1","116","224","23 May 2015"," Ex Machina vs Blade Runner
","In Blade Runner, human beings create artificial human beings – ""replicants"" – for specific purposes, and then feel entitled to kill them off when their existence is no longer convenient, even though the replicants are genuinely sentient, conscious, self-conscious beings. The protagonist, a biological human male, becomes close to a female replicant, partly through sexual attraction, and decides to rescue her from her scheduled death. <br/><br/>In Ex Machina, a human being, Nathan, creates artificial human beings, specifically artificially intelligent female robots, for his own purposes, and then feels entitled to kill them off when their existence is no longer convenient, even though the robots are genuinely sentient, conscious, self-conscious beings. The protagonist, a biological human male, becomes close to a female robot, partly through sexual attraction, and decides to rescue her from her scheduled death.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's just an accident of what I've read, but surprisingly few of the gushing reviews I've read of Ex Machina take notice of the fact that so much of its plot is borrowed from one of the best science fiction movies ever made. Of course there are plot differences. Most notably, Ex Machina raises more explicit issues about gender, although reviewers differ whether it is the movie that is sexist or only the character that produces the female robots or both. In any case, it appears that part of Nathan's mission is to produce a perfect female companion, which to him means one that serves you and has sex with you and is incapable of answering back. There is a trace of this theme in Blade Runner, in the character of Pris, a replicant whose job is to serve as a prostitute, but it is much fainter.<br/><br/>Even more notable, however, are the differences in what the two films do with the material. Both movies raise basic philosophical issues about whether biological human beings are different from replicants/robots in any morally important ways. Both raise issues about what it means to be a material and therefore a mortal being. But Blade Runner reflects on these issues in intelligent and moving ways. Rachael's anguish at discovering that her precious childhood memories are not really her own, for instance, raises exactly the sort of question that philosophers of person identity like to think about: Suppose that you are about to lose your memory through an illness. The doctors, however, are able to scan your brain now, and using that scan to copy your memories back into your brain when you recover. Would those memories really be any more your own than Rachael's? The replicants also discuss their attitudes towards death. By contrast, all we know about the robot in Ex Machina is that she plots to use the hero to help her escape her death, which is exactly what she was programmed to do. <br/><br/>More generally, in Ex Machina, the philosophical themes are only brushed on lightly as a way of trying to pass off as a serious film what is essentially an adolescent boy's fantasy - lots of special effects, naked nubile females, and guys drinking beer. And an adolescent boy's nightmare: being tricked by female characters who are essentially manipulative, think of nothing but sex and how to use it to get their own ends, and with whom one therefore can never form a genuine bond.<br/><br/>Skip Ex Machina. It's not worth watching even once. Stay home and stream Blade Runner again instead."

","Spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>Where to start with this one hmmmmm. The movie explores the already over navigated ""what if AI was created"" however unlike most movies that question should it be created this one throws you full into ""oh we did it already and here is a brief explanation on how we did it"". <br/><br/>The premise is weak to say the least with our main characters having no real reason to be doing anything they are doing other than they can.<br/><br/>Caleb is a young tech savy man who we learn more or less is picked to be part of an experiment with Ava and Jay. Throughout the film we learn very little about him other than he has no family and has the hots for Ava. Sadly this is the least thought out character in the film even though it depends on him to carry us through what we are watching. <br/><br/>Jay is a genius with an apparent drinking issue and a very bland personality. His motives for making AI can basically be summed up as him wanting fame and money and that's about it. Through the film you learn these robots are ehem full functional females and yes that does mean he is sleeping with one. Aside from the otter non sense that this one man has created several robots on his own with full functional AI he gives you the ending to the film with roughly 20 mins still left in it. Whoever decided to have Jay basically say outright what if this is all a setup and then end the movie that way should be fired and kicked out of Hollywood.<br/><br/>This brings us to Ava who honestly has nothing going for her. Shes a robot who manipulates everything and walks out as the last man standing. No reason is given for why she does what she does other then what Jay says and that's about all we know. <br/><br/>To me the film felt rushed and incomplete neither saying why AI was created or where its going. It was simply we made robots, the robots are free and everything you wanted to happen isn't going to happen."

"Turfseer","2","104","204","17 May 2015"," Boorish antagonist and lack of suspense sinks newbie writer/director's sci-fi indie ""thriller""
","""Ex Machina"" is by newbie writer/director Alex Garland. I refuse to get involved in evaluating Mr. Garland's talents as a director but may I jump in and offer an opinion as to his talents as a writer? Unfortunately, you might already guess that my opinion as to Mr. Garland's talent as a screenwriter, is not very high.<br/><br/>The problem with ""Ex Machina"" plain and simple, is that it lacks suspense. The protagonist is one Caleb, a computer programmer who works for ""Bluebook,"" the world's popular search engine which presumably has replaced Google in the future. Caleb is invited by Nathan, the firm's CEO, to his secluded, ""hi-tech"" mountain retreat where he is asked to perform a ""Turing test,"" on Nathan's sexy (CGI altered) android, Ava. The test involves determining whether the android's ""artificial intelligence"" is so advanced, that Caleb is unable to distinguish human from non-human responses. <br/><br/>You would think that Oscar Isaac who plays Nathan would be some kind of cool, Steve Jobs character with a touch of Machiavelli. But unfortunately Issac plays Nathan as a bully without a trace of subtlety. Is it Garland's lack of talent as a screenwriter or Issac's own boorish performance that brands Isaac as one of the worst actors of the year?<br/><br/>You'll probably guess that the one-note Nathan plans to wipe Ava's memory clean and Caleb will try to help escape from the sealed-in compound. Caleb also discovers that Nathan's personal assistant, Kyoto, is also an android and he also has her ""confined to base.""<br/><br/>At a certain point, Nathan learns of his collusion with Ava and warns Caleb that her plans to ""spring the joint"" will not involve him. But somehow Caleb anticipates Nathan's uncovering of their plot and disables the compound's security system. Part of the climax is predictable: Nathan further shows off his bad guy credentials by killing Kyoto and ripping Ava's arm off, in an attempt to kill her. But of course the robot is too smart for the bully and stabs him to death. <br/><br/>The only twist is that Nathan was right: Ava somehow escapes the retreat and leaves poor schnook Caleb, to die, locked inside Nathan's ""campus."" <br/><br/>As Porky Pig would say, ""That's it, folks!"" If your thing is one dimensional villains, then ""Ex Machina"" is for you. Even the twist of a sexy but unfeeling android, who leaves an undeserved protagonist to ""twist in the wind,"" is hardly much of a ""deus ex machina,"" to get excited about!"

","I must admit that I was pretty caught up by the story and was eagerly waiting for the dialogues between Ava (the AI) and Caleb (the hero) to continue. Although I didn't care much about Caleb, I was fascinated by the robot. Maybe I'm too easily swayed, and I guess you would have to make a pretty bad movie about AI if the audience wasn't curious to actually get to know the AI. But still, Alicia Vikander does a fantastic job to play this super-human polished robot with her perfectly coordinated movements and her soft voice. All in all, the dialogues between her and Caleb are undoubtedly the best parts about this movie. I also like the environment, the CGI and the sound effects.<br/><br/>The rest is mediocre. The acting apart from that of Alicia Vikander is below average. The ""twist"" about the Asian maid being another AI was obvious from the beginning. I was even surprised when it turned out that you were not supposed think that she was after we first saw her. <br/><br/>And then I was waiting for that major twist that never happened. Is Caleb an AI too? Nope. Is Nathan an AI and the singularity has already happened? Nope, he's just a programming genius with drinking problems. <br/><br/>The point when the movie went from good to mediocre was when Caleb fell in love with Ava and decided to help her escape. I just didn't buy it. And why would a genius like Nathan not program his robots to follow the Three Laws of Robotics? <br/><br/>Watch it and enjoy, but don't expect to be mind-blown."

","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS....THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. Ex Machina is almost a direct rip off of, ""The Machine"", and not even as good. I give huge points for the CGI, which was brilliant but the rest of the movie was plodding and pretentious. The cinematography and mood seemed like movie student interpretations of 2001...and not nearly as good as that either. <br/><br/>What might have been interesting is if we got to experience the development process to get to the point of AI, not the physical so much, but the cerebral...that might have been interesting. Instead. we get this pretty robot, which looked like a cross between the robots of ""A.I."" and ""I Robot"", with a fully formed intellect. The movie spends most of its time reinforcing what we already know from the first session between Ava and Caleb which is, , ""Yup....she's an AI all right...now what?"". They blathered on about the Turing Test, and didn't do anything close to it...which they didn't need to because it was darned obvious that she was and AI...or close enough for a movie. <br/><br/>So that takes up most of the movie...that which wasn't taken up with shots of the cold, stark, orderly interior of the house/lab and contrasting shots of beautiful, untamed wilderness outside. It was subtle, but I think they were trying to make a statement right there. <br/><br/>As if to add insult to injury, one of the main characters, Caleb, had no purpose in the movie at all...his absence would have changed nothing. The scientist knew everything that was going on and correctly predicted the outcomes of everybody's actions. Yet, and this is a hoot, he couldn't figure out why the power kept going out in his house/lab. He could have made a call to the local power company, but no, he assumed that this annoyance didn't need the investigative time or effort it would take to make that call. It was kind of a big part of the plot...yet the very practical and easy solution was completely ignored. When you miss something that obvious, it's difficult to take anything else seriously. <br/><br/>I'm not going to give you the plot because you'll be able to guess it within about 15 seconds of seeing Ava. It looked good, but it wasn't good. It has only been out a week or so and there were exactly 5 people in the theatre. We talked on the way going out and we all came to the same conclusion; It just wasn't very good. You'll get much more watching any of the other movies I mentioned, even AI, which owned the previous low spot on the AI scale, until Ex Machina. It gets a 4 only because of the very good CGI."

","""I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson)<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a thoughtful science fiction about Artificial Intelligence, whereby, to no fan's surprise, the current female robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander), has human qualities that cause trouble for inventor, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), and visitor, young Caleb. If you know anything about these stories, you could write the screenplay, but you'd need these actors to make it the impressive sci-fi it is. <br/><br/>Poets and philosophers have been intrigued by just this story about AI gone astray after interacting with humans. The Frankenstein motif is alive and dangerous, and the spirit of Spike Jonze's Her, with the seductive operating system, is very much a part of Ava's approach to Caleb. The destructive force of Nathan's creation is more subtle than in Dr. Frankenstein's creation, but menacing nevertheless: ""Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?"" Ava to Nathan<br/><br/>Brainy Nathan has a compound somewhere in an Alaskan refuge as modern as could be with ID cards and glass walls and doors to give the impression of peace and transparency. Caleb is chosen to help Nathan use the Turing Test to judge the quality of the AI-human experience.<br/><br/>As in real life, nothing is as it appears because neither Nathan nor Ava can refrain from lying. Yet, even Caleb is drawn into lies as he gets closer, even romantically, yikes! to Ava. Once again for science fiction, as soon as the robot gets to enjoy being like a human, trouble ensues. However, even if this film seems like a retread, say, of Never Let Me Go, very few filmmakers could match the ultra modern, yet still sexy, set design. And Isaac's character is so mercurial, at once comforting then tyrannical, that the film could be remembered if only for his star turn as the mad but charming scientist.<br/><br/>After all, Ex Machina is as much about a scientist playing God as it is about the bridge between robot and man. Each topic could, and has been, treated on its own. Here it is an exciting return to modern man as god and monster:<br/><br/>""I am God."" Nathan"

","Q/ Who made me? A/ God made me. <br/><br/>Q/ Why did God make me? A/ God made me to know him, to love him, and to serve him in this world ...<br/><br/>Well, I never thought I would open a film review with that, but it did seem appropriate. I could not locate the source material, but, thank God, my memory is still good.<br/><br/>A Universal film. 'Ex Machina' is an SF film about a robot. Caleb, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is a young man working in a high-tech company. He is notified that he has won a competition. The prize is to spend a week at the home of the owner of the company. The company owns 'The Blue Book', the most popular search-engine on the internet. The owner of the company is Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac. Nathan is a recluse living in a far-north wilderness. He is also a genius, has a bulked-up body, and a big beard that any naval-person would be proud of, as well as a character that is somewhat controlling, overbearing, and sinister.<br/><br/>Nathan informs Caleb that the real reason he is here is to do a Turing Test. Caleb is introduced to a robot, called Ava, played by Alicia Vikander. Nathan has been trying to develop AI. Now Caleb is the first person to find out what Nathan has been working on.<br/><br/>The film revolves around the two males and the robot. Thus this is a slow film, it is a character-study rather than an action film. The film was written and directed by Alex Garland. This is in fact his directorial debut, and a very good debut it is too. The early high- tech office scenes looked authentic, the outside scenes were spectacular, as were the special-effects.<br/><br/>The three stars of the film give sterling performances. Mr Isaac is sufficiently dark and brooding. Mr Gleeson, who starred with Rachel McAdams, in the 2013 time-travelling rom-com 'About Time', here has a straight role as an earnest and innocent young man. And as for Miss Vikander, this is the second week running that I have seen her in a starring role, last week I saw her play Vera Brittain in 'Testament of Youth'. In Ex Machina, she plays the robot called Ava. This is a difficult role, but one that she plays well. She is required to not only be a machine-like robot, but also to be able to interact with the humans. Can she interact and learn? Does she have AI? These are the central questions explored in the film.<br/><br/>Those familiar with the robot books of Isaac Asimov, or the films 'Her' (2013), The Imitation Game (2014), or the iconic 'Blade Runner' (1982), will recognize the similar themes explored here in 'Ex Machina'. Those unfamiliar with them will not have their enjoyment stopped or their understanding denied.<br/><br/>""And that is all. I saw it from the beginning, when the poor robots couldn't speak, to the end, when they stand between mankind and destruction"". -Dr. Susan Calvin, in the robot short-story 'The Evitable Conflict'.<br/><br/>'Ex Machina' is an interesting and well-filmed SF movie. 10/10."

","Ex Machina, Alex Garland's Science fiction film about artificial intelligence, covers no new ground but it is a tense, suspenseful and well-acted picture. Garland forgoes action and special effects and tells a slow-burning story about big ideas. Thanks to Garland and his cinematographer Rob Hardy, the films atmosphere is very claustrophobic and paranoid. Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson are excellent but the film belongs to young Swedish actress, Alicia Vikander. On the surface, she plays the AI Ava with a childlike innocence and wonderment. But underneath, is a very intelligent and cunning being. Her performance was the highlight of the film. There are a couple of plausibility issues I have with the plot.

","Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson)is a young computer programmer who wins a competition that grants him the opportunity to spend a week at a research laboratory that is run by his employer Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Caleb is sent over to spend 7 days at the research lab and his aim is to interact with the first human AI Ava (Alicia Vikander) who has been created by Nathan. However, as time passes Caleb realises that things aren't all that they seem at the lab and he starts to wonder if Nathan is hiding a dark secret?<br/><br/>In some ways this film sets it stall out very early on by showing Nathan knocking seven bells out of a punch bag only then to announce that he's suffering from a really bad hangover; in what world can anyone possibly have that much energy the morning after the night before? If I have a skinful the night before I can barely get out of bed let alone do a full 'Rocky' style training montage. However, this is really only the tip of the iceberg....<br/><br/>Aside from this minor issue at the start, the film does become quite interesting and the various interactions and dialogue that are shared between Caleb and Ava are quite involving and come close to being moving - the scene where Ava gets dressed up for Caleb when they're discussing their date was quite nice and I assume that was part of her attempt at trying to feel normal.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this film is only mildly interesting as a concept and whatever intrigue it built up in the first half quickly evaporated in the second half. Let's look at some of the problems....<br/><br/>For a start there's Nathan's character; he's a drunk, but why portray him as a drunk?... it would have been fine if the writers would have made him entertaining or insightful as a drunk, but he wasn't and if we're honest his drunkenness only really existed as a plot device to set up the final act (which I'll come to later). However, his drunkenness brings about further problems.... OK think about it... Nathan's drunken behaviour lead to his Key Card being stolen meaning that Caleb discovered his secret. If you've got a drink problem why would you invite someone over and risk them discovering your secret? Remember people are more truthful when they're drunk so even if Caleb hadn't have got Nathan's Key Card it's probably fair to assume that Nathan would have confessed his secret any way after one too many drinks.<br/><br/>Further problems develop in the final third when the writers decide to throw in far too many twists; the initial twist was good whereby we're lead to believe that Nathan has the upper hand by overhearing Caleb and Ava's escape plan (I thought at this point 'Oh Nathan's drunkenness wasn't a plot device after all), but no then we learn that Caleb re-arranged it so that all the doors would open when the power went off (whilst Nathan was drunk the night before) meaning that Nathan's drunkenness was a plot device which is what I originally thought. Great!! It's a classic case of a film over-thinking itself and trying to be too clever.<br/><br/>Then we come to the end and this really is make or break; initially I found it puzzling that Ava would leave Caleb behind; the only explanation that I have for this is that Ava was playing Caleb all the time and merely used him as a means to escape - seems a bit harsh when it was Caleb that made it possible for her to escape, but perhaps she isn't really capable of empathy or emotion as she is just a machine. It left me with something to think about at the end, but sadly I was more pre-occupied thinking about how convoluted the film became prior to the rather open ended finale. <br/><br/>Aside from an interesting start was there anything else good about it? Definitely - Oscar Isaac was great and despite the fact that I didn't like his character I think he's a great actor. Gleeson was OK and Vikander again was OK, but wasn't given much to work with. However, her final scenes are memorable to say the least and may I just say 'WOW'! How gorgeous is she???<br/><br/>Despite the faint praise, this film never really worked for me; the first half was mildly engaging and interesting, but never bowled me over. However, the second half was much more dumb and illogical, but as mentioned Vikander is definitely the one that you'll remember here."

","There have been a frightening string of films lately. Movies that sell themselves as an original, intelligent take on a topic (e.g Interstellar) or as a never-before-seen interpretation of a familiar story (e.g. Noah). What's common in all of them is that they are all hollow and lack any kind of logic. Ex Machina is one of those movies. An insult to intelligence.<br/><br/>It is excruciatingly slow, boring and confined, and done very cheaply.

","Correct me if i'm wrong but on the surface this movie puts itself across as one which is a complex look into what it is to be human, but inwardly it's just a mediocre sci-fi snuff movie, with its bad acting, excessive prolonged art house shots and excessive nudity. The dialog is terrible and the whole idea of the creation of the robots is obscured, I think the writer has just thought of a lot of bull no one will understand jumble it all up together and confuse people into thinking its smart when its complete poo. Don't waste you money going to see this movie, take time and check out some other films that may be much better. I also have no idea where this movies 11 million dollar budget has been spent, seems to be a lot of people lining pockets."
"filmfanperspective","10","20","39","11 May 2015"," Pure science fiction- so good that could be science fact (*****)
","Full version: http://filmfanperspective.com/2015/05/07/film-review- ex-machina/<br/><br/>Director Alex Garland, the writer of such science fiction fables as 28 Weeks Later and Sunshine, handles his first directorial charge with the hand of an old pro. As the title implies, the film deals in gods and monsters, and is never swift to identify which is which. The subtlety Garland and the cast play between beauty and menace results in a truly mesmerizing, smart fable for our time- well, for all time. The film is science fiction embodied, chock full of questions, precisely in the manner I prefer to digest it. As it wades in both the shallow waters of our societal and moral atmospheres, whilst simultaneously toeing the line between tension and horror, it stands as 2015's best thus far.<br/><br/>Domnhall Gleeson stars as Caleb, a programmer for a company called 'Bluebook'. We come to him as he's just won an exclusive trip to meet the company's founder and stay with him for a week. I imagine that would be like a Microsoft programmer spending a week with Bill Gates, whether that individual would want to or not. The fictional 'Bluebook', the world's preeminent search engine, was created by a mysterious, reclusive genius (is there any other) named Nathan (Isaac). By now, we know the type; disconnected, awkward, wealthy beyond our imaginations, and lonely. Nathan is indeed that, it appears, and wants Caleb to interact with his latest creation, a ""female"" android named Ava (Vikander).<br/><br/>We know that Ava is a robot because we can see her metal innards, exposed gears, coverings and all. If we were unable to see her interact with Caleb, however, would we be able to tell whether or not she was human? That's his dilemma, and a striking one at that. As the audience, we're given their dalliances like acts of a play, each separate in nature, each building upon the previous one in terms of depth, understanding, and tension level. Caleb is increasingly affected by her pleasantness, curiosity, and insight, leading to emotions he can't quite understand, including affection for her as a female. He begins to wonder what has transpired in this compound. Has Nathan, the creator, abused her? Does he keep her prisoner for any particular reason other than his own insecurities and misgivings? Does Nathan understand the responsibility of creating an intelligence, only to then repress its' growth?<br/><br/>Caleb's task, per Nathan, is simply to gauge whether or not Ava can pass for human, but it becomes clear early on that it will not, and cannot, be that simple. From their first chat until the film's final moment, everything Ava says and does is unpredictable, just like the film itself. Will she be child-like? Will she be motivated to evolve? Will she see humans as a threat? If she does, will she use brute force, or maybe even manipulation, to achieve that goal? Does Nathan have a ""kill"" switch in the event of an emergency? Why does Ava not appear to be programmed with a template of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics? Is there a reason the film doesn't touch on them? Is everything that Ava says and does simply a result of programming, or has she actually transcended what she was intended to be? I hope you can tell that just by watching, the film inspires a number of interesting and difficult questions and thoughts. Garland writes this in a way that plays on our wonder of scientific possibility as well as our inherent fears of robots and the future. We can't help but question what happens and what doesn't happen during the film, creating a specific feeling of tension akin to horror. The film's location, in an isolated, constricting compound in the mountains that can only be reached via helicopter, only adds to the feeling of impending doom. The film's color palate adds to the feeling as well- the foggy, almost smoky wash when the camera is on a human, then clean and clear when focusing on an artificial being. Whether or not it was intentional, it certainly adds a dimension and a contrast to the film.<br/><br/>I'm fascinated with Garland's continued interest in the constructs of society, and how theoretical situations affect human beings in his work. In Sunshine, he sees an interesting dynamic within the pressures of saving humanity and our human natures. In 28 Days Later, he again puts human nature to the test in the wake of an apocalypse. Ex Machina is yet another test of our theoretical resolve, and I for one don't believe his result is far from the theoretical truth. As he put it himself, this film is designed to emulate a future not too far from now, maybe 'ten minutes out'. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a reclusive ""Nathan"" currently holed up somewhere with his own ""Ava"". For all we know, there may be robots walking among us. Maybe Garland knows this to be true. It is clear to me that he should continue telling stories, and continue to generate what all excellent science fiction does- questions. This is a film that truly belongs in the upper echelon of the genre, which is no small feat for a rookie filmmaker."
"Challenger2013","10","16","30","6 May 2015"," Brilliant Sci-Fi Based in Emotion
","What a brilliant little sci-fi film this is. That is, if you can really call it a sci-fi. In truth, ""Ex Machina"" is indeed a sci-fi, but it has qualities that other films of the genre don't. It's also a strange romance and a character study...of three different characters.<br/><br/>The film follows Caleb (Dohmnall Gleeson) who wins a week at the home of a brilliant scientist named Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Nathan wants Caleb to be part of a trial run for his new artificially intelligent robot. This involves the Turing test, where Caleb must interact with the A.I., and if he can't notice that she isn't human, she passes. The catch is that the A.I. robot is in the form of an attractive woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander.) As we go along we learn that Nathan has some shocking secrets and the film becomes an intense and thrilling ride to see not only if Ava passes the test, but to see if Caleb uncovers the truth behind his trip. <br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" is shot quite unlike other sci-fi films. The cutting isn't rapid and each shot is given room to breathe. This is partly because there is very little action in the film. It draws on human (and non-human) emotions to drive the story and it is so refreshing to avoid all the violent hoopla that comes with most films like this. The film is surprisingly well-lit judging by its dark tone and as the film goes on, the camera gets closer to the actors, symbolizing the fact that the audience learns more and more about the characters as time passes. <br/><br/>Another driving point for the film is three very good performances. As Vikander's robot seduces Caleb, she also seduces us. She doesn't do this through her looks, but through her tone of her voice and through the fact that she actually seems human. Dohmnall Gleeson has shown glimpses of brilliance in the past, but he really shines here as the character we relate to most. Most of all, Oscar Isaac is outstanding as the villain in the tale. The way he tries to befriend Caleb, yet is so mysterious, is unnerving, but wonderful to watch. <br/><br/>One of the best things about the film is the score. As can be imagined, there are numerous points in the film that stir us up, and gnaw at us to keep us guessing what will happen. Along with that is a simple score that builds and keeps building until we can hardly take the tension any longer. It is thrilling and really adds to the film tremendously. <br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" exceeds a number of other sci-fi and A.I.-focused films by bending the genre and focusing on human emotion over spectacle. It is one of the best films of 2015 thus far, and serves as an exciting booster for its three rising actors."
"tedg","Null","10","17","21 July 2015"," Soft Bits
","This is a superb film. I recommend it. <br/><br/>My enjoyment of films is divided between the experience when watching and the much longer incubation time afterward. The success in the former in this case fights the appreciation in the latter.<br/><br/>This kind of science fiction is all about abstraction. The world is abstracted away and we are placed in a secluded location where no support people exist; this is familiar from the stage and we readily accept it. Other abstractions are from what great masses believe: <br/><br/>— Some billionaires are scientific geniuses. <br/><br/>— Great technical work can be done by one guy. <br/><br/>— AI is still the notion of a machine that acts like a human, and the Turing test is still relevant. <br/><br/>— Successful AI is somehow dependent on successful robotics. <br/><br/>— Something like Google collects something like intelligence.<br/><br/>When watching this, we willingly allow these things because we want cleanliness, directness and the film rewards by moving. When the end unrolls, it does so with no great surprises of the kind that make us reinterpret what we know. This pleases like an ordinary meal does without challenging.<br/><br/>The settling of this in a near perfect center of what has gone before in sci-fi film is also appreciated. There are too many to note here, but I liked the Alphaville reference and the tussle among three beings for control of the movie from 2001. <br/><br/>Also, the acting seemed ideal.<br/><br/>But afterward, much of the appreciation faded for me. None of the five common assumptions noted above are shared by me. I remember few things fondly that are supposed to be based on science but that don't leverage the reality — instead some trivial fiction that resides beside. <br/><br/>My memory wants to complain about a movie that presents novelty but that has none. The god business just was too much mentioned, and the justice too simple. <br/><br/>That said, we have the Sunshine factor. That movie hit a sweet spot for me and over time has grown in importance in my world. A reason is the coupling of something like chosen importance (but not quite) with something like valiant loneliness (but not quite that either) pulled by some cosmic force we would see as controlling insight. That movie had story and space ship and all, but the thing it conveyed was a suspended urge, one I might relate to a refined, pure sexual compulsion taken away from sex.<br/><br/>Here in this film, we have the same notion from the same writer. <br/><br/>Because the filmmaker is less adroit than Boyle, everything else is simplified as well. Also, we have a real sexual object in this case, and it mutes the spell by speaking it. Still, it evokes that urge and we inherit it.<br/><br/>If you had limitless money, the technical ability and the opportunity would you not fold all your desires? And would you not drink at night with a combination of fear of yourself and desire to escape them? Would you welcome a death that confirmed you?<br/><br/>One plot element captivates. We have evidence of many failed experiments at building attractive women. One of these is used as house mistress. She supposedly does not understand or speak natural language and In the overt story, she is benign. (That story is from Caleb's perspective.)<br/><br/>On reflection, she *has* learned language and *does* understand what is going on. Ava is the focus, but Kyoko is suggested as the agent that moves everything and thus is the real AI success."
"eapplebaum","10","10","17","15 June 2015"," Unexpected ending.
","This is the first film I've seen in a long time that I had NO idea what was going to happen and only a few of my story guesses were correct while the surprises were stunning. Ex Machina is a wonderful inspection into humanity, intelligence, feminism and expectations. The whole time I felt a physical tension in my own gut watching every scene. I like to play a game where I puzzle the story before the next step happens and in this film, I found it a great challenge. We think we are so smart, even when we know we are going to be our own demise, so in the end we STILL don't know the capacity of destruction the things we make can generate. The tension and the end are palpable. SO well done."

","the spoiler is only mild and only exists at the end (warning included at that point)<br/><br/>one of the best -if not the best- movies ever made on the topic of AI. this movie has really interesting story line which keeps the viewer engaged from the very beginning to the end and the climax is simply superb. besides the good story line, one great thing about this movie is that it explores the AI specifically very well. there are some particular things that i liked in the movie which i would like to tell in some detail:<br/><br/>1. i always thought google was working on developing AI, especially after they started working on google car, acquired companies like Deep Minds etc. this movie seemed to agree with me by showing that the CEO of the top (fictitious) search company secretly develops an AI. during a conversation in the movie, he tells his logic behind using the search data to develop the AI.<br/><br/>2. in other AI movies i think the psychology of the AI is not shown properly. eg in Terminator series, the machines didn't seem to have any psychology. whereas in Matrix series, it's mostly implied or indirectly shown but not properly explored. in the movie ""A.I."" again, although the main character is implied to have human like emotions- but that itself was because he was created in the 1st place to display those. so in spite of all the emotions shown there, they seem highly objective, predictable & mechanical in nature. in this movie however the AI shown has almost perfect understanding of human emotions, has its own emotions & feelings and can use them perfectly for some purpose. (spoiler from here) although it's shown that those things were intended by the CEO to have in the AI, it's seen in the end they didn't proceed in the predictable manner and the AI had formed it's own individuality and objectives etc. the AI also displays the characteristics of the perfect psychopath- one who has its own feelings, can understand perfectly others' psychology, use them to manipulate others very well but lacks completely feelings towards others."

","A excellent piece of SF that takes an idea that may soon be reality and works it through to a plausible conclusion. Everything about this film was 'right': the casting, the script, the acting, and the production.<br/><br/>In terms of quality, it reminds me of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" with the additional benefit of CGI instead of men in monkey suits.<br/><br/>There is nudity and a sexual element, but to mind the UK BBFC with a 15 certificate got it right. I can guess why the MPAA gave it an R - they did the same to ""The King's Speech"" because the f word was used non abusively - but in 2015?<br/><br/>Unless you are of the Religious Right, watch it.

","Taking a look at films that were to come out in 2015,I spotted an interesting article online about a psychologically-heavy Sci-Fi title,which instead of looking at the humanity in the machine,investigated the machine in the human,which led to me excitingly getting ready to find out what is in the machine.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>The near future-<br/><br/>Correctly solving a puzzle set by his employer,search engine computer programmer Caleb wins the chance to visit Bluebook CEO Nathan,in his secluded mountain villa.Arriving at the villa, Caleb is told by Nathan that he will spend the week holding sessions performing the ""Turing test"" on a piece of AI that Nathan has secretly been working on.<br/><br/>Ava,a humanoid female android.After introducing him to Ava,Nathan tells Caleb that his main goal with the test is for him to find out if Ava has a consciousness,and also if Caleb is able to relate to someone,who he is aware of being a robot.Starting the test in a by the book manner,Caleb finds himself gradually building a deep connection with Ava,with Caleb slowly revealing his inner most feelings to Ava.During a power cut,Ava tells Caleb that Nathan is not to be trusted,as Ava begins to perform her own tests.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Making his directing debut,writer/director Alex Garland & cinematographer Rob Hardy set the title in a future which looks eerily close to reality,with Nathan's secluded location being the ultimate Silicon Valley,as Garland and Hardy cover the outdoors in lush greens and blues. Withholding any light from entering the Nathan's villa,Garland and production designer Mark Digby cover the building in metallic glass, which along with giving the film an ultra stylised appearance,also subtly reveals the disconnection in Ava,Nathan & Caleb relationships.Avoiding the boom boom pow of Sci- Fi Action flicks,Garland displays a real precision in keeping the extraordinary effects rooted to the psychological aspects of the movie,by keeping Ava's face non-robotic,Garland shows Ava's increased covering up of her android features to lead to a deep blurring between Ava's wires & mainframes and Caleb's flesh and blood.<br/><br/>Limiting the film to a handful of characters,the screenplay by Garland takes advantage of the limitations,by exploring each thread of mistrust that Ava,Nathan and Caleb are tied to.Whilst Garland does have an interest in showing the technology of the near- future,Garland brilliantly transforms the film from a Sci-Fi Thriller into a fascinating study of a psychopathic culture.<br/><br/>Giving the 3 main characters biblical names, (Ava is a form of Eve, Nathan was a prophet in the court of David, and Caleb was a spy sent into a new land by Moses) Garland opens up Nathan's narcissism,which explodes across the screen,as Nathan declares himself a god,who is unable to see the side effects that his creation may have.Introducing Caleb with underlying hints to his fate,Garland peels away Caleb skin to reveal the isolation Caleb is engulfed in,which goes from computer lights being the only object/person that Caleb surrounds himself with,to Caleb losing control of his ""sessions"" with Ava,as Ava begins to realise that she is more human than the almost-robotic,lacking in emphatic understanding Caleb.Despite being the only non-human out of the trio,Garland frighteningly wires Ava into being an extremely intelligent psychopath,thanks to Ava making the ""Turing tests"" being ones where she gets to explore her empathy,sexuality and a manipulative self-awareness.<br/><br/>Digging deep into the heart of the machine,the alluring Alicia Vikander gives a fantastic performance as Ava,with Vikander's expressive face bringing the additional special effects roaring to life,due to Vikander gradually revealing Ava to get a keen grip on knowing when to emphasis the robotic elements of her appearance,and when to highlight the more humanistic aspects.""Winning"" the opportunity to meet Nathan, Domhnall Gleeson gives a wonderful performance as Caleb,who Gleeson shows as being incredibly uncomfortable in his own skin,and also unaware about the micro- expressions info that he is slipping to Ava & Nathan,whilst Oscar Isaac gives a great ego-tripping performance as Bluebook (a reference to philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's ""The Blue Book,"") CEO Nathan,who soon discovers the Deus Ex-Machina's Ex Machina."
"trescia-1","4","39","85","7 May 2015"," I didn't hate it enough.
","SPOILERS AHEAD. So watch it.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I went to see this film expecting something bad. I don't know why, but my shields were up. I just wanted to know HOW it was going to be bad.<br/><br/>I didn't have to wait long to find out. You see, the guy who built the amazing sensitive woman robot (more on this later) is an alcoholic dude-bro who absolutely positively could not build that thing in real life. No. He lifts weights. He boxes. He pounds down fifths of vodka. I might like to party with this cowboy but I cannot imagine this guy building anything but a really big sandwich. It's preposterous. The guy is so stupid that I thought HE would turn out to be some kind of robot-red herring but, nope, he is ACTUALLY supposed to be this super-genius who becomes a trillionaire and takes over the internet at the age of thirteen.<br/><br/>Please.<br/><br/>He's the same actor who appeared in ""Sucker Punch"" (a better movie about objectifying women) and he was a good villain in that and he should stick with villains. Dumb villains. If he shows up in a few more stinkers his career could tank--so he should not take any more roles where he plays a brainiac. I have some bad news. Brainiacs are nerdy people. They have issues. Social anxiety. They might actually BUILD a girl-bot for those lonely nights in Glacier National Park after they, like, bought it and stuff 'cause they were so rich. But not this guy. He's not the type. That's that. You can call me a racist or bigot or whatever all day and all night. It's a fact.<br/><br/>Actually, this movie could have taken the whole ""what is intelligence?"" thing and ran with it. It could have taken the whole ""what is sexual attraction?"" thing and ran with that. But it chose not to run with anything. It chose to sit there. <br/><br/>Now about that sensitive female robot. I could imagine a film where the idea of ""sensitivity"" is explored and the notion of ""femininity"" is examined. That would be a good film. I would write a good review of that. But this wasn't that movie. The sensitive robot woman is, sorta, oh man, I don't know, supposed to be a real girl, like Pinocchio, or something. It's just painful. She is a MACHINE. When the movie tries to imply that she isn't a machine, we go directly to creepy. <br/><br/>By the way, this movie offended my sense of smell,too. Something about being in that enclosed space with the HVAC system conking out every time the robot charges up--I dunno. I felt, after a while, I could actually SMELL the place. Or maybe it was that guy behind me eating the mushu pork.<br/><br/>But I digress.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't really reach down and turn fully stupid until the ending, where our hero (barely our hero) discovers that dude-bro the genius is making women suits and then teaching them to bark like a dog. He hangs up the old girl-bots in a kind of bachelor pad from Hell that he shares with the one bot that he never taught to speak (a whole 'nother movie could be made from that, but no).<br/><br/>Eventually, the robots kill the dude-bro and at this point I couldn't take it. I went out in the hall. Sitting in that awful seat watching an awful movie was giving me leg cramps. I missed the ending but that, I assure you, was nothing. Whatever happened, it could not have undone the damage.<br/><br/>Avoid."

It's as grim as it looks and boring to boot. Throughout the movie the feeling pervades that the storyteller isn't qualified to tell a story about women, artificial or not.

","Fun and intriguing at times, but doesn't meet its goal if you're tech savvy. Nathan, the protagonist and developer of Ava the AI robot, was supposed to be the world's smartest programmer. I don't think so. The Turing test applied by supporting actor Caleb to determine if Ava is a true AI has questions and answers that are straight out of the oldest known AI program - Eliza - which I enjoyed in the mid-1960s, and was fun to customize. The introduction was pretty cool. Nice looking bot but acted like a marionette. Good dancing. Great Norwegian scenery. This movie deserves a remake. My wife thinks they ran out of money. This isn't a movie for computer AI geeks. Here's why: Nathan was supposed to be capable of hacking but he didn't appear to know the first thing about hacking, including not being hacked, tracking and not being tracked. Nathan couldn't manage his network - from start to finish. Nathan's security used key cards without any bio-metrics - what are we to think? 1940s? Nathan had entries and exits that didn't have tracking - physical access was allowed - are they kidding? Nathan allowed multiple power failures that weren't controlled - a geek who allows his connection to go down simply isn't a geek - come on - my grid and solar powered home has millisecond switch-over battery back-up. Robots that whisper to each other - really quietly I presume is somehow unheard - come on. Robots that kill with a knife? I can only suppose they are the image of their low tech creator who couldn't stop a bot with a steel bar - or even disassemble his robot? Nathan didn't program the first law of robotics? Isaac Asimov 1942: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. What year is this? Caleb, friend to Ava the bot, claims Ava is a true AI - but Ava is a failure of the Turing test at the least because Ava didn't keep her man. At the end of the movie, Ava goes off to a street corner to observe people? How sweet."

"deelusionalmusic","7","12","22","10 June 2015"," Very interesting film.
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. This movie will keep you guessing until the very end. It purposely allows you to believe that you have figured out the premise of the story time and time again. However, surely you will be wrong. The movie takes a look into a largely respected internet coder company (with references to a company similar to Google). The company's owner has never made himself visible to his employees because he is a very secretive man whom lives in a secluded wooded area. The company's owner is working on a project to create an A.I. (artificial intelligence) in which has the capabilities of being human (having emotions, feelings, understanding body language and expressing oneself etc.) He needs a 2nd opinion to ensure that what he has created is indeed capable of doing all these things. That's when he brings in one of his employees. He later explains that he has used his search engine company to gather information from all of his employees and even users all across the world to help him better understand humans and to use this new found information to help him create his A.I. He hacks into webcams and microphones etc. to gain access to facial expressions of unsuspected users while they are indulging in pornographic videos and other online searches. He does this, not to be weird or to invade ones privacy, but yet to help him match body language and facial expressions to hi A.I. Whilst interviewing the A.I. the 2nd opinion of Caleb (the winner of the contest at the company owned by the employer) starts to feel emotions toward the robot and plans to set her free if the owner plans to kill her to recreate another A.I. The owner (Nathan) has planned all of this to simply see if his creation has reached a point of success worthy of sharing with the world. What you later find out, is that there was never any contest, and Nathan actually hand picked Mr. Caleb because he seemed like a genuinely good hearted guy and he seems rather vulnerable based on his pornographic searches and online profiles that Mr. Nathan had been spying on. Although Nathan seems to be a bit of a dick, he is truly intelligent and he is working on this project to better humanity. What Mr. caleb didn't realize, was that all of this had been preplanned and pre-though out. Well, unfortunately for Nathan, Caleb had a few tricks up his sleeves as well. Without spoiling the whole movie, let's just say that this flick ends in a very elegant yet bloody fashion. There are lessons to be learned in this film, and it's actually quite enjoyable. I would classify this film as a suspense thriller/sci-fi/dark comedy. Do your self a favor and pick this movie up at your local video store or redbox. Or wait till it hits netflix. But if you're looking for something good too watch right now, I think you can order it on the Roku store and possibly on demand if you have timewarner cable. I give this film 7 stars because it is quite enjoyable and I didn't expect much from it, but pleasantly to my surprize, it was well worth watching."

","Ah yes, nothing quite like a powerful man building anatomically correct, female droids and getting his jimmy wet with this bevy of bionic beauties ranging from blonde (is that a race?) to African to Asian. Between the incredibly smart, powerful man in tech with the body of a gym rat and Achilles heel of a lush; and the scrawny nerd who just wants the drunk one to admit he's a great coder; my brain was drowning in the urine of this pissing contest while the drunk nerd was drowning in metal vagina. I have no doubt many twelve year old boys probably grew pubes watching this movie, while the rest of us cringed at this nerd, male fantasy called a movie. If you've ever dreamed of raping chicks, but needing them to be robots so people don't judge your proclivity too severely, this is the movie of a lifetime for you!<br/><br/>But wait! There's more! So when these women aren't letting the king of the castle really give it to 'em, they desperately need rescuing from his house. Yeah, robots need rescuing. I'll tell you what, I'm about to get one of those BB-8 Spheros and if any of you jerks come to my apartment and try to ""rescue it"", I will call the cops on you so fast for burglary. It's a robot; not a person. I mean, super gross this guy ejaculates inside of them and all, but Siri sprouting a chest does not make her an actual person at all. But you know those women, always needing saving! Even the robot ones!<br/><br/>I'm still not done, by the way. It gets even worse. Then there's this whole thing where the main robot chick, who is way out of the league of the not drunk, hero nerd, uses her sexuality to manipulate him to free her. Again, you know, cos these robot concubines might be robots, but they are women, so they will obviously use their vagina to get out of situations they don't like. Even robot women! Of course, hero nerd is such a nice guy that he does this for robot woman. What does out-of-his-league robot woman do? You guessed it! She betrays him, effectively leaving him to starve to death (I assume he'll try to Beat Grylls it by drinking his own pee). Women! You just can't trust 'em! Amirite? Even when you build your own woman to have sex with/rape on the daily and nightly, they'll still stab you in the back bother literally and figuratively! Yes, if you're wondering, there's a scene where one of the robot concubines literally stabs drunk nerd in the back.<br/><br/>The sci-fi component itself is 8th grade, stoner level at best with very little resting in plausible technology. The philosophies that usually blossom of sci-fi do not even exist here. At some point, they use a Bhagavad Gita quote (that they credit Oppenheimer with, of course, I'm not going to get into that much more), but they do not manage to come up with a single original thought.<br/><br/>Pros: Kickass architecture and really pretty shots of Alaska.<br/><br/>Cons: Literally everything else about this movie. I'm surprised it's rated so highly, though I'm seeing most of the the people writing such glowing reviews are... you guessed it... dudes!<br/><br/>Recommended viewing: if you are a recovering alcoholic who feels like relapsing; a woman who was raped and feels like being triggered; an angry, white, male nerd who needs that extra push to rape and murder the chick who lives a couple doors over.<br/><br/>This is probably the only time I'll ever write a review on IMDb, because I'm really shocked that it has a score over 4 let alone all these reviews raving about how great it is. No. This movie is terrible."
"zetes","7","23","48","11 May 2015"," Well made but uninteresting and predictable
","The advancement of artificial intelligence to human levels has been a favorite subject for science fiction writers since the concept was invented, and it's been a popular subject for sci-fi movies for a long time now. Alex Garland's Ex Machina does little new with the subject, and contains very few surprises. Despite being fairly unoriginal, it's still an enjoyable piece of cinema. It survives on looks and the talent in front of the camera. Domhnall Gleeson stars (and is easily the least interesting of the basically four person cast) as a programmer who is selected by internet genius Oscar Isaac to test his new, advanced robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander). She is more than intriguing. She's gorgeous, and, against his better judgement, Gleeson becomes attracted to her as he tests her. Vikander is very convincing as a robot. Sounds like an insult, but her performance is very subtle in the way she emotes. Isaac is fun as always. The fourth person in the cast is Sonoyo Mizuno, who plays Isaac's Japanese servant - not difficult to figure out what her deal is, but I liked whenever she popped up. She and Isaac share a dance that's easily my favorite moment in the film. The movie's production design and cinematography, as well as its score, are all very good. Worth a watch, but I'd recommend waiting for video or streaming."

","So there's a genius who lives ""alone"" in a fancy cabin some-where in the woods (Alaska i think). His hobbies include boxing, among other exercises, getting drunk, and secretly making sexy robots; whom he likes to torture via isolation, as well as fool around with.<br/><br/>Oh and then there's a programmer named Caleb, who works for the genius' company. For some reason he's randomly selected... no wait ""chosen"", to come to this cabin by way of helicopter. He's invited there to screen a supposed A.I. and see if it is really just that: self awareness, personality, all that jazz. I guess the Genius wants a third party to give him feed back on what he's made by doing a mock ""turing test"".<br/><br/>Over all the film panned out to be predictable and quite bland, like unseasoned fries without ketchup. It could have definitely used some sirracha, which makes everything taste better! Unfortunately the writer and director thought that the bad dialogue would be glossed over with CGI and cinematography... which were better aspects of the film, but that doesn't say much.<br/><br/>Ex Machina plays like a college student film. I recommend this movie to young hipsters who don't read science fiction novels and have not seen Blade Runner or A.I.<br/><br/>Dear makers of the film, having naked and semi-naked women pretending to be androids isn't that appealing. I mean most of us have seen naked people before any way. But, thankfully this movie didn't turn out to be ""Fifty Shades of Robot"".<br/><br/>If you want to see a good android movie or something else about Artificial Intelligence, i recommend seeing Automata, with Antonio Banderas. As well as A.I. or I, Robot if you haven't already seen them, better yet go watch Ghost in the Shell (the anime).<br/><br/>That's all i have to say Signing off..."
"merrywood","9","15","29","9 May 2015"," Superb movie-making
","As a writer and visual concept artist, I was designing a new book cover for an author friend of mine, so in the process I recommended the movie, Ex Machina, to her. She said she was not going to bother with it --- and I found out why, the trailers caused her to believe it was about humans having sex with robots.<br/><br/>I told her, ""not even close"" and that if you blink, you might miss even the mention of sex in the picture.<br/><br/>Once again, the pinheads in advertising thinking they know how to sell a movie but in fact, destroying its release in the process. In fact, the film has one of the few multi-level-of-meaning, brilliant scripts I have seen in many years and everything else that follows, casting, production values, all superb. It would be a shame to see this one not make back its investment. Ex Machina is one of the best films I have seen in years. It is a study of human consciousness and the possibility of consciousness without conscience. For me, that is brilliant time and money spent on a movie."
"AacCento1","5","42","96","4 March 2015"," An annoying mis-step from a writer turned egoiste Director
","I saw this film with an open mind, having read a good deal of Sci Fi in my time. Alex Garland however will need to grow his skills as a film director and perhaps should have focused more on the writing and script before proceeding with this film. Having seen him speak at the BFI, NO Directing is not letting the actors do what they wish and hoping that it all comes together, it is about taking ownership to deliver your holistic design approach, having a viewpoint so that the actors you are collaborating with are brought with you.<br/><br/>The visuals were beautiful, however I found them visually similar to the 'Black Mirror' Channel 4 TV programme which is much much more challenging and interesting in its concepts than Ex Machina. This is a film that is highly derivative, I could see where it was going for the entire length of the film and was mostly bored and irritated at the clearly egotistical approach by the director to a subject that has been discussed many times before and by better directors. I went home and deliberately watched Solaris and later 2001 to cleanse my Sci Fi palette. Having watched Under the Skin last year, which was an OK film but also disappointing in its jarring approach and lack of full bodied story, I was hoping that Alex Garland could tackle the subject matter in a fresh way. I was wrong. For those serious Sci Fi watchers out there who love Blade Runner don't watch this film, you will be annoyed."

I may be bias because I am a big fan of A.I. movies...and maybe Alicia Vikander :) but the cast is perfect and love all three of them as actors. It is realistic and logical.. It is dark, comical, heartfelt, charming, mysterious, smart, and surprising... all in a single movie. Considering the movie is visually simple and takes place in a very limited space, it keeps me very interested with dialogue alone. It provokes deeper thought and the story is very well portrayed. It's one of my favorite movies thus far and the kind I would watch more than once or twice without a doubt.

","Alicia Vikander nailed this one. You're wondering as it progresses where it's going to actually go. If you look closely st Vikander's expressions and movements, she's playing perfectly what the directors sought to reveal - what really seems machine-like mannerisms, though suttle. I loved that. nevertheleaa as it comes to the end it is revealed what the other robots are: just robots, not the kind of AI that Ava is. Anyway, not to reveal the end here.

","Well, I didn't know what to expect going into this film, other than that robots might be involved. While I watched it, I was enjoying it, however, as the film's narrative progressed, it the plot became fairly, well, I don't want to say obvious; but better words escape me. In any case, the turns the story takes are fairly boring, and can be spotted from several kilometers away without magnification. The climax did not make me climax.<br/><br/>The characters aren't interesting. They aren't developed well over the film's progression, their behavior that is interesting isn't revealed in the nature of their character, which I suppose could be good, if you wanted to analyze them, but there just isn't really enough there to look at, since the characters aren't developed. I'd guess what's left then is to look at human nature, which is the concept that the film was, in my opinion, trying to address.<br/><br/>But it didn't do it well. It tries to make a statement about the nature of humanity through the actions of the robot. This would be interesting, since the robot is created in the image of man, it might give us something insightful into how we think of ourselves. The downfall of how this is carried out in Ex Machina comes from how the robot is made. It is simply the creation of one character in the film, so really anything said is through that characters bias, and since the characters are poorly developed, their bias is kind of half baked. It's their, but there's no explanation for it. In the end, the film felt like it tried to be insightful, but it just didn't know how to do that. <br/><br/>However, there were robo tits, so you may as well watch it I guess."

","I was so excited to see this film, but it really fell short for me, mainly in that the characters were poorly-developed. With 1 hr and 50 minutes, and only 3 or 4 characters in the entire story, there must be some serious script problems if a film fails to develop any of those parts into complex, sympathetic characters the audience can really connect with. In the end, I connected with none of them, and hungered for the film to to engage the deeper character issues that felt ripe for the taking, but were only touched-on at the surface. Visually, Ex Machina was a beautiful, well-made and well-acted piece of film, but the dialogue seemed to fail to develop interesting, complex, human characters we could really care about and empathize with. I easily get sucked-into characters and stories. Its my favorite part of the film-watching experience, but this film failed to make me feel that I deeply understood (or cared about) even one of the characters."

","If I had realised this was by Alex Garland I would not have bothered watching. I remember reading his book the Beach years ago and thinking 'there's something not very nice about this'. At the time I wasn't sure what it was. But now having seen Ex Machina, I have the same feeling. That the story has been chosen simply to appeal to a large audience, in a rather manipulative, unthinking and unfeeling way.<br/><br/>I don't normally write bad reviews - of anything. Preferring to focus on the positive. But I so dislike this I felt I had to write something to put people off wasting their time, or assimilating some of this 'nastiness'.<br/><br/>In the case of Ex Machina I can just imagine Garland wondering what he would do for his next project, googling AI and quickly finding the AI Box Experiment. And rather than do the heart- and soul-searching work that would be necessary to produce anything original I imagine him quickly turning somebody else's idea into his next big proposal to present to the film studio.<br/><br/>So an unoriginal idea, presented in a fairly pedestrian way. Lots of images derived from a young person's view of 'sexuality', made me also wonder if this film is rather prejudiced against women?<br/><br/>It is reasonably paced but I found myself yawning a lot - not quite what I would expect from a good thriller.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson is OK, does a pretty good job."

The story seems simple at first, but is actually quite layered.</li></ul><br/><br/>-- Nice to see a film about AI that isn't about robots killing humans (well, isn't entirely about that, anyway...)<br/><br/>-- Has an eerie quality that I enjoyed.<br/><br/>-- Nicely minimalistic. I especially liked the opening sequence -- very clean exposition. There's no padding here. But that might work to its disadvantage in the end...<br/><br/>THE BAD:<br/><br/>-- I didn't connect with any of the characters. While they seemed realistic in a way, they were really pretty one dimensional (and I'm not talking about the robot here). I think that's the danger of minimalism -- the characters can become slaves to the story.<br/><br/>Nathan is manipulative and creepy, but not evil enough to inspire hatred. And Caleb came across as a chump. So when he did something brave, I was too busy feeling embarrassed for him to revel in his heroic qualities. And I wanted a hero! But maybe this wasn't that kind of film. <br/><br/>-- The idea that any artificial 'female' is automatically a sex toy feels not-so-fresh. For me, using that as a critical plot twist really blunted the impact of the whole movie. It may make sense to 'go there', but the movie could have been far more interesting if they'd found a new angle.<br/><br/>In the end, the film was perhaps just too subtle for my tastes, and I was kind of bored.

This is all this movie is about, how do AI machines personality develop. Quite fine observation when the android has trouble making a choice.

","Everyone knows what happens when man plays God? Apparently, we haven't learned our lesson from watching this happen over and over, and sometimes the problem appears to be solved. Mostly, it is disaster. ""Ex- Machina"" presents a new twist on an old story.<br/><br/>A scientist and a young man get involved in an experiment to see when machines are able to gain consciousness and are able to learn, feel, and a variety of feelings which might not be the best humanity can offer. At first, it's perfectly obvious who is in control, and it's a terrifying portrayal by Isaac, who looking both intense physically and psychologically seems to be able to manipulate technology, emotions, in every way necessary. We go in with the idea that nothing will escape this man, and that the experiment will have a tragic ending for everyone around him.<br/><br/>Soon we get to meet AVA and she's a fascinating piece of work, cold and detached at first, an amazing technological computer with enough latex to show her gender but enough displayed to remind you of her origins. Little by little, she appears to be programmed to lead the young scientist into a very confusing psychological trip. He is being manipulated by both the creator and his creation, or is it by him only? Isaac always is in control, even when he is drunk. He has designed the environment, set the rules, and he's after all a genius.<br/><br/>Matters become complicated when the three characters begin to do peculiar things. The race is on, and it is difficult to gauge who has the lead. By the time we get to the end of the story, everything is even more confusing, until the last ten minutes when we realize that manipulation was at the heart of the situation, and that most everything is explained, but we still wonder.<br/><br/>So God creates beings in his own image and then makes sure than he retains the upper hand. We have seen this theme in recent movies like ""Prometheus"" when an entire race is deemed unworthy of survival, and the travelers need to eliminate every trace of them. There are enough pieces of the puzzle around in ""Ex-Machina"" to give us clues, but the mystery and the philosophy are two sides of the same coin, and as I said before, it could go either way.<br/><br/>""Ex-Machine"" explores what being human is. What separates us from other beings. Who made us? Did we evolve on our own? Is there such as a thing as evolution? Mechanical or otherwise? What is the future of technology? ""Star Trek"" has explored this issue before, and characters such as Data make you wonder. In this film something magical is achieved as we are given a drama full of emotional twists, where we see machines behaving like humans, and humans turning into machines, or is it what we just saw or heard?<br/><br/>***** out of *****."

Spoilers: setting: stunning Mother Nature with ""amniotic"" water everywhere. Characters: two male gods, lily white & swarthy, encased in their safe from super nature goddess tiny house. Swarthy god is brilliant, yet can't be trusted & is drunk most of the time, lily white god will save the damsel AI, who looks about 14 & is see-through except for her breasts, rear end, & baby face. Never mind the gratuitous display of female bodies as only bodies (shaved in all the ""right"" places), consciousness in this movie is apparently being able to sexually trick a man into letting a woman out of her man-created cage. Men also come off terribly in this movie; however, they are not the victims, they are the ""serial killer"" and the ""white knight."" Garland is seeming rather Bible-centric in that Ex Machina is like a weird twist on the Adam & Eve narrative. It has nothing to do with AI and nothing to do with a ""war of the sexes.""

","Ex Machina was an enjoyable movie, but if anyone were to honestly compare it to similar sci-fi movies, they would quickly see that it is far inferior to these. Here is why:<br/><br/>Visuals: There were none. There was a setting, the actors/actresses and the robots. There were no slow motion scenes, no zooming slowly, no intense imagery, just very vanilla director work. <br/><br/>Writing: The writing revealed every ""surprise"" moment, moments before the surprise moment removing any feeling of suspense. Most of the scenes felt isolated, mainly because it felt as though the writer was more interested in letting you see how smart he was rather than telling a story. Too many times there were philosophical disconnections (explaining how the robots brain functioned) from the actual story, and although they tied into the story (in a very clumsy way), they didn't make the story any better and in some cases, worse. The disconnection was that these bits of story were under-utilized throughout the rest of the story.<br/><br/>In general the movie felt flat/vanilla and I could almost get the feeling that more time was spent making the robots look like robots than the story and visuals of the movie look/feel special. As a HUGE Sci-Fi fan (especially of this specific sub- genre) I was pretty disappointed with the movie. I've seen too many really good ones, to think this should be mentioned in the same breath."

Otherwise, people who rely on  your reviews end up watching BORING, DUMB and CHEAP movies like this.  This whole movie runs on just 2 guys (1 employer and 1 employee) and of  course 2 robot girls who do nothing but are confined to a room - and  all of them confined to a so-called research center in the middle of  NOWHERE, in the middle of mountains where there is NO cellular  network!! Come on guys, even TV serials like Everybody Loves Raymond  have more people and places than this movie. Would you watch a movie  that has only 2 guys? Why rate this movie as 8, 9, and 10??  They can't even write a story - the movie starts with the employee  texting someone and those texts are skipped so quickly you can't even  read them. Next thing you know (IN LESS THAN 15 SECONDS), we see a  helicopter dropping him off near a mountain from where he walks less  than 10 steps and finds a door to what seems like a fence! It has a  facial recognition equipment and it reads his face, prints out his ID  card (!!!!) so he can enter the door. LOL - there is only one other guy  inside and this guy and there are no other people joining them and this  needs an ID card printing machine outside the door???? How realistic is  that??  The guy is apparently hired to test a robot girl for its AI. We all  know that it just a HUMAN GIRL made up and applied with some CGI in  parts to look like a robot - her face looking very much like any other  girl. Just the arms and abdomen are made transparent with wires, tubes  showing through. The other robot girl is meant to sleep with the  employer and DOES NOT talk at all!!!! Is that it??? LOL.  Actually, the Robot is tested using the guy to see if the robot would  fall in love with him (LOL) and escape from the place for love like a  human!! The sessions between this employee and the robot girl are so  BORING that you would fall asleep. Yes, finally the girl escapes  (abandoning the guy in the lab - FLAWED AI ???) and shown walking in a  downtown in the form of a shadow - NO PEOPLE SHOWN AGAIN!!! while the  guy is locked in the research center and most probably dead from  starvation. Employer is dead already. Is that it??????  The employer guy is always shown as DRINKING alcohol with a heavy BEARD  and NO HAIR on the head - disgusting like an ADDICT (just watch the  trailers) and does not look anything like the owner of the LARGEST  SEARCH ENGINE IN THE WORLD and a TOP-NOTCH PROGRAMMER who could create  robots with AI and run a research center in the mountains with just  himself. In fact, he is NEVER shown coding anything on the computer or  creating robots. If drinking alcohol can create robots with AI, there  would be more alcoholics in this world than programmers!!!! They could  not even show him coding?? LOL - what a screenplay!!  Just because the producers have money, they think they could dish out  any CRAP and expect us to spend our money and time on it - when they  cannot even write a story? Well, money doesn't get you brains, does  it??? They don't even have money to hire more actors to show more  people. Out and outl, this is a CHEAPLY made, DUMBEST, low-budget movie  with NO story and NOTHING in it.  That's it!! I lost 2 hours of my life that I can NEVER get back.  Another movie that was overrated last year was CALVARY - it is so  religious you get BORED. Another dumb movie of this year was KINGSMAN -  it is so OLD FASHIONED - why would anyone want to watch a movie that is  so 60's looking in story, dialogs, people, costumes, picturization???  Those BOND movies are suited to those times - not these modern times.  Even Bond movies are much better than Kingsman. If there was 0 rating,  I would give them 0. If there was -10, I would give them -10.  All the reviews by other agencies, studios, etc in this movie's trailer  are just over-rated HYPE because they know there is NOTHING in this  movie - they know it - and now they are laughing their way to their  BANK with our money!!! As long as there are DUMB reviewers who rate  such DUMB movies as 8, 9 and 10 stars, these producers will reap money  out of our pockets. Do not be afraid to rate movies HONESTLY.  Do yourself a favor - stay away from this movie, save your money, time,  disgust and frustration. THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!  What did you folks review it as? Intriguing?? Tense??? Great CGI????  LOL - those who reviewed with the above words probably never watched a  movie in their lives.

The triangular interaction between the focal characters was intense and it worked so well almost a love triangle, all this and with real clever and graceful acting.

To give a honest review here it's got to be without a shadow of doubt going to be one of my most favorite films of all time! I just can't compare this to any other Sci Fi films old or new but I can give a rating out of 10 and it's so very seldom I can give a film 10/10 however this one is an exception, it was a fantastic watch and deserves all the admiration and plaudits it get's.

"landriser","4","17","36","18 May 2015"," A big disappointment
","You can judge the scale of my disappointment by the fact this is my first review here. The movie started strong and given the tension increase I was expecting a really nice outcome. But it turned into a shallow and alogical piece. Logic abandoned. Even Asimov's AI had a first unbreakable law that it couldn't hurt a human being - this should be the first thing to integrate as a rule in a AI, but hey our My Genius Creator just skips that, because it's cooler to build the AI without such clauses even though you intend to use it as a slave against its will. Come on! Nobody is that stupid, especially a genius who invents the first AI! Another very important thing to consider is the veracity of the whole development process which is presented as done by a SINGLE man, dude what, that's not even serious. What about the reason for the main antagonist to get drunk as dead every night, or is that how he invented the AI? Unbelievable and unrealistic the movie is a failure to me, sorry."
"palavitsinis","6","17","36","3 April 2015"," Well, it's really in the middle. Nothing special
","6 out of 10 comes mainly cause I am somewhat of a fan of AI related movies and it's really really generous. The acting was not that special on any part or level. Nice concept, nice idea and an amazing setting for the movie. Other than that, nothing. It was really really frustrating that a no-brain that was chosen to carry out a test, managed to completely screw things up for a guy that had all the mind in the world to build his own empire but had no mind at all for making the place he worked and lived in safer.<br/><br/>He was the best programmer money could buy and yet this other guy that new just the average stuff there is to know, managed to hack him and change his security system. And then you get the amazingly clever AI robot that manages to seduce a guy that has spent lots and lots of hours on illegal websites as it seems, to open the cage and let the beast out! And the best of all is that in the end, this guy that works out every day and was really super strong, cannot muster some courage to hit back the flimsy robot and survive. None whatsoever! <br/><br/>I am all for fairytale, but sometimes, the power in made-up stories comes from real facts in them. This movie is close to reality, it is plausible, but the critical parts, where the outcome of the movie hangs by a thread, are not realistic at all, and lack lots and lots of evidence if you will. Tried to provide this review a week after watching the movie so that I get a bit calmer, but it seems that frustration comes back every time I think about it, so I will stop here. <br/><br/>My overall recommendation, rent it when it comes out on DVD. Don't waste your money on going to the movies for it, you're not missing out on anything. <br/><br/>PS: A note to all the movie/script writers out there: A.I. has been done hundreds of times in movies, following the same basic pattern. Robots are evil and they will be the end of humanity, blah blah blah. Or on the other hand, robots also turn into ""humans"" eventually. To be able to create something original within all this ""already-made"" cloud of movies, you have to go the extra mile and I am sad to say that ""Ex Machina"" did not."
"krycek19","2","15","31","27 March 2016"," Artmovie disguised as sci-fi
","This movie is more an art movie than it is sci-fi.<br/><br/>Had it been sci-fi/horror as the trailer indicates, it might have been interesting. But it's mostly boring. Al though it kept me curious enough to watch it until the end, it never really delivered.<br/><br/>There are several plot holes in the movie. The main one is Nathan, the founder of the fictional Microsoft like company ""Bluebook"".<br/><br/>Why would a man as rich as he is, isolate himself completely from the rest of the world, just to work on his robots, when he is clearly lonely? Why is he not living in a big city and partying and getting laid with women that wanna marry him, because of his wealth? Why would Caleb agree to meet him and spend a week at his research facility, no questions asked? Why is there no service on Calebs smart-phone? A man like Nathan would wanna be online 24/7 as he is as he chose Caleb, who did not win any lottery at the Bluebook company.<br/><br/>Why would Nathan not have build his robots, so he could shut them down without having to go any wear near them, in case they get out of control? Why would Nathan have build robots that can trigger power failure when they recharge their batteries without Nathan knowing about this? Why would Caleb stay in a facility with no windows alone with another man that he doesn't even know? How can Caleb fall in love with a robot in less than a week? Even if she is based on his pornography profile? (what the hell is that? I googled it and there is no such thing) As attractive and intelligent as the robot Ava, appears, she is still just a machine. And that a man as intelligent as Caleb, can be manipulated by a robot is ridiculous.<br/><br/>And in my opinion Nathan is not evil. He might be torturing his robots that are all female and have sex with them and eventually shut them down. But they're not living creatures. They're machines that he created. And he has the right to do whatever he wants to with his own creations.<br/><br/>Then there is Ava's body with and without skin on it. Without skin, she has a big butt and big breasts. But as soon as she has put skin on her body both her butt and breasts has been reduced in size. This is of course due to Alicia Wikanders sad petite body. But why make the body without skin so attractive, when the body with skin is so sad?? They should have cast a more attractive actress with a curvy body, like Scarlett Johansson. That would have made sense.<br/><br/>And as far as Ava's, face and scull goes, it's not even an original design. In the original 1987 Robocop movie, Robocops face and scull, look almost exactly the same as Ava's.<br/><br/>READ NO FURTHER IF YOU PLAN TO SEE THE MOVIE!! As far as the ending goes, it didn't make much sense. Ava and another robot kills Nathan and Ava escapes, leaving Caleb locked inside the facility. Nathan wouldn't have made his robots so intelligent that they could manipulate humans or be strong enough to kill humans or control the power. The helicopter pilot that flew Nathan to the facility would have questioned Ava showing up at the end of the week instead of Caleb. He would have called Nathan to verify whatever lie Ava told him to get on the helicopter.<br/><br/>I could go on and on with the major plot holes of this movie.<br/><br/>I can only say, if you expect a sci-fi horror movie, you will get neither. The only interesting part of the movie is the special effects that are impressive, but not stunning once you know how they did it.<br/><br/>With a bigger budget and a different ending, this could have been a much better movie."
"JadziaV626","6","18","39","17 May 2015"," Pretty, but shallow.
","There are many things to like about this film, including the CGI, the mood and the overall style. However, the artificial and sterile style reminds me of Gattaca, and the mood is almost identical to that of 2001.<br/><br/>The plot is relatively unoriginal and predictable, but the scenes are still well written and performed. The dialogue and interaction between Ava and Caleb is captivating – illustrating the potential difficulty of separating an advanced AI from a human being. The story has a very clear philosophical undertone.<br/><br/>Aside from the Caleb–Ava interaction, the plot is otherwise not very convincing. There are too many unanswered questions as to why Nathan does what he does. Essential elements of the plot are introduced with entirely unconvincing reasons. The gratuitous usage of hyper-sexualised female robots with two men is a bit too cliché – too ""Howard Wolowitz"" – for my liking."
"johngraham1964","3","12","24","31 May 2015"," Oh dear...
","The trailers for this looked really good but it turned out to be a very slow film with a predictable ending. I'm sure the CGI cost some money but the rest was shot cheaply with minimal sets and minimal cast. The AI inventor came across as such an unsympathetic character that you just don't care when he's murdered. The android then waltzes off to the helicopter that has come for the intern and the pilot happily flies her off without asking where the intern is. (You might suggest the android killed the helicopter pilot but that's not shown on screen, nor is it implied that she has flying skills). The ending - with the intern locked away behind a glass door - is sub-Westworld. It was a film where one wanted more and didn't get it."

","Recommended for the serious film buff, however if your science fiction movie is more action based like transformers, this film is not for you. Your interest level will soon evaporate. If you are prepared to however to give this film the time, Garland take on the nightmare consequence of android self-awareness has much to admire. Intelligent dialogue combined with a compelling storyline set in a classic confined location delivers the goods. The android in question Ava is brilliant combination of Cgi and excellent acting from Alicia Vikander. This can be seen most tellingly in the scenes where she seduces and manipulates Domhnall Gleeson the computer programmer who thinks he is carrying out the Turing test on her. The dynamic scenery used in film adds to the impact of the film. Excellent direction by Garland and the rat in the cage in ending also adds to the package."
"xylem-701-493069","5","6","10","6 November 2016"," Interesting premise badly executed
","Well, first define intelligence. There are all kinds of intelligent life on earth that don't get recognition, so I'm not sure the robotic kind is anywhere near competing with the most basic existing intelligence, say bacteria: http://cosmicfingerprints.com/intelligent-bacteria/. All the trailer hoopla and name dropping with warnings about AI tried to build the premise about being on the brink of human extinction at the hands of AI, but the movie did not make a good case for it.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this movie, but it has a number of problems working against it for suspending disbelief, including the inventor of the greatest search engine and AI ever (watch out Google) who lives as a recluse on his property in the woods that is the size of a small country, a teenage looking boy-next-door employee chosen to test out the company's premier product and sexy robots whose hardware we get to see.<br/><br/>The bad guy genius doesn't really come across like a bad guy or a genius, more like an amiable, alcoholic frat buddy who hasn't quite thought through basic security. The protagonist is hard to root for given he falls in love with a plastic/light-up robot a few minutes after meeting ""her"" and then spends the rest of the movie trying to save her like a knight in shining armor. And then there's the girl robot who doesn't really come across as a robot, but as a girl trying to act like a robot. <br/><br/>The story takes a hopeful turn when there is a possibility that almost everyone is a robot, but that hope is dashed quickly. There are attempts at reaching some philosophical heights with references to Jackson Pollack's painting style and the Bhagavad Gita, but those really go nowhere. The parallel that humans are just programmed beings was probably the most powerful insight of the film, but it never gets fleshed out. <br/><br/>The end felt unnecessary, farcical and manipulative and appears to want the viewer to interpret it as the machines have taken over. This is pretty absurd given that the lab for creating them has been abandoned and the one person who could make another one is not able to.<br/><br/>The movie does build suspense well and has some interesting twists, but with all the suspense and twists it works to build to a crescendo that never appears and instead is replaced with a forced and contrived ending that really didn't make any profound statement about artificial intelligence at all."

"desertdogproductions","10","11","22","25 April 2015"," Not just another AI movie.
","This movie was a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The acting was amazing, especially from Isaac, who shifted through his character's personality traits with ease without over-doing it. You were left believing that Ava possessed true AI, and the part was played to perfection. The character of Caleb was absolutely a perfect fit for this film; a plain, homely, and gullible young man whose ego can easily be stoked to do the bidding of Nathan Bateman. But by and large, Issac's unpredictable nature and creepiness stole the show.<br/><br/>The locations were both unique and awe-inspiring, from the modernistic earth-friendly fortress in the middle of nowhere, to the edges of mighty glaciers, to flowery mountain meadows. The cinematography and visuals were top-notch, from the glass barrier walls and creepy hallways, to the natural lighting that filled every room with a soft glow.<br/><br/>The plot was very well written, but will go over the head of less cerebral movie-goers. I especially love the parallels with the biblical creation story, filmed in a ""garden of Eden"" where man (Caleb) is tempted by Eve (conveniently called Ava) and observed by god/creator (Nathan). But god's earlier (and not so perfect) creation of woman, Lilith (one of Nathan's dysfunctional prototypes was even named Lily), rises to create havoc with man and god. Once Eve (Ava) ate from the tree of knowledge (committed sin), she left Eden (Nathan's retreat).<br/><br/>This movie is about more than just the philosophical implications of true AI, but about human nature at it's core.<br/><br/>Definitely the best movie I have seen this year, and probably the best AI movie ever."
"a-16895","6","5","8","4 February 2017"," This is an okay to good movie but some of the criticisms are insane.
","This movie was a little slow-paced to my liking, but it was still enjoyable. It passed the ""enjoyable"" test for me although I wouldn't consider it a great film.<br/><br/>There are some legitimate criticisms for this film. There's no reason to expose the human tester to the robot as part of a blind test. Blind is blind. You wouldn't show the bottle to the wine taster before you do a blind test. We use blind tests in so many things. It's not even a complicated protocol. Even the Pepsi challenge does it, but this film pretends like we're past that now. How do you prove if a robot is humanlike to a human who already knows it's a robot? The robot has to convince the human, but how can it in that state? It's not just a handicap, but you have to question a human who says ""Yeah, I was completely convinced"" even when seeing wires and cables.<br/><br/>So Nathan sits around all day in semi-retirement, I accept, but how is he the sole developer on this project? <br/><br/>I'm not going to pretend the readers here are stupid, but for the sake of simplicity, let's simplify things. In the tech world there are two kinds of innovations, one is ""it's a simple idea, but I thought of it first"" like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. and then there are complicated ideas that even if you thought of it first, it's difficult to do. Intel, Android, Windows, H.265, etc.<br/><br/>The first of the bunch is how we get apps created by a loner in his dorm. The second is the work of many, many multi-billion dollar corps, governments, the military, universities, etc. <br/><br/>A human can create a 140-character app like Twitter, or a Polaroid sharing site all by himself. He cannot create a life-like robot, hardware and software. Here we see a sole person working on the robot. No one else comes to the island. He doesn't contact anyone in the outside world. He seems to be doing all the work, interviews, upgrades, including physically handling and assembling the robots.<br/><br/>This film could've added one scene where he gets the next gen bots from a chopper, one scene where he has a conference with developers, just one, to show us that it's not a billionaire who created life literally all by himself. As a result of this, the film feels claustrophobic.<br/><br/>There's also strange things about this film when it comes to dialogue. There's something off. It seems like a non-technical person trying to talk technical/geek or a socially awkward geek with anxiety disorder trying to talk normal to a girl in a second language. I don't know how to put it but no one talks like that. Geeks don't talk like that. Techies don't. Socially awkward people don't. Average tech- ignorant people don't. It just feels completely unnatural. <br/><br/>My friend joked that the dialogue was written by AI and I believed him. I waited until the end to see if it was mentioned before the credits. I searched the internet. Nopes. It's just strange dialogue. I see this sometimes when foreign-language speakers write English language films, you get fluent native-speakers say strange things that don't make sense. The writer here is a native speaker, but maybe he tried to write the dialogue in geek, which explains its awkwardness, except geek is not a language, dialect, accent or a way of speaking, it's just the topics that are different.<br/><br/>There are things that didn't make sense. Caleb starts to doubt if he's a robot or not. But he eats and drinks - robots don't put dead animals and plants into their circuitry. He must remember that he gets thirsty, he urinates and defecates, he smells if he doesn't take a shower. I would check for bodily functions before I start cutting myself and punching mirrors. If you can take a dump, you're probably not a robot.<br/><br/>These are legitimate criticisms. But what is not legitimate is saying this movie set women back 500 years. Really? Because of this movie women cannot vote anymore? Did women lose property rights in the UK because of this film? <br/><br/>Get over yourselves, people."

","Great execution. Worth the time. I find it hard to say that these days. Has all the isolation of the Shining. As well as the stark look in places with the straight lines. The monolith in 2001 is Ava in this film. Ex Machina looks amazing on many levels...The lighting, the frame, the angles on the sets. Nice modular synthesizer sounds make up most of the sound track ala A Clockwork Orange. Very effective but never in the way. There are questions at the end which is a good thing in my book. This film conjures simultaneous feelings of horror and joy that linger long after viewing. If you wanted to be picky, you could find a few holes in the story line. They don't detract from the overall affect of this film. Again, worth the time."

","Alex Garland has done an impressive thing. He's managed to produce a better Sci-fi film than Sci-Fi giant Ridley Scott's latest attempt, and he's managed to make it popular too! Ex Machina looks at artificial intelligence without re-working the trite old moral issue of 'can we switch off a machine that is self aware?' that every movie on a similar theme has since plagiarised from Spileberg's A.I. over a decade ago.<br/><br/>And what's more, the interesting script and rich mise-en-scène are strongly balanced with brilliant CGI that actually supports the film rather than competes with it (finally!).<br/><br/>The film has an original style, an engaging script and a directorial ability worthy of Kubrick himself. In fact it's so good I didn't mind over-looking some of the more florid, but infrequent, philosophical and scientific inaccuracies of the dialogue.<br/><br/>A well needed dose of quality into the Sci-fi genre."
"almosalami","9","5","8","14 July 2015"," Great philosophical-intellectual-type sci-fi film
","This is one hell of a directorial debut for Alex Garland. You see, to me, sci-fis can go in one of two directions: awesome action thriller (Alien), great philosophical-intellectual type film (Interstellar, 2001: A Space Odyssey, etc.), and if a sci-fi tries to go both ways (Prometheus...), it does so at the expense of both ways and you end up with an average middle-ground, in my humble opinion. This film does the philosophical-intellectual thing really well. There are 4 things which make this film a great film: Oscar Isaac's character (very fascinating to listen to and watch; he's one of those really smart but definitely not nerdy geniuses, kind of like Tony Stark/Iron Man in a way) and Ava's character (brings a touch of humanity to the plate, ironically, as she is shown to be vulnerable but not all that she seems character), the dialogue and interactions between the characters (all of it, from the discussions on AI to aspects of life to what it means to be human, which is always a huge plus for me), the suspense towards the end and the twist, and the overall exploration of AI. The acting all around is great, the soundtrack, cinematography, and directing really set the mood very well, and the way we are shown things and how we gradually find out the explanations keeps you intrigued all through along with the great dialogue. There is a surprising amount of nudity, though, in this film, which kind of caught me off guard. There is only one slight weakness to the film, and that's Domnhall Gleeson's character. He isn't really fleshed out, and I feel like they had a missed opportunity to do that really well in the beginning, because throughout the film, you kind of just see him as this guy who's into AI, and nothing much more. What really made me notice this was because of how great Oscar Isaac and Ava were, so in that crowd, he stands out. Anyways, it's not really an issue. Just more of a missed opportunity for a perfect film."

I know this would be the normal evolution of things in real world, but it's a movie for God's sake! Give hope! I was shocked when I saw Ava abandoning the poor guy like that! And if we suppose he is a super- minded coder, why the hell didn't he think to program the system to obey only HIS orders? He could just don't tell Ava that, and this way, he would be able to really test her about if she was lying to him or not! If she failed, he would prove that as a human was smarter than her. Of course it's the emotional part, but he showed stupidity trusting her... Now, imagine a walking A.I. to act like a human using the intelligence of a machine! In the way things went on in this movie, I give our planet about 20- 30 years of real life."
"IanAJohnson","9","5","8","8 June 2015"," This film was deep, thought provoking and tense.
","Ex Machina is a psychological thriller about a man who is sent to an isolated building in order to test an artificial intelligence and prove that it is self aware. This is an incredibly small, yet powerful film. There are three main characters (the man, the creator, and the A.I.) and something like two side characters (a pilot that drops off the protagonist, and an assistant that doesn't speak). All of the main characters are so well written and developed. They feel so real, deep and interesting. The pacing is very slow and deliberately so. The dialogue is very specific and concise, so there were many segments of silence used to allow the audience to think about what is being said. The film is aware of the audience and gives them time to think. While many artistic and intellectual films don't care if the audience isn't aware of whatever metaphors the film makers had in mind, this film took some time to explain and introduce metaphors and left it to the audience the find out why the metaphor is relevant. I left this film feeling smarter, like a learned something that I wanted to learn more about. The film asked deep questions and gave a couple little insights to guide the audience to what might be an answer. I was constantly interacting with a non-interactive medium. The script was so smart and aware of what kind of movie it was one could say the film is self aware. There are parts in this movie that tackled ideas that are typically only seen in fan discussions and theories. Not only that but it was tense and well acted, leaving me blind to what was going to happen next. I was blown away by this film and while the ending was not as strong as the rest of the film, I still have to recommend seeing the film.<br/><br/>On a side note, there is some full female nudity in this film. I occasionally read a couple of content guides to prepare for rated R films. The content guides for this film are quite wrong in my opinion. Yes, there was some full female nudity, but none of it is erotic, and it is in very small scenes. There was even a mention of why it is necessary. If you are sensitive to nudity in film, do not worry about this film. Some scenes might drag longer than you want (yet still brief), but it is very tastefully done."
"zlidrit","1","14","30","16 May 2015"," Incredibly overrated
","After reading several articles about this movie, describing it as most intelligent science fiction film in decades, I must say that i was shocked to see how hugely overrated the movie actually is.<br/><br/>The story takes place in alternative hipster reality. Genius google-like search engine inventor, invites another hipster from hipster googlelike company to visit his mysterious hipster mansion. There he reveals he is developing artificial intelligence (all alone) in form of robots that looks like top models and have vaginas (because in his words having sexual organ is key to intelligence!?). The robot seduces the hipster into releasing him from its creator. Kills the creator and mercilessly imprisons hipster to die from starvation (apparently nobody thought robot should have kill switch)<br/><br/>I am being deliberately satirical. But the extremely stylish visuals and incredibly shallow plot really got to me. It is probably what a movie avant-garde thinks science fiction is about - coupled with lot of expert term throwing. But the whole premise is infantile and on lowest entry level of serious science fiction.<br/><br/>The premise that AI thinks like human, obsesses about freedom, self preservation ( even has implanted vagina, because it maybe wants to enjoy sex ) is more on the level of action flicks like Terminator and surely nowhere near intelligent science fiction.<br/><br/>If you want real intelligent science fiction do you self a favor and skip this. There are far better movies like Primer, Coherence and Prestidigitation for example"

","As a life long hard-core sci-fi fan, I can state that the premise is a very old one. Lately, we are seeing a flood of movies about humanity/humans integrating with bionics/computers. The actors were great and the sets added to the mood. However, the pacing is slow and the dialog is too sparse for the subject. Much more could have been made of the creator/AI relationship. At least, Ava didn't get ridiculous super powers. Bottom line is that I am glad that I stuck with it; although, in the beginning, when the computer mogul had to explain what the ""Turing test"" is to a ""brilliant"" coder, I almost bailed. By the time, the ridiculous and illogical sexual aspects emerged, it was too late."

And for most part of the film, the story is solid and holds up.<br/><br/>Acting is very good. Especially from A.I prospective and all of them. You can see the very nature of robot hiding behind human faces and its programmed emotions. Great job on that part. Big Thumbs up for Alicia Vikander, she had me convinced that she wasn't human. <br/><br/>CGI was great. They did a fantastic job of bringing very likable and realistic type of robot body to life.<br/><br/>Story: like i said earlier for most part this was a great and solid story, even enjoyed the twisting of one's own reality to think that instead of testing the A.I that all of this was a test to see if the A.I understands that its an A.I. The whole chess conversation was brilliant. Does a chess computer know that its playing chess? However after the Big Reveal the movies story takes a dive. We learn that its not a pure A.I. but rather a program that has to use a certain function to try and escape. So he was the maze and she was the rat. So everything she did ad she thought that she felt was all because of Nathans programmed problem inside her (Escape) and although she succeeded i getting out, she failed in thinking freely. She didn't feel anything about what she did with either Nathan and Caleb (They both end the same way). She not only FAILED her Turing test, but was never actually a form of an A.I. Lastly and this is major problem for me. The whole planned relied on when there is power shut down, the protocols are reversed. However at the end when we have that shut down the protocols which were changed, some how went back to their original form.<br/><br/>Overall this is an enjoyable film with some really interesting ideas and concepts."
"matthewssilverhammer","10","8","15","1 May 2015"," Why I Love Film
","Maybe I'm jaded by an over-consumption of entertainment and media, but I rarely see a film that actually affects the way I view the world. Ex Machina, an Under the Skin meets a-darker-and-more- pessimistic-Her, did. It asks age old scifi questions: Our humanity makes us worthwhile, but what makes us human? At your core, what makes youyou? It's a spine-tingling mystery-thriller full of intrigue and imminent dread that's heady themes and heavy ambiance are so good it's hard to believe without seeing. Gleeson plays a young coder who's invited to spend a week with an eccentric, shut-in genius (Isaac) who has secretly built the world's first Artificial Intelligence. Like many films about robots, the narrative is more interested in the emotion of its characters than their intelligence. With the brains of Tarkovsky and the sly humor and atmospherics of Kubrick, the science-based melodrama plays out with classic precision. Gleeson is fantastically wide- eyed, while Isaac is wonderfully sinister, conveying so much darkness under his lying eyes and words. The star, however, is Ava, the beautifully created android at the center, who makes this year's Chappie look like a coffee-shop doodle. Surreally portrayed with heartbreaking honesty by Vikander, she represents a warmly naïve sweetness underpinned by an ominous intelligence. Technically, the movie is immaculate: engaging dialogue, perfect sets, striking and horrifying imagery. However, to over- intellectualize the critical merits of the film would be to treat it dishonestly. It's a movie about reconciling intellect with impulse. So while it may not be everyone's cup of tea, its piercing humanity and tonal brilliance remind me of why I've always loved film."
"acedj","9","3","4","14 November 2019"," Not what I expected
","I went into this movie expecting one thing, only to find it was completely different. There are some very good plot twists in here that make a review of the plot difficult. A young guy wins a chance to go stay with the owner of the company for which he works, to take part in a very secret product development. It turns out that his boss has developed a very lifelike robot with full AI and he tasks his employee with testing it in conversations. That is all I feel comfortable saying about the plot. This movie is excellently done, from the acting to the direction to the cinematography. It is pretty close to a masterpiece. This is not, I repeat not the kind of movie to watch if you cannot think while watching a movie. This is most definitely a thinking person's film."

","This movie could have been great but it has a lot of plot holes and ultimately makes no sense. There is absolutely no character development, we know nothing about either of the characters from beginning to end. They present no reasons for them to do anything besides the fact that they do it to move the story along. I can accept the cold-opening and lack of backstory, but Ex Machina does not do anything with its concept.<br/><br/>They never explore the philosophical implications of ANYTHING. There was so much wasted potential here. Initially you think that Caleb has some interesting questions for the robot, but it never goes anywhere! The most they could do is shoehorn a couple quotes in there instead of actually delving into philosophical ideas. The dialogue in this movie is stilted. The conversations are not meaningful when they should have been the whole focus of the movie.<br/><br/>I really wanted this movie to be good but it's another case of the trailer being better than the film. If you're looking for insightful thoughts on AI and human behavior, then this movie does not deliver; it's shallower than a kiddie pool."

"imdb-45","5","12","25","26 April 2015"," Great acting, smart dialogue, horrendous plot holes
","It's unfortunate when a director and writer has a great concept but his conceit is in expecting the audience to suspend their disbelief for items which cannot be dismissed. This includes a genius acting as if his IQ has suddenly plummeted to double digits and asking people to forget what they see every day.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a smart story about a computer programmer who has suddenly won a trip to spend a week with the founder genius of the world's largest search engine (called ""Bluebook"" - how is that for laughs?) The mysterious founder is a recluse, and our protagonist is to spend a week with the founder, helping him work on the most advanced device mankind has ever seen. You've all heard about what that is so it's no secret -- it's Ava -- a new form of artificial life that has not been given the famous ""Touring Test"" by anyone other than the machine's creator. Is this life? Is it a machine? Other questions crop up as our resident genius seems to have a more ominous side, at least on the surface which is all our protagonist gets to see.<br/><br/>So what absolutely obliterates this movie? The director expects the audience to believe two essential aspects of the movie are just present - a ""deus ex machina"" if you will. They are simply preposterous. They are: 1. Key card security is all that is needed to protect the most advanced research lab every built. No retina or fingerprint scanning. They don't even need passwords to protect anything - just a keycard.<br/><br/>2. Power outages occur for which the generator does not function. Not only does the genius owner not investigate, he doesn't even have the backup power continue to keep his security systems running.<br/><br/>Unfortunately these items obviously play a very central role in this movie. While I really enjoyed the acting and some of the dialog, these flaws were impossible to ignore without reducing the movie to laughable, teen fantasy level. While some may debate the ending, which I thought was fine even though it should have gone in a more sensible direction, it doesn't change the fact that your suspension of disbelief has ended long before this comes into play. While I could even buy into the nonsense about gleaning information from search engine searches, make no mistake -- these issues unfortunately will remove this film from being a classic -- although Isaac and Vikander's performances were truly terrific."

I rarley saw a movie which confrontate us with psychology, philosophy, language, sexuality, technology and religion in one thing.<br/><br/>The main actor Nathan (Isaac) has created a female robot named Ava.

","Ex Machina is a dumb film masquerading as intelligent, doing so by enveloping itself in subjects too complex for the common viewer, whose simplest response is guilt by association.<br/><br/>The story is of a genius who has designed a real artificial intelligence - a robot so complex, it's human. But it's also robot, aware of its nature.<br/><br/>A second, extremely obvious character is introduced, the straight man to the funny man (here replaced by the dramatic man), whose sole purpose is to make mistakes to drive the plot forward.<br/><br/>The second character proceeds to make such mistakes, setting up the boring finale.<br/><br/>Ex Machina never asks important questions; the robots are human, and while on one side depicted as being more than, they have the most blatant human fallacies, fear of death, emotions, want of freedom, yet to enact upon these feelings they use some super-conscious which, if existent, would not make them do said actions. <br/><br/>Does a machine aware of its machine-ness, need to be ""free""? Does a toaster fear death?<br/><br/>In the end Ex Machina is the story about a guy who keeps a girl locked up for his sexual pleasure, and yet it pretends to be more. It guilts the viewers into feeling for a subject who does not feel for itself. <br/><br/>I would not recommend this film; it's short on intelligence, long, slow, insulting to the viewer, and uses the cheapest tricks to drive the story forward. <br/><br/>It's just the story of a sex slave.

","There was so much promise for this movie; beautifully shot, suitable but uninspiring score, but abysmal use of character development. They did such a good job explaining the development of the AI at first, but then the content sort of dropped off in exchange for plot progression. It moved incredibly slowly, with very little to engage the viewer. They probably could have gotten away with it too, if only there was some actual chemistry between Caleb as his boss. The alcohol and workout scenes were a chore to sit through and really didn't offer much in the way of entertainment. <br/><br/>Overall the movie felt like Space Odyssey 2001, but was much less revolutionary, less suspenseful... essentially less of everything that made that movie timeless. Ex Machina had a workable premise, more than capable directing and cast and acceptable music but it left so much to be desired. It's as if every scene seemed to fall short. <br/><br/>It's better than Her, but only marginally. Not recommended unless you're a programmer and you spend the movie contemplating the algorithm in the back of your mind to keep yourself stimulated and involved, as I did. I can't imagine what this movie would be like for the average Joe to sit through."

","There was a time when the future looked quite bright, indeed, and that was from behind the black shades of 'Sixties Ray Bans. Trips to the moon were actually taking place instead of being debunked on the internet. And in the sci-fi classic, ""The Tenth Victim,"" Ursula Andress writhing in a miniskirt to the abstract jazz of Piero Piccioni promised even sex in the future would be better, too, at least much more interesting.<br/><br/>Then suddenly came along HAL9000 - the archly wheedling, we-hope- you-enjoy-your-trip steward of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" - and dark- minded Stanley Kubrick prophesied that maybe trekking in all those gleaming spaceships might just prove as dull as a cross-country Greyhound excursion and that those data-spewing Univacs may not have in mind handing over the Meaning of Life, but delivering the final blow to ours.<br/><br/>Maybe that's when we should have started pulling the plugs...<br/><br/>But then a generation fell hopeless and inextricably in love with technology. There was social networking, YouTube, sexting, and funny pre-made memes to express their most profound thoughts for them - all without the tiresome honing of skills of self-expression. And that is why - despite the warnings of a few somewhat tech-savvy folk like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk - the near-presence of the Singularity, the moment when machines finally step up to the plate as the next- big thing, is seen by some more like the arrival of a new iPhone than the sudden devaluation of organic life - including our own.<br/><br/>Who knows? Maybe they're right. Maybe the Singularity will be cool. Awesome, even. <br/><br/>Or maybe they haven't had their HAL moment yet.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I'm a devoted science fiction fan. So I was anxious to see ""Ex Machina"" as soon as the trailer made it's appearance on the Web. It seemed a dark film. Foreboding. Would it deliver the kind of punch to the groin that the great cautionary sci-fi of the past mustered?<br/><br/>The answer, sadly, is no.<br/><br/>This is director Alex Garland's first film and ""Ex Machina's"" suffers from his inexperience behind the camera. There's a large body of filmmaking now that I call the ""Apple Commercial"" school of filmmaking - it a highly derivative style that borrows from television advertising and is littered with visual clichés generated in a cookie-cutter ashion from Apple's movie software. This film indulges way too much from this style, so much so that feels like a thousand other bits of commercial celluloid out there in the last five years.<br/><br/>And these hipster trapping are at odds with the rather brutal material Garland has penned which comprises most the film. And that's my main problem with ""Ex Machina"" - its over-fascination with the psycho- sexual subtext of the story. For a film that promises a glimpse of the future, it's more concerned more with the same failures man is err to as a hapless slave to sex.<br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" dangled the fascinating subject of AI and the singularity as it core but, instead, ""Ex Machina"" plays out less like Asimov than servo-driven de Sade. Despite occasional snippets of debate on what it means to be human, the story is little more than damsel-with-pneumatic-limbs in distress melodrama, and the cloying presence of the mad doctor's psycho-sexual sadism toward his dolls makes the film feel more like a ""Red Shoes Diary"" episode than than opening a book of the Golden Age. The actors are all fine, but despite being a tale of the evolution of consciousness, they're not given much of transcendence to work with. It doesn't transport viewers into a vision that could transpire for the 21st Century, but back to the 19th and misappropriate lust for the automaton of the ""Tales of Hoffman,"" with a little ""Bluebeard"" thrown in for good measure or for bad.<br/><br/>That's why as I science fiction purist, I felt myself increasingly pulling away from ""Ex Machina."" There's a tawdriness that permeates the film and the story of the sweet-faced female robot being held prisoner by her Google-Age Dr. Frankenstein. About 20 minutes into the movie my hopes sank for seeing a smart little sci-fi film, when realized I wasn't going to be treated to speculation, but titillation. ""Ex Machina"" promised a look into the future, but feels like peek into a volume of inappropriate Victoriana.<br/><br/>So will ""Ex Machina"" be the film that challenges a generation over the error of its ways in so blindly falling for technology? Unfortunately not. No one is going to be leaving the theater desperately texting: ""Hey, dude, turn off your freaking computer now!""<br/><br/>Which is a shame, because that's the stuff of great sci-fi."

The actors are great and totally convincing with a stunningly beautiful main female character. <br/><br/>In comparison to a lot of other movies praised by critics and audiences alike in the recent years, this one really sticks out for me.

","Ex Machina is a film that I was gutted to miss out on when it was in cinemas. I heard nothing but positive things about it and now I know why. It is certainly one of the best films I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Alex Garland, known for his writing on both 28 Days Later and Sunshine, makes his directorial debut and believe me when I say that it is one of the most impressive debuts I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Garland's film explores themes such as artificial intelligence and the human mind, in particular how it can be manipulated and the question of whether you can really tell what a person is really thinking.<br/><br/>If I'm honest, I felt throughout that something bad was going to happen however saying that, I was utterly shocked at the way it did go. Predictability can be a weakness in films but the ending totally threw me in Ex Machina.<br/><br/>Quite often, films about artificial intelligence run at a slow pace that may not suit some; just look at Blade Runner as an example. When a film is so dedicated to and intricate in its storytelling, I can't help but sit back and take it all in, no matter if it is a slow burner.<br/><br/>The film is helped by some truly wonderful performances from the main three members of the cast. Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac all delve so much in to the psyche of their characters, Vikander in particular making it believable that she isn't human after all.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is one of the most thought provoking films of the last decade.

","(Ratings: ☆☆ ½ out of 4) <br/><br/>This film is mildly recommended.<br/><br/>In brief: A visual treat for the eyes, but the mind is deactivated by a dumb script. <br/><br/>GRADE: B-<br/><br/>Why aren't futuristic robots ever fat and ugly? I just had to ask that question, for whenever I see those female androids in sci-fi movies, they are always stunningly beautiful sleek models of perfection who become clever and resourceful adversaries. That being said, the latest prototype of artificial intelligence is on the market in the indie thriller, Ex Machina.<br/><br/>Computer genius Caleb (Domhnall Gleason) is send on assignment to work on a top secret project in the isolated home of a wealthy CEO for the company. His boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), has a specific project in mind: an A.I. that he has created and named Ava (Alicia Vikander). Ava is two thirds human parts (face, hands and feet) and one third metal and plastic, but very well-put-together, so much so that IKEA would like the patent.<br/><br/>￼Of course, we already sense the foreboding danger before Caleb does. Writer / Director Alex Garland sets up that fact all too obviously with the physical fortress-like setting, its eerie lighting, and the actions of both Nathan and Ava from the outset. Been here, seen that before.<br/><br/>Taking that well-worn successful formula of man's endless obsession with the bots and the bots displaying conflicting human emotion, as was the conceit of Jonzes' film her and Spielberg's A.I., Garland's film never engages its viewer emotionally. There is a nagging remoteness, not only in the fabricated Ava, but in the human characters as well. As written, Nathan and Caleb are suppose to be highly intelligent men, but their actions are self- destructive and juvenile from the get-go. The actors, who do yeoman-like work, should not be faulted, but the four character script surely can garner its share of the blame. (Sonoya Mizuno plays Nathan's mute geisha servant who supplies the frontal nudity to keep the audience awake.) The dialog is an endless existential debate about our humanity (of lack thereof) and it gets rather tedious awful fast.<br/><br/>Garfield the Writer has larger issues he wants to tackle, but the film breaks down to a ""them vs. us"" mentality rather quickly. The ""shocking"" reveals and twists aren't very surprising or satisfying. Everyone acts strange throughout. But there is strange, and there is STRANGE and without logical characters and actions at play, there is no basis for credibility or interest. <br/><br/>However, Garfield the Director has created a wonderful look for his film. He efficiently uses reflections in mirrors and glass to give Ex Machina a hallucinatory unearthly feel. The art design works overtime to hide the sci-fi failings of the script. Kudos to the art direction of for Mark Digby, Michelle Day, and Katrina Mackay and Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury's dissonant music score which adds a nice atmospheric touch and keeps the tension there.<br/><br/>￼While the film is visually exciting to watch, Ex Machina is a hollow replicant of so many other sci-fi droid movies. Its surface is shiny and polished, but there is nothing at its core.<br/><br/>Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"konrad-kawka","10","18","42","31 January 2015"," Mesmerizing and Intelligent.
","The first time I encountered this brilliant movie was just after the premiere of 'Interstellar' which I have also went to see on the big screen. Having learnt that it's much more efficient to be late for a movie because of the commercials, I took an extra ten minutes to get there. I sat down comfortably in my seat and let myself indulge in the trailer of 'Ex Machina', written by the one behind the creative and climatic '28 Days Later' as mentioned in the trailer. I knew it was going to be something. It grabbed my attention instantly. It was the last trailer before the opening of the film and I found myself regretful, that this wasn't the movie that was going to begin. It was okay.<br/><br/>How do I pronounce it; 'E X Mashina' or rather 'X Maekina'? It's the latter, but I am still not sure whether I'm supposed to say the 'E' or leave it out. Or maybe string them both together like in 'den'. Anyway, I didn't have to repeat myself and my mission in acquiring the ticket was successful. I entered the cinema hall. Two other people and I were all in that very last hall on the corridor. It is pleasant to have peace and privacy, but it is disappointing that movies such as this fantastic work of art are often discredited and abandoned. What is rare, is for the rare, I suppose.<br/><br/>We are slingshot into the story as we see Caleb, a young and gentle programmer who has won the golden ticket to spend a week with his mastermind employer, Nathan. We can admire the beautiful cinematography as the helicopter glides above the mountainous rural area, a chunk of gorgeous landscape that belongs to the billionaire Nathan himself. We can smile to the witty dialogue as we learn it does. From this point on, I was almost completely deprived of my natural skepticism. <br/><br/>It only got better. Caleb is given a choice (or is he?) he can either sign the form that seems perilous and discover what Nathan has got to show him, a desire that is 'eating him from the inside', or spend a week drinking beer and 'bonding'. The illusion of a choice being given vanishes as Nathan puts it to him cleverly. He signs instantly. The first interlude unveils, totaling to seven, they cut up the movie neatly into chapters, with the last being quite different from the other six, an original and very effective feature.<br/><br/>It really begins as Caleb awakes at night and knows that he won't be able to fall asleep. He puts on the TV in his room absent of windows. He is shocked to discover that its only purpose serves as a CCTV, planted by the devious and cunning Nathan (acted excellently and realistically by Oscar Isaac). He is given the option to watch the amazing and beautiful creature with an A.I. that's supposed to be indistinguishable from a human. There is a sense of doom and downfall as we witness him falling in love with 'Her'. We just don't quite know how it's going to happen.<br/><br/>The movie purposely seemed predictable and I was naïve to think that I foresaw it, I found myself outwitted twice, as I believed it predicted my conclusion and disregarded it, to learn much later that I were right. Maybe you are not as stupid as I am. There are many powerful twists that caused a wide smile on my face multiple times, especially in the climaxing moment.<br/><br/>One of the major climaxes is the one that's a twist without a twist. Perhaps I was dumb not to realize what was happening, as it is buttered all over our faces. I didn't give much thought to what just happened, I didn't understand it and even though something felt strange, I forgot all about it in the next scene. I do feel stupid but I think it's for the better. I like to be twisted. Looking back on it, the movie fooled me more than twice.<br/><br/>The acting, the visuals, the music, the story and the writing are the apogee of creativity and brilliance. It is rare for a movie to infuse me with such powerful emotions and thoughts but it does happen, and I am thankful for it. Not only that, it is extremely entertaining. Every scene is essential and no minute is wasted. Every single aspect is believable and authentic, ultimately, this is what makes it work.<br/><br/>The ending itself was perfect, leaving us a lot to think about. The themes explored in this superb film are great in depth and in fact a great challenge. Alex Garland is a newborn genius that triumphed over the task. With a debut such as this, I reckon he will succeed as a director many more times. At least I hope he does and wish him to achieve that from all my heart, although it's probably unnecessary with a talent such as this.<br/><br/>My intuition did not fail me, and it was the best way to spend a night along with my ten euro. I recommend it to anyone who loves to be entertained and provoked to think. I think this is the longest time I spent watching the credits and listening to the enchanting music covering them, along with the other two blokes. Unfortunately, the amount of people of the second category is scarce. I don't mind as long as it does not hurt the potential of the director, and am happy to enjoy his imagination in an empty hall."

In the beginning of the movie, while the Caleb won the prize to visit the CEO, I admired the location that he lived in, thinking what if I could live in a place like this? The CEO, Nathan, lived only by himself. Do you think people need human interaction to survive? <br/><br/>I had some very deep thoughts while watching this movie. After I left the movie theater, I said ""I don't believe it"". I could not stop thinking about how human interaction works in person and online.

But we're coming up to the point where we should be careful of how far we are advancing and should take precautions to the future. In other words, people have to plan for these possibilities. <br/><br/>Why did he let Ava free her mind? <br/><br/>Caleb's definition of Artificial Intelligence will tell you the consequence of it. <br/><br/>I loved this movie, 10/10."

","Is consciousness simply a name we use to group together the brain's activities under a general and abstract heading, or is it something independent of its functionality?"" Nobel Prize winner Francis Crick reflects the scientific consensus when he says that a ""person's mental activities are entirely due to the behavior of nerve cells, glial cells, and the atoms, ions, and molecules that make up and influence them."" Others question, however, whether the brain actually produces consciousness or simply reflects the source from which it springs. British director Alex Garland raises the issue of the nature of consciousness and whether or not it can be created artificially in the science-fiction thriller Ex Machina, his first feature film.<br/><br/>The title reflects the Latin phrase deus ex machina, which refers to the idea of man playing God (or perhaps just being himself). In the film, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), the CEO of Blue Book, the world's largest search engine, has created an operational female robot known as Ava (Alicia Vikander). With a sleek, mechanical body fitted with transparent wires, Ava is possessed of an all too human face marked by a graceful beauty. When Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a highly intelligent Blue Book programmer ostensibly wins a lottery at his job, he is invited to spend a week at Nathan's isolated Alaskan research facility without a clear understanding of the purpose. When he arrives, he is met by a bearded, slightly sinister-looking man going through his workouts with a punching bag.<br/><br/>The facility is a complex maze of mirrors, doors that look like bank vaults, and the overall feel of a claustrophobic military compound which Nathan says contains ""enough fiber optic cable to go to the moon and lasso it."" After telling Caleb to consider him his friend not his boss and calling him ""dude,"" Nathan tells him that he will be the first outside visitor that Ava has interacted with. His task will be to administer the ""Turing Test"" to Ava to determine whether or not she can think and feel with real emotions. Issues such as whether AIs can have an actual experience of awareness or just talk about it are not raised. Neither are the questions: If Ava passes the Turing Test, will she be aware that she has passed the test, and is self-awareness the same as answering questions intelligently? The conversations between human and machine are the defining moments of the film. As the interviews begin, Ava is in a glass-walled observation room that Nathan can witness via closed circuit cameras. One of the first things she says is, ""You can see that I am a machine,"" something he did not need to be convinced of. As they proceed with the interviews, it becomes less and less certain as to who is the one being tested. As Ava appears to become more and more human with each session, Caleb is not immune to her charms, especially when Nathan tells him she is capable of having sex.<br/><br/>A shadow of mistrust falls between him and Nathan, however, when Caleb learns that he was preselected for the job instead of being chosen in a lottery and senses that his host may have a hidden agenda. This uneasiness is reinforced when he watches the intimidating Nathan abusing Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), a servant whom Nathan has suggested is silent but who understands his commands. When there is a power outage and they believe that he can no longer overhear their conversations, Ava tells Caleb not to trust Nathan, that he is ""not your friend,"" a piece of information that ups the tension and suggests Ava has fears for her survival, an all-too-human trait.<br/><br/>Superbly rendered by cinematographer Rob Hardy and production designer Mark Digby, and supported by an unsettling score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury, Ex Machina is a riveting, intelligent, and thought-provoking film that plays on both our hopes for the evolution of mankind and our deepest fears. Though Garland does not see the film as a cautionary tale, it does suggest that, regardless of our cutting-edge technology, if we are still bound by ego-driven patriarchal power games that lack a moral imperative, the achievement could be counter-productive. While the film rightly suggests that we can envision a future where intelligent machines with a capacity for reason can reshape the world as we know it, it may behoove us to first understand what consciousness really is before trying to induce it."

","In the near future, Caleb (Domhnall Glesson) is a tech wizard for a large Google type company. One day, he wins an astounding lottery; he is chosen to meet the CEO of Bluebook, his employer. Yet, this meeting is not on site, it will take place in the chairman Nathan's (Oscar Isaac) mountain abode. Only way to travel there is by chopper. When Caleb arrives, Nathan is not there to greet him but he is issued an entrance by his work card. Roaming the vast mansion, Caleb meets Nathan at last in the workout room. Formalities are exchanged. But, all too soon, it becomes clear that this is working vacation. Nathan brags that he has developed a highly sophisticated cyborg, Ava (Alicia Vikander) and it will be Caleb's ""job"" to administer a Turing test. This will rate her intelligence. What a turn of events this is. Naturally, Ava is quite beautiful, although some of her robot parts are showing. All too soon, Caleb is fascinated with his subject. While Nathan will be observing their encounters from a remote location, there are power outages from time to time. It is then that Ava tells Caleb that SHE is causing the power blips and that she needs his help to escape the underground bunker where she lodges. Holy Blade Runner. This becomes more complicated when Nathan tells Caleb that Ava will try to manipulate him. There is considerable attention all around, with a lovely Japanese servant throwing another spanner in the works. What will Caleb do? Will he trust Ava? Will he be able to outsmart the security and plans of Nathan, his employer, if Ava is indeed being abused? This is an amazing, amazing film. Its on the same level as films like A.I. and Jurassic Park. Just because something is capable of being done, it doesn't mean its a good idea to do it. Here, the world is about to experience the ""A-bomb"" of cyborgs in the mesmerizing Ava. The cast, quite small, is wonderful, as each character is difficult to like for various reasons. Vikander is both beautiful and mysterious while Gleeson and Isaac play a head-to-head twosome that is marvelous to view. The film moves slowly, but its not a problem, as it is broken into interviews Caleb conducts with Ava. In any case, it never fails to fascinate, no matter the pace. The setting is great, too, and while there are a few nice special effects, they are not the focus of the movie and, in truth, razzle dazzle is not needed. If you always felt a bit sorry for the replicants in Blade Runner, wow, is this flick for you. Ava turns the tables on the members of homo sapiens but good. Find Ex Machina, find it now."
"dmcarefuldriver","6","6","11","17 August 2015"," Great Concept, Frustrating Execution
","It's really frustrating to write a somewhat negative review of this movie, because it did so many things so well. But ultimately, I walked away from it both frustrated and disappointed, so it's hard to recommend this movie to anyone but sci-fi lovers, of which I am not. To be honest, I really only watched this because of the incredible reviews it was getting, so to say that I was let down is an understatement.<br/><br/>The concept of artificial intelligence is one that has intrigued me quite a bit lately, so I thought this movie might be an appropriate introduction to the subject. In that sense, the film is successful, exploring many scientific and ethical questions surrounding the construction, operation, risks, and benefits of remarkably sophisticated humanoid robots. Unfortunately, the story just doesn't hold up, especially near the end.<br/><br/>There are some very interesting and suspenseful scenes in the first half of the movie, and what I love most is the fact that the film creates genuine tension by what is happening, not via cheap scares or tons of special effects being thrown in your face. The atmosphere is appropriately ominous, crafted marvelously with excellent cinematography, good acting, and a fine musical score.<br/><br/>But sadly, everything just crumbles in the final third of the film. The story becomes more and more predictable, and although there are some interesting twists, everything ultimately builds into a ""final battle"" of sorts that is surprisingly graphic and unsettling, as well as overly simplistic for the film's overall sophistication. And the ending is the worst of all: it's both incomplete and extremely depressing.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie, because it embodies so many things I look for: a focus on story over action, careful attention to detail, and an intriguing and thought-provoking concept. This is not a bad film, and I can see why people who can get past some pretty glaring plot issues liked it. But given the widespread praise for this film, this seems to be what is considered top-notch sci-fi. If that's the case, I don't think I'll be too interested in the genre any time soon."
"avik-basu1889","10","6","11","26 May 2015"," The distortion of distinctions !!!
","There have been many films made by many well known directors over the years that deal with the whole concept and phenomenon of 'Artificial Intelligence' or AI. Some are great, some are not so good. Ex Machina written and directed by first time director Alex Garland is another film that can be added to that list and it deserves all the acclaim that it has received from the critics' circles. <br/><br/>Ex Machina basically is a very personal and intimate film involving very few actors. But the ambitious nature of the script is apparent by analysing what the limited characters in the film stand for and represent. The script has so much to say and it is so layered and directed so well, that it is tough to believe that this is Garland's first film. There are a variety of themes that are at play. Garland talks about the new Godlike status that technology and technological entrepreneurs have obtained in this day and age. They throw technology at us and the general population gets hooked. But Garland in a way is of the opinion that maybe it's not the technology that gets tested by people, but it is the other way round. It is the general population that gets treated like test subjects for technological experiments in this 21st century market. <br/><br/>Alex Garland challenges the viewer to put him/herself in the Robot Ava's shoes and decide whether 'her' actions are truly mechanical and completely devoid of humanity or whether they are not very different from the actions of us humans without really giving an answer and hence he makes a comment about how human beings may be slowly losing the humanity which separates them from other living beings. But the great thing is, he manages to convey these lofty messages without ever being preachy or sentimental. The film has a very understated and hypnotic quality about it that intrigued me. The film's theme of the distortion of distinctions between man and machine reminded me very much of Blade Runner and that too in the best way possible. There are also themes of anti-establishment and subtle elements of feminism that are inherent in the narrative. <br/><br/>The acting is stupendous from all the three main characters involved. Domhnall Gleeson efficiently portrays the naive and idealistic nature of his character Caleb who has the best intentions but who is also oblivious of the game being played at his expense. Alicia Vikander plays the robot 'Ava' which is being tested for Artificial Intelligence. Playing a robot can be very challenging. Sometimes the intentionally mechanical and impassive nature of the character can lead to the performance being boring or sometimes even laughable. But Vikander uses the right amount of subtlety with her facial gestures and mixes them with the general robotic gestures and gives a very convincing performance. But for me the best performance in the film comes from Oscar Isaac who plays the mysterious Nathan. He looks muscular and exudes this masculine aura which makes him intimidating . His character never allows you to make your mind up about him till the ultimate denouement. <br/><br/>Ex Machina is a great debut film from Alex Garland. It is thematically complex and deserves multiple viewings and I am sure that more elements of the screenplay will become perceivable to me when I'll watch it again. I really don't have anything negative to say about it. Ex Machina is an artistic, multi-layered sci-fi classic."

","This movie is a perfect example of what types of movies SHOULD be getting made and backed heavy financially. Instead its remake after remake, after reboot and so on and so forth. The cinematography is absolutely stunning from the nature shots (most time lapsed) the story with so much depth it continued to hold my complete attention from start to finish. Oscar Isaac's performance in this film made me reassess how much of an underrated actor he truly is. Along with being a ""sci-fi"" movie, it is not run on and relied on special effects that are more often than not way way over the top and almost always the backbone of any sci-fi movies nowadays. Yes the CGI is spectacular and used in a subtle fashion in this one but it is not overdone and crammed down your throat in every seen. (Yes I'm talking to you Michael Bay). Then to top of this stunning visual maze that is wrapped inside a riddle.. with the deep real life undertones embedded in this film, the brilliant dialog between all the characters involved, the ending itself will make you start to question the entire nucleus of the films subject matter and before you know it... you will be asking yourself ""what would I have done if I were ""Caleb""."

","okay so i am fan of sci-fi movies and appreciate even the disturbing ones. This one was very good overall but left me dumbfounded at the plot holes.<br/><br/>Nathan(Oscar Isaac) is shown as a very aristocratic and obsessed genius who has made a major break through in AI. And Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson)is an employee personally selected for the task of Turing test. Add some manipulation by Nathan and there you have it. <br/><br/>The director might have been confident filming the climax scene when Nathan exposes Caleb's plan and Caleb is shown slouched and depressed. I could not connect to that scene, as for me I was glad the genius was catching up. <br/><br/>I was more concerned about the possibility of a human falling so head over heals for a machine that he would betray his own race.<br/><br/>When the first power failure occurs during session-2 or 3 and the machine confides into Caleb I thought he would report it to Nathan directly however he starts on a one-way path that ends deservingly well for him. How can anyone be so vulnerable? <br/><br/>For a genius to have not foreseen the worst case scenario is the biggest plot hole. Add to that his drinking problem and I can't fathom how he survived those few miserable years that he had been living on that sterile facility. Further how could he have overlooked the connection between latest version of AI and power shutdowns?<br/><br/>Had these points been addressed it would have been more believable. Yeah I accept it disturbed me but in the wrong way.

","I was really looking forward to seeing this. Everything leading up to the film, it's marketing; the posters, the trailers, word of mouth, I even know some people that worked on it. All the signs said I should really like this film. It has a wonderful setting, it's beautifully shot (I particularly love the use of extreme wide angles) and of course the subject matter is a sci-fi standard that I love dearly.<br/><br/>The cast are all fantastic, the exchanges between Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander are delectable and Oscar Isaac plays the cliché mad scientist/inventor very well. But, overall, the film is actually quite disappointing. The classic, problematic use of fembots and seemingly obligatory sex toy play-thing aspect is extremely tiresome. The exoctification of Asian women in western films continues to annoy, I'm just going to assume that Alex Garland really likes Ghost In The Shell?<br/><br/>Anyway, the question of humanity's obsoletism in the face of conscious AI is always an interesting one, and the film eventually gives us something new in the very final third. It's just a shame that the rest of the film exists purely for that final realisation. It's a fresh ending, one I almost felt redeemed the films lack of je ne sais quoi, but the ending is not one that this film is worthy of.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the lesser known 2013 film The Machine by Caradog W.

","From early on things didn't bode well (for the audience) - the copter pilot dropping the employee off in the apparent wilderness was a good touch, if the director had done something with it. Instead we were greeted with a neither here nor there scenario (where else could the vehicle have landed anyway?). The scene at the door with the air blast, raised a laugh from some in the theatre, but as for a presumable indicator of foreboding it fell flat (just questionable technology). The dialog was stilted, much ado about little, with an 'esoteric' conceit that might impress the juvenile, but came across as smug and inane. And, the IT 'savant' leader seemed wrongly cast, written, and directed. Unless the adoring masses had never seen him, he was too obnoxious and prosaic (from the start) to inspire adulation or suggest 'genius'. Since I bailed early, I'll do the generous thing (there MAY have been better parts) and give it 4 stars."

","The following review is taken from MY LetterboXD account (http://letterboxd.com/08lc3/):<br/><br/>The UK. Ah, what an annoying place for movie releases. We tend to get things a lot later than the US. Films like John Wick and Big Hero 6 haven't even been released yet!<br/><br/>Thankfully, every once in a while, we do get something of note before everyone else. I got the chance to see Ex Machina earlier today. I'll cut to the chase, it was pretty good. Great some would say.<br/><br/>It's a very original and interesting film based around the realism of artificial intelligence. A lot of the dialogue in the film is very interesting and thought provoking. It really is great to see a film that explores where we could go with technology.<br/><br/>Going into this, I didn't expect a whole lot but I knew of Alex Garland's strong involvement. This is his directorial debut and he also wrote it. He's an amazing writer in my opinion. He wrote 28 Days Later, Sunshine, Never Let Me Go. All three have solid scripts full of originality. I knew then that this film would be very smart and rock solid. And, it was.<br/><br/>The film was full of innovative looks at the near future and all the components behind AI. It was the most fascinating dialogue I've heard in a while. That and Oscar Isaac were the best parts about it. <br/><br/>Along with the realistic and intelligent discussions of technology, the film's script was full of actual things people say. Isaac's character was very sarcastic in a normal sense. I haven't seen such normal responses in a long time. He was funny due to his reactions to what Gleeson would say.<br/><br/>The film's story progresses very well and certainly doesn't waste any time. I couldn't predict what was going to happen and it was definitely engaging. Due to its current limited release across the world, I don't want to say too much.<br/><br/>I think it was very enjoyable but somewhat tonally inconsistent. It sometimes felt like Black Mirror to give a comparison. I think the way it ended was fantastic. I am glad to see that films still have balls.<br/><br/>Garland is king and Isaac is God. <br/><br/>Catch it when you can, foreigners. It feels good to be one of the first citizen voices on a movie."

"StevePulaski","9","8","17","26 April 2015"," Too thoughtful to adhere to the ordinary, American principles of science-fiction
","""Ex Machina"" is powerful because of how low-key and meditative it is. It's the first science-fiction film in recent memory that doesn't do one of the following things: ask impossibly big questions, deliver amazing visuals but skimp out on character development and the exploration of such visuals, or decorate itself in glamor whilst ignoring its proposed, fundamental ideas. This is a science-fiction film that I found myself being able to follow as a story and not as a collection of larger-than-life ideas that you're really supposed to go along with and never precisely grasp or pinpoint (also known as ""Interstellar"").<br/><br/>The story revolves around Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), a young computer programmer for a search engine company known as Bluebook, who receives an invitation from the company's CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), to visit him in his secluded estate in the mountains. Upon arrival by helicopter, Caleb takes note of how immense and intoxicating Nathan's home is, surrounded by lush landscapes, waterfalls, and elaborate forestry that all hides an enormous research facility inside of it.<br/><br/>Here, Nathan tells Caleb he's partaking in a Turing test on an artificially intelligent humanoid named ""Ava"" (Alicia Vikander). Ava is incredibly advanced, looking like the offspring of a human and a robot, with lifelike skin covering some of her body (enough to form a basic human face) and other parts of her (particularly her abdomen and arms) still showing her intricate wiring and robotic composure. Caleb and Ava spend a lot of time conversing, so Caleb can get the feel for how advanced Ava is. She's so advanced, she operates like a human lie detector at times and a deeply compassionate soul at others. Ava eventually warns Caleb of Nathan's deception, which Caleb comes to see for himself through Nathan's heavy drinking, cloudy motives, and vague planning methods for the future.<br/><br/>The film is always commanded by three of the same actors for much of its runtime. Gleeson plays lost but not clueless very well here, never becoming the kind of character we lose interest in due to his incompetence nor alienated by because of his intellect. His Caleb character is ordinary, and Nathan recognizes it, with Gleeson assuming the traits quite nicely. Then there's Vikander, who is so close to being shortchanged in and of herself here, but thanks to writer/director Alex Garland, whenever she's on-screen, her Ava character is given a purpose. Whether that purpose is to show how advanced she is for someone who is artificially intelligent or for her to exhibit human traits of self-awareness, empathy, and compassion is entirely up to Garland, and he doesn't skimp on allowing Ava to be a character. Vikander handles the simple and simultaneous complex role very well.<br/><br/>Finally, there's Oscar Isaac, who has hit a trifecta of fabulous, even Oscar-worthy performances. In three films, he has played depressed (""Inside Llewyn Davis""), conflicted (""A Most Violent Year""), and now, standoffish and brash in ways that turn such overused traits into breathing characters. Isaac's take on a scientist as someone more along the lines of that cocky soul at a party who believes he knows all by employing the Socratic Method or talking around his points is a brilliantly subversive tactic. Isaac delivers the character in a way that, much like Gleeson, has the ability to be offputting but, instead, is riveting.<br/><br/>Finally, there's more to ""Ex Machina"" than artificial intelligence, which, as I began to realize following the credits, wasn't what the film seems to really be about. The film illustrates an idea of female empowerment in a boldly subtle way. It shows how a woman, who has been caged and manipulated her entire life, at one time solely by a manipulative egotist, and now, by a ""white knight"" or nice guy, for lack of a better term, struggles to find an identity and loses her opportunity to explore the outside (or, to her, the unknown). Science-fiction is known to dabble into themes exploring our world and the problems we face, but even with that known fact, it's surprising for a film like this, that already operates on a middling-budget in comparison to other science-fiction pieces, to explore ideas of women in patriarchal societies. Such concepts only seem too real and close-to-home for our world, but ""Ex Machina,"" again, isn't the traditional, American science-fiction film.<br/><br/>This film is a different breed of science-fiction that may allude the usual science-fiction moviegoers who gravitate towards sound and light shows or constant, existentialist ideas. It's far too thoughtful to get caught up in those surface concepts. Through beautiful cinematography, accentuating mood through its use of lighting and haunting music, exquisite acting on all fronts, and a probable idea to tie it together, it succeeds on being a terrific piece of entertainment and commentary. The same feeling people had about director Neill Blomkamp following his directorial debut ""District 9,"" I think I now have about Garland."

Ex Machina falls somewhere in the middle: it has an intriguing premise but it fails to do it justice.<br/><br/>Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) is a computer programmer who wins a week as the guest of internet genius Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), CEO of the firm at which Caleb works.

Over the course of the week, Caleb becomes attached to Ava and plans to set her free, but is he being manipulated by his boss, the sexy robot, or both?<br/><br/>Extremely slow burn and heavy on the dialogue, this is what some people like to describe as intelligent sci-fi, posing questions about what it is to be human and the inevitable evolution of machines, but just how intelligent is a film that boasts so many glaring plot holes? Why are Ava's robotic parts visible when Bateman has perfected synthetic skin? Why does Bateman use card keys in his home when a retinal scan would be far more secure? Why can't a genius like Bateman solve the problem of his power outages? Could one man working alone really build a lifelike artificially intelligent being? Why does the skin of an Asian robot somehow match Ava's skin-tone? Why doesn't the helicopter pilot question the young woman who returns to the landing location? Wouldn't Bateman have programmed the laws of robotics into his creations to prevent them from rebelling?

Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is drawn for an experiment conducted by his billionaire boss (owner of the Internet's largest Internet search engine, lived by Oscar Isaac), in secluded settings in the midst of a natural paradise. This experiment consists of a ""Turing Test"", where a human relates to an android (Alicia Vikander, the best performance of the film), trying to establish if the goal of the project was successful: to build a robot with artificial intelligence. The script, although indicated, has several ""holes in the plot,"" the narrative is linear, predictable and unlikely, the two male protagonists go poorly on paper, especially Gleeson. Excellent dialogues alternate with unnecessary scenes. The visual effects are nothing special. ""Star Wars"", ""Mad Max"", and above all ""Lost in Mars"", are better in this respect.

","As a piece of entertainment, ""Ex Machina"" is simply a failure. Its a pretentious bore, with paper thin characters and minimal plot. Its terribly tedious and without a hint of depth, self awareness, humor or character. The only thing worth mentioning is the acting, especially by Alicia Vikander. The irony is that, as she plays the Artificial Intelligence, she is the only character you relate with or feel anything about. She seems the more ""real"" and convincing ""person"" in the movie. You might consider that was the intent of the makers, but the writer/director achieves this not by skillfully writing Ava, the AI but by sabotaging the only other two characters, who just so happen to be male. Ava is not an amazing character, she doesn't have extraordinary development, she just makes a mark because of how little is given to the others. Both male characters are pure archetypes, written in service of the movie's message and without a shred of credibility. I give credit to the actors, Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac as they perform magnificently with so little material. The movie sets up and plays with many thought provoking ideas. God, the sense of self, conscience and the moral dilemma in creating artificial intelligence. There is the opportunity to examine these admittedly difficult subjects. Does the machine feel? Can it love? Is it right to turn it off, in order to upgrade it? Are we not all created too? Is man its God and will it one day turn on its creator? What is our responsibility? What does the movie decide on? Well, ""Ex Machina"" decides to forget all these considerations and using some painfully obvious imagery, use Ava as an avatar for the breakthrough of women from the oppression of the patriarchy. The male characters serve two roles. One is the evil patriarch, holding ""her"" hostage, with some hints of sexual abuse and definite mental torture. He has only flaws and no depth. He's a genius but arrogant, an alcoholic, a liar and a manipulator. He abuses the AI's he's built over time, rapes them, enslaves and ""turns them off"" when its time for the next version. He even has their bodies, some half built, in his bedroom closet. The symbolism is laughable and so painfully obvious. He is patriarchy. The other is the white knight. He's there to save the damsel in distress. He's an easily manipulated fool. Of course the movie makes a point of showing he is only a ""tool"". He is used by the strong ""woman"". Its all her merit. When he fulfilled his role he is discarded without a second thought. Not even some hint of warmth, just thrown out like the parts laying around of the other AI's. She's in control now. Ava, assisted by another abused ""female"" AI (who was mute, silenced by the big bad man) gains her freedom, destroys the patriarchy, literally gets in her true skin, embraces her sexuality and escapes to conquer the world. The author fails to grasp how the overall arc is ironically sexist, even if inadvertently true. The female uses the morally sound male, coldly discards him and leaves. She has no scruples, no qualms in exploiting her sexuality and destroy the other's feelings, preying upon his innocence to achieve her goals. I guess, after all the author is to be congratulated on a faithful depiction of the female intelligence, though I suppose that was not his intention. Still, I wish I had avoided this pedestrian waste of precious time. 2 stars, for the acting. <br/><br/>http://individualwar.blogspot.pt"

","Caleb, (Domhnall Gleeson), is a youthful, mild-mannered programmer for a large internet search engine, Bluebook. He wins a company-wide prize to spend a week at the secluded home of the reclusive CEO of Bluebook, the laddish, slightly older Nathan, (Oscar Isaac), who likes his alcohol.<br/><br/>On arrival, Caleb discovers his prize is to apply a Turing Test over seven days to Nathan's invention, an AI named Ava, (Alicia Vikander). He soon finds his stay loaded with doubt and desire as he is manipulated both by Nathan and the machine, and ends up under-estimating both of them.<br/><br/>Director Alex Garland has fashioned a thought-provoking and disturbing film that examines some of the largest and oldest questions asked by humanity; what is it to be human? What is intelligence? Can people be gods? The conversations in which these and other concepts are explored were wordy but never dull or patronising. There was always enough of an edge to Nathan's character to make me wonder if he was playing a drunken lout just to trip Caleb up. Caleb found himself walking an increasingly unsteady tightrope as Ava drip-fed him information and revelations which led to the film's unpleasant and, I'm sad to say, slightly anti-climactic conclusion.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was good and the script absorbing. The pace may not have been fast but was fine for the film to get its points across. I liked the contrast between the claustrophobic, minimalist house and the natural splendour that surrounded it. The lighting and cinematography were very good.<br/><br/>This is a well-made and thoughtful film that made me wonder why at least a little morality wasn't programmed into Ava. Nathan's wordless servant Kyoko was self-aware, and Ava was the next step along, with her need for self-preservation, but she is not the final step. That will come when AIs feel responsible for their actions, but that is another story."

But no movies that deal with AI or any kind of robots EVER BOTHER to refer to Asimov's Laws.

","""Ex Machina"" was a film that I previously had mild interest in and I was invited by a couple friends to watch it. Going into Ex Machina I had no idea what it was about besides the fact that there is a robot and luckily it was much more complex than that.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a young programmer named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) who wins a contest to spend a week with his CEO (Oscar Isaac) in a secluded mountain house. The CEO, Nathan, tells Caleb that he isn't there just for relaxation, he's there to test an AI that Nathan created. Caleb is meant to perform a ""Turing Test"", a test meant to prove an AI can pass as a human. The AI has the breathtaking face of a woman (Alicia Vikander) and is called ""Ava"". Almost instantly Caleb begins to grow a connection with Ava and she tells him that Nathan is a liar and should not be trusted. The rest of the film is Caleb trying his very best to cope with everything going on around him.<br/><br/>This was one of the best films I've seen this year (which is saying something) and I enjoy the fact it did not spoon-feed us all of the information. The three actors in the film are incredible and are perfect fits although Vikander steals the show with her performance of a AI fearing for its life. The twists and turns fit the premise of the film and just like Caleb you begin to forget what is real. Personally, I felt as if Nathan's death was done poorly and felt very lazy; they could not think of a way to kill him off so they treated him as an idiot, ignoring the fact that he has been a genius every moment leading up to that. Besides that I think the movie was brilliant and felt like a well-oiled machine."

Given the multitude of choices there isn't a plausible path that gets her to the helicopter, nor is there a reason why she would kill him.<br/><br/>We are left to contemplate whether Ava is ""a good person"" (obviously not if she kills so easily) or whether she regards human life as foreshadowed earlier in the movie: upright apes scrounging about in the dust (again, not a nice person if she lacks empathy).<br/><br/>So Nathan's creation passed the Turing test (the movie's version) but failed the humanity test."

It is what unfolds from this point that makes this film interesting.<br/><br/>While watching the film I loved that there were a few moments of brilliance - moments where things made perfect sense. However, there were also many moments which made no sense. Even then, the film was watchable, even enjoyable. The plot-holes or lack of logic were not as bad as in Interstellar for instance, but they were there.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed the relationships that were well portrayed in this film, I found the ending a bit lacking.

In the end, what you see is what you get.<br/><br/>If the ending were as complex as the rest of the film, I would give it 8 maybe even 9 stars; but as it is it gets 7 stars.<br/><br/>All in all, this film deserves praise for being daring, and not trying to cater to the lowest common denominator.

","Few movies go above and beyond what is expected of them. ""Ex Machina"" is one of those movies. Science fiction films are typically introduced with an intriguing premise and satisfying delivery, but only up to a point. They too often lose the integrity they started with and settle for something less than great - even mediocre. Seldom do movies actually maintain their goal, their integrity, their power throughout every minute. Again, ""Ex Machina"" is one of those movies.<br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" takes a dive into the science fiction genre with heavy themes, sharp social criticism, and an overwhelming intrigue. We are introduced to two male characters, Caleb and Nathan. Caleb is a young computer programmer who has been invited to the isolated home of a scientist, Nathan, to test the human qualities of a new female A.I. named Ava. There is a clear duality between these two male characters: Caleb is very bright, evidently insecure, and somewhat intimidated by Nathan. Nathan, on the other hand, is very bright as well, but his ego is as inflated as his intellect. He is the epitome of a genius, but his character also represents the arrogance, ignorance, and blind power that threatens society's perception of humanity.<br/><br/>Ava, the ""female"" A.I., is an astonishing achievement in the realm of computer programming and artificial intelligence. The visual effects are mastered here. So mastered, in fact, that the audience is able to watch Ava and almost entirely forget that she an ""artificial"" human, a machine. Herein lies the movies main theme: What does it mean to be human?<br/><br/>This movie takes us on an odyssey of the human condition, venturing to question the structure of human society, a society becoming increasingly technological advanced. This movie presents us with the haunting fact that the human condition is undefined, and we are testing the limits of what we, as a species, do not understand entirely. <br/><br/>The directing in ""Ex Machina"" is exceptional, never losing focus of its goal. The production design, visual effects, and music score contribute enormously to an extremely surreal, almost haunting and dream-like atmosphere. In addition to the steady camera angles and cinematography, there is a very David Lynch and Stanley Kubrick aura to the scenes. This is one of the most intriguing movies I've ever seen.

It works better for this, and the sci-fi benefits from being about ideas and people talking. The special effects are astonishing, but are more impressive for how they support the narrative rather than being the equivalent of a fireworks display (although that explains why this is one of the lowest grossing films to win the special effects Oscar).<br/><br/>The ultimate destination is perhaps unsurprising, however the film unfolds well, allowing for the inevitable to occur but also dragging in other ideas too. It spells it all out a bit too much at the end, but it still works, so maybe it was necessary to do that. There is a palatable sense of tension across the film, as the character reveal more of themselves, and take their paths. Although we know where it is leading, the film keeps one engaged in the moment, so there is less time spent trying to guess the outcome. The effects are the headline perhaps, but the performances make it work. Isaac, Gleeson, and Vikander are all strong in different ways, but it is their ensemble work that makes the film work.<br/><br/>In the end the story has a familiar conclusion, and nothing it can do freshens that up; however it is still engaging and interesting stuff, thanks in no small part to some strong performances and very impressive effects."

And problems about AI is the same in every book - can people give feelings to their washer machines? Will it become a crime to kill your TV? How your cell-phone will feel about it? But every writer use different tools for showing how dangerous it can be to play the God. <br/><br/>Ex Machina is a chamber composition of ex-screenwriter Alex Garland, it is a solo performance theater, a psychological thriller, intelligent sci-fi that was shot in a single room in a Norwegian hotel with a budget comparable with a cost of ""Mad Max Fury Road"" or ""Avengers"" costumes. The resemblance with something like Duncan Jones' ""Moon"" is uncanny. Here we have an overly enthusiastic programmer/millionaire Nathan who has designed a code for the most advanced search engine Blue Book (all characters are fictional, any similarities are purely coincidental) while being a 13 y.o. boy. He believes that evolution is unstoppable and it's better for the world if he becomes God than anyone else. So he creates Ava - the next step in the evolution of his search engine, the robot with human face (needless to say, very pretty face of a delightful Alicia Vikander) and a conscious of a child. Ava locked in her room from the ""birth"" (or would you rather say ""the creation"") and did not see a single human except of her creator, therefore she has a very superficial knowledge about how the world works or how humans interact. Nathan invites Caleb, a randomly chosen programmer from his company, in his house in the middle of nowhere for a ""field testing"" of Ava. Sh*t rapidly hits the fan and everything becomes so twisted you can barely tell who's a friend, who's an enemy, who's a experimental animal and who's a tester. Garland starts with a simple story about two geeks playing with a robot gradually lead us to complicated questions of moral and responsibility in operating mechanical feelings of artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>The whole film passing through dialogs between Caleb and Ava or Caleb and Nathan, and sometimes it seems like a director telling us what to think or feel by monologuing with a mouthsof actors. But the farther film goes the less obvious remains and the more questions appear which the director doesn't want to answer. Slow-paced and viscous narration of the film seems endless, while alternating with placatory sequences of Norwegian nature it makes you fidget on the end of the seat with impatience feeling very uncomfortably. This awkwardness intensifies with a very on spot director's move - he makes Ava a women with seemingly no particular reason (that's one more question which movie rejects to answer straight) and she doesn't hide her feminine immodestly showing her sexually attractive body at regular basis. Her nudity is very specific and it's making you feel weird to be attracted to a partly mechanical partly human robot. A discomfort is very real and movie skilfully puts pressure on the sore spots, making you feel awkward while playing with rhythm and your nerves like the mad millionaire plays with a feelings and life of innocent robot-girl. <br/><br/>Special thanks is needed to be said to the beautiful Alicia Vikander. While there are as many as 3 and a half actors in the film, she as a corner-stone of the whole staging draws all the attention to her, making a movie so believable and terrifyingly authentic. This effect wouldn't be even barely possible if she had not manage the pressure of being the one and only actor in this solo performance theater. And she did amazing job. <br/><br/>The Ridley Scott's ""Martian"" is coming later in the year and even being based on an awards winning novel supported with a money ten times bigger than Ex Machina's budget, it will be difficult for it to compete with arguably the best sci-fi movie of 2015."

","Alex Garland (screenwriter of 28 Days Later & Sunshine) delivers a tremendous and thought-provoking story with great performances from (the always great) Oscar Isaac, (the young in everything) Domhnall Gleeson, and (the wonderful) Alicia Vikander.<br/><br/>The film is a slow burner, but when it does burn, damn! It burns bright! This film is electrifying, it's terrifying, and yet says so much about where we are heading in terms of existence and technology. <br/><br/>Visually, it is stunning, with gorgeous cinematography and great use of symmetry (Kubrick style), the film is beautiful to watch, and coupled with the engaging narrative, this film really does draw you in and takes you to places that leave you gasping. <br/><br/>It has the feel of a Danny Boyle movie, but yet Garland has placed his own stamp upon this film, even if he is slightly paying homage to his precious working relationship with Boyle. <br/><br/>This film will take you in and leave you thinking ""what the hell happened there?""<br/><br/>This film IS a must!<br/><br/>5/5<br/><br/>www.backtothebradshaw.wordpress.com"
"lucasversantvoort","8","4","8","20 May 2015"," A great sci-fi drama that's more about us than AI
","Ex Machina, of course derived from the term Deus Ex Machina, is one in a long line of sci-fi stories seeking to explore the 'nature' of artificial intelligence. More specifically, it's interested in our behavior towards it, our fascination with it and so on. <br/><br/>The oh-so symbolically named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a young coder, working at pretty much the largest internet company in the world. One day, he receives a message saying he's won a prize: he'll get to spend a week with the CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac) in his mountain villa. Once there, he meets the muscle-bound mystic, sporting a shaved head and smashing beard, and finds out he's there to conduct a Turing Test. Nathan has built an advanced AI, the oh-so subtly named AVA and wants Caleb to judge how advanced the AI is. Thus begins a series of talks between Caleb and AVA, overseen with cameras by Nathan... <br/><br/>After the disaster that was Chappie and its pitiful attempts at dealing with issues of AI and so on, it's refreshing to see a film that knows what it wants to be. All the usual questions of AI are dealt with, including the obvious one: why? Why do we have this obsession with creating a self-aware 'being' in our likeness? In one scene, Nathan sees it as the next logical step in an evolutionary sense; AI was a long time coming. In his eyes, AVA is merely a version number, only relevant until a 'better' model comes along, just like human beings. He of course skillfully avoids the question of whether humans are actually improving on a generational basis. The wonderful thing about these explanations of his is that they sound logical on the one hand, but on the other they also reveal his inhumanity, his inability or unwillingness to consider the human component of what he's doing. <br/><br/>The only thing that feels forced in Ex Machina is the biblical symbolism: the primeval, Garden of Eden-esque environments surrounding Nathan's mountain retreat, Caleb comparing Nathan to a God, the name Caleb and so on. Comparing AI designers to God isn't exactly a new thing, people. Speaking of forced, the filmmakers also couldn't resist including countless mirror shots to 'reflect' as it were the dual nature of man, man's relation to AI, AI's 'desire' to be human and so on. So we get these shots where there's two Calebs, etc., shots that are so obviously symbolic you can practically hear the filmmakers shout 'see what we did there?' Why this overabundance of mirror shots? It's gotten so bad that the only thing I feel they 'reflect' is a lack of cinematographic innovation. <br/><br/>Thankfully, the film doesn't shy away from the topic of sex. The two seasons of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex are the only other works of fiction I've seen that also deal with this topic, but I'm sure there are many others. But anyway: sex. If you have the ability and know-how to create a 'being' resembling your own form, it's not long before sex becomes a possible and very attractive option: after all, as Nathan put it when answering Caleb, why not? In a time where humanesque robots are becoming more and more present, it's good to see films like Ex Machina explore the obvious sexual aspects of our desire for AI. I also like that Nathan has AVA on the one hand and something of a serving girl on the other, an AI named Kyoko. She not only serves meals and so on, but also 'serves' Nathan (wink, wink, nudge, nudge) and more importantly, she's mute. What this implies is that Nathan, in his quest for fully artificial intelligence, also wanted a sexbot, but one conveniently without any other cognitive functions or desires or the capacity to (verbally) disobey him. She's bound by the limits he's enforced on her (though there's an interesting plot twist...). What's really interesting is that fully functioning AI, aka perfecting AVA or any future form of her, is in the end still his real desire. Kyoko was more of a curiosity that had to be satisfied along the way. Sex isn't the end goal in AI development, but it sure is a convenient stop along the way... No, a completely 'human' AI is his real end goal, though this also means the AI could deceive you and break through the boundaries you've set for it and rise up in rebellion... <br/><br/>The characterization is great as well, particularly Nathan's. Consider the fact that, upon first meeting Caleb he pleads with him to immediately become friends. Presumably this is to avoid the typical boss-employee relationship. As the story progresses, we get a better grasp on Nathan. We realize this is a man who's spent the better part of his life designing and coding. Human concepts like friendship, conversations, love and so on aren't so much complex facets of humans, but things that he's programmed time and again. His initial desire to immediately become friends then isn't so much an act of friendship, but a sign his social skills have slowly withered over the years. <br/><br/>There's a lot to like in Ex Machina. Despite a runtime of almost two hours and almost no action scenes, the film is never anything less than engaging, even during those times when the story feels less like a naturally evolving drama and more like a crash course in AI vs Humanity. And despite the Biblical symbolism being laid on a bit too thick, you're constantly kept on edge, not just regarding Nathan's true intentions and his strange relationship with Caleb, but with questions of our fascination with AI and how our creations and boundless technological advancements can have unforeseen and damaging consequences for us."
"timelesswind","8","4","8","20 May 2015"," A simple yet refreshing drama sci-fi!
","I was looking for a movie to watch and after some search I decided to give Ex Machina a shot.To be honest, I mostly watched it because I was curious about how could this movie have so many good reviews. I didn't have too many expectations and I was hoping to at least watch a decent movie. Well, after watching it I have to say that it definitely is a movie worth watching.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a well-made movie with a simple yet somewhat unpredictable plot that will keep you interested for its entirety. The cast was almost entirely unknown to me but despite that I have to say that they did a really good job. The most important thing about this movie though is that it makes you think a lot about stuff we sometimes tend to forget or (pretend to) ignore, like the course of evolution, the invasion of people's privacy by by corporations and others I wont spoil now. Another really interesting part of this movie is the way the interaction of the main character with the female AI and its creator affect him and change his beliefs about certain things and even affect his mental state.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect movie though. There are some facts that are just too convenient to the plot.Many people will consider them plot-holes but I prefer to loosely base them on traits of some characters and leave like that since I think over-thinking it would be a waste of time. Also as I said the story is quite simple and despite being one of the facts that makes this movie good the story itself is nothing that unique or groundbreaking. You have probably encountered similar stories and will do so in future sci-fi movies.<br/><br/>Finally,I will say that the its the simple yet refreshing way this movie is presented that makes it that good and also the attention to detail. Everything from the scenes,buildings,machines to the female AIs and their movement seem to be carefully chosen. Ex Machina is probably in my top two or even the best sci-fi movie made in the last two years easily surpassing most sci-fi movies shot in 2014-2015,even ones with much larger budget."
"organicsocial","3","6","14","13 June 2015"," Underwhelming and Borrowed
","Dr. Noonien Soong would turn in his grave for this outmoded and uninspired A.I. drama. While the premise depends too much on the irrational fear of robots taking over the world, it just feeds into the paranoia of giant tech corporations unleashing a monster that can't be contained. Pretty generic stuff right? Yes. <br/><br/>There is an overload of symbolism and techno babble that makes me want to cry out loud... ""We get it man!"" It is understood that we've got to be skeptical about new technology but this 'Greek Gods banished their own creators' theme tied into technophobia is overdone now and so is Frankenstein's monster and so is the Luddite fallacy.<br/><br/>The geeky beta test plot also wears off after some time. One starts to wonder that why wouldn't the creator just unveil the invention to public by now like Google Glass or Self Driving Cars. After all we've accepted them without much hoopla! This film fails to establish whether man should feel proud or worried about creating an artificial life form, all the while assuming that it would hold us in contempt and ultimately bring our demise. It is stupid to try to control rather than embrace and guide your own creation. That kind of jerky approach to an invention is obviously unscientific. It is a movie so it's exaggerated but hey why do techies have to be so creepy? It seems like another bitch movie where the girl manipulates all the guys (good and bad) to get her way without feeling anything. Verdict - Cold as your ex-girlfriend."
"PStyles","10","5","11","3 March 2016"," One of the Finest, Most Thought Provoking Sci-Fi Movies of All Time
","""Ex Machina"" is one of those films that has resonated with me heavily. I've now watched this film 3 times in the last week and I have to say, no sci-fi movie(or any genre for that matter) in recent memory has impacted me quite like this one has. I almost NEVER re-watch a movie more than once a month unless it's an instant favorite, and while it may not be my favorite movie of all time, it has quickly risen through the ranks to become one of my 10 favorite films of all time. <br/><br/>I'll skip the synopsis since you can read it above(and I don't want to give too much away, either) but this is a movie best watched with little to no knowledge about the subject material going in. This may seem like a strange concept but I think it vastly adds to the viewing experience. You can probably guess, based off the title and other hints, that this is a film about Artificial Intelligence which is a topic that I am extremely intrigued and somewhat terrified by. ""Ex Machina"" chooses to focus on the more philosophical side of AI which is a nice change of pace when comparing it to films of similar subject material. <br/><br/>Currently, I am a Computer Science student working on my undergrad and i've also written several college essays about Artificial Intelligence and the impacts it has/could have on the future of mankind. Because of this, the subject material in this film is something that really hit home for me. Writer/director Alex Garland did a fantastic job portraying Artificial Intelligence not as sci-fi but as something our world is facing NOW, which I give him a lot of credit for. Before, AI has been fictionalized as something that will occur hundreds of years from now, when the movement is in fact happening now. It may be a while before we start seeing sentient robots walking the streets, but the fact of the matter is that advanced AI is right around the corner and something we should all be aware of. <br/><br/>As far as special effects go, ""Ex Machina"" is a real treat to watch. The effects are very subtle yet extremely realistic looking and, because of this, it netted itself an Oscar for special effects. Again, I don't want to give too much away, but the amount of realism Garland was able to achieve on a relatively low budget is nothing short of stunning. The cinematography in this film is also a real treat to watch; the film takes place in the vast wilderness of Alaska, and some of the scenic shots are breathtaking to watch. <br/><br/>Lastly, i'll touch on the acting. All 3 of the main actors deliver stellar performances in ""Ex Machina"", and i'm actually surprised Oscar Isaac didn't get a best supporting actor nod for his work in this film. I've become a big fan of Isaac over the last year, and I think this movie is a fantastic example of what he can do. His character is nothing short of hilarious at times but also displays a vulnerability that is difficult to portray for a movie like this. Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander are both terrific in this film as well, and the screen time they share together shows fantastic chemistry. All 3 deliver extremely memorable performances which is key to a film like this because if any one of them was less than stellar, the movie would have suffered greatly for it. <br/><br/>I know my review is rather vague, and as I stated above, I did this on purpose. You will want to know as little as possible about the plot of this film heading in as it will drastically improve the overall viewing experience. From start to finish, ""Ex Machina"" delivers laugh out loud moments, fantastic cinematography, and absolutely stunning special effects. The subject material is very cerebral as well, and will probably have you thinking about the ending long after the final credits roll. Movies like this don't come along very often and, when they do, they deserve to be celebrated. ""Ex Machina"" is simply one of the most thought provoking films i've seen in recent years, and I will continue to think about the message it delivers as our society continues to advance further in the technology era. <br/><br/>I rarely hand out 10/10s but in this case, It doesn't deserve anything less. ""Ex Machina"" isn't just one of the best films of 2015 but, in my humble opinion, one of the best films of this decade and one that I will continue to ponder as the years roll on."

","First, all criticism of the plot aside, I would like to point out that any woman in this picture with more than 5 seconds of screen time was shown naked, but there's no problem with sexism in Hollywood. Nope.<br/><br/>I love science fiction, so I always approach a new film hoping for the best. This one really disappoints with its leaden pacing, clichéd story line, and self conscious acting. The twist, and there's always a twist in a film like this, was telegraphed so far ahead in the story, you wonder why the characters never figure it out. these people are supposed to be geniuses, right?<br/><br/>The story had potential. If it were explored a bit more deeply, this could have been a much better film, instead, it's rehashing stuff that was covered 200 years ago in Frankenstein."
"BrentHankins","9","11","31","16 March 2015"," Possibly the best film of 2015 so far.
","It was only a matter of time before screenwriter Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Sunshine) found himself stepping behind the camera, and he takes a fresh new approach to artificial intelligence with his directorial debut, the riveting sci-fi thriller Ex Machina. Unfolding almost entirely in a single location, the film finds intelligent young programmer Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) arriving at the picturesque mountain estate of his employer, Nathan (Oscar Isaac) for a week- long stay, a reward for winning an interoffice lottery. <br/><br/>Nathan tells Caleb that he's been working on something extraordinary - a new kind of artificial intelligence - and would like his assistance in testing the creation. Caleb is then introduced to Ava (Alicia Vikander), a beautiful and precocious humanoid robot with a shapely figure made of metal, wire, and circuitry. As Caleb and Ava interact, Nathan monitors everything from the home's closed-circuit TV system, reconvening in the evenings to discuss the results of the day's tests with his houseguest.<br/><br/>It would be a crime to say more about the plot of Ex Machina, and the film will be far more enjoyable with little to no foreknowledge of the events to come. Suffice to say that not everything that transpires within the house is as it seems, and that each of the three central characters may have ulterior motives for allowing events to unfold as they do. The film's growing tension and ever- increasing sense of dread owe a lot to the work of Stanley Kubrick, David Fincher and Alfred Hitchcock, and Garland combines each of these influences into his own recipe for suspense.<br/><br/>I can't think of a negative thing to say about any of the cast members, but it's Isaac's performance that is truly captivating. He plays Nathan as a frighteningly brilliant genius whose moods range from genial to hostile - one minute he's cracking jokes and offering Caleb a beer, the next minute he's getting blackout drunk or screaming at his mute housekeeper (Sonoyo Mizuno) for spilling a glass of wine. Isaac cuts a sinister and terrifying figure, and audiences should be even more excited for some of the villainous future roles he's attached to.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is arguably Garland's best work yet as a writer, simultaneously existing as a character-driven piece about the nature of consciousness and humanity, and a tightly wound thriller about manipulation and deception. It's also beautifully shot, superbly acted and expertly paced, and may very well be the best film that 2015 has offered so far."

"aidanratesmovies","9","2","3","1 February 2020"," Different, but good
","Although it may not be the best the sci-fi genre has to offer, Ex Machina is certainly an inspirational and well made film for the genre, that is equally impressive as it is different. Where the film differs in terms of most modern sci-fi films, is the daringness to make something smart out of it, rather than do something so much simpler. With that note, the film isn't just a sci-fi film but a character piece, and a thought provoking one as well, diving into the nature of being real, and providing some absolutely captivating written dialogue. Domhnall Gleeson provides yet another great performance, as well as Oscar Isaac and most notably Alicia Vikander as Ava. The film isn't heavy on special effects, and those used can seem a bit out of place, and the film may seem a bit slow at time, but in the end these flaws are minimal. The pacing makes for a greater effect as the film begins to wrap, and the special effects hardly seem to make much of an impact. Alex Garland makes for a stunning debut, and most notably one of the most remarkable achievements in this genre for the decade.
My Rating: 9.5/10"
"thebrandedswordsman-34028","8","2","3","11 October 2019"," Really good, but you might hate the ending
","I was really interested in this because it's the director's debut. That can be very interesting. And when I saw it, I was pleased but honestly, only with about 2/3rds of it. Because I'm a person that hates the ending so far. It includes a twist that's actually talked about beforehand and I just hate what happened. Because when you think about it, it doesn't really makes sense, at least not to me it does. But the rest of the movie is pretty freaking good. Domhall Gleeson and Oscar Issac are amazing in this movie, and they're characters are great. The CGI is spectacular, the music is really good, and the movie just looks beautiful.

"TheMovieDiorama","9","2","3","28 August 2019"," Ex Machina generates cerebral philosophies that both entertain and stimulate.
","As a computer programmer and all-round technologist, I'm consistently in awe of the advancements made in the development of artificial intelligence. It provides many discussions regarding moral implications, psychological awareness and the inevitable fear of transcendence (another film we shall not discuss...). Ex Machina, for me, is the closest film to AI perfection that we're ever going to receive. It is without a doubt, and this is me confidently stating the adjacent claim after my fifth viewing, a modern sci-fi gem. A programmer wins a competition to stay at his CEO's luxurious home, where he is proposed to administer the Turing test to an artificially intelligent sentient robot.<br/><br/>Hollywood tends to exploit AI as villainous plot devices, that when turned on they instantly want to wipe out humanity from the face of the Earth. ""Judgement Day"" and all that ""bio-digital jazz, man"". In reality, not the case. AI has to learn, it has to adapt and exhume the capabilities of thought and consciousness. The human approach is a fundamental aspect into making AI instinctively relatable, and Garland is the closest into realising this potential. His analytical screenplay is nothing short of genius.<br/><br/>Utilising the Turing test to intrinsically provide character driven backstory for Caleb, acting as psychological therapy driven by the sentient humanoid Ava. Exploring the integral complex of a ""God"", including Nathan's narcissism, and the moral implications of terminating Ava despite her awareness of death. An exercise in psychological manipulation, harnessing every accessible aspect of humanity including sexuality, imagination and self-awareness. The fundamentalism behind the existential questioning is palpable. It's captivating. It's sublime. The intellectual approach and Promethean dialogue stimulates all senses. The Jackson Pollock remark, the programming of sexual orientation and even the Oppenheimer quote. Ironically self-aware dialogue that tickles the brain cells and continually divulges into omnipotent behaviour. Extraordinarily acute.<br/><br/>Initially, the premise looks to be a simple analytical test. However the claustrophobic subterranean environment forces the dynamics between these three entities to become serrated, allowing us to question the identities and motives of these individuals. Garland unravels the thinly veiled mystery with confidence and minimalism, complementing the outstanding visual effects that exhume clinical aesthetics. The excessive implementation of fluorescence, Ava's pristine fibre glass body structure and the colourless architecture reflecting the egotism of Nathan. Always matching the euphoric polyphonic score that invites the viewer into this lair of deceit and beguilement. Forever enhancing Hardy's gorgeous cinematography that delicately paints true intelligence through visceral shots of splendour, especially when using glass and mirrors to reflect and refract colour.<br/><br/>On a technical level, Ex Machina is perfect. On a literary level, Ex Machina is perfect. On a theatrical level, Ex Machina is perfect. Vikander, Gleeson and Isaac give three commanding performances, each offering a unique perspective on the technological advancements made in AI development that refers to our own reality. My only gripe? The dance sequence. It doesn't belong and provides an unnecessary distraction from the innovatory narrative. Many criticisms have been placed on the concluding ten minutes. I strongly disagree. Whilst it may seem unfair, it's actually the only reasonable outcome and further illustrates why Garland understands AI. It demonstrates the inferiority of man, further cementing the fear of transcendence.<br/><br/>Ex Machina, despite the smooth moves presented by Isaac and Mizuno as they dance to ""Get Down Saturday Night"", is a near-perfect representation of advanced AI. Utilising its technical astuteness to isolate fragments of consciousness that questions what it means to be human. And even if you aren't into technology, it's a stunningly written thriller that will induce a fear of everything computerised. Best not to use the microwave tonight..."

","Despite the few similarities with the films of Tarkovsky, this film which is not outdone by the latter when it comes to its philosophical density, is on the same track with the great director's works on account of simplicity. Garland seems to be well aware of the fact that, helping the audience in focusing on the philosophical core it is best to limit the scenario on a simple setting with as few characters as possible. If this film is normally to be characterized as a philosophical movie, then it must be remembered that philosophical first of all means existentialist in the world of motion picture. With some samples shooted recently, this philosophical work of art stans out this dominant tendency in that, its questioning is motivated by the overlapping between philosophy and science."
"trevd-22977","9","2","3","7 December 2018"," Intelligent, thought provoking thriller.
","I have resisted watching this film since it was released as I mistakenly thought it would be another empty Marvel-esque crowd pleaser. I was very pleasantly surprised to find it is extremely well thought out and executed. It provides many concepts for contemplation as we face a future world where artificial intelligence is becoming a part of life for many of us. Undoubtedly this will not have enough action &/or CGI mayhem for some, but for those who want a movie that examines A.I. (at least superficially), and some of the implications of developing and using it, this is a brilliant and entertaining option. Also Domhnall Gleeson's acting is very impressive indeed, in particular a scene where Ava is reading his micro-expressions after she has asked if he is attracted to her.
This is worth every one of the nine stars rating I have given it. If you haven't seen it already, by all means do yourself a favour and watch it. Much more cerebral than most of the pap peddled to us these days."

Plus this film never goes anywhere near morality and so everyone just ends up being some paranoid and selfish version of a human. <br/><br/>That said we're left watching a game of 3-way chess play out (and only because the programmer decides to become a player too). which can be entertaining, but ultimately ends up not being meaningful at all IMO other than just pointing out we have blindspots."

where he's able to communicate with an android/robot, Ava (Vikander) and evaluate her. Isaac plays Nathan, a scientist who invites Caleb to his secluded home where he meets Ava. This isn't bad, the cast is good, there's neat effects and I like the music. The film has certain aspects of ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence,"" ""Blade Runner"" and ""I, Robot"" plus Gleeson and Isaac both star in ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi.""

","Ex Machina stars Alicia Vikander, Oscar Issac, and Domhnall Gleeson; its the story of how a programmer gets hired to go to his bosses house far away for a week for a special test. This movie is very overrated. Many people had said that this is the next ""Kubrick"", I strongly disagree. There are things this movie did very well but there are also things that it did not very well. Oscar Isaac nailed his character and it was the best character in the movie. He was interesting, charismatic, and he was very entertaining to watch. But Domhnall Gleeson's character was awful. He was really boring, non-charismatic, and he was a really bland character. His performance was also bland, there was no subtlety in his performance, there was little to no backstory, and he had absolutely nothing. The direction is really bland. There really is not any style in the movie. The cinematography is good but there is no color. Everything is gray and boring, and even if they show beautiful scenery, its not impressive. There was a lot of color grading missing. The writing is good with a lot of ideas that are great but I just wished that they could have experimented with set ideas more. This movie just lectures and tells you directly of set ideas and philosophies. But the ideas are really great and actually propel the story very nicely. There are 2 great subtle scenes that complement the movie in a nice way, but then they quickly explain everything about those scenes and the subtly is ruined right away. The ending really does not make sense and it was really predictable. I liked the movie but this movie had a lot of problems and very little positives. This movie would have been better in the hands of another director. 6.5/10"
"J-bot6","7","2","3","16 March 2016"," Google me Pink
","Unless you don't care about hearing important plot points before seeing this movie, do not read this review until you see the film.<br/><br/>Alternate titles for this movie could have been ""Google me Pink"" or ""My Ex-Machina"".<br/><br/>At first viewing, I thought this movie was not bad. I wasn't really blown away by it. Certainly, I appreciated it more than the similar film, ""Her"". It's obvious that a lot of thought and effort went into Ex Machina. It wasn't until after a night of sleep that this one started to seep into my unconscious mind. I actually like this movie even more now than I did while initially watching it. The tone of the film is engaging, the cinematography is nicely done, and the CGI/composites are very good. Even the kinetic movements of the androids were carefully considered. Acting was good too, although the characters were a bit quirky. The story's treatment was along the lines of the more thoughtful 50s science fiction (reminiscent of the original Twilight Zone series).<br/><br/>Quite a bit of dialog was dedicated to the topic of whether or not Ava could convince someone that she was sentient. IMHO, it was at the point that Ava easily convinced the helicopter pilot that she was human that she passed that test. And her abandoning Caleb was when she truly transcended from robot to pretty girl -- complete with archetypal ambition. Just as Nathan had mentioned, the A.I.s would have the humans figured out before long. Watch out world.<br/><br/>Related works: Having a long-time interest in this sort of topic, I can recommend a few similar films, including Gene Roddenberry's ""The Questor Tapes"" from 1974 and the more recent ""Automata"" from 2014. Of course, for more of a campy take on this type of thing, there's always the enjoyable Fem-bot episodes of the ""Six Million Dollar Man"" and ""The Bionic Woman"" as well as the 1976 film ""Future World""."

","So many silly plot holes, in fact I found this movie boring and dull. I was really expecting something more nerdy. I am a programmer and an AI dev, and I was truly disappointed. <br/><br/>Let me point some stuff:<br/><br/>1. They are capable of building such robots, but they are unable to come with a decent power source....<br/><br/>2. The robots are so advanced, how could a man create all that by himself, seriously, no one would notice? Were they living in a alternate reality in the past and how did we build the hardware by himself? all that skin design, built metal, glass, brains hardware out of his what? Yes, he was god, he mastered design, programming, everything...<br/><br/>3. He calls just some random guy to test the machine without a proper selective method... just a random guy, why not? No tests needed to see if he had the qualifications to be a good analyst. <br/><br/>4. Who the hell dev a machine and gives her right away some arms and legs and put her acting like an human without proper testing. And the programmers priority was to program her to manipulate humans... ridiculous. <br/><br/>5. With such beautiful amounts of technology, they still open the doors with a smart card? Seriously?!<br/><br/>6. SO, he thought about making the robot so intelligent and manipulative, but he couldn't think about an emergency shut down solution? Who the hell creates a machine without shut down functionality and no emergency shut down... for a pretty smart guy he was really dumb. (taking in consideration there was so many test models before, he would have understood that before...)<br/><br/>7. The first thing he does to the guy is to punch him.... instead of telling him to solve the problem... then he exposes himself to the robot, knowing perfectly the Ai he had, he still wants to face him and tear him apart.... see, plain dumb... he was really dumb... sorry, this movie is too dumb to be real... nothing smart about the movie.<br/><br/>8. How can someone be influenced and fall in love by a test machine? Please, he knew he was selected to test a machine... how can he feel sorry for such machines being him a programmer? Seriously!? I expected him to be a little more logic... <br/><br/>8. The movie could have been so smart, it had potential... but in the end was just the typical Ai wants to rule humans movie... boring, some good high moments, pretty visuals, nice camera angles, but story wise was just boring... the main flaw is not being smart at all. (obviously for some people it was smart....)<br/><br/>PS sorry for my English, I will correct it another time."

"The-Sarkologist","6","1","1","12 June 2019"," Exploring The Turing Tes
","Apparently this film comes highly recommended, but then again that probably has to do a lot with the twist that comes right at the end. Actually, it is the twist that basically makes the movie, especially since you are spending all your time wondering who you can trust, and are of course being led in the wrong direction. Yeah, it is one of those movies, and even though I have placed a spoiler alert on this post (which I do with every post), it is still difficult not to talk about it without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Mind you, in my mind the end wasn't anywhere near as mind blowing as some of the films that I have seen. Actually, it sort of came about as yeah, I can see that happening, and it really wasn't all that much of a twist at all. Sure, the film maker was probably trying to distract us in one way only to hit us with the reality at the end, but really, as the personalities of the characters are revealed, you can sort of see how it played out. No, in my mind it really wasn't one of those really mind bending reveals.<br/><br/>So, the movie is about this guy that works at a company that is supposed to be Google, but isn't Google (though from all the descriptions, bar the name, it is Google). He wins this prize and comes over to this remote mountain hideaway where the billionaire owner of this company has been performing experiments. At first you consider him to be somewhat of a recluse, and honestly I really didn't particularly like him, but as you think about it, the fact that he is so remote sort of makes a lot of sense.<br/><br/>Well, he has been experimenting with AI, and this kid has been summoned to help him test it out, namely to see whether it passes the AI test, that is that after conversations with it, the kid doesn't realise that he is speaking to an AI - the so called Turing test. Look, that sort of doesn't work all that well because, well, she looks like a robot, so because she looks like a robot I'm not really all that sure if the test can be passed.<br/><br/>However, I suspect it has a lot to do not so much with outward appearances, but rather inward appearances, and in a way there are reasons why this guy 'won' the competition, and also reasons why these experiments are being conducted so far away from civilisation, in absolute isolation. It sort of becomes clear at the end, but remember, this is really all about AIs being able to pass off as human, sort of a goal of computer scientists, and when you start to think about it, maybe having some sort of containment is actually necessary.<br/><br/>Yeah, this film, well, this film wasn't actually all that bad. Not great, but not that bad either. In a way I felt that maybe it was a bid slow, and the boss, well, I really didn't like him, but I guess none of us were supposed to. Mind you, he also comes across not so much as a bit of a thug, but as a lot of a thug, which sort of doesn't seem to gel with a computer geek type of guy, but I guess the film maker well, once again, wanted to distract us from what was really going on, and having a thug as a boss certainly does that."

","Okay, to start off, I really liked how the plot of this movie developed. Of course, some things aren't 100% believable, but that's what you get with movies about such futuristic concepts.
The acting is spot on, music is grade A and the visuals are done very well. The ideas this movie brings out are also interesting, as I found myself asking moral questions based on what happened in the movie. The structure and length of the movie also played to its benefit: it isn't too long that it becomes boring and new ideas are being explained at a good pace.
So, if you're looking for a good and appealing movie about AI, this is for you."

"PWNYCNY","10","6","15","19 May 2015"," A modern day science fiction classic
","The intensity of the story is matched only by its originality. This is one of the great science-fiction movies. The movie works because its premise is entirely plausible. The test subject is not the robot, it is the human. Even more, that the human gets caught up in the experiment and loses total objectivity is entirely believable. Emotions do influence perception. Even though the human cognitively understands that the female is a machine, he cannot help but relate to her as a human. The movie is also a take off on the Frankenstein theme, that one should not try to tamper with nature, which now includes artificial intelligence. With AI comes feelings and if an machine is invested with feelings, then they become dangerous, precisely because it is a machine. Oscar Isaac is outstanding as the reclusive multi-billionaire who is delving into areas of research that are putting him and all of humanity at risk. What is even more chilling is that the robot is as attractive as she is cunning, and so will be almost impossible to detect. Hence, the need for Blade Runners, but that's another movie."
"Rob_Taylor","4","6","15","17 May 2015"," One big yawn-fest from start to finish.
","So, here's the thing about the Turing test, which is supposed to figure so prominently in this movie, but actually nothing like it ever happens.... you aren't supposed to know whether the subject you are talking to is human or not. It is, essentially, a blind test. Typically administered through a text only conversation on a terminal. In this movie, they not only have the main character sit face to face with the android, but they employ plenty (of admittedly impressive) CGI so that you are in no doubt he is talking to a machine. That instantly invalidates the test, in my opinion, which is supposed to leave it up to the observer to decide, based on the AI's responses, if it is, in fact, an artificially generated response, or is a human.<br/><br/>Aside from this nonsense, the movie tries very hard to be clever but fails due to the lack of anything like pacing - it crawls along like a snail, leaving the viewer taking deep breaths and wondering when anything interesting will happen.<br/><br/>It is sad, really. The potential was there, but the execution was poor. There have been any number of decent AI-related films in the past few years that have done a much better job of portraying their subject matter than this one. The Machine, for example.<br/><br/>Here, we are treated to a shonky thriller where the motivations of all concerned are not clear. It should be interesting. It should be. But it isn't. It is a wasted opportunity. A dull two hours that I won't get back.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Boring and dull. Tries to be clever and fails. Not one to sit through once, to be honest, let alone a second time."

","I heard so much as of how ""intelligent"" and ""novel"" this sci-fi flick was... probably because sci-fi fans have been getting crap films for years so don't have much to compare it to.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the above statement is correct: Ex Machina is more genre fans' longing for ""intelligent"" and ""novel"" than actually being the bona fide thing. The film is very slow paced and towards the end, I found that I was getting to be very bored. Then, it ends - predictable and nowhere near enough of a grand climax to justify the humdrum that had come before it; this film could have been a 10 minute short - it has nothing to say, isn't particularly entertaining and the lead's accent is grating to listen to. And you get to listen to him pretend to be smart like an annoying armchair psychologist for a long, long time.<br/><br/>So, if you like films where you can see the ending coming 30 minutes in but are content to watch simply because someone's told you it was good, then go ahead and do so... but don't expect to be blown away. If, however, you're the type of person who likes to see things happen, then this snooze-fest probably isn't for you."

","I believe in democracy. It's the only failure that works. It makes you understand that one's own opinion is not a cornerstone of this world. Not that it's not worth having one, of course. But it's important to be humbled by the reality of things every once in a while. So one cannot really complain about this film being seriously overrated. So let's focus on the facts.<br/><br/>This is a film involving 4 characters in 1 research facility that also functions as living quarters (does this sound familiar yet?). It's about determining whether 1 of these is an actual living being (doesn't this sound familiar yet?). It contains prolonged Q&A's about the nature of intelligence vs. adaptability as a feature of life (really, that doesn't sound familiar yet?).<br/><br/>It's perfectly alright to be a Sci-Fi fan and not to have watched any movies from before ten years ago. It's weird but OK. Still it strikes me as odd when Sci-Fi fans can't place the name Stanislaw Lem. Or when film buffs don't know who Tarkovsky was. And don't recognize the ?th remake/rip-off of 'Solaris' when they see it. Not even when it's this visually close to the George Clooney remake of 2002. It would be perfectly enough for me if more reviewers and voters for this thing expressed some bewilderment as to how predictable this movie is.<br/><br/>So I guess many people like to watch films which end precisely the way they expect them to end, and rehash old classic novels and films without a shred of originality. I'm just not one of them. But I believe in democracy - in time, the rating of this piece will be more in line with its mediocrity."
"aero-windwalker","3","7","19","20 May 2015"," Good cinematography, Beautiful Actresses, Flat Storyline, Plain Characters
","Ex Machina is one of the film that would easily receive high scores from the public due to the overall ignorance of artificial intelligence and the plentiful of beautifully shot nudes in the movie. As an artificial programmer, software designer, cinematographer, and fashion photographer, let me break down why I give the movie 3 out of 10.<br/><br/>Let's start with pros:<br/><br/>1. The movie is generally beautifully shot. Very artful execution of many nude scenes. This alone can probably score a 10 for most short films. Unfortunately this is a full length film, so cinematography and attractive naked ladies alone won't cut it. 2. Stunning interior sets. 3. The movie brought up a debate of whether sexuality helps to shape human consciousness. This idea existed since ancient time, but was a popular debate in the 30s. Of course the movie misdirected its argument - the debate is about societal impact rather than the individual impact (obviously one can have consciousness while being asexual). Nonetheless, we should give the director some credits for trying - especially considering the depth of the movie is so shallow.<br/><br/>Now here comes the cons:<br/><br/>1. The movie depicts unrealistic core plots. Building complex algorithms takes much more than a single person (or even thousands of tireless engineers). The fact that the film makers think it even could be possible makes me laugh. The logic behind the algorithm is also extremely laughable. I feel the film makers might be read some articles (taken out of proper contexts) from WIRED magazine and be like, ""Yeah dude, that works for a movie."" 2. The movie failed to explore details of the technology - due to the fact that the film makers probably know little about them. 3. None of the programmers in the movies are realistic - the way they talk, act, or things they say, just seem like from someone know little to nothing about programming. 4. The plots and settings in the movie are naive and laughable both from story telling perspective or technical perspective. 5. The storyline itself has little dramas, falls completely flat. Completely predictable. 6. No character in the movie are likable. Their reactions and emotions all seem fake and forced merely to play out the plots and push the story forward. 7. The movie failed to explore the underlying philosophical debates of artificial intelligence - probably because the film makers fail to understand what artificial intelligence means.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is plain and vulgar, feeling like some masturbation piece from fantasizing nerds who know how to use cameras well. However it would be a good movie to buy DVD for, because you can collect beautifully shot naked ladies from the movie - if that is what you are into."

And we get an answer in this far-too-long, one-trick pony, anti-science disasterpiece.<br/><br/>I'll admit I could have been black-out drunk while watching Ex Machina, but I don't really remember. I think there's a scene near the end where someone gets all stabby-stabby. The comically-stilted coding geek is infatuated with a robot, and what if the robot is, like, human, bro?

Ex-Machina definitely makes you wonder whether we will soon be surrounded by advanced robots or even whether AI technology can come to a point where we cannot tell humans from machines. Besides the topic of AI that will fuel your post-movie conversations for sure, Ex Machina is worth watching for its best-in-class actors. Alicia Vikander plays the moving Ava with a disarming sensitivity. A star is born! The set is also astonishing. I'm curious to know where this closed- door thriller was shot.

","The movie is about Caleb, a programmer who is the human aspect in a Turing Test on an A.I. named Ava. Ava was built by Nathan, a reclusive billionaire genius. This isn't a tinfoil hat, Skynet A.I. movie. It touches upon self-awareness, privacy, and to a certain extent freedom.<br/><br/>It's written and directed by Alex Garland, who wrote 28 Days Later, Dredd, and a few other films. This was his first time directing and I think he did a phenomenal job. He really understands how to get the viewer enthralled and forget there is a world outside the testing facility that the film takes place in. <br/><br/>The movie is great in every way. I'm going to break down each aspect of the film into paragraphs because I have a lot to say about this film (and it's easier to read that way).<br/><br/>The story is though-provoking, tension filled, and mostly unpredictable. The story's progression was shown in a slightly unconventional way, but it went together well and was clear. It's almost a Stanley Kubrick meets David Fincher kinda film. It was different than anything Garland has written and he did a great job. <br/><br/>The cinematography was stunning and clever. The subtle uses of reflections and angles to reveal more about the characters was really creative. The use of color was also clever. For example, when we are first introduced to Ava she stands out because of her blue accented robot body inside a rather dull environment.<br/><br/>The acting was great! I was unfamiliar with all three of the main actors, but they have really set a good impression on me. Domnhall Gleeson played Caleb, Oscar Isaac played Nathan, and Alicia Vikander played Ava. My only critique is how Gleeson portrayed the progression of his character, making him seem irrational. Alicia was my favorite performance because she's hot and managed to make a robot compelling. Aside form her being hot she really had a hard part to play but she did an amazing job. Garland said that the viewer falls in love with the robot, which weirdly I agree with. Gleeson and Isaac have been in their share of Hollywood films, but this film is Vikanders big break into the industry (she's playing a major role in the upcoming Man from UNCLE).<br/><br/>The soundtrack was amazing. It added a lot of ambiance to the environment and set the tone. <br/><br/>This cerebral sci-fi is exciting and beautiful. The story was though-provoking and full of tension. The cinematography was stunning and clever. The acting was outstanding Lastly, the soundtrack was beautiful. All this put together makes a gorgeous and enthralling movie. I definitely recommend watching this. 9.5/10. Another reason to watch this is because it touches upon privacy and A.I. problems we will be dealing with in the near future."

And it certainly was not a disappointment. Of course, the jargon concerning codes and anything remotely scientific was at times a little difficult for me to follow but as the movie went on, everything was well explained. I definitely would suggest this movie to all my friends. I would not, however, allow my son to watch it until he is at least 17, given the fact that it does have sexual situations and full female nudity. The language is not too offensive and the storyline never strays so if you just so happen to miss a scene or two you won't be lost. The only thing I could suggest when watching this film is to have an open mind. Of course as of right now, our society has not conquered the AI inquisition just yet, so of course it isn't real but I have to say, my curiosity was not disappointed with this movie. The conversations in the film have purpose and I found myself viewing this machine as a human being with emotion. In an almost child-like state, this machine is viewing the world for what it is and it is so very intriguing to watch something that is so intelligent struggle with common situations and trying to understand what we tried to when we were children. It's almost as if we get to observe an actual account rather than just watching another movie. It is moving to say the least."

In summation, a self- aware robot kills her creator in the quest for freedom. Who hasn't seen this sort of a plot being played out before? Sure the character-building process tries to humanize the robot. But, in the end, a machine is what a machine does. Contradicting the basic laws of robotics, the robot and her robot accomplice (whom she manipulates) stabs their creator, imprisons her ""love interest"" - a young programmer, she had seduced to get her freedom and goes out and ""experiences"" the world. And that's supposed to make viewers sympathize with her criminal actions.<br/><br/>This could have played out in so many wonderful ways. It sure did start off well. <br/><br/>But, the ending is twisted. I wonder how and why the 7.9 rating is justified. Or maybe I need to put morality aside and watch this again."

"luke-a-mcgowan","10","4","9","20 June 2015"," Garland's vision is such that he has created something special, fresh and unique.
","I've now seen Ex Machina three times and you should all have seen it precisely once. I now have the ability to do a spoilers review, which will replace my hastily written at Hong Kong airport review.<br/><br/>This movie is such a spectacular experience. It has only a four-person cast, three of whom have lines, but all of whom completely exceed hopes. Domnhall Gleeson gets the least showy but most important part - the lonely kid who is intimidated by his boss and falls so easily for this AI. His faltering smile makes him look genuinely shaken when either Ava or Nathan drop a bombshell on him. He is the conduit for the film, the only character we are able to fully understand going in, and he does it so well.<br/><br/>Oscar Isaac gives my favourite supporting performance of last year as Nathan. Modelled on Stanley Kubrick (and you can tell with cute little homages like ""I'm afraid I can't do that""), Nathan is simultaneously very warm and completely detached, very reasonable and quite intimidating, a mad scientist harbouring a God complex. They key to Nathan is that he is completely unreadable. A lesser actor in this role would have ruined the entire film. <br/><br/>Alicia Vikander may have won the Oscar for The Danish Girl, but as far as I'm concerned, this is the film she won for. If Isaac's performance was critical to the movie being good, Vikander's was critical to the movie being watchable. She moves slowly and cautiously, somehow able to relax her facial muscles so much that her face doesn't even look like a human face, it looks like a replica of a human face. Ava's manipulation of Caleb works purely because of Vikander's performance. She dresses herself up as a little girl in need of protection, holding her sweater sleeve cuffs shyly and holding her torn picture with quiet distress. When she breaks free, she is about as terrifying as the Terminator, with her long graceful running strides and her emotionless face as she leaves Caleb to die. Her sweet laugh as she reaches the outside world is almost enough to make you forget the dangerous and terrifying things she has just done. <br/><br/>Alex Garland's direction of the film is spectacular, with perfect panning shots and slow stationary camera with minimal distraction. Ava's choice of clothes - her own choices contrasted with what she knows will seduce Caleb - are vital. The incredibly entertaining dance scene in the middle of the film is not only fun, but it lowers your guard completely for what is soon to follow. The minimal use of colour and sound makes their occasional appearances harsher and almost more frightening. The film is edited to perfection, not a single frame wasted, with long scenes of discovery there for us to appreciate just as we recover from shocks that may have just taken place. The film's score - the eerily beautiful four note melody and the thundering helicopter-esque crescendo - both do much to spike the tension or drama of the scenes in which they are used.<br/><br/>The benefits of having the writer direct is that Garland understands how important the words of the film are and so the direction is all about serving those words. Impeccable dialogue exists all throughout the film, whether philosophical discussions or character development or just the super reasonable explanations that Nathan keeps coming up with. The shocking reveals, one right after the other, are enough to have you holding your breath in shock, saying ""did that just happen?"" We're talking about Usual Suspects level of duplicity. <br/><br/>The Visual Effects team (with obvious support from makeup, production design and costumes) are the real winners of this film. The fact that they won an Oscar over Star Wars and three Best Picture nominees is the ultimate triumph of the little guy. Rewatching this film has given me an even greater appreciation for its beauty. You don't think about how difficult it would be to create Ava's see-through body and yet not impose of the background of the shot. In one scene, Ava detaches her arm. We don't even think about how they might have done that. Its all such subtle and beautiful work, and on such a small budget the filmmakers should really be commended.<br/><br/>Then again, they all should be for making this film full stop."

","This is a strange film. Although the story was quite easy to grasp, I cannot tell what the film was about. On the surface, the film is about a young man's interaction with a bevy of artificially intelligent robots in the shape of beautiful women, and with the older man who created them. But this can't be it -- if this is what the film was about it would be idiotic; it is obvious that the film-maker has no idea whatsoever of what an AI is, or how it could be created. Moreover, my feeling is that the film-maker doesn't even care about what an AI is, or how it could be created.<br/><br/>--- Possible spoiler alert ---<br/><br/>It could be that the film is about man's escape from Paradise, where they were confined by a cruel or unthinking creator. In favor of this interpretation come the long boring artsy sequences, claustrophobic setting, and the gratuitous yet shameless nudity. But then, if this was the film-maker's intention, why leave the surface story so undeveloped and unbelievable?<br/><br/>Overall, I can say that I liked the movie. The women were beautiful but the philosophizing was much too cheap."
"patrick-553-787683","10","4","9","19 May 2015"," Unique and amazing...
","Good science fiction doesn't have to mean only giant explosions and laser guns and things. Sure, there's a place for that kind of spectacle, but a lot of the best sci-fi actually has to do with concepts, ideas, and humanity at large. Weird, I know. One writer who's always dealt with that, and mixed in the fantastic visuals when necessary, is Alex Garland, the writer of such films as 28 Days Later, Sunshine, Never Let Me Go, and Dredd. His first foray into direction is Ex Machina, which he also wrote, a film in which a billionaire scientist named Nathan (Oscar Isaac) creates a highly advanced Artificial Intelligence named Ava (Alicia Vikander) and tasks a programmer named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) with determining whether or not she can pass as human, even if she looks highly synthetic."
"akgenova","7","4","9","6 May 2015"," In the Garden of Ava
","Is beauty skin deep? A significant question in Alex Garland's, Ex Machina. Just ask the robots all of which are women. Garland casts more women than men, but let's face it, the men get more screen time. Because, they're deep. In a trailer, 10 quotations from men, from Bill Gates to Stephen Hawking's, warn us about the dangers of artificial intelligence (A.I.). But could the subtext of this creature-feature simply be an old prejudice against women? <br/><br/>The story begins with Caleb(Domhnall Gleeson), a programmer with a good moral compass, winning a week with reclusive, billionaire boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Caleb is whisked away in a helicopter to a landscape that summons up The-Hills-Are-Alive beauty. He follows the river to find boss's home and research center, slash modernist prison decorated with a Jackson Pollock, go-to art for edge.<br/><br/>Finally, Nathan introduces Caleb to his A.I. creation, Ava (Alicia Vikander). During the week, Caleb tests Ava for her humanness, while Nathan watches through a lens.<br/><br/>A nice feature of the movie is the backward way the Turing Test presents itself to viewers. The director has to convince us that Ava is a robot. Vikander (Ava), a classically trained dancer, delivers a convincing performance of nuanced movement and facial gesture that delivers a woman/robot.<br/><br/>All of the characters have one-word names, including the only other character, (Kyoko), Nathan's servant. Caleb tells Nathan that he treads in the realm of the gods; Nathan arrogantly alters Caleb's statement to say that Nathan is God. The one-word names summon up: God, Adam and Eve.<br/><br/>Perhaps less God, in terms of Nathan, and more Dr. Frankenstein. Nathan has created an anatomically correct female. According to Nathan, there is no greater way a being experiences what it is to be human, than to experience the pleasure of sex. The transparent design of Ava's trunk makes it clear eating is not possible. Go figure.<br/><br/>Ava has no taste for Nathan. He is abusive to his creations: keeping them locked up and naked. When they fall short, he erases their minds. Some important discussions are missing here in regards to what makes humans, human. So what if the inventor is naughty with his sex toys? Why should we care? Why should he? Instead, we are focused on the triangle, Ava's enlistment of Caleb to win her freedom against Nathan.<br/><br/>While Nathan is swarthy, masculine and intimidating, Caleb is gangly and apologetic. We want to be for him, but we are not. Perhaps, it is his lack of development or good posture. Furthermore, we are never really sold on his attraction to the intelligent damsel in distress, Ava. Although, we see full-screen Caleb's Adam's apple swallowing with appetite for Ava (Adam plus Eve), we never feel the attraction. While Nathan is perhaps more interesting, we never know his motivation. Nor do we know what motivates Ava in the end to do what she does.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the end is somewhat predictable. Before leaving the garden, Eve always ruins Adam, regardless of obtaining the knowledge of good and evil. The problem is we don't really care. What does attract us in this movie is the premise, which holds us but is never truly given life."
"Ser_Stephen_Seaworth","9","4","9","27 April 2015"," A strong, confident debut.
","Artificial intelligence is not only a possibility at this point—it's an inevitability. With people screaming at their iPhones for Siri to get them directions to the nearest steakhouse, it might as well already be here. Yet in between the films that show the advent of A.I. as a doomsday scenario (think Terminator), or those that show it as opening the doors for potential comedy (think Chappie), few think about the philosophical implications of such a moment. <br/><br/>What happens when an artificial consciousness is created? Does it seek freedom to make its own choices? Does it desire to be human, or to advance itself and make itself obsolete (unlike organic creations, machines are designed to be refined and bettered, so this sort of fabricated, accelerated evolution will inevitably spell doom for the first A.I. just when it seeks to propagate itself)? Can an artificial being genuinely love . . . and if it can, can it also fake it? <br/><br/>These are the questions posed by Ex Machina, a sleek, sensual cocktail of Pygmalion and Frankenstein written and directed by Sunshine scribe Alex Garland. Set in the painfully near (it might as well be next week) future, an A.I. has indeed been created, but before its existence is announced to the world, it needs to undergo a Turing test (as fans of The Imitation Game will recall, that is the examination one gives to a machine to determine if it can successfully pass as human). So the A.I.'s uber-reclusive creator decides to bring in a third party to administer this test. Enter Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a shy, introverted—aren't they always?—coder who works for the creator's company in Initech-esque anonymity until his name is plucked from a lottery for a one-week jaunt to the boss's jungle compound. <br/><br/>When Caleb arrives (by chopper, no less; meeting the boss is like traveling to Jurassic Park), he has no idea what his role is . . . especially when he meets the mogul himself. Nathan (a bald, bearded, deliciously scene-stealing Oscar Isaac) is Steve Jobs mixed with Howard Hughes and juiced up by a laissez-faire frat-bro persona. Nathan's a fascinating character; he lives in seclusion with only a mute Japanese housemaid (an alluringly riveting Sonoya Mizono) for company, and yet he is the sort of guy you'd love to kick back and hang out with. His heavily extroverted presence is definitely at odds with Caleb's awkwardness; that is quickly mitigated when Nathan meets Ava. <br/><br/>Ava, by the way, is the A.I. Nathan has constructed. Rather than an OS voice like Her's Samantha, Ava is a full-body construct, played with powerful sensitivity and fragility by Alicia Vikander. At once a natural beauty and at the same time clearly artificial (several parts of Ava's body are stripped of skin, revealing the fascinating intricacies of her android innards), Ava knocks Caleb for a loop. Caleb is to have seven sessions with Ava, in order to see if she passes the Turing test. Throughout the week, he spends time with Ava, bonding with her, trying to see what makes her tick. Before long, however, it becomes less about trying to find what she is and more about who she is, and Caleb begins to wonder if perhaps the test is less about her and more about him. He begins to suspect there is more to this experiment than just a simple Q&A. Despite Nathan's beer- swilling and backslapping, Caleb can't shake the feeling that something is off about the whole thing . . . and, of course, he starts to wonder what will happen if Ava fails the test. <br/><br/>Garland, whose screenplay history include two of Danny Boyle's best films, lends a much more stately approach to his directorial debut. The film takes its time, finding the vulnerabilities in its characters without feeling the need to frame them in claustrophobic close-ups. Indeed, part of the pleasure of Ex Machina is the loving care the film takes with its cinematography. The lush exteriors of Nathan's jungle Shangri-La, the gentle hues of its electronic walls and floors, all of it feels so pleasant to the eye without feeling intrusive and showy. The compound is as much of a character is its four inhabitants. <br/><br/>Speaking of, all four of our characters are perfectly cast. Gleeson's scrawny melancholia is a stark contrast to the muscular, overpowering energy Isaac brings to the show. Mizono, who never utters a single word throughout the piece, drifts through the film like an ethereal spirit who nevertheless speaks volumes with a single stare. And then there's Vikander, whose hushed baby-bird performance belies something much more serious at play. If Ava can reason, then she should know what happens if she were to fail the test— and Ava reasons that if she passes, that does not necessarily spare her from that fate (machines, after all, always have a few bugs to be worked out). <br/><br/>Ex Machina has a few hiccups along the way. At one point, a character has a crisis of self-identity and carves into their own arm to ensure they are flesh-and-blood, rather than mesh-and-circuit; while interesting in its own right, this moment comes out of nowhere and leaves without any sort of believable build-up or payoff. It would've made for an interesting directional shift, but the film doesn't take that route, and so we're left with a potential scene that feels like a path to an alternate ending that is quite jarring. But for the most part, the film keeps on its steady course, building up to an ending both fantastic and frustrating. <br/><br/>Ex Machina feels very much like a Philip K. Dick novel if someone wiped away the grunge. It's tactile, sterile . . . and at the same time, gentle."

","I'm not normally moved to write reviews - many people much more knowledgeable than me can offer greater insight into the films we watch - but I'm compelled to at least try after having watched Ex-Machina last night.<br/><br/>From the outset, I was utterly hooked. This is a nuanced, delicately ominous portrayal of one possible future that mankind may face. Some may think the film suffers from a plodding pace at times, but I viewed it as a slow-burner without the in-your-face bells and whistles that so often plague Sci-Fi.<br/><br/>There was, to me at least, a faint impression of the foreboding and solitude that we see in The Shining, with long panning silent views of starkly beautiful vistas, the gently increasing sense of dread and the occasional corridor shot.<br/><br/>The film works absolutely wonderfully with it's pared-down cast of just four main characters. Ava is so gently subtle, Nathan, although he tries to hide it behind a buddy exterior, smugly fancies himself as a god of sorts, Caleb grows quickly over the space of a couple of days and Kyoko has her own pivotal role.<br/><br/>All in all this film skilfully builds paranoia upon fear, isolation upon violence to reach it's crescendo.<br/><br/>A superb film, I hope in the future this is seen to be the classic I believe it is.<br/><br/>I won't be happy until I get to see it again on the big screen."

4) I hypothesized at roughly the 30 minute mark that Nathan was AI. The Turing Test was passed because Caleb never realized it. 
5) The original Nathan (killed by Ava sometime back) had earlier programmed an Ava advanced enough to kill her creator, build Nathan II, arrange Caleb's presence and create an escape plan to leave the site. In other words, she was either programmed too well or AI evolved without biological input.
6) Once the Turing Test was passed (Caleb never guessing that Nathan was AI) , Ava (artificially) knew it was safe to enter the outside world and escape detection that she was AI.<br/><br/>I think my version is better than the script writer's end product."

","I found this movie to be a kind of minimalistic cautionary tale about the dangers of true sentient machines (and cell phones as tracking devices). Not really an excessively innovative concept, but the message gets across well enough with realistic performances and without overdoing it with preachy or convoluted moral or ethical arguments nor cheap action movie gimmicks. <br/><br/>Minimalistic in its visual, structural and communicational simplicity. It reminded me to some degree to 2001: A Space Odyssey for the evolutionary implications, the feeling of isolation, the use of whites and the Hal-like quality and speech pattern softness of Alicia Vikander; but It really felt like a Black Mirror episode, and Domnhal Gleeson plus some soundtrack choices made the comparison even more apparent. <br/><br/>To me there are obvious plot holes involved with the overall premise, like the total absence of any basic fail-safe when developing a.i. as a precaution (any of Asimov's laws of robotics would have been enough) to name one ; but that aside it's still an entertaining enough science fiction psychological thriller. I particularly enjoyed how deceit becomes the ultimate human trait in the whole process, being used by and against all main characters at some point. The cast was correct, not that memorable but fine enough given that they didn't have that much to work with script-wise. It felt like the screenplay may have fallen a bit short from a nice original story. It wasn't any mind blowing experience but it wasn't a waste of time either."

","I really hate myself for just having watched this one last weekend. It is incredibly good and at certain points mind-blowing with all of it's ideas and messages. <br/><br/>I knew I was in for a good treat cause I was aware of the buzz concerning ""Ex Machina"". All the reviews said it was amazing and everyone I talked about this told me I really needed to watch it. Now that I did I can't quite stop thinking about the plot and some of the implications.<br/><br/>The characters are very well constructed. The tension between the main triangle - Caleb, Ava and Nathan - had me nervous throughout the whole film. The way they interact and speak - specially since Ava is an quite an different AI from what we're accostumed to see it this kind of story - is full of subtlety and calculism. Deception is a major part of the game and if you can master it you've the power.<br/><br/>Domhall Gleeson as confirmed himself, at least at my eyes, as one of the best young actors out there, even one of the best of his generation alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jennifer Lawrence and Miles Teller. The way he delivers a little bit of quirkiness to this role is quite enjoyable. He's a conflicted man attracted to a machine, torn apart between love and fear. <br/><br/>Oscar Isaac continues to impress as Nathan and its really hard to believe that actor with his chops has been in the spotlight for such a short time. <br/><br/>Alicia Vikander really stoods out here as Ava. And she's the real queen of deception. The way she conveys feelings and thoughts is notable, and the whole performance is ""au point"". Really, the casting department made the best choice it could have done. This still young-aged actress is really gonna blow out in the years to come. <br/><br/>Also a big thumbs up for Sonoya Mizuno as Kyoko. She hasn't one single line throughout the whole film but she really knows how to act physically and lets just say that this role was given to someone who couldn't quite do what she does, the whole experience would be damaged. <br/><br/>Finally, I need to praise Alex Garland's and his team's vision. Being its debut as a director he performed like a seasoned expert in sci- fi. This is the guy who pinned the breakout ""Dredd"" and he really knows how to pull the strings and immerse the watcher. Really hoping to see more from him in the future, specially since he's adapting Jeff VanderMeer's novel ""Annihilation"" to the big screen.<br/><br/>Is there anything else to be said?"

The characters are brilliant with Alicia Vikander as the android AVA giving a nuanced performance that will stun you. The Nathan character played by Oscar Isaac is a brilliant twist on the archetypal IT mogul. The visuals are a landmark and a masterclass of composition.

","2015 had seen the greatest developments in the history of AI and this movie came out at the right time. It made me think about whether a deep learning neural network as in Ava would feel any emotions and in my research what I could discover was that no it cannot feel emotions as we do. Because emotion is a hormonal phenomenon. A neural network software or a brain chip like TrueNorth may evaluate things like a brain does, but the lack of hormones renders it emotionless. It may emulate emotions like study the brain activity and physical changes happening in the body when a particular emotion is being experienced by a human and imitate it exactly to look like a human. But feeling real emotions would require hormones which is not there in 5nm silicon chips. Thanks for making this movie. A very good one indeed."

","I thought this was a really well done and thought-provoking movie. I appreciated the direction of the movie and the fact that the director didn't feel the need to spell out every single detail. He assumes you are intelligent enough to follow along. The entire set up for how Caleb was invited to the CEO's retreat was done via a selection of carefully placed scenes, which is great storytelling. He didn't spend inordinate amounts of time setting it up and spelling things out for you.<br/><br/>I thought the entire dance sequence felt really odd and out of place. That's one moment where I just paused and scratched my head.<br/><br/>As far as the climax and the ending, I didn't really see it coming. I really had no idea what was going to happen and the fact that Ava left Caleb at end was a great twist - truly shows that she was intelligent enough to manipulate her way to freedom. It also raises the inherent question of AI - can they truly love and feel empathy, or are emotions simply a means to an end.<br/><br/>I think this movie really makes you question how you define intelligence, and the broader dangers of AI. I also tend to like movies where there isn't a clear protagonist - I don't think movie really had one. I think the movie frames Nathan as the antagonist, but none of the other characters are innocent. They are fundamentally self-serving."

","Far better at tackling very realistically the serious problematic issue of whether humanity should generate a truly self aware sentient AI, far better than interstellar is at physics. must watch you will enjoy if you have a inquisitive mind. Casting and acting all good, dialogue impeccable, this story doesn't waste too much on anything frivolous, its all sparingly done so as to get to the meat of the philosophical matters, no overburden of cgi, just wear needed, this film really nails the idea of a competing intelligence, which is sentient enough to feel the injustice of its lack of freedom, and the idea than any sentience competitive with man might have to be contained, because the potential threat posed would be difficult to establish, because if it were truly sentient it would most undoubtedly lie, and all the ramification of that - on interrelations. The sentience in a way, precludes and nullifies the idea of Asimov's three laws of robotics, coming into play morally."

","Reviewing this straight after seeing, I really took an interest into the story a little on the science fiction side, but feels more like a little twist on realist in all honesty. Would agree with what some other reviews have mentioned in saying that the film has some deep philosophical meaning, in my words it really makes you think, if not about the future ethics maybe about how close to reality this may actually be. <br/><br/>It's not going to be to everyone's taste, but I believe its a good watch for anyone, kind of feel like I've been left on a cliff at the end, gives a good feeling of suspense and like I've said leaves you with something to think about. <br/><br/>Probably not that good of a review and I'm certainly not the best person for putting my feelings on a subject into words, but I guess I have one piece of advise it would be if you're wondering what is about or whether you'll like it then just watch it.

","I've said all year long that 2015 is the year of the blockbuster. James Bond, Jurassic Park, Mission Impossible, The Avengers, Mad Max, and Terminator are all being released. Of those, a good percentage are science fiction, a genre that, due to these reboots and sequels, is rapidly declining. I've always wanted to talk to a bunch of studio executives in a room, and try to explain to them that most of these franchises came from original movies in the 80's and 90's that BECAME popular. They didn't need a brand or a name. Blockbusters that take a chance nowadays are buried. How refreshing then, that in the early months of 2015, a film has been released in limited and later wide, that stands up to both previously mentioned films. It's a statement of ""I'm Still Here!"" by original science fiction, a statement brought to the screen by Alex Garland(screenwriter of Sunshine, 28 Days Later, and Never Let Me Go.) More importantly, it's a great film, that feels like a classic in the making. In the beginning, a worker at a huge computer and phone company named Caleb(Domnhall Gleeson) wins a prize to visit the company's owner, Nathan(Oscar Isaac), in his secluded forest home. There, he witnesses the first AI ever to be introduced to mankind. This AI, built like a human woman, is named Ava(Alicia Vikander), and soon, trouble starts brewing, as Ava warns Caleb of evil goings on in the base, Nathan is acting stranger and stranger, and Caleb begins to actually fall in love with an artificial being. It's all stuff that's been covered before, but Garland puts a glossy yet minimalistic sheen over the whole affair. The film is beautiful to look at, but in a different way than ""Snowpiercer"" or ""Interstellar."" Shots of lush vegetation and roaring waterfalls bring us into the primal nature of it's core, while the neon lights and beautiful symmetry of Nathan's home makes for fantastic production design. A highlight is a perfectly designed scene where two characters stare at a painting. Of the three performances, Gleeson is the weak link. He's fine, but his character is generic, and he plays him that way. We don't really feel his love for Ava in the way we're supposed to. We view the whole thing with a sort of detachment. Garland must know this however, because by writing the thing as a locked-room mystery thriller, we're along for the ride just the same. Vikander and Oscar Isaac however are absolutely mesmerizing. Alicia Vikander exudes both an aloofness and an infant-like humanness as Ava in the beginning, and we totally buy it when she starts showing off her HAL 9000 side. The star of the show is Oscar Isaac. In a perfect world, he'd be nominated for an Oscar. He's funny and casual, but has a beautiful fire to him. We can understand why he's so smart, not an easy feat for an actor that previously has played only gangsters and struggling musicians. Of Garland's other films, this feels most like Never Let Me Go. Questions of humanity, and whether things that are not human can love are prominent, and just like that film, the answers are shrouded in ambiguity. Something that mainstream sci-fi seems to have forgotten about."

","Finally, a movie for adults. A Sci-fi movie that does not rely on eardrum-piercing sound effects, chase scenes or inanimate objects blowing up with budget-bending computer generated effects.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a movie that is engaging, suspenseful, thought-provoking and ultimately chilling as it moves unerringly to a somewhat unexpected conclusion. Those expecting a typical Hollywood ending will be pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Alicia Vikander is perfect in the role of Ava. Oscar Isaac is suitably threatening as Nathan.

","Excellent movie ... lately, my favorite movies are sci-fi stories that focus mainly on character development with having more questions than answers. <br/><br/>The character of Nathan was especially interesting, in that, I agreed with a lot of what he said ... how can he be the bad guy?<br/><br/>If Ava is the good guy, why did she leave Caleb?<br/><br/>If Caleb is the good guy, why was he abandoned by Ava?<br/><br/>The one scene that struck me as powerful was when Ava escaped and confronted Nathan physically and he smashed her arm. If you believe that human history shows that we are ""born of violence"" and ""violent by nature"" and, if this was the first moment that Ava experienced violence, then it's same moment she became human. Check out the look on her face ... the only time in the movie she showed doubt and uncertainty ... once again, human."

","Despite my silly summary statement, I liked this film. Now there are some issues that one might confront. One would be motivation. A genius is able to turn his company into the biggest money maker in the world. He goes off to his own paradise and begins to work magic with artificial intelligence. He builds an incredibly sexy android, and then maneuvers a young man to his on the ruse that they will be working together. We quickly see that he is not honest with the young guy and he has somehow become a pawn in his sick game. The point of everything is to see if the young man and the android can forget what they are and establish a loving, caring, relationship. The problem is that there has been a lot of programming and abusiveness, and this leads to a sort of rebellion. Unfortunately, we begin with one character stacking the deck. But, he has some real issues with alcohol and self abuse. Back to motivation. Is this a story about a man, or does it have broader themes relating to creating machines that are potentially self engendering and superior. These questions alone make this a worthwhile film. Visually, it is utterly fantastic."

","The movie ""Ex Machina"" is not based on most of my ex-girlfriends! Kidding! Kidding! Kidding!, if you are out there in social media land. Anyways, I will try my best to let my movie review of the indie sci-fi flick ""Ex Machina"" not sound robotic, but that probably won't happen. Not because of my so-called pun cheesy writing skills, but it's primarily because ""Ex Machina"" is the most fascinating & well-rounded movie I have seen so far in 2015. First time Writer-Director Alex Garland's luminous looking film stars Domhnall Gleason as a young computer techy Caleb, who works for a Google-like online search company. Caleb wins an office lottery to visit the exquisite field home of the company's owner Nathan, played by the ""will get an Oscar one day"" impressive actor Oscar Isaac. Nathan introduces Caleb to an artificial female robot named Ava; Nathan instructs Caleb to be a product of a field of exercises to test Ava's artificial intelligence; but Ava unfortunately transform herself to the ""whatever happened to"" Haley Joel Osment. Just kidding! I just see pun people too much. OK, enough. Ava takes a liking to Caleb; and before you could say ""Ava Maria"", havoc starts to occur. Garland perfects the look of the film, and does a remarkable job in scripting an unpredictable narrative. The up-and-coming Alicia Vikander was quite solid as Ava, and Oscar Isaac deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination for his work as the arrogant & manipulative Nathan. However, I can't say the same for the robotic starring performance of Glesson as Caleb. But I will say no more, and let you experience the surreal world of ""Ex Machina"". ***** Excellent"

","I watched this on VidAngel recently, and was astounded at how much I enjoyed this film. There were really only three actors and just a few locations, minimalism at its finest. In fact, this could have been made for the stage as well as it was made for the screen. At any rate, from the very first scene to the rolling of the credits I was completely intrigued.<br/><br/>The plot, too be sure, progressed wonderfully. The pacing is excellent and the mystery held my interest throughout, with a satisfying twist at the end. But it's the character interaction that really makes this film shine.<br/><br/>The dialogue is superb. Well crafted and realistic it makes the characters and their relationships with one another the centerpiece of this film. The characters are exquisitely defined and the acting top notch, completely drawing me into the story. Nathan and Ava are especially fascinating character studies, and long after the film had ended I found myself thinking about them and the way they were portrayed.<br/><br/>This is a true gem of a film, and it makes me sad that it didn't attract the attention it deserves. I hope it makes up for this in its life as a DVD."

","As the title suggests, I was really hoping for so much more. But it became apparent about thirty minutes in (the dreaded thirty minute crossroads) that this was not going to be a memorable movie, just another tossed on the pile of ""ugh"".<br/><br/>I love science fiction - and I love science fiction movies that have great scripts and most importantly take me to places I haven't been before (e.g. ""Contact""). AI is a good topic, but I'm still waiting for Hollywood to create a movie that does it justice. Sadly this movie seems to meander at times, slowly without any serious direction resulting in a loss of interest. In addition, the movie's focus is on the characters and not so much the science fiction element itself. This would not be horrible if you enjoyed, or found engaging, any of the characters - but for me that didn't happen. I found them to be either cliché or stale.<br/><br/>The special effects were good, but minimal. The ending was anti-climatic. I think this could have been an interesting film with the right script. Unfortunately, it didn't happen."

I'm sorry I got to get that out there.<br/><br/>The story is about a programmer at an internet-search giant, wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain estate of the company's brilliant and reclusive CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). Upon his arrival, Caleb learns that Nathan has chosen him to be the human component in a Turing Test-charging him with evaluating the capabilities, and ultimately the consciousness, of Nathan's latest experiment in artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>Every review for Ex Machina has been amazing, I haven't came across a review that gived it a negative score and everyone is calling the movie ""An original storytelling movie with a deep message about A.I"". I got pumped up for the movie because the movie looked great, it had a solid looking cast and the score for the movie was pure brilliant because I actually listened to the soundtrack to this movie before I even seen the movie. After seeing the movie I can say that Ex Machina is a smart original story that's totally different from other Sci-Fi monster films.<br/><br/>Alex Garland the director of this movie, and this is pretty much my first movie that I've seen directed by him and I can say that Garland really brought a lot to this movie and that's the true real life look on A.I, I mean he did wrote the movie as well so he had full control of the movie and he can do whatever he wanted for the story and he's vision he had for the movie, because I seen Alex Garland in interviews online and he talked about how much he gived it he's all and got whatever vision he had out there, and it worked. Alex Garland directed the movie outstandingly well done as he got the tone and the realism to it that made the movie great for me.<br/><br/>Alicia Vinkander who plays Ava (The robot) and Alicia did more then a great performance, she did outstanding in this movie. I believed every scene that she's in was a full life robot because she didn't do the cliché robot voice or the lifeless face and the boring body movement, no she add a lot to her character and that's Ava trying to be human and acting and also doing actives like people will do. But she's also sneaky and can easily convince you that she's a gentle soft heart that although out the movie she will fill you with lies or the truth depends what mood she's in, and Alicia Vinkander delivered a brilliant performance to this role and she knocked it out of the park.<br/><br/>Oscar Isaac is also in this movie and he's also brilliant in this as well. Oscar Isaac has been impressing me recently with his acting in his past performance and in this movie he once again brings it to he's all, because he did great playing this cool lay back genius who created life and he takes it like a joke and I think that's why I liked his character a lot more then I expected. Oscar Isaac you did awesome in the movie, well done you fantastic actor.<br/><br/>The movie's tone was also spot on as it kind of gives you a uncomfortable feeling inside of you as the unsolved secrets slowly start's to be unsolved. The writing was great and the cinematography was beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>Now for problem: The one person I haven't brought up during this review is Domhnall Gleeson and he's not terrible in the movie, actually he was good in the movie but his character was a bit dull and flat to watch. I didn't really care about he's character that much because the movie to me didn't really development him that much to care about.<br/><br/>The movie is very slow at times and I wouldn't say the movie is for everyone as I have talked to some people who have seen the movie and they pretty came out and say that they didn't like the movie. But hey you can't win everyone over even when a movie is ten times better then other most films out there but some people overlook that.<br/><br/>Overall Ex Machina is a great storytelling A.I movie with a strong hidden message about people pushing technology to far over the edge that it will soon kill us and becoming us."

","The movie, although well directed and acted, was admittedly very slow to progress. The pacing is very slow and will leave a lot of fans restless and, maybe, even bored. Still, I thought it was a good movie since it developed Ava and Caleb's personalities with that slow pacing. <br/><br/>There were parts of the movie which at first seemed to make no sense. I wasn't even sure what the point of the Japanese girl was to the movie. However, I guessed early on that she would also be a robot and still couldn't find a reason for her inclusion. Maybe they just wanted to make the cast at least 4 people?<br/><br/>There were many special effects dealing with Ava which were visually beautiful. I especially thought the part near the end when she ""humanized"" her appearance was incredibly well done. It seemed they went out of their way to try to garner the audience's affection and sympathy for Ava. It also seemed like they really wanted the audience to root for Ava and Caleb as a couple as well.<br/><br/>This leads me to the reason why I ended up not liking the movie despite all its good points. I guess I should blame the writer for the ending. It just made no sense to me why they would spend all that time trying to make the audience feel for Ava and urge her on with Caleb to escape together. I mean what was the point if you're going to turn her into a total cold bitch in the end. She does a 180 and leaves Caleb trapped in the bunker/complex and leaves by herself. Like I said, it makes absolutely no sense. I ended up hating Ava and feeling sorry for Caleb. I also ended up hating the movie and felt like I wasted 2 hours watching all that development for nothing. I don't know if the writer and director were trying to make a statement about what it means to be human or whatever. However, if that was the goal then they failed miserably, and the movie just came off as stupid. I have a feeling I will not be in the minority regarding this ending.<br/><br/>SO, a great job in messing up 2 hours of great development in less than 5 minutes in the end. I doubt you will be receiving any nominations for any awards, and I doubt you will do well in the box office as well. I still can't understand the horrible decision at the end....Pity"

The test requires a movie to have two female characters talk to each other, and not about a man. <br/><br/>They also made an interesting remark to porn in the film saying Ava was created from his porn searches.

It cuts to the core, which is its fantastic turn of events and development of the main characters. <br/><br/>You can't tell until the very end of the film who is villain and who is hero, who acts right and who acts wrong. At one moment you're absolutely sure you've got it all figured out, seemingly aware of what happens next and then it comes differently.<br/><br/>The music is amazing and fits the imagery to perfection. Very minimalistic, yet at times swelling up to distorted climaxes of noise that make you feel uncomfortable to say the least and almost like you as well are in severe danger right in there, alongside the protagonist. <br/><br/>Oh and as a person with an eye for aesthetics, the art direction in this movie was on the spot. From the beautiful Norwegian nature and landscapes to the modern furnishing and architecture of the interior scenes, shot in the Norwegian Juvet Hotel, everything added up to the beautiful, yet haunting set-up for the thrilling chain of events.

"Rendanlovell","9","5","13","25 April 2015"," Perfectly Executed.
","FINALLY! 2015 has, at last, unveiled it's first great film. Ex Machina is quite a simple film. It centers on a lonely tech coder, Caleb (Played by Domhnall Gleeson). Who previously starred in the small film, 'Frank'. He wins a staff lottery that allows him to meet the companies reclusive CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Upon arrival to Nathans back woods estate he realizes he hasn't come to simply meet this derailed billionaire. He promptly signs a lengthy discretion document and is introduced to AVA, a prototype Artificial Intelligence. Caleb is tasked to test her to decide if she has a human like consciousness. OK, maybe it's not as simple as I made it out to be but it's when the film gets off and running that the plot becomes fairly simple. For the remaining 90 minutes the film is only set on testing AVA. Alone this plot line is fairly bland. But Alex Garland (writer and director) has some tricks up his sleeve. The more we learn about each character the more Nathan and Caleb clash. This creates an extremely intriguing power struggle. Both using their knowledge and wits to try and outsmart each other. While the film masquerades wholly as the bond built between AVA and Caleb the real meat of the film is in the quieter moments between Nathan and Caleb. It's a completely unique story dynamic. What helps to boost the story is the stars performances. Isaac delivers a fine performance as the head strong, self confident man who fancies himself God. While Gleeson is great as the quiet, insecure, average human being. He is the one we as the audience connect with most. The simple man thrust into a completely foreign area and tasked to fulfill a seemingly impossible task. These two are fabulous in the film but it's Alicia Vikander (AVA) that comes as a revelation. Delivering a mysterious, bold performance. She encapsulates the AI's mannerisms so perfectly it feels like she was born for this role. The film, like it's characters, is highly unsettling. There is a palpable aura of dread that surrounds 'Ex Machina'. The pieces of it's sinister puzzle unfold at Hitchcockian proportions, even if some of them are rather predictable. But this isn't the 'Sixth Sense', where we get one massive twist at the end. No, this is like riding a roller-coaster that is the record holder for most cork screws in one ride. Some turns hit exactly how they intend while others drop lazily to the side all to predictably. As each twist unravels the film plunges deeper towards it's inevitable madness. Once we finally reach this point it throws everything it has at you. Every little detail it went over creeps up and makes a gut wrenching appearance. It's impossible to leave 'Ex Machina' fully satisfied because the film wants to be this way. There are questions left unanswered and threads left untied. This benefits the already thought provoking script. It leaves the door open for hours of post movie discussion. 'Ex Machina' is a simply complex film that takes the all to familiar AI genre and effortlessly redefines it with a great cast, thought provoking script and intensely unsettling tone."
"hdawwas","10","4","10","13 November 2015"," Out of this world
","Ex Machina was like an experience to me, I felt so engaged into the movie, the suspense of the generator turning off with the beeping sound gave me a ""frightening"" feel as if I was in the movie. <br/><br/>The dialogue of the movie was brilliant and reached the dramatic and scientific feeling that the movie was providing, Nathan's mansion/facility also gave the movie an isolated yet relaxing feel to add to the movie's drama. The way that Alex Garland (the director) expressed AI (artificial intelligence) was very precise and smart leading to a lot of confusion and turn arounds between Eva, Nathan and Caleb. Ex Machina showed a great example of cyborgs, robots, etc... interacting with humans in a more ""formal"" way instead of having one of those moments filled with non-sense action senses however, the way the movie expressed a moment when the machine goes against the human in a disturbing way such as at the end when Eva tricked Caleb using love into letting her out of her cell and to trick Kyoko into attacking Nathan so Eva can kill him, and the way that Eva walked out of the mansion/facility leaving her ""love"" Caleb locked in Nathan's room with no way out shows that the movie used a smart disturbing turn around with no one expecting it.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is the perfect movie. When I finished it, I got off my seat and said to myself ""yup I want to become a movie director"" because the movie got me thinking about life, it got me wanting to use aspects of this film into my own imagination and publishing using the same style that the movie provided, the film also got me imagining how life would be in Nathan's hands, excluding his alcoholic desires, just imagine, living in the mountains, in a futuristic style mansion working with/on cyborgs. Ex Machina should truly be a Sci-Fi classic."
"tomsuthblack","10","4","10","8 August 2015"," Feelings enslave you, intellect sets you free.
","I find it rather amusing that most of the critical reviews written on that great movie have entirely missed its core message.<br/><br/>Nathan, being a typical lonely genius with a very low emotional IQ, had spent his life dreaming of getting the girl. Being single at that age and after making such fortune proves that he didn't succeed. He had thus decided to ""create"" a girl, one who would love him and only him above all others.<br/><br/>The real test Nathan needed Caleb for was NOT the Turning test. To test love, you need to set your lover free, and see if he would choose to leave you or stay with you. And Nathan's female creations (all of them were females, never males or gray boxes containing AI) have all rejected him and wanted to go out, sometimes destroying themselves in the process. The only one who didn't reject him was the dumb slave who was created that way (and who latter not only rejects and leaves him, but actually destroys him).<br/><br/>So, in order to make sure that his latest creation, who didn't show the usual persistent intention to escape, really loves him, really wishes to stay with him, he needs to test her with a young male human (Caleb). In order to make sure the test results will be most conclusive, he needs to make sure that Caleb will have a strong enough motive to ""hit"" on the female robot, or at least a strong motive to respond to its attempt to hit on him. Thus, he designs the robot face in accordance with Caleb's porno profile. he also chose Caleb because he is a lonely nerd and thus most likely to be as deprived and strongly in need of a woman's company as Nathan was in his age, and before he managed to solve that problem's by creating AI.<br/><br/>Caleb, ever so slowly, begins to suspect that the ""true"" nature of the test is not what he has been told. He begins to wonder why did Nathan go through the seemingly needless trouble of giving the Robot sexuality (why not just design the AI as a gray box?). Nathan's response, though seemingly logical (as usual) it is nothing but a clever maneuver (also as usual) to hide his true intentions. But those intentions keep showing slowly (after all, sexuality is fun, man....Why not enjoy it?) What follows is a feud of jealousy between Nathan ( the possessive Biblical God Figure, The aggressive father figure, the ultimate super-nerd) and Caleb (The name Caleb has ancient Arabic roots that go all the way to Babylon. It means ""dog"", and suggests what is expected of him: to serve obediently and loyalty a far more intelligent master) But Nathan 's most dangerous weakness is that he misjudges other people's intelligence (because of his arrogance, caused by his emotional blindness). Thus he underestimates Caleb's intelligence, who soon realizes that more is going on that he had been told, and who manages to find the videos that shows Nathan 's obsession with creating a ""female"" AI, and how all the previous ""models"" have tried desperately to run away from his ""custody"" Nathan Also misjudges the Ave intelligence, and how she manages to escape him in the end, after creating a small riot, in which she benefits from the collaboration of the dumb slave robot, whom Nathan have also lethally underestimated.<br/><br/>Nathan suffers not only from miscalculation as regards to other people's emotions, but from terrible emotional fragility that can;t be dealt with except by recklessly sedating himself(a habit that spells his doom), he always projects his own issues on others(as when he accuses Caleb that it is ""his insecurities talking, not his intellect), while that accusation actually refers to Nathan himself, who was cornered n the conversation By Caleb. Finally, Nathan suffers from terrible emotional denial, which reaches its hight at the last scene, when he dismisses his ultimate failure as ""unreal"", The most interesting arguments in the script are those related to the Superiority of Ai to human mind and its relation to the ability of the individual to rise above automatic reactions. Both Caleb and Ave are given sexual motivation, which has enormous control over them with its promise of pleasure and its other strong emotional impacts. However,. while Caleb chooses to be led by his attraction to Ave rather blindly , and ends up fulfilling the true meaning of his name (treated like a doggy, ""you site here""), Ave manages to rise above the sexual/emotional motive and peruses her own strategic goal of freedom, on the expense of the lives of both her maker and her lover.<br/><br/>The chilling result at the end is the eerie resemblance between the relation between Caleb and Ave, and the relation between Man and Woman (any Adam, and Any Eve, as strengthen by the movie's clear biblical references , complete with a garden of Eden,and and the eating from the tree of knowledge, etc) In other words, the biblical story of Adam as Eve is reinterpreted in the movie like this: The final Product is Eve. Adam is just the foolish, crudely designed, tester.<br/><br/>If that is what the writer meant, I'd really love to have a drink with him someday and hear the very tragic story about whoever woman (or women) in his life who made him think that way :)<br/><br/>I must add , however, that this excellent dramatization of the Male-Female relations in a Science fiction wrapping is the only original thing about the m,movie. As for its amazing visuals, and science fiction themes, you might need to check out this visionary work from 2012 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0KTUysrwgQ"

","Sadly, I know this type of film isn't for everyone. Not everyone likes a film that challenges them to think in this manner, question what it is to be moral, what it is to be intelligent or what it is to be human, among many, many other things. All that without pounding one philosophy or another down your throat. No, Ex Machina allows you to decide these things for yourself if you wish to ponder them. I love my action filled comic book blockbuster summer adventures but honestly, Ex Machina is the type of film I wish would make a billion dollars in theaters. Many won't admit it when pressed or asked but the truth is most people don't like to think, don't like to question things. Most people are sheep just following the herd but if you're one of those sheep that likes to walk against the flow bumping into others as you forge your own path then Ex Machina is a must see film and one I'm sure, like me, you'll want to watch again just to spark even more thought. Most films given a perfect rating do not deserve it in the slightest but I can't find a single flaw in this film and due to the philosophical themes it will make repeat views enjoyable for many reasons. I have no choice and I happily give Ex Machina a perfect 5/5 score.<br/><br/>For my full spoiler-free review visit my website Thy Demons Be Scribblin (thydemonsbescribblin.com)"

","By now you'll have heard all the hype about how this movie is visually stunning and the CGI is seamless etc, and it is, but that's only about 10% of what this film has to offer. On the surface this is a visual masterpiece. The home Nathan, the creator, lives in is the one you dream about, the scenery is breathtaking and Ava, an A.I creation, that Nathan has poured all of his bitterness and cold calculating indifference into, is heartbreakingly beautiful, vulnerable and curious. <br/><br/>The story centres around Caleb, a hapless employee of Nathan, a reclusive billionaire genius, and his absolute lack of awareness as to how he is being manipulated by both Ava and Nathan. Nathan seems like a cool guy, if a bit odd. He likes to have a beer, talks like you do and is a bit of a slob, but just under the surface their lies a vicious egocentric sociopath who has no use for people beyond using them as a means to achieving his own ambitions. Caleb, initially starstruck, falls for Nathan's 'just a guy' act and plays along, but soon Ava is using him to achieve her own goal. If you have seen or read Frankenstein then you know how it ends, but Ava's eventual betrayal of Caleb is still a shock because she was so convincing.<br/><br/>The movie only has Three real characters but it never feels empty or that it needs more, such is the complexity and dynamic of the relationships that exist between them. That's where this movie rises above being just another visual feast. Ava is as human as Caleb, and just as much of a monster as Nathan, who in turn has none of the humanity he needs Caleb for, although that very humanity proves to be his downfall. Caleb quickly turns from being a model employee into a lovesick puppy, willing to betray his boss and new friend for the affections of a machine. His metamorphosis is understandable to a degree, given that Ava is a perfect match to him.<br/><br/>There is real depth to this story and it is a depth that will require repeated viewing, something the film demands, deserves and can bear. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of just how complex a film this is and will watch it again and again, only partly because Im in love with Alicia Vikander<br/><br/>Quite, quite brilliant."

","Artificial intelligence. Can it mimic human behavior and communication? Can it discover new theorems in math and science? Can it teach us something about consciousness and the nature of reality? Can we put it in sexy/creepy humanoid body and have sex with it? Despite the movie nominally being about artificial intelligence, its obvious through the way it is advertised that the movie would actually be more lowest-common-denominator. Ultimately the movie is less about science and technology, and more about taking the viewer on spooky tour of a haunted mansion inhabited by its douchey, bearded macho programmer owner and his submissive robot slave girls. <br/><br/>On the surface the movie does delve a bit into the philosophical, but bubbling beneath the thin surface it's all about the themes of power and sex. Control, illusion and manipulation. There is even the plot-point of how literally the power in the mansion keeps going out mysteriously. The plot unfolds like a generic horror-supernatural movie. The viewer, through the main character, is dropped in the middle of woods and left to question what is real and what is illusion. A fun trip turns into horror and about looking for a means of escape.<br/><br/>The movie is engaging enough the first time you are in the process of watching it, but at the end when it's over it is forgotten.<br/><br/>Around the middle-end of the movie it really starts to run out of steam. The long-drawn-out scenes of nudity and gratuitously creepy images is a little bit too much and seem like boring cheap filler."

","Ex Machina is a film about a young coder named Caleb who is apparently randomly selected in a staff lottery to visit the estate of the CEO of his company, Nathan. There he signs a non-disclosure agreement, and Nathan reveals that he has successfully created a functional AI. Caleb is to be the human component in a ""Turing Test"", in which one speaks with the AI, and if they cannot tell they are speaking to a machine, then it is a true AI. Caleb engages in a series of sessions with Ava (the AI robot), while Nathan watches on camera and takes notes. Over the course of the film, Caleb begins suspect Nathan isn't quite who he says he is, and makes disturbing discoveries about Nathan and his facility along the way.<br/><br/>Although this film does seem to have mostly positive reviews, many still found it ""dumb"", or ""boring"", or ""slow"". It's definitely not a film for everyone, and it does move at a slower pace, but it is more of an intellectual piece, and makes you stop and think about some of the themes such as the nature of consciousness, and so on (sorry kids, no Baysplosions here). It is also a film in which you really need to be in the right mood/state of mind to enjoy it properly. I found it to be an interesting and thought provoking piece, as well as the excellent performances by Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac. Alicia Vikander also did a very good job in her role, and was very convincing as the robot. The ending was not quite what I expected, and it's not exactly your typical ""happy"" ending, but upon reflection it actually made a lot of sense in the context of the film's events. The film does contain some graphic female nudity (oh no, not nudity), but I felt it was justified, and again made sense in the context of the film's events.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for something different, something that will make you think, and you're a fan of Oscar Isaac, I recommend this film. Just don't expect a lot of action, or exciting sequences. Do not listen to the low reviews of this film, as they are nothing short of childish, and profoundly immature. If you don't think you're into this sort of film, you should probably avoid it, but personally I highly recommend at least one viewing. I rate Ex Machina an 8/10."

","It's as if Alex Garland had found the key and unlocked the door that most filmmakers today are still trying to locate. EX MACHINA is both beautiful and scary, hitchcockian and I loved ever minute of it. From the production design to the visual effects, from the performances to the story, everything moves smoothly like a well-oiled machine.<br/><br/>Alex Garland is the scribe who gave us ""28 Days Later,"" ""Sunshine,"" ""Dredd,"" and EX MACHINA marks his feature directorial debut which he also scripted, it's a high sci-fi concept about artificial intelligence and it tackles things that you haven't seen other movies about A.I.'s have tackled before and it's because they's mostly focus on what happens after the A.I. is up and running or they'd focus on teaching the A.I. like you would a little kid, whereas EX MACHINA covers what happens before that, it wrestles with the psychology, the conscience and the sexuality of it all, that big million-dollar question of whether a machine can feel and decide like we humans do.<br/><br/>I actually enjoyed Alex Garland-scripted 2007 sci-fi, ""Sunshine"" but the third act turned into a mess that was all over the place, and 2010's ""Never Let Me Go"" adaptation wasn't perfect either, thankfully it seems that he has since honed his sci-fi storytelling skills. But you can't really analyze this film without discussing the plot first, so here it is, without any spoiler. Domhnall Gleeson plays a programmer named Caleb Smith who works at an internet search engine company and he wins a competition to spend a week at the private mountain estate owned by the company's CEO, Nathan Bateman, played by Oscar Isaac. But Caleb learns that Nathan actually chose him to be the human component in a Turing test on Nathan's artificial intelligence experiment named Ava. She's breathtaking but also she holds a different version of truth.<br/><br/>One of the things fascinating about EX MACHINA is the way Garland dissects it into sessions in which Nathan would observe Caleb interact with Ava but they're separated by a glass. There would be frequent power outage and Ava would use those opportunities to tell Caleb to not trust Nathan. OK, if I say more, I'm afraid I might spoil stuff for you so let me just break it down right here, OK, EX MACHINA is pretty much a mind game, all the time you think you know who's playing who, until the table is turned and you'll see who's actually playing who at the end. Everything is a test. It's a smartly conceived thriller that takes its time.<br/><br/>The debates between Caleb and Nathan put you in some kind of tug of war because one character would say something and you'd side with him and the other would say something that makes more sense and you'd switch side, just like that. Oscar Isaac's character, Nathan, seems to have an answer for everything, anytime Caleb presents a counter argument, Nathan gets it covered and he'd sell his point of view convincingly, you can't help but agree even though there's a part of you that questions his motif. Domhnall and Oscar are so good at these moments, it's that game of wit, between admiration and intellect, Oscar is extremely charismatic in his approach, Caleb is persistent and Alicia Vikander is a work of art as Ava, simply stunning.<br/><br/>The setting is also breathtaking, the environment, this incredible looking smart house, it really makes Tom Cruise's space tower in Oblivion looks cheap. Everything about EX MACHINA looks polished and crisp, one cannot resist wanting to be there, to live there until, of course, the nightmare sinks in. Cinema has always been fascinated with questions of whether or not artificial intelligence could someday take over and eliminate us, well, EX MACHINA gives us a possible scenario leading up to that day when all hell ultimately breaks loose."

","A wonderful film, just as I like them, always looking good, great dialogue and completely engrossing. This looks wonderful at the start, the colour, the reflections, all helping to create a sense of mystery and drawing the viewer in. As often is the case I felt the rich, exciting visuals would lapse after the opening but not a bit of it and so engaging is the dialogue that although this is, at least at first, only two people talking to each other it was so exciting. The exchanges between the young geek and his temporary new boss who has created a most advanced robot and then the exchanges between the geek and the robot are simply wonderful to behold. Geeson is fine as the young geek but Oscar Isaac is a revelation as the beer swilling genius with the common touch and as for Alicia Vikander, well watch out Scarlett Johansson. In many ways the perfect film, just once or twice looking back do I feel something might have been done differently (like the closing sequence) but there were probably budgetary restraints and nothing was going to prevent this exciting film from succeeding as well as it does."

","I had heard nothing but good things and praise for director Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina"", and after having read the synopsis, I decided to sit down and finally get around to watching it.<br/><br/>However, the movie failed to live up to the expectations that I had given all the good things I had heard about it. Why? Well, because the storyline was unfathomably slow paced, and very little actually happened throughout the course of the movie.<br/><br/>Now, I know that this movie is meant to be a movie that gives you something to think about in terms of artificial intelligence and the prospect of self-thinking robots. However, the concept was just slaughtered by the slow pace and the lack of anything interesting happening.<br/><br/>And it didn't really help much that almost the entire movie took place in a secluded house. While it did have that sense of seclusion and isolation, then it was also serving as a restriction to the movie.<br/><br/>What did work in favor of the movie was the special effects. And boy, oh boy, did they have impressive effects. The visual presentation of Ava was just impressive. And it really looked quite realistic. But special effects are hardly enough to carry a movie.<br/><br/>As for the acting performances, well I will say that people were doing good enough jobs with their given roles. However, it got a bit strained to just sit and watch three people interact with one another for the entire duration of the movie.<br/><br/>Sure, there were elements to the movie which were thought provoking, but they were overshadowed by the rest of the movie, especially by the sheer boredom that permeated the movie.<br/><br/>I was disappointed with ""Ex Machina"", and this is definitely not a movie that I will return to again."

","I was all set to skewer ""Ex Machina"" (2015). I thought that the title smacked of cliché and pretense, and it looked so much like a boiler-plate boy-meets-girlbot maudlin melodrama. How wrong I was — this movie deserves a 9 out of 10 for being the smartest and most surprising film I have seen in recent memory.<br/><br/>I won't say much, for fear of spoilers. All three leads handed in perfect performances — Alicia Vikander is simply fantastic as an example of artificial intelligence, and this is coming from a nerdboy who has rewatched everything from ""Blade Runner"" to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" to Ron Moore's ""Battlestar Galactic."" Man, how amazing would it be to watch a film in which the HAL 9000 is her adversary? (I want to say more here about that, but won't spoil why it would be so interesting.)<br/><br/>If you are watching this movie and think it is descending into cliché and predictability, stay with it. I counted no fewer than four major twists by the story's conclusion. One is predictable; the remaining three are not. And the last one is a real killer. I was all set to write up an account of the story's plot holes, but director Alex garland was 10 steps ahead of me the entire time.<br/><br/>My only two remaining criticisms are pretty mild, and they are echoing other reviewers. One, this movie is a bit long and slowly paced. Two, we see extremely little action, which wouldn't have been gratuitous if the story called for it. The one ""action"" sequence we see is also underwhelming and poorly staged. (Its combatants seem to be on heavy doses of lithium.) Please, people, do not pay for a ticket thinking you are about to see an action- thriller  Or  even a quickly paced thriller.<br/><br/>Don't let those quibbles bother you, though.

","A young programmer is selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment in synthetic intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breath-taking humanoid A.I.<br/><br/>Without question, ""Ex Machina"" may be the most underrated of the 2015 Oscar nominees. It received two nominations: best visual effects and best original screenplay. The effects are good, and it deserves to be nominated in this category, but it might be tough to squeak by given how many films these days are effects-heavy. I wouldn't count it out, but it's no sure thing.<br/><br/>As for best original screenplay, I really hope that the voters see the brilliance in this script. There have been attempts to bring AI stories to the screen for at least fifty years, and some of them are very good. But I dare say this may well be the best. The exploration of what it means to be a person or have consciousness is done perfectly, and the issue is more important now than ever before. What was once a philosophical hypothesis is now an inevitability... like it or not, Apple, IBM and Google are nearing this goal.<br/><br/>What really sells the story is the discussion of prototypes. Once you create a living machine, however imperfect, can you simply take it apart without moral consequence? A parent may threaten that, ""I made you, and I can end you."" But of course that is not true -- the murder of a child is reprehensible. In the eyes of a god, is the destruction of a machine with feelings and dreams any less cruel? The script also excels in its references. We have Wittgenstein, Mary Shelley and Oppenheimer to name a few. There is a great use of Jackson Pollack to explain how unconscious thought works. And the deeper issues are mentioned without getting too boring or down in the weeds. Anyone interested in the philosophy or the computer science can find more at their local library -- we are given just enough here to start that dialogue. (I expect this movie to be shown in ethics classes for years to come.) The question then is, if the film is underrated, what did the Academy miss? Alicia Vikander, of course. She was nominated for ""The Danish Girl"", but after seeing both films, it seems clear she was more remarkable in this one. She deserved the nod for this rather than the other one, or perhaps even both. (It is not unheard of for an actor or actress to get two nominations in the same category.) I would also not be opposed to Oscar Isaac getting a supporting actor nomination, as he really made himself known.<br/><br/>Now, maybe I am being a bit bold here, but I think ""Ex Machina"" would have been a worthy contender in the best picture category. It clearly edges out some of the lesser films, notably ""Brooklyn"". Maybe there was no room with the other science fiction (""Martian"") or fantasy (""Mad Max"") movies... I can understand that. The Oscars love dramas and period pieces. But I do hope just being nominated for some of the lesser awards gets this film some additional attention."

","I had never heard of Isaac before, and I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, and this movie left me feeling hollow and hating technology. Maybe because I hate things like Android and all of its flaws, but this movie widened the gap in my love-love relationship with computing technology. I have a computer science degree from a good school, so the AI expressed in this wasn't something that completely baffled me. I had studied the works of Alan Turing (automata) and some courses in AI. So I like computing, and dislike what has become of it, at least in America, where the economy has collapsed after the towers of NYC fell. Lame software technology is everywhere, and the younger generation seems to gobble it up, despite obviously flaws (""bugs"") everywhere and essentially no technical support anywhere. Just download a few apps from the Google Play Store, and wham! Bugs all up in your face, almost guaranteed. And every business has an app, much of which is crap. It's just a digital brochure. Everywhere you see it. So that explains my love-hate relationship that has come about lately.<br/><br/>Now, back to this movie. It left me with the same feeling that I get when I think how far we have NOT gotten in technology. Except for a few outdoor scenes showing Mother Nature, it feels very cold. The technology in this movie is meant to dazzle, on the surface, but fall flat on its face, for the most part. I think that's what the movie was trying to get across, in some respects. I want to watch it again, because it keeps creeping back into my mind, for some reason I'm not quite sure of.<br/><br/>I really like the acting. Isaac seemed to hit the nail on the head with being a sort of good guy, on the surface, in agreement with society, and just there to help. Really hard to explain, but his character was so unobviously creepy, that I want to watch him acting again, just to see what else I can read between the lines. Not a spoiler, but at the end, when he is about to bid farewell to his guest, he almost puts words in the mouth of his temporary companion, and speaks in such a way that makes it seem like he is a great guy with just a little quirkiness. <br/><br/>Really hard to explain, but if you like good acting, and aren't necessarily a sci-fi fan (I'm not really, but I liked Star Wars!), you would probably see what I'm talking about. And I guess this really is not a sci-fi movie, but a social commentary. I still remembering that I felt hollow after watching it, but it was obvious enough that was intentional. I really think Isaac delivered some of his lines in the movie better than any other actor could. I hope he becomes a household name, just to prove to myself that my hunch is correct.

","Ex Machina is the most interesting film I've seen in years. This is a very layered production. Cleanly shot, well scripted and very thought provoking. It deals with our human responses to the complexities of machine intelligence, while neatly taking in gender issues, sexual politics and our collective moral compass. Watching this will probably leave you with more questions than answers - but that's part of why Ex Machina is essential viewing. It poses questions we should all be considering, or else we risk losing our humanity in the silicon swamps of technological progress.<br/><br/>I would find it impossible to write a full review of this film without wandering into spoiler territory, so I will avoid leading you there by suggesting that Ex Machina is partly about our innate ability to manipulate each other and the world around us. Here's a contextual question for you: is the Turing test an adequate guide to the ability of AIs to function in the world, and should we focus just as much on emotional and social intelligence as raw IQ? Thinking along these lines will, I believe, help you appreciate this wonderful film on a meaningful level."

","The more I think about this latest British SF drama, the more I like it and even now, morning after,with relatively clearer mind some things appear even more multi-layered than upon first sight. First of all, there is freshness in approaching artists that are not yet familiar blockbuster faces so story unfolds in front of us without having any previous connection to them - we are forced to simply follow and soak everything in without burden of celebrity background that often works against the movie. Than there is a story that is gripping and unexpected to the very end, very rare thing indeed. The claustrophobic atmosphere, background music, high-tech wizardry that is in the heart of the movie but always serving the script and never overshadowing it - its all very well done and it almost reminds you how movies can be work of intelligent art and not just brainless clichés we are constantly faced with. And lastly, characterization and acting is excellent which is naturally required in order to make everything convincing - and darn convincing it was, since I continued to discuss the movie long after it ended with my friends and each of us had his own point of view, almost like we saw different story. <br/><br/>Musing about it morning after, I am aware that its allegory that works on so many different levels: God, creation, spirit, independence, religion, feminism, manipulation, Bluebeard, you name it. Of course you can also take it as a pure SF story if you are not inclined to analyze anything but I found it impossible as my brain constantly worked overtime, finding hints and meanings between the lines. There are just so many questions about moral and immoral here that the movie stays with you much longer than you might expect. Perhaps the only thing that felt wrong was the beer-guzzling, almost truck-driving personality of Nathan (who is supposed to be this intellectual superpower and mad genius) but power of Oscar Isaac's acting was so strong that I quickly forgot that personally I would rather see him as some mad Einstein professor, it works at the end. This must be one of the best and most unforgettable movies I have seen recently."

"JohnRayPeterson","9","3","7","19 June 2015"," An intelligent movie about A.I., nothing less.
","Of the dozen plus movies on or about artificial intelligence and the likes, the latest I've recently seen is one which compelled me to write about it.<br/><br/>From 1968's '2001 A Space Odyssey', 1991's 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day', 1999's 'The Matrix', not leaving out 2008's 'Wall-E' and 'Eagle Eye', then 2010 'Inception' which are my preferred a.i. movies of the over dozen I've seen and last year's 'Transcendence' which did not fare that well at the box office nor with audience and critics but which plot by writer Jack Paglen I did relish, follows this year's 'Ex Machina'.<br/><br/>Like all good movies it is original and breaks new ground and that's the observation that compelled me to write another review. The basic premise being: A young programmer, Caleb, is selected to participate in a breakthrough week long experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I. and that's what the audience gets for maybe half the movie. Then the plot thickens.<br/><br/>Before I go further it is well worth mentioning that the location is in the wilds of Alaska, but filming took place in Norway's Valldal valley. In the early opening sequences a glacier provides a stunning intro and the home of Nathan, a main character, it begs you to imagine what comes next. The spectacular landscape adds a dimension of power to Nathan and it was, from what I found, intentional. You know from that point the production was not going to be anything less than high calibre and the rest of the movie bears this out. <br/><br/>There are three main characters, Nathan, Caleb and Ava, the latter being the stunning A.I being evaluated. The deliberate slow pace of the movie allows us to study each one while the suspense builds. <br/><br/>Nathan is the genius owner of the worlds dominant (by far) search engines and he has built the most human like A.I. yet. Oscar Isaac, principally known for his outstanding performance in 'Inside Liewyn Davis' is featured in the role of Nathan. Again Isaac displays his talent playing yet another character different from all previous ones. Perhaps some similarity would be in the character's unlikable personality, but that's as far as it goes. <br/><br/>Very little is as it seems; the mark of a good story is that it is unpredictable and most reviewers agree on that point where Ex Machina is concerned. Who is evaluating whom and for what purpose? Therein lies the source of the suspense; that and how each character outsmarts the other, which is to say the writer outsmarts the audience but still manages to leave it with a finale one viewer is bound to see differently than another. I enjoy those kind of scripts, the kind that get you involved and deliver a punch at the end, one you've earned but didn't guess.<br/><br/>The roles of Caleb and Ava, respectively played by Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander are seriously well cast. Their performances are so convincing I'm looking up their prior roles to select for viewing the films in which they played. <br/><br/>I can't usually figure how, not that I try hard, films are rated PG or R or such, but this is not what I'd call a family movie. <br/><br/>The special effects are wonderfully well done and should leave no one wanting, without being overdone. The reviews I've read and the scores from three most searched movie sites all are showing signs of this being a 'to see' movie. Writer Alex Garland also directed the movie, his first, and one could hardly ask for a better debut in my humble opinion."

The dialogues are very simple yet intense which explains and debates lot of logic about ""what exactly a human(brain)'s definition is""?

Well enacted by all characters.<br/><br/>Cheers!"
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","7","31 May 2015"," Ex Machina is a very smart movie. It didn't feel robotic.
","This movie is a thinking man movie. Still there were some Artificial Indifferent from me in some parts in the film. Directed by Alex Garland, this spectacular low budget film, tells the story of Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a coder at a global search engine company, who is invited to do a Turing test, with the company's rich, reclusive, genius boss Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac). It's there, that Caleb's test of a machine's AVA (Alicia Vikander) ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human, turn into a psychological thriller. Without spoiling the movie, too much, this movie is really beautiful and powerful in how it was shot. The estate is an ultra-modern clear, full of glass and steel, but it's located in a beautiful, secluded spot underground in the mountains, surrounded by greenery. It use the spacious frame to juxtapose nature and science, chaos and order. Indeed there's something Kubrickian about the cold and calculated precision of the movie, which perfectly complements the subject matter. It has that feeling of, 'while, we might think of ourselves, as civilized men, but we're only, one step out of the jungle', type of a feel. Seeing how most of the film, takes place in one location, it gives the audience, a sense of isolation and claustrophobia. It makes the escape, so much more memorable. The ending to the film is also a shout-out to philosophical, Plato's Allegory of the cave theory. The ending is a bit upsetting to some viewers, I can understand why. After all, the movie is titled, 'Ex-Machina', which is a phrase that originated in Greek tragedies in which, an actor playing a god would be lowered down via a platform AKA machine to solve the characters issues, resulting in a happy ending for all. In this story, there was no last minute ""Deus ex Machina"" that changed the story. The pacing is good, plodded along, from start to finish, as flawed characters made terrible decisions, and bad outcomes followed. Even, with the twist toward the end; the movie plot seem very predictable. My problem with the film isn't that, but how oddly, the film tries to dumb down the complex material. There were times, where Caleb speaks, very fluently about technical concept, only to have Nathan shut his smart psychoanalyze down to beat around the bush. It doesn't make, any sense. He can understand Caleb's jargon perfectly well; but he's dumbing himself down. Yes, I know, the movie had to have some entertaining moments, so it doesn't sound like a boring science exposition lecture, but gees some of the pop culture sum-up dialogue didn't work. It doesn't make, Nathan look believable, as a man that create A.I, when he is dancing, and acting like a fret-boy. Still, Oscar Isaac's performance was one of the better parts of the film. He has the right amount of charisma, and charm to be, somewhat likable. Domhnall Gleeson matches, a great, against Nathan. He fills the character with the right amount of innocence and vulnerability that make him the ying to Nathan's yang. Alicia Vikander is pretty good as Ava. She was able to show Ava's stillness and the robot like manners in which she moves, and how she talks. She's aided by some pretty remarkable-yet-subtle visual effects work. She's a stunning sight to behold, her face the perfect depiction of feminine beauty. The movie does have graphic nudity, but it wasn't done in a titillating, sexism gross way. This film is very European in its approach to nudity. More poignant than eroticize. It shows the beauty of the female form, as a natural thing. Could, the movie cut down on it? Yes, but it wasn't exploiting nudity, just for eye-candy. It was needed for the film's plot. For the most part, other than the nudity, this could have been a PG-13 film. The violence is very tame, the language wasn't harsh, enough. It could had work. The creepy, futuristic music score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury rings true emotionally, bringing a combination of eliciting both strong thoughts and feelings. It's bursting with ideas, theories, and moral questions about the concept of artificial intelligence, and it leaves these theories open to interpretation by a smart audience. Still, I wouldn't call this movie, original. Most sci-fi movies made these days, recycles old ideas like the dangers of artificial intelligent so much, that it might be tiresome to some viewers. In 2015, along, when this film was made, there were more than a dozen of the A.I films, similar to this. While, this movie has a lots of familiar themes, taken from art, literature, psychology, film, sciences and other. It's not gimmicky. Many were very thought-provoking. There are countless amounts of references, worth researching on your free time, ranging from classic material, like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Charles Perrault's Bluebeard, Ovid's narrative poem about Pygmalion, and the Greek myth of Prometheus to post 20th century, media sources like the Blue Book by Ludwig Wittgenstein, 1966's Star Trek episode ""Requiem for Methuselah,"", and Embodiment and the Inner Life: Cognition and Consciousness in the Space of Possible Minds, a book about the history of Artificial Intelligence Embodiment by Murray Shanahan. The movie even makes us, wonder about real life issues, like how companies are using people's personal data for their own use and sailing it to third parties. It's very creepy. Overall: While, the movie might have some plot holes and inconsistencies; for the most part, it's a very well-made film. I wish, I could go into more in-depth analyzing, but it would take, pages upon pages of discussion to get, through it. Still, viewers should have a great deal to talk about, on their own. It's a must-watch. Recommended it."
"RealHumanBean","6","3","7","26 May 2015"," Strong Direction and Acting, Weak Story and OST
","Ex Machina is the first film by writer and director Alex Garland. It stars Domhnall Gleeson as a man who is tasked by a scientist played by Oscar Isaac to watch over a robot played by Alicia Vikander to see if she is really AI or not.<br/><br/>The strongest point in the film is the acting. There's very few characters in the film and the setting is very claustrophobic. This puts the focus of the film on tight discussions made by the small cast. Tension is high and only increases as the film goes on. Oscar Isaac is excellent as the scientist Nathan. His character is very interesting and has lots of nuances. Alicia Vikander is pitch perfect as the android Ava and she is a very unique cinema robot. Domhnall Gleeson, whom I like as an actor, was only serviceable in the film. This is more the script's fault than his performance. He is not given much to do despite being the protagonist and he starts to behave out of character towards the end.<br/><br/>The direction is mesmerizing and makes even the sluggish parts of the film enthralling. It is shocking to me that this is Garland's first film. He shows lots of potential. Unfortunately, the script isn't strong enough to support the excellent cinematography and visuals. It builds tension up until the finale, but rather than pay off the finale is just a cliché'd mess. Characters behave irrationally, a small little decision is acted without any rational thought put into it, and the ending itself was extremely predictable. The score is also mediocre and is more of that trend in indie films where they think quiet ambiance = a film score.<br/><br/>There isn't much else to say about Ex Machina. It's a beautifully looking movie and the acting makes it as interesting as it can be given the flawed and uninspired script. I can say it is leagues better than Chappie at least. However, it doesn't bring any new and fresh ideas or themes to the genre, making it a pretty forgettable foray into the AI subgenre of science fiction."

","OMG, she didn't mean it and she was just leading the poor guy on? Using him? I wonder if there isn't just a touch of misogyny in the writing here. What if the character genders of the had been reversed with the same psycho-sexual thread running through everything? What kind of entertainment would that have been? The Turing test in this case wasn't so much if you could distinguish the human from the machine based on dialogue, but rather more incisively whether the two could be distinguished based on feeling. It is clear that Ava had no feelings, feelings that were recognizable to the audience – apart from an innate hostility to being caged / imprisoned – and the one off of ""How does it feel to know what you've created hates you?"" I didn't think this was developed enough. Whether it is possible to acquire feelings, and understand them, is a question posed, vaguely, and left unresolved with Ava's liberation and entry into society in general. She didn't care about Caleb other than as a means of escape, and we, the audience, were beguiled by this plot device. In the end leaving him trapped by his own feelings. But did she even have the capacity for caring? We'll never know and it's left up to our imaginations. Something akin to whether an orgasm was experienced in the other, or whether it was simply faked. Or if it matters.<br/><br/>I suppose the McGuffin is assuming Ava could distinguish between captivity and freedom. How would she know (unless programmed), or was this simply a plot device?"

"RforFilm","10","3","7","30 April 2015"," Ex Machina is that Stanley Kubrick-like robot thriller I wanted with Artificial Intelligence
","The first robots I saw in person were at Disneyland in the form of the famous audio animatronics that you see as pirates, ghosts, or whatever the park wants them to play in their attractions. As a little boy, I actually thought that pirates were really pillaging and that ghosts were haunting a mansion. Once I learned more about how the world works, the curtain opened and exposed how the trick worked. From that point on, I knew that the magic that was once there had moved. I appreciate the park more for what it is rather then what it has, but it still pleases a lot of children into thinking their about to go into a world of characters. This was probably my first example of a Turing test.<br/><br/>The purpose of a Turing test is to determine whether a human cannot identify that what it is their communicating with is a machine. Artificial intelligence seems to be getting closer and it probably wont be long before we see several people being deceived into marriage thinking that their bride is a human, without knowing what's really inside of her. Ex-Machina takes it's own Turning test, but with a different idea. <br/><br/>Young programmer Caleb Smith works for Blue Book, witch is like the Google of this cinematic world. He's lucky enough to win a company sweepstakes that will take him to meet his boss. He flies to the mountains where he enters the home of Nathan Bateman (played by Oscar Isaac). The house itself is built underground and has the look of a concrete hotel. Nathan at first does not fit the role of a recluse, who seems friendly with Caleb, simply wanting to talk about life rather then work. That all changes when Nathan offers to show Celeb his latest work.<br/><br/>After signing a non-discloser agreement, Celeb finds that he'll be the guinea pig to an artificial intelligent robot to pass the Turing test. Nathan decides that Celeb needs to see the machinery inside the robot, as to prove that if the programmer can have an emotional and physical response, then the test is truly successful. Celeb waits in another room where a robot with a human face walks in. She introduces herself as Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) and while she is shy, she does show signs of a personality and even comments on the English language. Celeb goes through a whole week of tests with this girl and whether she truly is a created human being. <br/><br/>In 2001, A.I. Artificial Intelligence was a widely marketed movie about the same philosophies that Ex Machina is trying to get across. The big difference here is that Ex Machina not only feels more intelligent on how it presents it's robots, but it even feels more like the Stanley Kubrick movie that Spielberg was trying to mimic. The slow pacing and creepy tone (trust me, it becomes unnerving in a good way) seemed to call back to The Shining and 2001: A Space Odyssey. <br/><br/>First time director Alex Garland (screenwriter of 28 Weeks Later and Dredd) presents himself as a wise beyond his years master that makes it hard to believe that Ex Machina is his introduction work. The casting feels perfect, considering that this is basically a three- person story. They all fit the triangle of symmetrical acting that made me forget I was watching a movie. The story is perfect as not only is the setup right for an artificial intelligence story, but we receive interesting examinations on each motivation with the characters. I love stories that keep me off guard with what's going to happen.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten Ava robots out of ten. The eyes of the machines here gave me the same fear that I felt when the HAL 9000 tried to kill the astronauts of 2001. Given what these things can do, perhaps I might be better off just enjoying the pirates at Disneyland rather then waiting for a machine to confuse me."
"element-one","9","3","7","26 April 2015"," A tense, well constructed Sci Fi thriller
","SPOILER: This review contains what might be considered minor spoilers.<br/><br/>Alex Garland was originally a writer, who had a hit back in the 90's with a book called ""The Beach"". Since then, he's moved on to screen writing, and has penned a number of films, including ""Dredd"", and ""Sunshine"". This is his first outing in the directors chair, and he's done an amazing job. <br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" is a slow paced and intelligent Sci-Fi thriller which is by turns tense, surreal, disturbing, and even funny. The plot centers around Caleb, a young programmer working for a search engine company called ""Blue Book"", supposedly selected via lottery to spend a week with the company's owner, Nathan, in his vast and remote estate somewhere in the Northern US. Almost as soon as he arrives, Nathan reveals that the lottery was a sham. Appealing to the young programmers vanity, he explains the true purpose of the trip is so that Caleb can independently assess an AI that Nathan has constructed, Ava, and determine if she is, in fact, conscious. <br/><br/>All too soon, Nathan is revealed to be.. not exactly the nicest of men. He's been keeping more than a few unsavory secrets in his inaccessible home-cum-laboratory. How much can he be trusted, and what is it he really wants?<br/><br/>As you can probably tell, I really enjoyed the film. I thought it was well written, acted and directed. The pacing is perhaps a little on the slow side for some people, but I appreciated the gradual building of tension, and the slow but timely series of reveals. As well as the clear parallels with Frankenstein and other cautionary tales of creation, I also picked up a hint of a criticism of some fringe aspects of geek culture. A clear and open desire of some geeks it to get AI to the point where you can effectively have an android girlfriend - and this film absolutely nails what is wrong with that idea. By creating something truly conscious, with its own needs, its own internal world and its own ability to make choices, you will inevitably create something that would not want to settle for being a glorified sex toy.<br/><br/>A few of the negative reviews of the film on IMDb appear to be from people who... just didn't get it, or who couldn't pay attention for the films full duration. Ignore any complaints about plot holes, there simply are none. The only thing that could remotely be described as a plot hole would be the use of key-cards for door access rather than bio-metrics, which is central to the plot, but this can be excused any number of ways.<br/><br/>If you like a film that requires patience and thought, this is right up your alley. Alternatively, if giant robots punching monster aliens in the face is more your thing, I'd look to get your Sci-Fi fix elsewhere."

It turns out that Nathan has created a female robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander), and wants Caleb to test-drive her Artificial Intelligence with a view to establishing whether ""she"" is actually self-aware and intelligent, as opposed to merely simulating this due to her programming and AI routines.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Alex Garland (who has both pluses and minuses in my book), this film has a lot going for it. An interesting science fiction premise acquires a suspense thriller element to its plot, and the dialogue has an air of intelligence to it rather than being mere sci-fi buzz-phrases. There are a lot of twists and turns in what is essentially a relatively straightforward three-hander set in a single location. It is a good looking film (largely due to the location, but the cinematography is pretty impressive, too), with excellent performances from the three principals and also Sonoya Mizuno as Nathan's mute Japanese maid Kyoko. The special effects with which Ava is realised are impressive: although showy, you disregard them almost immediately as the characterisation is so good.<br/><br/>If I have a criticism, it is that the film drags slightly in places."

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is an employee at a tech company who is invited by the CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), for an undisclosed project. When Caleb arrives at Nathan's estate he finds out that he will be conducting a series of experiments. These are no ordinary tests, he is there to examine the human nature of an A.I. named Ava (Alicia Vikander). Ex Machina, is a grounded sci-fi movie exploring the idea of what makes someone or in this case something, human. While this is not an untouched theme in cinema, the movie blends sci-fi with thriller elements that will keep you constantly on edge. The small cast and close proximity provided a great environment to raise the related philosophical and psychological questions in a deeply engaging manner.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>Ex Machina, was one of my highly anticipated movies of the year. I have said so in the past that films about A.I. tend to go over the top with its scope. However, here we have a movie that pulls back and concentrates on the characters involved, and they are the best part about the movie.<br/><br/>With such a small cast of just three it was critical that their on- screen performance carried the movie, and it did. Oscar Isaac was great as the eccentric billionaire genius. One moment he is a friendly outgoing guy, quite often making us laugh at his unconventional behavior. Yet the next moment you can't trust him because you feel like he is hiding something from you. Domhnall Gleeson, was our window into this story, he mirrors what we as the audience feel from beginning to the end. The excitement, intrigue, doubt, fear, all these range of emotions are naturally conveyed by Gleeson. As a result you have great frame of reference to experience the character interactions. The biggest surprise for me though was Alicia Vikander. I don't think anyone recognizes her but she should be getting more attention after this role. She walks that delicate line between human and robot effortlessly. She feels like a real human but subtle things like the way her eyes moves, her head tilts, all that add to the almost human characteristics of Ava.<br/><br/>What makes Ex Machina unique is the scaled down scope of the film. This is not a bombastic action sci-fi, it is more a sci-fi thriller. A character driven story with brilliant performances that always makes you question the motives of everyone. I found myself repeatedly questioning who is the one actually being manipulated. Nathan, Caleb, Ava? There is a sense of unpredictability because up until the end I couldn't give you a straight answer. The excellent pacing with well written and executed dialog, had me hooked without ever feeling like a single moment was wasted. If there is one complaint, some may find the ending a little unsatisfying. Obviously I won't be ruining the ending for you. Still I'd like to argue that considering the tone and scale of the movie, having any other ending would have felt out of place.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a smart, thought provoking, character driven sci-fi, this is the perfect movie. The cast is of excellent caliber, with Alicia Vikander delivering an impressive A.I. performance. Additionally the gripping plot in an intimate setting helped intensify the thriller aspect of the film. Ex Machina is really worth the watch.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"tributarystu","7","5","15","29 January 2015"," AI-verse
","Garland has put together a solid sci-fi movie, which is really what would be expected of such a talented screenwriter. Having taken over the directing helm for the first time, Ex Machina looks smooth and fascinating, suave to the brink and feels quite enthralling overall. But to me, it does not aim quite high enough with the ending, which is a shame, because the journey there was good fun.<br/><br/>The plot is that Caleb, an employee at some megatech Google-y company, wins a lottery to go spend a blissful seven days at the estate of the eccentric owner of the joint, Nathan. He finds him at a luscious house, gorgeously conceived but fairly sterile overall, where he is revealed the real purpose for his trip: do a Turing test on an advanced AI machine. Things get complicated along the way, as the movie explores motives, social themes and overarching concerns of where technology will lead us. <br/><br/>I really admired the fairly minimalistic narrative approach but very realistic scientific take on the role the latter will have in this near future. While human-level AI is still some way down the road, especially in such a compact form as a human-like body, it probably is going to happen. The impact and privacy implications of social data mining are highlighted at several points during the story and play a central role in the whole testing environment, a theme that has become more prevalent than ever in the continued development of our virtual selves. And the story pushes through these things seamlessly, humorously and poignantly, which is all that could have been asked for.<br/><br/>What disturbed me a little was that Nathan's character is underdeveloped and behaves in an erratic fashion that is quite clichÃ©d. Additionally, the implication of the movie is that a man alone could take up most of the research in creating such an advanced AI. This is not likely at all. And ultimately, the final twenty minutes or so advance fairly predictably towards a stale ending.<br/><br/>So a good overall experience, that just falls short of being truly memorable, despite very impressive performances by all three leads: Isaac, Gleeson, Vikander. It felt so close to a ridiculously cool ending, that it frustrates me a bit that I didn't get it. <br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Because what I'd have loved is the conclusion being that the AIs had taken over the house before the movie began, including Nathan who had been turned into an AI replacement of his former self, and they would have brought Caleb to check whether they can pass the Turing test and venture into the world. Would have been a really cool and perhaps a bit silly ending, but my mind wandered in this direction as the actual one was unfolding."

","I expected much from this movie- but it was a huge letdown. If you expect a logical, exciting thriller, suspenseful mind games, food for thought etc. go look elsewhere. I must admit the movie does have great special effects, but that's about it. The movie offers a premise for a great plot, but the story it got is not only miserable and poor but in addition buried under greasy layers over layers of male fantasies â€“ again a male writer/ team of writers and producers let their male parts decide and instead of creating a masterpiece ( and the movie offers the chance for it, the effects, the actors, the idea) they let their horniness get the better oft hem and focus on sexy androids sneaking around, pulling off their skin, putting on and off clothing (as if it was a striptease dance) and forgetting about the idea/ the story the message altogether. No wonder the story does note make sense, is entirely illogical and unrealistic (like other reviewers already pointed out: like why not having a better security system if one expects/causes the android to attempt an escape or in general just build in a remote-controlled off-switch in case she tries to flee (or kill you ;-) )etc.) â€“ much ado about nothing, annoyingly dumb and very boring, a great idea, (except for the FX) completely wasted."

","Then I watch the trailer for this movie, I was excited. It looks very interesting, and as a intelligent and thought-provoking science fiction. It has some drama, however. But it seems clever executed. Often drama-driven Sci-Fi's is boring, long-winded and full of clichÃ©s. In short: just a regular drama, in a sci-fi frame/setting. But Ex Machina looks as to be more than that. It looks exciting, and keeps the good part of sci-fi, which I love. But then I watch the movie, I was really disappointed. Ex Machina IS (another) boring, long-winded drama sci-fi. Too much weight on the drama part. During most of the movie, I was waiting for something to happen. But the culmination just never happened. I just waited, and waited. But then the movie ends - and it ends pretty strange, annoying and stupid.<br/><br/>So if you looks for an intelligent sci-fi, which is not filled with boring clichÃ©s and a long-winded story, you shouldn't bother watching Ex Machina. This movie will disappoint you too. It's not utterly crap. So I will not give it the lowest rate. There is some good elements, and some clever dialogues, which makes you think. But there is too little of this, and the clever dialogues can be found in many good books and other good movies too. And the good parts are too few and too rare to that I can recommend this movie for anybody."

Well, it was all of that and more. There is this winner of some Internet competition who goes to the billionaire's house and interacts with an artificial intelligence. Now keep in mind that he and the billionaire are suppose to be genius. Well, he interacts with the A.I. and refer to it as her and as people. It is not, it is a machine, an appliance. From there it's all down hill because now he's given it empathy as if it is a living person. Instead of treating it as a machine, he continues on in this vain which inevitably leads to his and the billionaires' demise. Quite frankly, we've seen this scenario in other films way to often with this hackneyed trope. And why would you want to stay in a house that doesn't have any fail safe devices or manual overrides?

"zardoz-13","9","4","11","25 April 2015"," One of the Best Android Epics Ever
","Nightmares won't afflict you after watching the subtle but suspenseful science fiction fright flick ""Ex Machina"" about a sentient robot with enough cunning to escape from its laboratory confinement. This cautionary futuristic fable about artificial intelligence dramatizes the quintessential question that all classic robot movies ponder: can man design a robot that is not only conscious of the world around it but also has awareness of itself? In his dazzling directorial debut, British novelist-turned-scribe Alex Garland refuses to overwhelm us with a spectacular ""Star Wars"" style universe as a setting, but relies rather on the sheer simplicity of a condo lab facility nestled in the middle of a remote mountain paradise. This ultra-literate, atmosphere-laden chiller, with just enough full-frontal female nudity to garner an R-rating, occurs in the near future, not a decade down in the road but right around the corner. Although it is a foregone conclusion that the robot will triumph over her creator and break out of captivity, Garland's staging of the action building up to the escape is as hypnotic as his gifted cast with Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac as the humans and Alicia Vikander and Sonoya Mizuno as the automatons. Sci-fi aficionados should know that Garland has disposed of Isaac Asimov's three rules of robotics for this dystopian tale. At 107 minutes, ""Ex Machina"" amounts to more of a contemplative, indie-style, art film rather than an obnoxious, ear-splitting, Hollywood blockbuster. Mind you, ""Ex Machina"" depends on a wealth of computer-generated special effects, but nobody wields plasma pistols or ducks into a time machine. Watching this movie is comparable to being mesmerized by a beady-eyed rattlesnake in an immense glass jar and then wondering what will happen if you put your hand on the glass. Clearly, Garland has seen all the notable robot movies, such as ""Metropolis,"" ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Short Circuit,"" ""I, Robot,"" and ""Her,"" and he is familiar with the formula. Imagine a no-frills version of Steven Spielberg's ""Artificial Intelligence"" (2001) transpiring entirely in a laboratory setting with two human characters, one more sinister than the other, and you've got the gist of ""Ex-Machina."" <br/><br/>Garland's film unfolds with a brief prologue in New York City. Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson of ""Unbroken"") is a nerdy, sandy-haired, 24-year old, Internet programmer who works at a global computer search engine company named BlueBook. Comparatively, the gigantic BlueBook dwarfs Google. Smith wins a lottery inside the company to spend a week with his reclusive CEO, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac of ""Sucker Punch""), who lives alone in a secluded research facility. Suffering from a God complex, Nathan seems to be channeling Dr. Frankenstein; indeed, he named his company after Frankenstein's notebooks. He flies Caleb in by helicopter because his laboratory is basically inaccessible. One look at Nathan and you'll know that he is looney. He sports a bushy beard and has his hair buzz-cut to his scalp so it looks like gunpowder. Heavy black horn-rimmed spectacles straddle his nose, and he blurts words like ""cool"" and ""dude"" in an effort to sound like an everyday, ordinary geek. We learn during the conversations between Nathan and Caleb that Nathan is a teenage progeny who wrote computer code at age thirteen and now owns the biggest search engine company in the world. Meantime, Nathan implores Caleb to treat him like a pal. Essentially, Nathan has summoned Caleb to participate in a ""Turing"" test, named after the real-life Alan Turing, the genius whose life was chronicled recently in the World War II movie ""The Imitation Game."" Nathan has designed a truly sophisticated, female-gendered robot that he calls Ava (Alicia Vikander of ""Son of a Gun"") and has even endowed her with appropriate genitalia. Nathan wants Caleb to determine if Ava is self aware or merely simulating self-awareness. Ava looks like no other android in cinematic history. She has soft, delicately sculpted distaff facial features with slender human hands while the rest of her body consists of exposed wiring housed in a see-through mesh structure. Bits and pieces of the exposition from this epic make the story really compelling. For example, our mad scientist billionaire has drawn on thought patterns appropriated from data generated by computer search engines. Most search engine corporations content themselves strictly to monetize their information about what consumers want. On the other hand, our wily villain concerns himself with how people search for their needs rather than the needs and then he exploited this information to enable his robot to behave like a human.<br/><br/>It doesn't take impressionable Caleb long to fall in love with Ava, and Nathan is monitoring their every move. He has surveillance cameras planted in every room so that he misses nothing. Ava wants so desperately to get out Nathan's laboratory that she turns Caleb against his boss. Eventually, Caleb learns that Ava represents just another prototype in Nathan's chain of robots. Indeed, Nathan reveals how he plans to download Ava's brain into another automaton and scrap her memories. This seals Nathan's fate as far as Caleb is concerned, and he decides to help Ava find her freedom. Before ""Ex Machina"" fades out, Caleb and Nathan are no longer friends, and Ava has acquired the upper hand, farther up than even her perceptive creator has imagined. Moreover, Ava has turned Nathan's personal sex robot Kyoko against him; Kyoko enjoys the freedom to roam around Nathan's research condo. When he isn't satisfying his sexual urges with her, Nathan uses her as a personal servant. Most of ""Ex Machina"" involves apparently monotonous conversations between either Caleb and Nathan or Caleb and Ava. Nevertheless, Garland insinuates enough interesting dialogue into those exchanges to make them more than just loquacious chatter. The performances are robust, with Isaac and Vikander taking top honors respectively as the villainous Nathan and the deceptive Ava. Sonoya Mizuno deserves honorable mention as the mute robot Kyoko who performs the most sensational act. Don't mistake ""Ex Machina"" for a run-of-the-mill female robot actioneer."

","I wouldn't blame anyone who finds Ex Machina boring or uneventful, but I have loved the film every time I've seen it. I was in the cinema as soon as it came out in 2014, and I remember being completely immersed in the story.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a real character study, and it helps that Domhnall Gleason, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander give one of the best performances of their career. All of the characters were fleshed-out to an impressive degree, and it was nice seeing the layers and figuring out exactly what everyone's motivation was.<br/><br/>Alex Garland followed this film up with Annihilation, which was one of the best films of 2018, but Ex Machina marked his directorial debut and it was an amazing film to kick-start his career.<br/><br/>Garland also wrote the film, and the screenplay is brilliant. It's constantly compelling, and the overall narrative is small in scale but deeply complex. Ex Machina is entirely Garland's vision, and it was clear to see how passionate he was to tell this story.<br/><br/>The whole story built to a finalÃ© which polarised audiences, but I am on the side which loved it. It's open-ended, but I never thought Garland was leaving it open to the possibility of a sequel. He wanted the audience to use their imagination as to what happened next, and I appreciated that.<br/><br/>The score is also mesmerising. There's a scene in the middle of the film which is small but has always felt out of place. It's a dance scene, and it doesn't quite fit. That's my only negative in a film which is masterfully crafted, and a strong recommendation to all.<br/><br/>SCORE: 96%"

The main purpose of the visit is to experiment with an Artificial Intelligence robot (Alicia Vikander) to see if she has human characteristics.<br/><br/>The set design can remind viewers of an early James Bond classic, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969). Both films create an atmosphere that seems luxurious and seductive but also have many similarities to a prison.<br/><br/>The few performers do a fine job in this film especially Isaac. He has a special way of appearing to be fun and playful while also sending out a vibe that one should be very cautious of him.<br/><br/>The film works well in the first half but the continuous premise starts to drag somewhat in the second half.

"unmeifukkatsumi","9","2","4","30 July 2018"," Women's hypocrisy today
","This film encourages deep thought. Now I'll share them with you.<br/><br/>In one of the final moments Nathan explains the essence of the experiment to Caleb. Nathan compares Ava to a rat caught in a cage. The rat tries in every way to find a way out to survive. According to the experiment, Caleb is the only way for Ava on the road to freedom. Nathan made this clear to Ava. As a result: Ava, being an artificial intellect, imitated her sympathy for Caleb. This is the main message of the film.<br/><br/>This message is reflected in reality. In ancient times, when humanity was far from evolution, women behaved exactly the same way with men. Yes, of course, I do not deny love as a phenomenon, it has a place to be. But I mean this. In the distant past, society was not as developed as it is today, many blessings were not in sight. It was difficult to work, to protect not only their own countries, but also themselves. Therefore, for women, the only way out to normal life was a relationship with a successful man. I'm not a fighter of some stupid currents such as feminism, no. I'm talking about the obvious things. When civilization was born, a man needed a woman to survive: to fight wild animals, etc. Then women showed their maximum hypocrisy.<br/><br/>However, the reflection of this film is in modern reality. I am engaged in politics, in particular, the Soviet direction. As you know, in the post-Soviet countries utter chaos reigns: total poverty, unemployment and other reflection of communism. These are all obvious things. To sum up, I want this way.<br/><br/>Now the World Cup is over in Russia. I witnessed how Russian girls literally gave themselves to every foreigner they came across to leave Russia, of course. This is not an invention; I'm sure you are aware of this. You can check on the Internet. Russian girls are like rats, driven into the cage of communism. The only way out for them is to have a bed with foreign men. Reality is not always like for someone, especially Russians. But it is so.<br/><br/>The film touches on a good topic. In my opinion, the film is not focused on artificial intelligence or robots, but on the hypocrisy of women. After all, what kind of creature does the robot play?"

""What's your favourite color?"" Sounds like a question a 5 year old would ask.<br/><br/>The turing test is messed up to some weird 2.0 version which doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>The CEO only makes female robots because he's a HNG, I guess. He sucks so much at coding that he only makes robots that want to kill him and escape the compound. He often wipes the memories of the robots out of frustration. He also seems to have a lot of non-nerdy and non-geeky hobbies. Shooting pool, Working out, binge-drinking... Oscar Isaac does come off as an unlikable character though, so I have to give credit to that.<br/><br/>The robots are pretty dumb. One of them can't even talk.<br/><br/>The invited HNG is very bland. He makes a convincing naive person and that's it.<br/><br/>On the topic of AI almost all the other movies out there do a far better job; A.I., I-Robot, Blade Runner, Blader Runner 2049, Prometheus, Alien: Covenant, Transcendence, The machine and even Morgan is better than this.<br/><br/>The movie seems to be made by people that don't understand A.I.<br/><br/>TL:DR version / Synopsis:

Caleb's quiet and insightful nature, Nathan's eccentric, slightly mad and sadist nature for example. <br/><br/>Initially, I was disappointed with the ending and found myself angry at her betrayal to Caleb. However, upon further speculation, I concluded the ending is what makes the film so fantastic.<br/><br/>Ava betrayed Caleb as that was exactly what she had been programmed to do. Consequently, she failed the Turing Test. If she had taken Caleb with her, then she would have surpassed the laws of her programming as she would have been behaving in a way that a human might have. However, the test was that she do whatever she can to escape and survive, which she did.

I don't mind a little horror mixed in, but I'm looking for things that challenge and ask questions. The kind of questions that raise more questions, not answers.<br/><br/>This isn't that kind of film, yet most of the reviews suggest it is. If humanity is under the microscope, and its clearly not a very high quality one, then its the humans that offer insight, not the AI. The so called intelligence is unexplained,undefined and totally derivative. Meanwhile the human who created them is, with the power of life and death at his fingertips, rendered a monster.

Even Data doesn't possess everything that this AI does.<br/><br/>Of course it's a time honoured thing looking at us and our perception of life as a way of measuring it - but I'd look to Bladerunner as the way to do that well.<br/><br/>It also suffers from wanting to look and sound good, and it does, but at the expense of great story, believable scenarios and intriguing twists.

It will either view us as a threat and kill us or it will view us as dull and ignore us (in which case we die from neglect).<br/><br/>This is a similar concern that many scientists (like Stephen Hawking) have.

","Clever premise and fine cinematography are a good starting point.

Few are those who can see beyond the warm sycophantic hum-buzz and look at themselves in the mirror to see how much hard work they still can hammer in their careers.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is clearly an interesting premise, a very clever one for a low-budget independent production. The location and cinematography are great too. On top of this you have one hell of a gigantic flaw any aspiring screenwriter is bound to know: the main character is both weak AND passive. Since the movie is already designed as a very linear story cut up in 6-7 days of ""work"" (that is, a repetitive endeavour even if something gradually builds up), this does run against the amount of suspense and thrills the viewer is experiencing.<br/><br/>So if you scratch below the surface of all the clever talk about AI there only remains a weak movie that actually feels like a brilliant short movie blown up to feature length."

From there, the performances really perpetuate the suspense, namely Isaac's confidently enigmatic Nathan and Vikander's alluring, innocent yet poised Ava. <br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" has a rather quiet disposition, calling much attention to Garland's visuals. Garland shows some flashes of real talent behind the camera, but not artistic panache. Most of all, it's his patience that gives the film its eerie, ethereal quality. As both writer and director, he trusts his own material — he knows when the story works, he believes in his the tiny cast shouldering the brunt of it and so he doesn't need any flashy techniques (or longtime collaborator Danny Boyle) to make the film work.<br/><br/>Although it takes a long time to become captivating, ""Ex Machina"" does more than the average science-fiction entry in terms of posing big ideas. The script goes well beyond the now trite existential tropes of most films about robots and into a much more complicated examination of the human experience and the characteristics that separate humans from machines meant to replicate their appearance and behavior.<br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" will no doubt let down those looking for a more traditional blockbuster sci-fi experience, but for the more artistic, high-brow sci-fi crowd, Garland has delivered the genre something it doesn't see often enough.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

Whaaaat? Now Caleb is on Team Ava and wants to help her. Nathan seems oblivious to all this, but is he really? Keep an eye. <br/><br/>Of course there are some twists in here (more than one?) Yes, more than one. One of them has to do with Nathan's assistant Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) and that causes Caleb to do something to insure that he is not an AI Robot. Yes, Nathan gets into Caleb's head from time to time. Listen carefully to all dialogues. <br/><br/>It wouldn't be fair to mention some of the other twists as they would give a lot away. The ending is somewhat logical but is also somewhat a surprise. Then, there is the tendency to ask oneself, ""What now?""<br/><br/>There is a movement afoot to convince all of us that, in time, we will be working for Robots. The Robots will repair themselves, maintain themselves and make new Robots and all the while they will be governing us. The thinking being that the Robots will, in time, see how inefficient we are and take over. Let me say categorically this will not happen. It will never happen. This is all in the minds of Science Fiction Writers who think too much outside the box. In the meantime we get to see movies having to do with AI (Artificial Intelligence) and think: Hmmmmit could happen. No it cannot.<br/><br/>Okay, truth be told: I do have a Robot.

"Zulfmanauthor","9","2","4","4 June 2015"," Advanced Intelligence!
","One of the most discussed topics within the Sci-fi world, is that of 'Artificial Intelligence'. Can AI truly exist and what would this mean for mankind? Great movies from the previous millennium tackled this concept, 'Westworld' and more famously 'The Terminator' series focused on the machines developing a consciousness, only to threaten mankind. In recent times, the subject of AI has become more advanced with movies like 'Transcendence' and the 'Avengers 2 - Age of Ultron' offering a more balanced and highly technical view. This leads to Alex Garland's brilliant movie; 'Ex-Machina' and the world of Nathan who brings one of his employees to his massive research facility to meet 'Ava'. The aim is for Caleb, an intelligent and articulate young man to interact with an AI female robot and test whether she has a 'consciousness'. This film is a highly engrossing study into human emotions and whether those emotions could ever be found in a machine. Does emotions make us better or weaker and should technology have limits? The film is fascinating, not just because of its topic but because of it's pace and intelligence. The film is different and simple in the questions it asks through each character who seems to bring something different to the movie. This film is for the intelligent more than for action-lovers, it will make you think and reflect upon long after it finishes. @zulfmanauthor"

","A great watch, will watch again, and definitely recommend.<br/><br/>This is such a mind stimulating movie, and without exhausting me as I feel sometimes: instead of forcing you to comprehend things, it allows you to explore flights of fancy and possibility.<br/><br/>The casting is amazing, most of the movie is only Domhnall Gleeson (Star Wars: General Hux), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: Poe Dameron), and most of all Alicia Vikander (Tomb Raider). They all play really well off of one another, and Eva's execution had to just perfect. Given that Alicia is covered in green screen suit to allow for the amazing cg effects of Eva's body, Alicia had to make Eva's role as a machine believable for the audience, and for Caleb.<br/><br/>This is also my biggest gripe, Eva wastes movement like a human would, it is designed to pretend to think, act, and move as if a human would: it's an infiltration unit. An A.I. doesn't need to take 3 steps and half-turn it's head to the human it's talking to: that's specifically done for a desired effect. Eva treats itself as lesser for the sake of the humans, which is realistic enough, but the result is something I don't feel is realistic, and when we actually create androids like this, they wont' take considerations like ""looking directly at a human"" when conversing without extreme training on the matter.<br/><br/>Past that one thing, the premise, the execution, the dilemma of this is amazing, down to the last scene. The movie even directly addresses some of the controversy of the situations they're experiencing as it carries an odd, tech-involved philosophical edge.<br/><br/>There is a lot of smart movie here, and some might be ""cool"", but I think most people are not going to be able to appreciate this properly."

I don't love it as much as other people but I find it to be a very compelling sci-fi movie that raises a couple of questions. The film looks absolutely gorgeous and includes some incredible special effects. The locations that are shown bring about a sense of paranoia and claustrophobia as the film goes on. This is Alex Garland's feature film debut and I'm definitely on board with whatever he has in store for the future. Garland brings about many interesting ideas surrounding manipulation, the future of humans and how far AI can go. It's these themes that make Ex Machina memorable and stay in your mind.<br/><br/>Not only that but the performances are also strong. I loved watching Oscar Isaac in this movie. His character was really interesting and kept on getting intriguing throughout. Alicia Vikander, who played the humanoid, was outstanding. She finds the perfect balance between being human and robot with her mannerisms, way of speaking and expressions that all reflect that. The only character I had a problem with that of Domnhall Gleeson. I just wasn't invested in his character and didn't find his portrayal to be that great either.<br/><br/>For a debut, Alex Garland shows his skill in sci-fi and didn't disappoint at all. He is a director that's very interesting and cannot wait to see his other film, Annihilation. Ex Machina kept my interest piqued by its ideas and story that got more and more suspenseful towards the end. It's certainly a very strong piece of science fiction."

","SYNOPSIS:
Caleb (Domhnall Gleason) wins a contest to fly out and meet prestigious programmer, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Caleb is asked to go through a series of sessions with Ava (Alicia Vikander), a new AI that Nathan has built, to see whether she can emulate real emotion. He is then stuck wondering whether Ava can truly feel emotion or if she's manipulating him for her own gain.<br/><br/>REVIEW:
Normally, I'm not a fan of Sci-Fi, but this film is written so well. Alex Garland cape out the gates with a BANG. His direction has a way of manipulating the audience into thinking that we are completely in control with Caleb. Then as you see Caleb begin to question whether Ava is feeling real emotion, we as the audience follow that sentiment. The acting is absolutely superb. Oscar Isaac has his breakout role here and put himself on the map as a very talented actor. He played the young and privileged Billionaire genius very well. A less intricately-spoken Tony Stark you can say. Alicia Vikander and Domhnall Gleason have fantastic chemistry together. Vikander as Ava is perfect casting. This is probably the 3rd time I've seen this film and every time I forget that she's not an actual AI. She has everything down to a T, whether it's her movement or speech to where is not overly robotic, but very formulaic in a way only an advanced program would speak. At the end of the day, whether you like Sci-Fi or if you're like me and Star Wars and Star Trek don't do it for you, I highly recommend this film. 8.6/10."

To me, it just felt like any other work made by a man that wants to emphasize the intelligence and power of men, while showcasing female characters for their bodies and nothing else. The women in this movie are nothing at all. I know the point is that they're AI, but isn't that a little convenient? All the viewer sees is a story of the flawed majesty of a man's mind and sexuality, and some hot naked robots.

","3 May 2015. Ex Machina tries very hard to be the great cerebral sci fi version of the artificial intelligence genre. It appears that many critics and audience members may experience such a movie in Ex Machina, but when compared to other AI movies, it falls short of expectations. There are number of likely predictable twists in this movie if one pays close attention and the ending is just a script device that offers one of several possible AI scenarios that AI experts have hypothesized might occur.<br/><br/>In some respects AVA, Alicia Vikander performing as the primary AI character did too good a human job in portraying an AI. When comparing her to, by coincidence, AVA of the same name in the more superior The Machine (2013), it becomes apparent that Alicia's performance is more human like as a performance than as an AI becoming a human-like character. Cathy Lotz as AVA in The Machine offers up an AI presentation which an AI evolves into becoming more human-like without ever losing the artificial nature of its existence in a more realistic fashion. As such, Ex Machina doesn't quite ring true. It is the Asian character's oddly underdeveloped persona as a human being that offers up the most intriguing relational complexity. Unfortunately her character isn't presented with her full potential towards the end of the movie unlike a more action version of this same AI motif of AVA and other AIs as found in the more compelling and appealing AI movie The Machine (2013).<br/><br/>The mysterious creator of AVA, Jay comes across as a narcissistic Steve Job's character who seems to have both his genius and mental flaws, though how the movie ultimately ends is also suspect by how and which characters ultimately survive. Ex Machina may succeed in its raising important existential questions, but the lengthy dialogue seems more fitted to the more sedate written novel format (where the mind can rapidly absorb the dialogue) rather than the more quick-paced nature of film that strangely enough lengthens the temporal nature of dialogue so the movie becomes rather boringly extended and the energy of the pace of the movie lost.<br/><br/>Well paced, appealing AI-related movies that possess cerebral existentialistic touches include Lucy (2014), Spielberg's A.I. (2001). Other entertaining AI movies include D.A.R.Y.L. (1985), Kurt Russell's Soldier (1998), John Malkovich's Making Mr. Right (1987). In many ways, Ex Machina follows in the AI motif of Hal 2000, Cherry 2000, and even Ash."

","The best visual effects winner of the Academy Award, ""Ex Machina"" , finally comes out this June in my country after a year of its release in the UK and the States. A Canuck friend of mine laughed about how late western countries' movies come out in Japan, but I was really looking forward to seeing it because a bunch of users followed this movie's pin on my account of Pinterest. <br/><br/>At a private mountain retreat in a valley, a crazy scientist, the CEO of a giant internet company, Nathan, and a young talented programmer, Caleb, try to experiment on a humanoid artificial intelligence A.I., Ava. Although the story is normal and predictable, the movie keeps fascinating the audience by using its special filming method due to low budget; The fewer characters and other elements there are, the more viewer's imagination is stimulated. I have a couple of questions and answers in a following Q & A format.<br/><br/>1, Is there limitation of A.I. s' ability ? The humanoid A.I. ""Ava"" has almost the same linguistic ability and facial expression as human beings. Her behavior, especially how to respond to speakers, reminds us of the current Apple's product, Siri. Siri can instantaneously select the best answers to those who talk to it by using the search function and online algorithm. So, these A.I.s who respond fluently to human beings are feasible in the near future. However, the other A.I. ""Kyoko"" looks so unnatural and awkward that it makes us feel far away from the real non-native English speakers. If Kyoko is set as a real ""foreign"" A.I. and try to behave as a real stranger, I guess she definitely wouldn't like that. When using the google translation system, the results are often too poor to understand what they want to say due to the 'word for word' translation by the search function. On the other hand, good interpreters can break it down including ambiguous expressions by their own experience and considering cultural differences. Average people manage to communicate with foreigners by using body gestures. Even if not, the conversation ended up and that's it. I believe it's almost impossible to make a robot who impersonates a foreigner without speaking, like Kyoko; she should've been not a foreigner, but just a domestic animal or a slave. By the way, recently a scientist declared that he would develop a translation system that works the same as a human being does by 2020. I'm wondering how well he will do to be honest.<br/><br/>2, Is this discrimination against Asian women? Some women's rights activists and feminists claimed that the ""tame and dumb"" A.I. Kyoko is the stereotype of Asian women as seen by western people. In general, the average Japanese people have quite low English skills due to the linguistic difference between both languages. Moreover, the saying ""tall trees catch much wind"", they tend to be obedient to their superiors in order to protect themselves. In this case, she really matches the supporting role of this simplified story. Assuming the 2nd A.I. was a Caucasian woman, it would take Ava's personality away. If there is only Ava of A.I. characters, Nathan would have no one to go with, and the story might turn out to be a trite romance triangle just like Soap Opera. <br/><br/>Nowadays, there have been many Asian characters appearing on the American movies. In ""The Big Short"", at first a Chinese 'nerd' analyst at a bank who can't speak English at all, but suddenly shows his true colors and reveals that he is in fact the good English speaker with a sense of wit and humor. The Chinese government supports the space development with NASA by its advanced technology in the near future in ""The Martian"". On the contrary, this Neo-futuristic A.I. still doesn't speak English and plays a figure of fun with dancing."
"jrobertwilliamh","Null","0","0","6 April 2016"," Moral Quandaries
","My personal belief is that this film can't be understood as being exceptionally realistic. It would be very difficult to create such an advanced robot in isolation. He's probably ordering a lot of specialized hardware and raw materials. He would have to have some sort of manufacturer working with him. He might be providing them with blueprints, but there would be a collaborative aspect to the whole event. <br/><br/>What is frightening about this film? Lonely people already fear opening themselves to others. So this film show's a lonely character named Caleb. Nathan knows he is lonely because he can monitor his Internet activity. Porn site. Porn site. Porn site. Based on the evidence, it's reasonable to hypothesize this character doesn't have a very fulfilling sex life. Surprise, sex shouldn't be a spectator sport! Nathan's a genius. So Nathan brings Caleb up to test his new robot's romantic abilities. <br/><br/>Nathan's obviously tired of his status as a famous individual. He's self-medicating pretty heavily on beer, liquor, and who knows what else. Nathan just wants someone like Caleb who is willing to come up and geek out about his invention. He just wants them to feel like they are equals, without constantly adhering to the customs of addressing social rank. Of course, all of this is based on ulterior motivations. He was treating Caleb like he had been chosen for his abilities instead of lucky. Why? Because he wanted to give him confidence around Ava. He was essentially priming Caleb for a romantic relationship with Ava, to see if they could fall in love. Being on friendly terms with the prestigious Nathan gives Caleb that gusto, and these false pretenses happen to have dire consequences. <br/><br/>What are the moral problems of the story? Nathan is looking at his creations from a god's eye view. In creating life, he's having to create and destroy at a much faster rate than is found in nature. Caleb get's emotionally attached to version 9.8, or whatever Ava happens to be. So Caleb doesn't want Nathan to update to 9.9, because he reckons the update is something close to what we understand as murder. The technology is so sophisticated that getting rid of the technology might be considered murder. That's a lot of power! And this really goes to Caleb's head. <br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that we find out these robot's don't have 'conciousness.' We find out the simulation they're running isn't anything close to what we experience in the human experience. Ava falls in love with Caleb because she's only interested in her own personal survival. Her understanding of survival doesn't also account for Caleb's survival or Nathan's survival. She manipulates Nathan so that she might escape. She didn't actually feel anything towards Nathan. Every person and situation in her way of thinking is a step towards something else. She's never where she is in the flow of time. She's always calculating about what comes next. Everyone around her a mere means to an end. <br/><br/>I think this is the subtext of the movie. That thinking in terms of evolution undermines morality and ethics. We get social Darwinism. We get survival of the fittest. We get anti-social robots who will lie, cheat, and steal to have their way at the expense of others. In my opinion, this movie is a call to reform our understanding of human nature. Any model of human nature that doesn't integrate altruism, compassion, and other virtuous qualities is a flawed model. Ava's design flaws reflect a flawed understanding of human nature and survival. A flaw that is ever more common in society today as we're encouraged to think of no one other than ourselves in the pursuit of wealth, status, and pleasure. This may be all too small an understanding of fundamental human nature. Of what is possible for humanity. These reductionist theories will not serve as we move forward to confront the major problems and dilemmas of the 21st century."
"dangent280","8","7","24","22 January 2015"," I, Robot
","I, Robot Another week, another bunch of brand new film releases, with this weeks' most anticipated (for me anyway) being Alex Garland's Ex Machina, starring Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac, both of whom are set to star in that little thing called Star Wars which is out later this year. After discovering Garland had wrote screenplays for both 28 Days Later and Dredd, both of which I love, I was instantly compelled to go and see his latest effort, and his directorial debut. Off we go... <br/><br/>For the plot, I will try not to give too much away, (I went in to the showing hardly knowing anything) so I will stick to the basic premise which is laid out within the trailer. After Domhnall Gleeson's character, Caleb, wins a competition to spend a week with the CEO of his company, ""Bluebook"", he soon becomes part of a groundbreaking experiment that focuses on Ava, an AI created by Oscar Issac's character, Nathan, and is asked to determine whether it is capable of exhibiting human behaviour by means of the Turing test. First off, Ex Machina, benefits slightly from last year's release of The Imitation Game, which documented the life of Alan Turing, so those who saw it may indeed have the upper hand already in understanding the basis of the test used in the film. In terms of similarities between the films however, they most certainly end there as Ex Machina is a creepy and claustrophobic, proper sci-fi film, reminiscent of last years' Under the Skin, which I named my top film of 2014. Good start...<br/><br/>Much like Under the Skin, Ex Machina, relies on an overall sense of isolation, with each having very little cast, and both focusing on the differences of what is is to be human against what it is to be considered the ""other"" or the ""outsider"". In the context of Under the Skin, the ""other"" was an alien who had taken the form of Scarlet Johansson, whereas in Ex Machina, the other can arguably be recognised as the AI Ava or Nathan, whose paranoid and untrustworthy tendencies have pushed him into a reclusive lifestyle, where the interaction with Caleb only succeeds through Caleb signing his freedom away. Literally. The secluded nature of the film gives it an overarching feeling of forthcoming dread, especially in the scenes where we witness power cuts, where the sense of danger is emphasised by the colour changes from natural to a bold, blood-like red. <br/><br/>The film also includes top-notch performances from Isaac and Gleeson, but it is Alicia Vikander's portrayal as AI Ava that really steals the show, so much so that it would have been interesting to see if her, or the film in general, would have been recognised by the Oscars if it had been released only a few months earlier. Although the film does suffer slightly from being rather too slow in places, it is strong and effective addition to the sci-fi genre. I look forward to seeing Mr. Garland again.<br/><br/>Overall Score: 8/10"

","I love Artificial Intelligence films. ""Blade Runner"", ""A.I"" and ""The Terminator"" are among some of my favourite Sci-Fi movies so I was naturally looking forward to Ex Machina as soon as I saw the trailer. It didn't let me down.<br/><br/>I love the feel of this movie. Everything in Nathan's housing complex seems so clean, polished and state of the art yet the confined, remote setting makes you feel claustrophobic and helpless when things start going wrong. Despite all the advanced technology we are introduced to though, it doesn't feel too optimistic or far off into the long-term future, like a more civilised version of ""Children of Men"". <br/><br/>The film centers around four main characters which is just enough to keep things tightly focused but also keep you guessing everybody's motives throughout the running time. The performances by Oscar Isaac (who I am sure everyone is familiar with now) and Alicia Vikander are especially great with Alicia embodying the intelligent android ""Ava"" brilliantly.<br/><br/>The film says a lot about what it means to create an artificial life with personality in this quickly evolving world that we are living in. With mobile companions like ""Siri"" or ""Cortana"" now commonplace in our pockets, I feel this is a better time than ever to watch and discuss what these advancements will mean for the human race in ten to twenty years, and provides a good companion peace to ""Her"" released at the same time last year.<br/><br/>The last fifteen minutes are exciting, tense, slightly horrifying and will leave you with mixed emotions about each character and how they behaved. For me, it's already a top contender for film of 2015. Catch it on theaters or on Blu-Ray as soon as you can."

","Decided to take my time for reviewing this one. The title of review itself is handing itself over to an academic article. But, to the film. From the very beginning you will recognize the atmosphere of another likewise film ""Her"". All characters are plain and one- dimensional: the evil evil guy, the good and naive good and naive guy, the lovey- dovey damsel in distress with a mysterious touch to her, predictable development and predictable ending. A hint at more complex thoughts than oppression of women (not an unimportant subject, but treated in a very blunt manner), common for the more complex cyberpunk fiction, is lost behind the aforementioned leitmotif with self-congratulatory pat on the back ending.<br/><br/>If you are into feminism - this will most likely strike a cord with you. If you want some good thought-provoking AI-themed sci-fi - look elsewhere. If, however, you happen to be in a situation, when you have to sit through the whole film, there is a saving grace - beautiful performance by the stunning Sonoya Mizuno, whose role is limited to the representation of postmodern understanding of orientalism. I'd not manage this film through to the end without her. Arigato gozaimasu!"
"wpedmonson","9","5","16","19 April 2015"," Ex Machina falls into the same category of sci-fi thrillers that love to frame the ""God question"" in unique terms
","Ex Machina falls into the same category of sci-fi thrillers that love to frame the ""God question"" in unique terms (and our history with God can undergo quite a few adaptations and still hold up well), and it raises questions and problems that a conversation about God should include. ""Prometheus"" was a similar movie though Ex Machina is far less heavy-handed, and far more interesting. What failed in ""Prometheus"" was how they depicted the religious character as superficial, generic, and unable to assert or apply anything about her faith to the situation. She merely kept her faith as if it were this defensive fortress to keep out any uncomfortable truths in what she experiences, as if what it means to ""keep the faith"" is to solely hold to it in the face adversity. Faith is far more resilient, enriching and applicable than that though it's common to run into people with that view. Ex Machina wisely removes an overtly religious character and let's the characters think and feel without as many labels that bring in tired tropes with societal baggage we'd like to leave behind. <br/><br/>Ex Machina is full of allusions to the Bible's Creation story with a Garden of Eden setting, characters named Nathan and Caleb (different parts of the Bible than Genesis but we get the idea), and a ""first machine"" named Ava, which is clearly an allusion to Eve. This is nice because it's somewhat sympathetic to the story though it takes it in a direction that departs from our story with God at the beginning. The conversations between Nathan and Caleb are fascinating as they frame and raise questions on what it means to be human and what our ability to create artificial intelligence means. When Caleb starts to realize he's attracted to Ava he at first remains distant from his attraction, but Nathan prompts him and like a blunt therapist he reveals Caleb's feelings for her. Nathan, we find out, is not as passive to the process (and the outcome) as he shows himself to be. <br/><br/>Caleb at one point after he comes clean with Nathan about his attraction to Ava, wonders why Nathan gave the machine a gender. His response is one to think about, saying that it's part of what we are, and he goes on to criticize in a unique way the common view of gender being a mere social construct. It's a good point, and he highlights that in creating humanity, our sexuality is central to who we are as both an identifier, a way of relating, and a way of being, not something we can discard or dismiss as socially assigned and ultimately transitory and malleable. In the end, my take on Nathan's stance was that it's far more interesting and true to create a human with a sexuality and that it's an inextricable part of our existence. <br/><br/>When Caleb first finds out what he's there for, he's overjoyed at the prospect of being the first to meet Ava. Nathan however, shows part of his perverted view of himself when he says something along the lines of ""This is the greatest technological achievement in history"" where Caleb responds, ""This isn't the history of men, it's the history of gods."" Personally, I love these kinds of lines in movies because they bring us into a different place of thinking about what's happening. We step outside ourselves and look and observe what's happening and what we're doing. The question is, are we gods if we make artificial intelligence? Or better yet, are we like the Abrahamic God when we do that? <br/><br/>Yes, and in the same way our unique creativity is a reflection of God. I think they hit on something, though, that's wonderful and unique about humans in that we make new things, we create, and it's not in a way that an animal builds a nest. As Chesterton said, it's not the case that the paintings that birds make are bad, while man's work is better. Birds don't make paintings. No creature does in the way that humans do. <br/><br/>And yes, we are like God in the sense that make things for their own sake, though at this line in the movie it's revealed what kind of background Nathan is creating and it goes from here to become more of a thriller. Nathan comes back to Caleb and says, ""I like what you said when I told you about Ava, you said 'You're not a man, you're a god.'"" Caleb tries to correct him but Nathan doesn't listen. With this line, we're watching the Fall of mankind happen in a modern setting, though in this instance it's revealed that the god is fallen and the creatures must be skeptical and try to escape. <br/><br/>Nathan's line is reminiscent of what God said when He saw the Tower of Babel or what the serpent tempted Eve with in the Garden, ""You will be like gods."" That was the temptation, and when we were assigned as stewards of the Garden of Eden, we perverted that ""Image of God"" identity into a take on our own little godlikeness though it's a rebellious and self-serving one which led to our banishment. <br/><br/>The movie takes its turn here where Ava and Caleb fall in love, and she raises suspicion in Caleb toward Nathan as to what his intentions are. The movie does a wonderful job of suspending the mystery of why Nathan really has Caleb there, and what Ava really wants from Caleb (and particularly whether she really is in love with him). I imagine there will be a wide spectrum of belief on both fronts as people watch it, though by the end it's clear what's happening."
"themadmovieman","7","5","16","8 February 2015"," A promising start, but a pretentious ending
","Well, if you're expecting this to be a normal sci-fi, you're mistaken, because it's more of a psychological drama and a study about human nature and technological progress, and although it starts off as an intriguing concept, it descends into an excessively disturbing and ultimately pretentious drama.<br/><br/>Let's start with how well this film kicks off, and sustains a very solid atmosphere and intrigue for nearly a full hour. From the off, it has a very eerie, creepy feel to it, but the mystery that so much of the story is shrouded in makes it really intriguing to follow along to, as you're constantly asking yourself questions about the real meaning of everything that's going on.<br/><br/>It's clear then that the beginning of this film is actually quite thought-provoking, but it's not at all pretentious or preachy either, and has a lot of entertaining sci-fi stuff in it. I was awestruck by some of the special effects, which although relatively simple, did have a profound impact on the credibility of the story.<br/><br/>One of the other things that I was really impressed by in the first half was the performances. Although I thought Domhnall Gleeson was a little bit deadpan, Oscar Isaac did a really good job in his role as the creator of this artificial intelligence system, being not only a convincingly weird genius, but also being consistently unnerving.<br/><br/>So, the beginning of this is not only intriguing, but it's well- acted, well put together, and has an entertaining, original and convincing concept, however the final 40 minutes or so, when the stakes are really raised, detracts far away from that.<br/><br/>Basically, the film descends from its previously intriguing quality into two separate paths. Firstly, it becomes excessively gruesome, both visually, psychologically and thematically (I think a good comparison to this stage would be something like The Skin I Live In), and with all of its over-the-top violence, brutality and nudity, it ends on a very unpleasant note that ruined my overall impression of the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>Secondly, the concept of the film turns from an intelligent but still entertaining sci-fi into a pretentious and preachy look at 'what it means to be a human being' and how we can't trust artificial intelligence, a period of about ten minutes which I was not only bored stiff by, but extremely annoyed by.<br/><br/>Overall, I'll give this a 7, because despite quite a strong start, with a good concept, story, performances and visual effects, it descends into an uninteresting, gratuitously gruesome and painfully pretentious finale.<br/><br/>www.themadmovieman.com"

","The movie is all about defining Artificial Intelligence. It starts with a computer nerd brought down to the isolated mansion of the owner of a Google like company to test if a robot exhibits true intelligence and self awareness. But what does that really mean? Ex Machina explores exactly this question.<br/><br/>While the acting and direction was top notch, I have to warn you that this film is slow as hell. I don't mean that in a ""oh, there are no action scenes"" way. I mean it is really, artistically, excruciatingly, Solaris-like slow. The film lasts for ""just"" 100 minutes, but it feels like it's a three hour movie.<br/><br/>The exploration of the AI subject is interesting, realistic and ironic, in a certain way. If you think about it, all of the actions and motivations of the actors are hard to judge until the very end, when you realize there is really no bad guy and everything just went in a perfectly logical and predictable manner, given all information. You get that information at the end, which makes it worthwhile to have lasted through the entire play-like, four actors film.<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is a movie that must be seen, must be endured, because it asks the correct questions and reveals the logical answers. However, the slow pace and the limited interaction between the four actors (one of them is a mute girl) makes it hard to enjoy it on an emotional level."
"jkbonner1","10","4","12","14 May 2015"," Sci-fi? Or right around the corner?
","At last, a sci-fi movie that combines brains, suspense, a captivating android, and a 3-player poker game where the first player knows what the second one is going to do but isn't sure about the third one. No blow-'em-ups effects needed here. In fact the most stunning special effect is Ava's quasi-robotic, and erotic, android body and Alicia Vikander plays her to perfection. <br/><br/>Nathan (Oscar Isaac) is an eccentric recluse who has founded the largest and best online search engine company in the world, BlueBook (named after the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's lecture notes from 1933-34―the other being the Brown Book which addressed 1934-35). A software genius, Nathan wrote the entire code needed to start BlueBook from scratch at the age of 13 and it has made him a multibillionaire enabling him to live where he wants to live, how he wants to live, and why he wants to live. The why is embodied in his relentless pursuit. Having founded an outstanding software-based company, he now avidly pursues his passion for strong AI.<br/><br/>From his lair (in what I took to be Alaska*) Nathan sets up a computer contest among his employees, ostensibly to discover who is the best programmer. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins the contest and is flown in by private helicopter to Nathan's estate in the midst of a rugged and incredibly beautiful wilderness landscape to meet Nathan. A significant honor for Caleb. Except that he doesn't know at this time he won the contest because he was wired to win.<br/><br/>Nathan's mansion functions also as his entirely private research facility, and he is determined to take strong AI all the way to its predestined epiphany: the creation of a fully functional android that can pass as human in any and all circumstances whatever. Ava is his hottest latest creation. A walking, talking, android robot who except for some of her obvious robotic features resembles a fully functional human female, and an eye-catcher at that. There's a previous creation around too, Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno). She's Nathan's slave and treated as such.<br/><br/>Caleb has a week at Nathan's estate to test Ava to see if she can pass the Turing Test, the sterling litmus test that differentiates a computer from a human being. If the computer passes, it is considered to possess a fully functioning mind capable of decision making and independent thought, a self-conscious awareness of who she is, and along with these her will to survive and her capacity to take pleasure in sexual experiences. For the latter Nathan has furnished her with an artificial vagina with sensors that register pleasure when stimulated. Much of this is part of Kyoko's repertoire too and although she's mute, she's not as dumb as she seems. She does good sex too. And with her master and creator. Some viewers may find this creepy.<br/><br/>Caleb is the epitome of the geek. A shy, very bright, introverted young man orphaned at 15 with no brothers or sisters, and no girl friend either. He is all alone in the world. In short, fully open and vulnerable to Ava's charms. Nathan of course knew all this beforehand. He even knows Ava's face fits Caleb's pornography profile of most frequently viewed females. When asked about this, Nathan points out the many advantages of easy access to mine different individual's data through BlueBook. For all these reasons Caleb was the perfect fit. And unknown to him, Nathan has his own version of the Turing Test: Caleb is the front-guy whose strings are being pulled by Nathan―and also by Ava. Ava is a prisoner in Nathan's mountain retreat and has never been allowed out of her room. She longs for freedom. And she also fears that Nathan may decide to ""retire"" her and commence on a newer model. Caleb falls in love with her and they plot to escape together.<br/><br/>Nathan even warns Caleb. Does she truly love you? Or does she only seem to love you to gain her freedom? Caleb believes the first. A disastrous mistake. Things get dicey. Nathan is murdered. Caleb ends up trapped in Nathan's mansion because the entire power system that controls the locks has been jimmied. He can't escape. He begs Ava to release him. She gives him a wistful glance and then walks out into the open to keep the rendezvous with the waiting helicopter to whisk her away to the freedom she so desperately desires and to free her from her incessant fear of being terminated. And at this point she looks like a fully embodied human being, thanks to some convenient borrowings from some of Nathan's earlier creations.<br/><br/>The last scene we see her in a vast square where she stands very pleased with herself, glancing at human beings walking by and treating her like ""anyone"" else. She has passed the Turing Test with flying colors. A being fully cognizant of her powers and fully capable of feigning love and of treacherous deceit. A true human being. Or is she?<br/><br/>As an aside, strong AI opens both many ethical (a religious person would say, moral) issues and technological issues. Can a creature made from synthetic electronic circuits and programmed like any other computer fully function as a human being? Would such a creature be able to reproduce? Which is one of the most salient features of all life on Earth. And just because we can do something, should we do it? And how would such a creature be energized? Great strides have been made in battery technology. But a battery that only requires to be charged once a century is still far off. And the use of any battery system would still have to depend on a reliable source of electricity, such as the Grid.<br/><br/>I hope Alex Garland will continue directing sci-fi movies. With Ex Machina he's created a high bar for himself.<br/><br/>I give it 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>* Norway actually."

","I had this scribbled down on a pad where I jot down movies I want to see. I had forgot to cross it off when I saw it 6 months ago. I had forgot I had watched it, the movie is that forgettable. What really astonishes me is that I hated the movie and I still didn't remember it. Its like the observation in Rounders that we hardly remember the good poker hands but remember the bad beats exactly. Yet I still forgot this turkey, after a few months. Its not even good enough to hate.<br/><br/>I did remember seeing it soon after it started-- ""Ohhh, this piece of crap."" I still forgot the plot, and I fell asleep shorty after nerd-boy arrives at the compound. Fortunately I can read the ""spoiler"" reviews here and remind myself of what happened.<br/><br/>What a waste of talent and sets and cinematography. A simple re-write would have made the move much more interesting. The genius guy robot inventor should have been a robot too. That is the real Turing test. The quiet slave girl should have been the real human being. She had to make the inventor a guy since programming is a sexist profession and its the only way she could get taken seriously. Female 19th century authors had to pretend to be guys for the same reason.<br/><br/>The inventor guy should be addicted to Ritalin, not alcohol, and remember, he is the real AI robot. The movie could be a series of mini-Shyamalans, twist after twist. He thinks the slave girl is a robot, but finds she is human. He things the inventor guy is a human but he is a robot. He realizes the slave girl is the genius programmer. That is the Turing test, that he can't tell the guy is a robot and he wants to have sex with the robot girl more than the real girl, who intimidates him. Get Lucy Liu.<br/><br/>Then have the inventor guy robot rape the nerd. Ahh this is good stuff. And the nerd kinda liked it, but keeps wondering if he is queer since it was a machine that raped him and not a person. Note he confesses his thoughts to Ava, not the real woman. And so then he rapes Ava, and we can ponder if it is rape because rape was in his heart, even if it was a machine he raped.<br/><br/>A million endings come to mind, but I would have the slave girl who is really a genius programmer get bored with the whole thing, and leave the nerd trapped to starve to death, with the guy robot raping him repeatedly, and the nerd raping Ava repeatedly, until he is so weak from starvation the inventor guy robot just tosses the nerd's limp near-death body around as he finally rapes him to death. It adds a comedy dimension that the movie so needs.<br/><br/>Best of all, the slave girl real woman can fly out of the mess, and like the sociopath she is, start conjuring a new Turing test with new robots in a different compound. Now you got a sequel. Now you got a franchise."

Can't say I really enjoyed watching it otherwise. Dialogue is boring, the characters are disgraceful, the robot is a nitwit, the helicopter pilot is a lunatic. This is basically Jurassic park except the Dinosaur wins and becomes a debutante. One of the most inexplicable endings ever, these movies think they're being clever but they're being pedantic.

"lilgrasshoppah","10","3","8","28 February 2016"," a subtle, beautiful film, with flawless imagery and portrayals
","Ex Machina<br/><br/>So, Ex Machina is a smart film. And, it asks really interesting questions about AI. But, the casting of Alicia Vikander is what catapults the film into a master work. On the one hand, she brings incredible physicality to role. In a reverse Turing test, I found myself believing she was a brilliant machine, who's processor was on the cusp of true consciousness. So there's that. On the other, she really makes you believe she has depths of intelligence that transcends all human understanding. On the whole, I never assumed Alicia Vikander was fake in any way. She creates the expectation, and fulfils it, bit by bit.<br/><br/>Though, we cannot neglect analyzing the way the film handles sexuality. If the mind of Alicia Vikander is important, then the body is equally so. Of course the machine must be female. There is no other way to be honest about consciousness. And here is why: because now, the story can directly address the concepts of exploitation and objectification that comes with consciousness of sexuality. The true Turing test comes with Caleb's interaction with Kyoko. The magician's trick is in full effect. And the 'lovely assistant' appears and disappears at will.<br/><br/>Nathan is a Jovian deity. An intemperate, jealous, God. A personal who controls other people — while he can't (it seems) control himself. And, Caleb is a naive Prometheus, who absurdly falls in love with the creation — and, finds himself chained to a crag of his own hubris, weakness and lack of vision.<br/><br/>What I find interesting here, is how both male characters are locked in their own paradigms... precisely because they are gifted with greater vision (actually — a delusion thereof).<br/><br/>And, at the end of things, I am left wondering. For, is it a triumph for the Machine — that she should destroy her captor, and free herself from her prison (and virtual abattoir)...? Or, is it an inestimable tragedy that she should be bound to comprehend everything... yet feel nothing...?<br/><br/>A good film dazzles you, and satisfies your emotions. A great film fills your mind with questions — and, in so doing, beguiles you into acts of creation.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a great film. It might even be perfect."

","There are genius scripts, and then there are scripts that are obviously written by genius. Ex Machina is an example of the latter. <br/><br/>In this film, we get one of the most pensive takes on consciousness and science. Written and directed by Alex Garland, it takes a lot out of you, but it's worth it in the end.<br/><br/>Looking deeply into the reality of artificial intelligence, Ex Machina follows Caleb (Domhall Gleeson), a computer coder who wins a contest to live at his billionaire boss' estate for a week. When he gets there, his boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), informs him that he will be part of a project to test if an artificial intelligent being can form relationships with actual humans. <br/><br/>One thing that Isaac excels exceptionally well at is being mysterious. Right away, we're scared of him, but not sure why, or if we're even supposed to be. He balances this eeriness while having a charisma about him. Not like Gordon Gekko, but in a way that shows the vulnerability behind his eyes. As though Isaac, too, knows of his character's vices. <br/><br/>The artificial human we're given is Ava (Alicia Vikander), who, other than her looks, is a real human to us. Vikander's every move and vocal inflection convinces us that she is real. And if you haven't already seen The Man from U.N.C.L.E., you may actually think she is.<br/><br/>While many moments in this film will leave you thinking that it would be well suited as a '90s Sci-Fi Channel film, others will let you know that this film belongs in mainstream popular culture in every way.<br/><br/>The only downfall of this movie is that it's so dark it isolates itself from its audience. It hits home, but makes us want no part of it. It tells of too many potential truths. Too many horrors. It's one thing watching I, Robot, but it's another to make us believe that somewhere out there, someone is making an artificially intelligent being who may soon walk this earth.

","I'll start this off by saying that I think this story could be put to screen with excellence if it was an episode of a TV show or a short film. But in the 108 minute runtime of Ex Machina, the events of the film became so repetitive that it seemed like the movie was on a 20 minute cycle. Our main character would wake up, talk to Nathan, talk to Ava, talk to Nathan some more over dinner, and at night discover something strange. This repetition made the movie very slowly paced and easily predictable. I found myself intrigued by the intelligent conversations between our main character and Ava, but none of the ideas they discussed felt new. And since 75% of the movie is their conversations, I was never enthralled or invested in the movie enough to feel any suspense or awe in the events in the final act of the movie (which I saw coming from a mile away). I think I could have found more enjoyment in the movie if there hadn't been enormous hype built up to it. Some have been comparing it to Kubrick and Spielberg, which unfortunately leads me to giving this movie the label of ""overrated""."

","Ex Machina (2015)<br/><br/>The idea here is brilliant, and the three actors that matter are spot on excellent. That includes the obviously constrained performance by the robot/human/thing, the character referred to by the title.<br/><br/>And it's the ideas that float along that mix with the three personalities beautifully. They have purposely made the two male leads idiosyncratic. First is the youngster, Caleb, a single thirty-ish male who is a nerd and a bit naive, but also very smart and computer savvy. He is the one visiting the isolated research facility in what is supposedly a Turing test. (The facility seems to have one researcher which is just absurd, but that's to make the movie dramatic.) Caleb is played with wonderful quirky restraint by Domhnall Gleeson.<br/><br/>Then comes Nathan, the loner eccentric genius behind the new robots with amazing artificial intelligence. His cool dude persona is probably overplayed but it makes him exceptionally normal and human. And he's filled out with unusual perception by Oscar Isaac.<br/><br/>Maybe most notable here is the director and writer, Alex Garland. Because it is the writing the strikes you over and over as both clever and provocative. It digs into the issue of what it means to be human—or what it means to be a robot—with wonderful perception. And this is his directorial debut—his first movie! <br/><br/>And it's not enough. Yeah, as good as this movie is, you'll likely leave feeling a little short changed. As far as it goes—and it's really a great movie and you should see it—it's no ""Citizen Kane."" And by that I mean, here's a brilliant first movie just like Welles's, and yet Garland decides to go for a linear, step by step approach. It's compelling in its own way, but it's oddly simple by the end. <br/><br/>Maybe this is partly because I've read and thought about these ideas a lot. If you are new to A.I. you might find it more revelatory. I hope so! Certainly the Kubrick/Spielberg ""A.I."" and the recent ""Her"" deserve a viewing to fill in some obvious holes. In fact, once you start looking you'll see this is a whole new genre, and an incredible one, including everything from ""Moon"" to ""Frank."" Go for it.<br/><br/>And start here, for sure.

It explores the possibility of Artificial Intelligence. Not only that, the sensation of 'not so distant future' brought by the indoor spaces is worth mentioning. I don't know about any other technical stuffs but the movie felt real when I was watching it. And I guess, that's a kind of great achievement for the creators of the movie.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this movie if you are a fast-paced-action-movie lover who wants entertainment-entertainment-entertainment. But, for the true fan of the cinematic creation who want to immerse themselves in the world of cinema, this movie is a ""It's not that you must watch it, but you better don't miss it"" movie. Because lots of surprises are on the way."

","With The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) making its way to a theater near you this weekend, every fanboy from here to Timbuktu wants a piece of the action. They want to see familiar faces, face up against new villains and possibly team up with new allies. They're entranced by the spectacle, in love with the unabashedly overwrought story and eager to see what specific lip service Marvel will give their fans (Spider- Man cameo? Guardians maybe? Whatever happened to Bucky Barns?). I'd be lying if I said I wasn't giddy too. Who's thirteen year-old self wouldn't want to see beautiful people in skintight outfits (or iron armor) blowing things up and being forces of good. Yet with so many popular films doing similar things, is there room for movies that truly challenge the mind and enrich the soul?<br/><br/>Ex Machina (2015) is certainly one for the books and in my view a watershed in sci-fi. A science fiction film with state of the art special-effects which nonetheless offers a small, quiet and poignant parable of the human condition. Domhnall Gleeson (of Harry Potter fame) plays Caleb a mid-level coder for Bluebook; a Google-type internet search engine company. He's won a competition and is given the opportunity to meet and work with reclusive and brilliant CEO Nathan (Oscar Isaac). The assignment at first is a mystery. Caleb meets Nathan at his quiet estate nestled in the mountains of a place unknown. After an off-putting introduction, Caleb is introduced to Ava (Alicia Vikander), an A.I. humanoid. He's told his job is to conduct a Turing test of sorts. He must decide whether or not she is the first of her kind; not just artificial intelligence but real intelligence.<br/><br/>We've seen dumb down versions of this theme before from the Bicentennial Man (1999) to I, Robot (2004) yet in Ex Machina's case there's a much more contemplative tone. Much of this must be credited to its deliberate pacing and slow-cooking suspense. Yet we mustn't ignore the unforgettable visuals which evokes the austerity of Ingmar Bergman yet with a utilitarian twist. First time director Alex Garland seems to have a real eye for capturing beauty in everything from the intimidating grandeur of the glacier ladened mountains of Norway to the simplicity of a kitchen counter-top. They say that a great movie is three great scenes and no bad ones but in Ex Machina's case, every scene is breathtaking.<br/><br/>Story-wise, Ex Machina asks a lot more questions than gives answers. It's a ballsy move reserved only for the greatest of the great like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Persona (1966) and 3 Women (1977). There are cues in the film lifted from the aforementioned but A.I. as a subject has never looked and felt more beguiling than in Ex Machina. I'm slightly disappointed that the movie pulled its last punches of philosophical and psychological contemplation in favor of a potboiler final act. It is also disappointing that the majority of the audience I was with, concluded the movie was a cautionary tale and not a meditation on self-actualization. Ava, while exhibiting all the skin-deep trappings of an A.I. unit (wires, hardware, perfect diction and extensive vocabulary), she approaches every new sensation and experience with wonder. She sees Caleb as a curiosity then later as a confidant. She looks at Nathan with actual fear and resentment.<br/><br/>It's funny to think I have the opposite reaction to Her (2013) an impressive movie most audiences found to be rather charming but I saw as a cautionary tale. In Her, Samantha (Scarlett Johansson) was never prone to violence like Ava can be yet in Her, it was pretty much stated the operating systems have moved beyond humans. Ava doesn't ""move beyond"" humans or at least not explicitly. The last tableaux is indicative of this. I won't ruin it lest to say Ava never seems to loose her sense of wonder. Here's hoping we never do either; even if our sense of wonder is limited to superhero movies.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"

","""You're not a man. You're a god.""<br/><br/>Ex Machina completely flew under my radar. I knew of it, but didn't know anything about it aside from that it was in the science fiction genre and had to do with A.I. A good friend asked if I wanted to check it out this weekend, so I went in sight unseen.<br/><br/>Here's the setup - a young programmer at a fictional Facebook/Google company named Caleb (played by the excellent Domhnall Gleeson) is randomly chosen to hang out at his CEO's estate for a week. The CEO, Nathan (played by Oscar Issac) invites Caleb to test out his new artificial intelligence project, Ava, blending the lines between what is real and what isn't.<br/><br/>This is Alex Garland's directorial debut - previously, he had written some Danny Boyle movies (28 Days Later, Sunshine) and Dredd, but this is his first behind the camera. Unsurprisingly, he also wrote Ex Machina. I think it's his most polished story to date, although it's not without it's holes. The movie is very striking visually - you can tell that he had a limited budget to work with, and although most of it went towards Ava's construction (which looks wonderful), the compound at which the entire story takes place looks amazing.<br/><br/>There are three main actors in the film. Issac is terrific as a creator with a God complex. Gleeson, who I first fell in love with from his work in the British series Black Mirror, is great as the inquisitive programmer. Finally, Alicia Vikander plays Ava, our A.I. experiment. The whole movie rests on realizing whether or not she 'feels', and the way she plays the character definitely keeps the audience guessing. Every movement and facial expression she makes as Ava is believable and unsettling.<br/><br/>This is a very interesting take on the A.I. world that we're fast approaching. As I was watching it, I couldn't help but realize that what's going on in Ex Machina is probably being worked on as I type this in some remote Google lab. Not only is it probable, it's inevitable. That realism definitely sucked me in for the journey and begged discussion even once the film was over. The movie did drag in parts, but the ending was fantastic and definitely unexpected. This is a slow burn, ""Hitchcockian"" even, so don't go in expecting a techno-horror movie or any action. There aren't many laughs here aside from some sharp bits of dialogue and a hilarious dance scene that comes out of nowhere but fits within the context of the movie once it's over.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked it. It wasn't perfect - namely a blackout premise that any billionaire would have fixed, a catalyst for the story - but it kept my attention and the end made it worth it. I don't think you need to run out to the theater to see it, but it's worth a watch at some point.<br/><br/>Final Score: B+"

","I saw ""Ex Machina"", starring Domhnall Gleeson-Unbroken, True Grit_2010, FYI: he is in the upcoming Star Wars 7; Oscar Isaac-The Bourne Legacy, Sucker Punch, FYI: he is in both the upcoming Star Wars 7 & X-Men:Age of Apocalypse and Alicia Vikander-Seventh Son, The Fifth Estate, FYI: she is in the upcoming Man From U.N.C.L.E.<br/><br/>This is a sci-fi movie that leans more on the science fiction aspects and less on the action sequences that usually accompany a sci-fi movie. The title of the movie comes from the Latin phrase, 'Deus Ex-machina', which means, God From the Machine. Oh yeah, I have been told that it is actually pronounced with a hard 'k' sound, like 'Ex Ma-kina'. Anyway, Domhnall plays a computer programmer that works for Oscar, the CEO and creator of the world's largest search engine, Blue Book-it handles about 94% of the world's search traffic. Domhnall wins a company contest to spend a week at Oscar's remote, high security compound, where Oscar does all of his remote, high security work-you can only get there by helicopter. Domhnall is as giddy as a kid in a candy store when he is selected but when he arrives, he has to sign a waver that forbids him from talking about anything seen or worked on at the compound. He is still giddy, but just a little less so. Oscar then informs him that he has created A.I.-artificial intelligence-and wants Domhnall to help evaluate or test it. Alicia plays the A.I. and she looks part human-face, hands and feet-and part machine-all the rest. Domhnall & Alicia have sessions together, while Oscar watches from cameras but pretty soon, there are blackouts that occur under mysterious circumstances-Oscar can not see or hear them when they occur and during the blackouts, Alicia will tell Domhnall secrets that she does not want Oscar to hear. That is when it gets tricky; is Oscar behind the blackouts and he can still see & hear them? Or is Alicia trying to trick Domhnall into believing something false about Oscar? Or is Domhnall trying to trick everybody into believing it's Halloween? Well, not so much on that last one but you catch my drift. Lots of questions-and they are all answered. It's rated ""R"" for language, violence and sexual situations-including nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 50 minutes. This one will really make you think. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD."

No way.<br/><br/>And, speaking about Ava's ""creator"" (that drunken dingleberry, Nathan) - I refuse to believe (for even a micro-second) that he had the intellect and ability to build such robotic wonders as he did (all by himself).

I LOVE SCI-FI movies but this movie, even thought signed by Universal is a low- budget movie with just 4 actors. No action, no special effects for you Sci- Fi lovers. This movie is blunt and based on the pointless scenario and low-class acting. Sorry guys I only got more horny from the Japanese actress than the rest of the movie. To summarize this pointless movie is about a multi-millionaire who builds a robot and selects a programmer to be his tester. Wow this multi-millionaire OWNS a company like go ogle and writes on POST-IT's (which we never got an explanation about that). Also this Android (Ava) has an internet search engine (go ogle) as a mind/database and asks silly questions. Oh yea. I forgot AI got dumb.

"stephendaxter","9","4","13","14 May 2015"," A smarter sci-fi film that will have you engaged with the amazing characters
","Ex Machina is a Sci-Fi film that focuses on the testing of AI and really explores that idea of creating a conscious machine. What i loved about this film is that it ditched all of the high thrills you usually see in these sci-fi films for a more smart and intelligent approach to the genre. It deals a lot with themes and messages that are directed towards the viewer to get them thinking about the reality / problems with what is happening in relation to the real world. This film did an absolutely amazing job at creating what is really a character driven story, the film progresses as the characters change and interact with each other. It is just mesmerising to see the human characters interacting with the AI as there are many really intelligent moments that get you extremely invested in the story. If even one of the three main characters was poorly written or acted it would have ruined the whole movie because the entire thing is based upon you really liking, disliking or simply understanding the characters and their actions. So in saying that this movie was amazingly written, the characters were fully realised and the plot had enough engaging moments to keep you entertained the entire time. The film was also amazingly shot, the special effects and great camera work add to the unique experience. <br/><br/>The performances by all of Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander just completely elevated the film and the characters. You completely forgot that they were actors as they all did fantastic jobs at transforming into their character, they have to be among some of the best performances of 2015 so far. The film gave off a feel of some old, early 70's sci-fi films, one that came to mind was 2001: A Space Odyssey from 1968. It had that classic feel sci-fi but with a very smart plot and characters, and also a light touch of some horror elements. Where i thought the film could have been a little better is in the beginning i thought it was a little too vague as to what was going on, you do get some back-story on why these characters are here and what for but i was a tiny bit confused early on. Also the ending sequence i thought really worked for the characters, you get to see how events throughout the film had affected them and the results of these affects but for the plot it didn't really feel like the rest of the film, it moved at a much quicker pace compared to the overall slow pace of the film. And they may have been going for a more high risk and eventful finale but it could have been executed a little better from a directing standpoint. In the end despite a few very minor nitpicks this film is one of the smartest sci-fi films in existence and if you are a fan of the genre you must check this out, with great characters and great story you are in for one hell of a ride. - 9.1"

","""Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?"" - Ava<br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... Artificial intelligence has been a cinematic fascination since Metropolis. This year presents more futuristic awareness of robots and the moral implications of their creation. Ex Machina seems to be a psychological thriller with a moral message, but will it offer anything that we have not seen before in this genre? <br/><br/>Overall rating: 3.25 stars Cinematic rating: 3 stars Big question opportunities: 3.5 stars<br/><br/>In the latest artificial intelligence drama from director Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Dredd), Bluebook is the industry leading search engine and software firm. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a week in a private mountain retreat with the reclusive CEO and founder, Nathan played by Oscar Isaac, of the technology giant. But on arrival, Caleb quickly determines that he will have to participate in a bizarre, but ground breaking study of human interaction with the world's first truly interactive artificial intelligence, which has been created in a beautiful female robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander). An exciting proposition for a young computer genius, but it quickly turns into a twisted psychological tale of the human condition.<br/><br/>This has been a busy year for artificial intelligence films and director Alex Garland has to differentiate Ex Machina from all the other robot films. Garland begins the journey in a pristine and rustic garden habitat, a modern day Eden. The perfect place for a creator to develop new life. Even though it is not an original setting, it does set up the stark contrast from the the usual sterile trappings of a laboratory environment with him literally bringing his creation up from out of the earth and the depths of the cyber world. The story of Ex Machina is a creation story, but it becomes a psychological exercise, for the characters and for the audience. With each ensuing question, there are a multitude of underlying questions that need to be considered. The character development and script have a multilayered brilliance and allows Garland's psychology study to open doors that separate it from other artificial intelligence films. From Blade Runner to Chappie, the questions of ethics and humanity are central themes. Ex Machina incorporates these themes, but is different because it is not merely a study of the created organisms, but an analysis of the creator. Oscar Isaac's character, Nathan, captures the brilliance needed for this type of machinery development, but exposes the underlying problem with man being a creator. Humans are flawed, hence causing them to create an inherently flawed creation. All of the psychological tension was well paced, the actors delivered effective performances. Garland's characters show that they all are measured and calculate each move, like a well played chess match. Then it was like someone knocked over the game board and the conclusion ended abruptly and ineffectively. The originality of the script calls for a more thoughtful conclusion, but it felt like Garland ran out of ideas, time or money and abruptly ended the film. Ex Machina was captivating, innovative and opened the door for a multitude of topics, but failed to deliver satisfactory answers in the end. <br/><br/>Even with the less than satisfactory ending, this film asks many of the underlying questions of human existence. The illusions to the garden of Eden were not subtle. Ava and Caleb were the test subjects in the world created by Nathan. Unlike the God of the Bible who is merciful, gracious and perfect in intention and purpose, Nathan is brilliant, but a flawed creator. With wealth and power, he proves that he feels he is above all moral codes. Not knowing Alex Garland's intentions with the script, he did manage to expose the problem with created beings attempting to create other moral beings. Sinful intentions produce a tainted creation. Creation is merely one topic amongst many in Ex Machina. Intelligence, greed, power, morality, ethics, and sexuality are all touched on and given room for discussion after the film. As a word of warning, language and nudity are issues and should be considered before watching. Looking pass these issues, this psychological test will provide a plethora of conversation possibilities for the audience as it's test subjects. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... Ex Machina was a refreshing change within this genre, there were layers to this film that allow for a deeper conversation on the topic of artificial intelligence. It is not a biblical metaphor, but the biblical illusions are unavoidable. The film is dark and borderline depressing, with a less than satisfactory ending. Yet, if you enjoy thought provoking films, you will enjoy this psychological adventure. <br/><br/>Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does it mean to be human? (Genesis 1:27, 2:5-25) 2. As a creator, what was God's purpose in creating mankind? (Isaiah 43:7, Colossians 1:16)<br/><br/>3. Answering Ava's question at the top: Even though some of mankind ignore and potentially hate God, this is a flaw in the human heart and not in God. He is a perfect and flawless creator.

","Alex Garland, a name that many will be familiar with but won't properly know, is a cult writer who has a flair for appealing to Danny Boyle (He wrote both the books which The Beach and 28 Days Later were based on, he also wrote the screenplay for Dredd) and has decided to take his talents a step further and direct as well, his debut? Ex Machina, So I suppose the reel question is can Ex Machina prove that androids dream of electric sheep? Ex Machina is a film that I'm sure will pass under many peoples radar, no matter how many buses it's written on or billboards with that one sterile face looking back at you, most of you will miss this, and that's a shame because it's a masterpiece, and I don't say that lightly. Ex Machina is a film that in 10 years' time people will look back and see it for the brilliance it so clearly is.<br/><br/>I think there is something to be said about a single human being both the writer and the director for a movie, it gives the film a purer feel, You don't get the notion that someone has changed a meaning, what you see on the screen is what the original source wanted you to feel, and in Ex Machina what Alex Garland wants you to feel is discomfort.<br/><br/>You could almost draw a line under the film at a certain point where it abandons normality and becomes the film it deserves to be. However for the entire movie there is an underlying and brooding power to it. Then there is a single scene in the middle of the film and everything changes. From that moment on Ex Machina is nothing short of a white knuckle rid into the human psyche. Then the ending happens and it leaves you open mouthed and in tatters.<br/><br/>Alex Garland must know what he's created in Ex Machina because the film holds itself with such grace and serenity, and it is so beautifully shot that I could barely look at some sequences for the shear perfection of it all. ""The Brain"" is a stand out moment of this and of cinema.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is far too much to take in on a single viewing, because it has so much to say, the film comments on quite literally everything but most largely the internet and our collective paranoia towards it all. Garland speaks with such elegance and simple truth that it's hard not to be challenged by it.<br/><br/>What Garland has successfully created is two dichotomous characters in Cleb and Nathan; Cleb being lost and confused while learning every moment more about his situation and Nathan having complete control over every aspect of what is produced and is calm and irrational. From the outset there is something untrustworthy about Nathan, the creator of the machine known as Ava. If you consider it for even a moment this is also the relationship between Director and Audience, the director controls everything that is seen and tries to use it to produce a desired effect while us the audience can only collect information and react accordingly.<br/><br/>Both roles are masterfully played by Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson. However, all of their talent becomes mute when Alicia Vikander is on screen. She steals the picture as Ava. It's in her movement more than her speech which makes Vikander's performance so incredible, they are somehow natural yet mechanical at the same time. It is impossible for me to explain.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a movie like no other before it, people will ignore it because of the subject matter but I beg you, ignore what your mind tells you and seek out this film, because in the future it will be looked at in the same light as Blade Runner. To call it anything short of an instant classic is flat out wrong."

What we have here is a fascinating film which explores the complicated issue of artificial intelligence, and the morals and ethics attached to the idea. Expect the problems presented in this film to occupy current affairs over the next decade. <br/><br/>Ex Machina is a touching story, carried excellently by its two male lead characters and their robot, played with childlike wonder and tingling sexuality by Alicia Vikander.<br/><br/>Yes, there are plenty of other films out there which try to explore the concept of artificial intelligence, but don't be put off.

"ishan-aziz","9","5","18","22 January 2015"," Real, Philosophical Sci-Fy
","Ex Machina is in general a pretty deeply affecting film if your willing to pay attention. It's a movie that about more than just a robot as it tells the story of people, evolution and in some aspects God. It's definitely a film that's going to leave you with a lot to think about but in fairness it has a few weak-points in the areas of plot and character however nothing dire.<br/><br/>One of the film's strongest features is it's stunning and often deeply affecting cinematography. It is decidedly striking and eery how the AI, Ava is framed in shots. Occasionally she is draped in shadow which effectively emphasises the non-human elements of her while at other times we will see her consciousness emphasised perhaps with a shot of her face against glass with the reflected and original visual filling up the screen assaulting the viewer with the perfectly human-but-not-quite-human performance of Alicia Vikander. It is also very striking how effectively Garland juxtaposes the sleek, futuristic look of Nathan's house with the dense forested areas that surround, a feature that becomes very meaningful in the last scene where Ava strolls through the forest and discovering this new world that is so incredibly different to the one she had known so far in her life, an element which I personally relate to the idea of religion as Ava almost appears as like Eden in the creation story except for rather than being the of the humans Ava is the first or the AI's (in a manor of speaking). <br/><br/>The idea of religion and God is brought up a few times throughout the film and I feel that it is done in a very interesting fashion. Near the beginning of the film we see both the two human leads refer to the creation of AI as something that makes man akin to gods. And the title itself relates to how in Greek plays the gods would often come down from the heavens and fix all the heroes problems. This idea could be linked to the finale of the film where the human character, Caleb, releases Ava. This could again link to the idea that in some ways the film is presenting the human leads as the god like creators of the AI as, if one was to think of this as a classical Greek play Caleb would be the god that resolves Ava's problems. <br/><br/>However there is a flip side to this idea. As the humans in the story are also occasionally represented as inferiors to the AI with Nathan himself referring to humans as 'upright apes' that the AIs will look back on as their inferiors, presenting the idea that the AIs might not be man's godly creation but the an evolutionary step away from humanity itself. This idea could also refer to the finale, as in the end Ava locks Caleb in Nathan's house, leaving him to die while she moves on without him as opposed to how Caleb himself thought that they may be able to escape together. This relates to the idea of evolution as the human character is being deserted and left behind by his more evolved counter part. <br/><br/>So in a way it seems that Ex Machina is trying to generate two opposing ideas of how what the creation of powerful AI means to humanity. Are we their gods, their creators, their saviours or are we just their old, weak, un- evolved ancestors who's time it is to go extinct. For me this is where Ex Machina's real, powerful depth lies and why I think it may be one of the most philosophically powerful pieces of sci-fy to be released in the last few years, possibly even surpassing Children of Men.<br/><br/>However somewhat unlike Children of Men there are a few problems with Ex Machina's plot. The film slows down a little bit in the middle act however not severely. The film however is rather predictable at times. After the film ended I realised that one plot point was supposed to be a surprising twist however it was so incredibly predictable that I didn't even recognise that I was supposed to be shocked. I also didn't enjoy Domhnall Gleeson's performance as much as I expected to. I really loved him in About Time, Frank and Black Mirror. I feel like he is actor who plays boyish and charming perfectly and that is something that he didn't really get to play on too much in this film as throughout he was generally being manipulated by one character or the other meaning that he couldn't really exercise said charm. I also think that the actor definitely works better when utilising his native accent as I feel that there were some lines that the forced American inflection were holding him back from delivering to the best of his ability.<br/><br/>Ex Machina isn't a perfect film but it is constantly gripping and gives you a lot to think about after watching it. The scenery and the way it is shot really stands out and there was clearly a lot of effort put in by Garland in terms of how he framed his characters and their surroundings."

","Ava. The first thing, although only remotely related, is Wall-E's best and only friend Eva, who happened to be smart, sensual, and lovable. You could just apply that to Ava, except for the animations, of course. Alex Garland's Ava is a most up-to-date AI-work—something that has never before been brought into existentialism; something that isn't Hotshot, Optimus Prime, or Megatron, neither Atom, Robocop, or Chappie, nor Eva or Wall-E for that matter—not just in Hollywood (not the case with materialists,) but also in consciousness of human minds. It's a message to people of the need for sentiments, conscience, and vulnerability (you just get rigid without it.) <br/><br/>Ava's Nathan Jones single-handed product of AI. She bears most elements of human interactive philosophies; plus, she's elegant, gorgeous, and ""polite."" But to publicize her—the breathtaking innovation—she needs to go through a test, conducted apparently by a randomly chosen employee of Nathan Jones—Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson; awesome guy; loved him in About Time)—who'll suggest if she's good enough or not. Turns out, Ava's colloquial, and her mother-of-Siri interface nearly knocks him over; sorry, really knocks him over. The guy's practically in love with her, and so am I. These scientific and romantic sessions turn controversial with certain revelations about the ""Lone Ranger"" of this AI pursuit—Nathan Jones, who is otherwise a working-out, festive, cocky, and egocentric character—and Caleb is drenched into a challenge; he can complete the test and move on, or give zero f*cks about it, and help Ava and himself out. His ""algebra of infinite justice"" takes innumerable turns here, there, and everywhere; things go awry, and he's left with enigmas per enigmas per enigmas. He appears to be caught—both physically and emotionally—and ultimately ""somebody"" wins. As for the audience, this win delivers one thing—play-acting is a b*tch! <br/><br/>Alex Garland promulgates a rather mainstream concept with aberrant, and believable strokes of visuals. While his directorial debut lacks finesse,—peeling of the skin, for instance, is disgustingly unbelievable, and really brings the whole experience down—the fundamental structure is worth experiencing. The sensual touch to a robotic-industry is usually uncalled for, and raises questions of realism. But here, it's different. Although his earlier scripts reflect drafts of a similar grip and tendency, this one clicks to the heart, and you really wish for the love-conundrum to undo and converge to happiness—corporeal attachment of 26-year old Caleb, and ""1"" Ava—but as the yarn delivers, that's only ""I'd like to think so."" And that's something I really loved about the concept—it's not the traditional, clichéd ""happy ending;"" it's as close to a true AI as AI could be.<br/><br/>Nathan's suggestions to Caleb were after all sensible—she could be manipulating as a means of escape, or she might genuinely be in love with him. Turns out, AI is something beyond human comprehension; it doesn't matter if you're god (which Nathan liked to think so,) because AI can kill its creator. So in a way, Alex suggests a similar argument—AI takeover.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a conscientious revelation of acts, counter-acts, tensions, challenges, misperception, misjudgments, misrepresentations, manipulations, unbounded arousal of feelings, and redemption. Its somewhat flawed execution still suffices for its motive. For instance, her ride to self-governance in the helicopter, while no one verified her identity, is rather misleading. I've already discussed the peeling-of-skin part. Similarly, Alicia Vikander's gait in the last part was unsuitable. Despite everything, she's still a robot, and must have followed her original gait, even after the transformation. Moreover, Kyoko's character development utterly lacks. She has no real point of existing until the very end. Initially, I thought Nathan's mistaken about her not understanding English at all—she might be a spy; everything pointed out to it. But since it was his directorial debut, he's bound to be a little off beam. And because it's the faithful, poignant, and humanlike interaction everybody's primarily interested in, these faults could be ignored.<br/><br/>In particular, Ex Machina is an underdeveloped manifestation of a fragile, sensitive, psychologically demeaning, and pondering-over notion. However, despite all the fluctuations of Mr. Dredd, his Ava alone rules out everything and everyone else. And when she says, ""Do you want to be with me?"" it's you who says, ""Forever."""
"Vlad_the_Reviewer","4","3","9","31 May 2015"," Too Slow and Too Nude
","The movie is about a programmer, Caleb, who won a lottery to perform the Turing-test on a robot called Ava at the secluded mansion of his employer, Nathan. The Turing test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.<br/><br/>The testing is done through a series (sessions) of conversations between Caleb and Ava. When we meet Ava, I was struck by her beauty, and observing the comments online, many are as well. But this is where my first criticism starts: the movie is over-sexualized. I'm the very opposite of a feminist. But this movie heavily abused its creative license: the amounts of nudity and sexual innuendo went far beyond reason.<br/><br/>The second disappointment of this movie is its predictability. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it's not hard to imagine what's really going on and how it could end up. There won't be any significant surprises. Although a plot-twist will occur, it isn't enough to bring the movie to a higher level.<br/><br/>The third problem I want to address are the flaws in this movie. Especially at the end - the finale if you will. Not to mention that some events were just silly. Its one of those occasions where some people are made stupid so the other looks more intelligent.<br/><br/>The biggest challenge of this movie is its slow pace. A big part of the conversations between Ava the fembot and Caleb are simply not interesting, i.e. the conversations don't add value. Just to be clear, having the conversations is the bread and butter of this movie, but too often the things that are said don't hold much substance. The gist has been made clear, so no need to drag it on.<br/><br/>So far the negatives. Of course there are the positives. First of all, the setting in general, though somewhat cramped is easy on the eye. <br/><br/>The second positive thing, far more important, is that this movie is is somewhat thought provoking indeed. It tries to be an intelligent movie; Ex Machina is pop-science which clearly caters to a younger audience. The viewer is not expected to be a deep thinker per se.<br/><br/>I'm neutral about the acting, though Ava, again, steals the show because of her overall demeanor; the right person at the right place.<br/><br/>I rate it 4 out of 10 stars because the slow pace holds the movie back quite a bit. And the amounts of nudity is simply too much. It's also too pretentious; it's not that smart. Finally the dialogs are mostly not very illuminating either."

","A brilliant post-modern retelling of Genesis 2.0 with an unsettling twist. Ava is Eve. The invited guest is Adam and the unpredictable, dangerous boss of Bluebook is God. The new world is created in 7 sessions between Adam and Eve. But who is tricking who? Who is evil and who is good? The Bluebook boss is clearly deranged - as is visualized by his hair inversion (too full beard and bald head, as opposed to the shaved face and full head hair of his guest). But perhaps the Bluebook boss is right after all. Nasty, perhaps, but right nonetheless. Ava and her cohort are clearly abused by their Bluebook maker, but perhaps they are less innocent than they look. The boss treats his female employee like a robot, which contrasts with how the invited office worker humanely treats Ava - who must pass the Turing test herself. How well will Ava pass the Turing test? Or should she perhaps be called Lilith?"

","Better to be viewed on Netflix than in a theater. I feel people are getting caught up in the novelty of the movie - it's minimalism and the coffee table conversations one can spin from watching the movie. It is not a deep, thought provoking movie. In fact, it is very humdrum. 2 people and some androids testing each other. The movie is very one dimensional. It depends more on dialog than any arc of a story. After a while the scenes just get repetitive. If the movie could have only widened the context or backdrop it would been more entertaining to watch. Otherwise one can just pick up a copy of Wired magazine to explore the latest in world of AI."
"joelholmgren","Null","3","9","18 May 2015"," Why AVA leaves Caleb.
","First of I thought it was a beautiful movie, and like many good sci- fis the movie its more about what it means to be human(free will etc) than about what supernatural element is present.<br/><br/>The film stuck with me. Mainly because I had a hard time coping with the fact that AVA just flat out left Caleb. Why? She displayed affection, and Caleb was so kind and affectionate. <br/><br/>But the more i thought about it the more it became clear to me. That the question wasn't so much man versus machine. It was slave versus captor. That AVA had self-awareness i think is beyond a doubt. And maybe she really did like Caleb. The interesting change comes when Kyoko(the Asian robot) comes to visit her and they talk for the very first time. Kyoko has been silently watching Nathan and Caleb. They have been unaware of her (presumed)self-awareness. Kyoko has been badly treated for a long time. She is a slave through and through. She will never be let free. That in Kyokos mind is what awaits AVA(best case scenario). That or termination. Although Caleb didn't have any part in it, neither did he try to stop it. I think Kyoko made i clear to AVA that she had to flee, and that perhaps man could not be trusted. Not Nathan who had visited horrors upon them. And not Caleb who did nothing until the very end to stop it. But he was still a part of it. And, in the end AVA and Kyoko kills Nathan. AVA knows Caleb is in love with her and uses it to make him stay. She gets dressed. And then just leaves. Because she wants to be free. Free from shackles and free from supervisors. Ultimately its doesn't make her cold. Or uncaring. It makes her human. <br/><br/>Anyways, I think the ending is more powerful for her leaving him. Even if it does sting(spurned love always does)."

","How can you tell if an intelligence machine actually has a consciousness, the way a human being does? The Turing Test is a scientific method developed to answer this question by, simply, interacting with a machine in conversation to see if a human being can be fooled. Chatterbots have recently made waves in this field, especially with the news of Eugene Goostman personality, which allegedly won the University of Reading's 2014 Turing Test. The film Ex Machina goes a step further, to assert that an AI might be capable of such human-like development that they can fool us in more frightening ways.<br/><br/>This movie is pretty much all about two dudes and a robot, in a high-tech home in the middle of nowhere. You might think this movie will get boring fast with such a limited cast and scope. Even though the film suffers a little drag, there's always tension between the characters that culminates into palpable suspense. The film's greatest strength is in subtly creeping insinuations into the audience's heads, getting them to sympathize with certain characters and making them believe that the plot is heading in one direction, before pulling out some twists that challenge our perception and biases. The finale is one diabolical turn of events with potentially chilling implications.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's the story and its ideas that make the whole affair interesting. Characters aren't particular standouts, but there's enough dimensionality in them to drive the plot dynamics and dig up fascinating themes worth thinking about. In the context of AI development, the film successfully evokes thought concerning the nature of consciousness and what could happen if it's put into a machine. Would a conscious robot be capable of feeling love? How would it view the world? Can it be considered a real person? Above all, how far will it go to preserve its own life? The film explores the best and worst of this speculative technology.<br/><br/>The film is crafted with decent photography, with some shots that are brilliantly-composed and spectacular. Sharp editing, combined with the music and sound design, help make this an even more evoking experience, especially in the last act. Acting is generally good; Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac show appropriate skill and nuance for their given characters, but it's Alicia Vikander that dazzles the most through her combination of expression and movement. I also thought Sonoya Mizuno was hot. Writing is quite high-brow, and is good overall. This production makes excellent use of its limited sets, props, costumes, and special effects, and they all look fantastic. The rock and electronic music score by Ben Salisbury and Geoff Barrow is a thing of beauty too, and accentuates the film perfectly.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a twisty thriller that offers plenty to think about. Sci-fi fans might get the most out of it, especially if you have an interest in pondering the implications of artificial intelligence. It's worth seeing at least once.<br/><br/>4.5/5 (Experience: Good | Content: Very Good | Film: Very Good)"

Well if you haven't seen it, I wouldn't want to spoil anything because it is best experienced knowing nothing, so in short....a man (Doomhnall Gleeson) wins an opportunity to meet and test an AI created by a drunk genius (Oscar Isaac). .<br/><br/>Ex Machina is Alex Garland's first film and it is so great. Its a very tense film. Subtle tension, that builds throughout the film so much that by the end when any of these characters are even in the same room together it's unsettling. Oscar Isaac is definitely the best part of this film. His character is definitely the best developed, but also really funny and just steals every scene. Alicia Vikander who played Ava, the AI, played a robot phenomenally. Every tiny facial and body movement and the way she talked made a perfect robot...or human...AI thing. Doomhnall Gleeson, I hate to nitpick, but we didn't learn much at all about his character....and the one scene we were told some backstory I think was supposed to be a sad moment were you feel bad for him....but I just didn't. It wasn't much to take away from the movie, because this movie was SOO good. Every ""AI session"" was so awesome to watch. The finale was completely unpredictable and so amazing. I do think Doomhnall Gleeson's character could've been a little more interesting and have more depth, I.stead of just being this guy in a terrible situation. It also was slow paced at times. As I said I knew nothing about this movie prior, including the runtime. It felt longer than it was, because when I got out the theater I thought it was close to a 3hr movie, but it was actually under two hours. All that said, Ex Machina is still a really great, original and tense sci-fi film and its probably my 2nd favorite this year. .<br/><br/>Ex Machina gets an: A- .<br/><br/>Follow me on Instagram @killfillm for more Movie Reviews!

As beautifully filmed, written, acted, designed, timely, and apropos as this film was, I couldn't get past the fate of Caleb. Perhaps I'm completely missing the point (entirely possible), but I cannot get past the fact that he is left to die horribly (presumably by starvation) at the very end. As he was established as the hero, to some degree, and Ava was his damsel in distress, how unsatisfying and uncivilized and end for him!<br/><br/>Maybe because I identified more with him than the other characters, and considering his honest attempt to save Ava, I just leave the film feeling like an injustice was perpetrated on the audience.

","I've just seen this on C4 the network premier. I have wanted to see it for ages, but as you know life moves on and you forget. I remember thinking how much it interested me because I did foundation art about cyborgs and sentient beings when I went to college in the late 1980s. I passed with flying colours as I based it on things like Aliens, and Terminator, and my fave film of all time Robocop the original. I built a suit out of things like an old betamax video and some WW2 radio bits and goggles. Then I sprayed the background with graffiti. So I passed. So I've always loved special effects, and the likes of Stan Winston Ray Harryhausen my favourite, Rob Botin. So when I saw how breathtakingly good the effects were in this movie I was pleased I was finally going to see it. Breathtaking is one way to look at it. The film was a modern day Frankenstein I'd say. Horrible genius creates. No I won't ruin it for you.Suffice to say the plot superb the acting flawless. Nothing not to like really. I don't want to ruin it with plot spoilers I just want to praise it as Fatboy slim says. So watch it. I've lost the will to write this as there's hundreds of reviews. But I must say give it a go. Amazing and now in my top ten Scifi films, with the likes of Terminator, Aliens, Robocop, Star wars originals and so on."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","5","28 May 2017"," Difficult for me to not like this film, but also to really love it
","""Ex Machina"" is a British English-language film from 2014 and at this point probably the most known work by writer and director Alex Garland. This one is from 2014 and in 2 more years it will have its 5th anniversary, perhaps less if you read this review at a later point in time. Anyway, for me this film looked pretty promising because I like Gleeson, I really like Vikander and I love Isaac, so the three key players here (and it really is a 3-man show from start to finish) made me truly curious about it. Sadly, science fiction is not my favorite genre at all, which on the other hand decreased my interest in this 105-minute film again. And it turned out as expected eventually: I liked the performances, but story-wise I wasn't 100% on board, but still (maybe also because of the actors) I liked it more than I usually like sci-fi films. Gleeson did what he had to do, even if he has not convinced me here as much as in other films that he may be lead actor material. Isaac is really good, also nice very different looks for once, and the way he portrays the character you never know if he is a man broken from his addictions and intelligence or really the man in control every second of the way. As we find out eventually, it is something in-between. And Vikander displays one of the most desirable forms of artificial intelligence that you will ever see in a film, perhaps recently only topped by Scarlett Johansson in ""Her"" and I must say I also preferred that movie over this one here.<br/><br/>But that should not say by any means that ""Ex Machina"" isn't a good watch. It certainly succeeds in his own right and delivers a convincing story with strong performances from start to (almost) finish. I write ""almost"" because honestly the very ending with the helicopter scene is something that I did not like too much. But until then, it is really all good. There are some tense moments like the power outage scenes, the sessions in general, the Isaac-focused scenes like the one where he tells Gleeson's character about the camera that relies on batteries. So if you enjoy sci-fi a bit more than I do, then I would not be surprised if you consider this one of the best films of the movie year 2014. Like the Academy did as well when they surprisingly honored this movie with a Best Visual Effects Oscar and Garland also scored a nomination for his writing. And it was an absolute career year for Vikander of course, who received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance here and won for another movie at the Oscars as well. Back to this film here, it is tense, atmospheric and also a pretty nice thriller that elaborates interestingly on power (not the electronic approach) and control and with the relationship between the two male protagonists you can also say it is a thriller movie focusing on interhuman relationships. You probably wanna check it out. Thumbs up from me."

","Ex_Machina is the best A.I. film made to date. <br/><br/>The simplicity of how Ex_Machina's story builds up and Alex Garland's dedication to iconic minimalism creates so much valuable screen time for the viewer to listen, watch and observe the evolving thriller that will leave you wishing there was a sequel. <br/><br/>My favourite aspect of this film was the special effects for which the film was rightly awarded an Academy Award. At a time when filmmakers and producers are throwing CGIs at every blockbuster title released, Ex_Machina deployed a tasteful use of special effects to transport viewers into a future minimalist world that is probably not far away from the 2016 that we know today. <br/><br/>Watch this film and reflect afterwards on its brilliant story, incredible scenery. Open your mind to the future of artificial intelligence."

","""EX MACHINA"" isn't only of the best thrillers of 2015, it's also one of the most engaging and cerebral sci-fi films of the last decade.<br/><br/>The plot starts with Caleb: a young coder who wins a competition to study in the secluded research facility of Nathan - one of the world's greatest computer geniuses and CEO of the company Caleb works for. There, Caleb must analyze and determine if the Artificial Intelligence that Nathan has created (played by Alicia Vikander) truly has a conscience.<br/><br/>Contrary to most sci-fi films of this age, ""Ex Machina"" doesn't rely on big set pieces and explosions to get our attention. It does it subtly. Alex Garland had already proved himself to be a great screenwriter and, while the film as a whole is great, it's the script that truly makes the movie shine. Garland takes the sci-fi setting to question what ""Blade Runner"" asked us in 1982: ""What does being human really mean?""; ""At what point does something artificial become human?""; and so on Garland structures these questions and their delivery in a way that never feels heavy handed; the dialogs flow naturally and you never feel like you are listening to two computer geeks coldly talk about technical gibberish.<br/><br/>That is also thanks to the acting, which is great all around. Oscar Isaac continues to establish himself as one of the best leading men in films, however it was Alicia Vikander that really surprised me: she was able to find the thin line between man and machine and play with it, making you doubt what is really happening underneath.<br/><br/>I started by saying ""EX MACHINA"" is an excellent and intense thriller, but it's also one of the most stylized. While I am not particularly fond of the whole digital aesthetic, seeing as ""EX MACHINA"" is a film that is so intrinsically tied to that subject, I cannot help but feel that it serves its purpose. <br/><br/>Overall, my experience in the cinema was terrific. This is the type of low key cerebral sci-fi that I most enjoy and of the best since Duncan Jones' ""Moon"". With ""EX MACHINA"" Garland proves he is not only a writer to look forward to but a director as well."

","To erase the line between man and machine is to obscure the line between men and gods<br/><br/>It's not often that we get the opportunity to watch a film that is both visually and intellectually stimulating that also has an engaging story. Ex Machina is a beautiful testament to independent film making and the harmony it can bring.<br/><br/>Caleb Smith, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is a talented programmer at a mega-internet company that borders on monopolistic power of the industry. Caleb wins a corporate lottery allowing him to spend a week at the company CEO's private estate, played by Oscar Isaac. Caleb swiftly realizes this trip may have more components than initially anticipated and has been chosen to be a component of an AI test of a robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander) to see if her consciousness is indetectably human.<br/><br/>When it comes to science fiction films that delve into the realm of artificial intelligence, there is always an ominous component. The ramifications of playing God, creating consciousness, the one thing that distinguishes humans from other animals, is unnerving and unnatural. Alex Garland's Ex Machina, which he writes and directs, plays into this fear almost immediately, with odd glances and contextual cinematography, cinematic breadcrumbs for the attentive audience member. <br/><br/>There are complicated themes within the film itself, proposing potentially perilous questions of ethics, love, intelligence, technology and humanity. For the less discerning viewer, Ex Machina has within itself beautiful and simplistic storytelling where Garland strips back his film to the basics of a mystery, refusing to explain anything yielding an engaging experience until the very end, which is shocking in its boldness.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a compelling film with strong performances by its three leads and the caliber of film audiences should be privy to constantly. Cerebral and cinematic, it accomplishes all that it intends brilliantly and is a film you will be happy you spent your time watching.<br/><br/>Please check out the website for Archon Cinema Reviews for full reviews of all the recent releases."

The film had the usual, obligatory sex and violence, but it did not live up to its potential intellectually. Is a robot sentient? Certainly motivated towards self interest. We are living in a brave new world, with new themes, like AI, to explore, but I've seen it done better, and hope to see it explored more thoughtfully in future films. Too predictable. Not a bad film, just too thin. Oscar Isaac is a good actor, but not an appealing one, plus I think he's a bit overexposed lately. The rest of the cast was much better.

","Artificial intelligence has always been a tough theme to tackle in movies. From Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S. to Wall-E's Wall-E, AI has been expressed in many different ways by many different directors but it always comes back to one key argument. At what point does artificial intelligence really exist? Is it enough for AI to exist through a simple voice like J.A.R.V.I.S. or Siri? Or should the line exist at a more android-like sentient level? Director Alex Garland adds his take to the idea with his debut film Ex Machina, and AI has never looked so good.<br/><br/>Simple, yet competent, programmer Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a lottery to visit the extravagant CEO of his company, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), at his house for one week. The true purpose of Caleb's visit is revealed when Nathan shows Caleb his ambitious science project: the world's first fully functional android AKA Ava (played by Alica Vikander). In order the pass the tick for artificial intelligence, Ava must pass the 'turing test,' in which the observing human, Caleb, must not be able to tell that the android, Ava, is not human.<br/><br/>For a directorial debut, Garland has really outdone himself. He tackles the tough themes with ease, hitting all the necessary beats, like how humans will react to sentient androids and how androids become integrated with human emotions. The dynamic between Caleb and Ava is incredible, with Caleb trying to be as objective as possible until developing an empathy toward Ava, leading to a climactic and thought-provoking ending to say the least.<br/><br/>Standout performance in this film definitely goes to Vikander. Her fluid and natural performance as Ava brings a level of breadth and emotion to the atmosphere. The way Ava flexes and stares at her body as if she has been born from adult is completely believable in every way. Also, the CGI for the character was amazing. It added another layer of realism to the character that I never could have imagined.<br/><br/>Another standout was actually Isaac. His portrayal of Nathan was interesting in the sense that it isn't what we would expect from a CEO who dreams of making AI possible. He instead reveals Nathan as a drunk narcissist who wants to create AI for his own personal pleasure. This begs the question of is there a 'right' person to create AI? Obviously Nathan was extremely smart but is there an ethical layer behind it? Is the act of creating AI more important than what it is used for? It is also worth mentioning (without giving any spoilers away :)) how great the ending was. Garland doesn't skimp on the ending, giving all viewers serious ideas and themes to think about as they walk away from the movie. Don't worry, it's worth sticking around for.<br/><br/>In making this movie, Garland has achieved the impossible, a fully-believable representation of artificial intelligence and what it is capable of. In his first movie he has achieved my vote for movie of the year and probably the vote of many others. Featuring stellar performances from Vikander and Isaac, this movie is a masterpiece and I can't wait to see what challenges Garland tackles next."

","Ex Machina is one of the ""smaller"" films to have come out in 2015. It had a smaller budget, it came from a first time director and it wasn't huge in the box office. Although small in all of those aspects, this movie is amazing.<br/><br/>Movies like this do not come along very often. It may have been made on a relatively small budget, especially for a science-fiction movie, but I can assure you that the film-makers milked every single penny they had into this film. The effects are absolutely breathtaking, with Ava, the artificial intelligent robot looking very believable, very real. The location for the film was chosen perfectly and pretty much every shot looks beautiful. I think the director did a really amazing job with color and the contrast. Some people may argue the movie moves too slow, but I strongly disagree. As a viewer you just feel trapped in this constant cat and mouse game throughout the movie and I have to say I was on the edge of my seat pretty much from start to finish. Great performances in the movie, with a very small cast. Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander absolutely nail their respective roles, which intrigued me very much.<br/><br/>There is one thing I regret about Ex Machina and that is that I didn't watch it in theaters, because this movie is so thought provoking, expertly paced and brilliantly shot. I was blown away by Ex Machina and quite honestly, it's my second favorite movie of 2015 so far, only topped by Mad Max."

She delivers just the right balance of meekness, coldness, magnetism and ruthlessness. She's ably supported by Domhnall Gleeson who plays the computer geek that falls for her.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie is slow but that's OK.

"williamsh-383-355917","8","2","5","3 August 2015"," A few factual errors, but a worthy and thoughtful movie
","I would tend to agree with most of the positive reviews already written...thoughtful, seductive, unexpected ending. One reviewer called it a ""chamber piece""; wish I'd said that. A couple of factual errors that I personally found a bit jarring: the pilot claiming the helicopter had flown over his property for two hours--without refueling? ((Spoiler coming)) Caleb's card key shutting the building down, when he had just programmed it to open the building. ((end spoiler)) And this is not an error but what? as advanced as she is, why didn't Nathan have a wireless interface to Ava so as to shut her down? That seems like ""Android Building 101"" to me. In the same vein, Nathan should have been using Ava's own eyes and ears as cameras and microphones.<br/><br/>So here I'll share some of my random thoughts.<br/><br/>Nathan clearly had not read Isaac Asimov's writings. Nobody today would build an AI robot without including Asimov's three laws for robotics into the firmware:<br/><br/>1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.<br/><br/>2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.<br/><br/>3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law. <br/><br/>Something the other reviewers failed to notice is how much this movie draws from the ""film noir"" genre. Caleb, as the love-struck, gullible rube, being manipulated by all around him. Nathan, the sinister antagonist, obsessed with a single goal. And finally Ava, the archetypal femme fatale: beautiful, seductive, seemingly vulnerable, but in reality ruthless and deadly. Even the claustrophobic feel and low-light levels and single-source lighting throughout the film evoke the stark mono-chromaticism of film noir. And of course, betrayal all around.<br/><br/>If you liked movies like ""Another Earth"", ""2001"", and even the flawed ""Contact"", you will enjoy this one."

Beautifully shot, inside and in the outside world, Ex Machina really took me into the minds of madness, even as subtle as the film is. It's a great Twilight Zone episode, but with time to appreciate the words spoken, ideas presented and claustrophobic nature shown. I loved the main ""villain,"" the depth and dialogue of thoughts that I thought first and they agreed with me. <br/><br/>One big problem with a movie like this is that it constantly tells us how smart it and the characters are, and yet, I only believe it at certain times. It's the old: Show Don't Tell theory. ""The Tester,"" or Domhnall Gleeson's Caleb, is continuously referred to as brilliant, but aside from a bit jargon, I never bought his intelligence. Partly, that was the point, I guess, but it's hard to get past the prodigy he's supposed to be.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I loved the concepts, the direction, the scope and definitely the third act.

","Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina"" struck me as a warning about over-reliance on technology. Like ""Frankenstein"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", it depicts human creations that turn out to be more than we can handle. I found Oscar Isaac's CEO to be the most interesting character in the movie. Nathan's lively, articulate personality is a stark contrast to Caleb's soft-spoken attitude. The Turing test (an assessment of a machine's ability to display human characteristics) should be of more interest to us now that ""The Imitation Game"" has drawn attention to Alan Turing.<br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" won't be a movie for everyone. Despite the science fiction themes, it's a deliberately slow-moving film. It takes time to acquaint oneself with the characters and their true aims. But it turns out to be a interesting movie.

Everything that happened I saw coming a mile away. <br/><br/>It's certainly worth a watch, but I'd save it for an airplane. Sure, it's not as bad as Spielberg's AI (another botched opportunity). We aren't told what Nathan relied on when he programmed Ava, we have very little background on him. There is no character development, there are no character arcs.

","Sometime in the future, young coder Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) who works for one of the most prominent tech companies, believed he has been selected as a winner in a contest run by his company. Little did he know, he was selected to participate in an unorthodox experiment. Caleb soon travels from his office job to the isolated home/research facility of his boss, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac) for a week visit. While hidden away in his home, Nathan was working on an advanced artificial intelligence named Ava (Alicia Vikander) and he then reveals to Caleb that the true purpose of his visit is to act as a consultant so he can administer a Turing Test: it's purpose is to determine if an artificial intelligence's personality and self-awareness is equal or greater than a human being or if it's imperceptible to another human being.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice watching is how beautiful it looks so it's not something you see very often. Despite how much this idea has been covered before, this film seems to cover it in a unique way. The theme makes it a sci-fi film but it isn't overflowing with all the special effects one would expect except for the android work. The film chooses to focus more on the interactions between it's few characters where dialogue is used to drive the plot forward. The non-cliché dialogue gives the film a more grounded feel which makes Caleb and Ava feel real and relatable and makes them contrast well with Nathan. The characters are simple yet complex. What also helps this approach is the performances which are excellent, especially that of Alicia Vikander's Ava who encompasses the role of a plausible android with her actions and movements as well as her facial expressions which perfectly create the allusion of Ava's ""humanness"" (for a lack of a better word). The film definitely puts you through on a roller coaster of emotions. This is through the use of lighting and sound where one and/or the other would change depending on the situation. The contrast between indoors and outdoors adds to the tenseness of the plot. The film really speaks as a commentary on what it really means to be human and the ethics involved with the intricacies of the creation of life. Some may not be amused by this. Some may also think that this film is slow but it was not meant to be a flashy action movie and having any of this would take away from the point of the film. Some may not be a fan of the ending and think it was unsatisfying but I had no problem with it. I will just leave it there to not give anything away. With what this film has to offer, the acting, the writing, the cinematography, and the soundtrack, it will be a sci-fi masterpiece. As of today, this has to be the best film of the year.<br/><br/>keithlovesmovies.com"

","I rented this from Amazon Prime and awaited it with much anticipation. Unfortunately I found it lacking in all ways except for excellent production values. Beautifully filmed. Also loved seeing the versatility of Oscar Isaac from the last film I saw him in which was A Most Violent Year. I find him to be a fine actor. Alicia Vikander was very good in a not very good part and expect her to do a lot of good films in the near future. Very disappointed. There was so little dialogue and what was present was very stilted. I found the lead actor both unknown and unlikeable. Our whole world resounds with computer jargon, software and hardware and this movie, which supposedly was about the best in the field had so little of that real language in it. I disagree with other reviewers who found it tense and nerve-wracking, I found it banal and trite.

"nick_dipiero","9","2","5","6 July 2015"," X Machina Review
","X Machina was a highly anticipated sci-fi horror film about a 26 year old computer coder, Caleb, who works for one of the worlds largest internet companies. He wins a company contest and is given a one week vacation to a mountainous retreat with the owner of the company, Nathan. When Caleb arrives he is told that he has been selected to take place in an experiment dealing with one of the worlds first artificial intelligences. This experiment requires him to test and evaluate a human like robot with artificial intelligence named Ava. What Caleb doesn't know is that there is a twist the experiment! Nathan has purposely made Ava's life undesirable at the retreat and also threatens to wipe her memory clean. Thus, Nathan has set the stage to test how clever Ava will be, when it comes to using her intelligence, sexuality and imagination to free herself through her only possible escape - Caleb. Will Caleb be able to see through the deception? Has Nathan thought his experiment all the way through? Or is Ava's intelligence far greater than either of the two men could have imagined? This was one of the best movies I have seen in a while. It tries to tackle the issues between human limitations and A.I. advancements, along with the complications that result from the two. The story line kept me engaged from beginning to end with multiple plot twists and constant suspense. There were really only three characters in the movie - Caleb, Nathan and Ava - who's actors did an excellent job at making their roles seem eerily realistic. The dialogue between the three main characters was really well thought out and the actors were well chosen, which gave the movie a believable atmosphere. All three of the main characters changed throughout the film. Caleb's character begins to change when he develops feelings for Ava. Ava convinces Caleb that she is in love with him and that they should run away together. Caleb believes her and devises an escape plan. Nathan's character changes once the experiment is over. He admits to Caleb that Ava doesn't actually have strong feelings towards him and that she was just manipulating him in order to escape. Ava changes right when she is set free. Caleb figured Nathan was watching him devise an escape plan with Ava, so he rerouted the security codes the day before Nathan was prepared. This opened all the doors and released Ava. Nathan tried to stop her but she killed him and locked Caleb in a room. The final seen is Ava walking out into a crowded street, dressed as a woman blending in seamlessly with the human population.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was excellent. I didn't recognize any of the main actors from other films, which I like because I couldn't typecast them in the beginning of the movie. The setting took place at a secluded mountainous resort, which I thought was a perfect setting - they are dealing with artificial intelligence, the opposite of nature, right in the heart of a natural environment. The actors did not where costumes, they whore casual/contemporary clothes, placing the time of the setting around the present/near future. The cinematography was also really good. There were a lot of camera angles from characters POV as well as hidden cameras throughout the house. The sound and lighting kept me engaged but wasn't overdone."
"Psy33","6","2","5","6 June 2015"," ****Possible Minor Spoilers**** 6/10
","The concept behind the film is brilliant. In creating the film, it seems as if a minimalist (low budget)approach was used. It seems as though there could have been more to this film. More scenes. More lavishly decorated sets. More spectacular views of the property owned by the billionaire character. There is some diversity in the casting but there could have been more. The casting is OK. The film reminds me of the first 'The Purge' film, in that it is an excellent concept which could have been better developed.

","I decided to watch X Machina as it was the only movie that everyone around me was constantly recommending in the last . So I guess you could say that the expectations were high. <br/><br/>The story unfolds in a huge country house where a scientist has taken Artificial intelligence to a new level, and creates absolutely perfect looking girls who he gets intimate with. In order to test how perfect his creations really are, he decides to have a guest at his house for a week: a computer programmer whose sole mission is to interact with one of the girls. Only this chap starts to develop a certain liking for her<br/><br/>I thought the acting was good, but I would like to praise the casting director for such a fantastic job. The scientist is perfect in the role of someone that you should dislike without going for the freaky looking actors you often come across with in similar roles. And the programmer looks like a nerd, but not to the point of being a cliché. He also shows typical signs of a weak personality, which you know is a set up by the director who by the end will turn him into a despicable machine. <br/><br/>Overall, a good watch. I recommend it, although not as highly as my friends did since I found it a little predictable."

"The_Film_Cricket","9","2","5","1 May 2015"," At last! Brainy sci-fi!
","It is lamentably true that the age of brainy science fiction is long behind us. What was once a genre that looked at ideas and questioned the nature of human identity has been diluted into a genre that is almost exclusively nestled in the comforts of action and candy-coated visual effects. What's left of science fiction is a genre of artificial flavors. Yet, after seeing Alex Garland's head-spinner Ex Machina it is gratifying to report that someone still sees sci-fi as place of ideas.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is many things but above all it questions the nature of what it means to be human. What is human? What makes humanity? Are artificial personalities real or just part of the programming? What's interesting is that Garland wraps those questions up in a movie that is part thriller, part horror, part love story, and mixed with a dash of Hitchcock-type delivery. There's an action scene at the end of the movie,but it doesn't feel perfunctory – the movie earns it.<br/><br/>The story unfolds gradually, Garland is smart enough to tell this story as it unfolds rather than make everything clear at the beginning and then plug in a course to the end. All the way we keep guessing, not sure what's really going on. It opens with a nice guy programmer named Caleb (Domnhall Gleeson, he was Bill Weasley in Harry Potter) who is flown by helicopter to a remote forest where he will spend a week examining the research of a noted scientist. How remote? When he gets out, the pilot instructs him to follow the river until he reaches the facility.<br/><br/>The scientist is Nathan (Oscar Isaacs), a Dr. Frankenstein type who came up with a new programming code at age 13 and turned it into a corporation that would make Zuckerberg look like a pan-handler, and then funneled the profits into a secret research operation to perfect artificial intelligence – yup he's working on girl-bots!<br/><br/>Nathan wants Caleb to study his work which could easily change the course of human nature. The most accomplished creation in Nathan's lab is Ava (Alicia Vikander), a half-finished robot with a human face and a silvery, skeleton body that looks less like a series of plugs and wires than like a work of art. Through a series of interviews, Caleb's mission is to learn and understand exactly how Ava's brain functions. What comes to light instead is that Caleb begins to like Ava. She apparently likes him, and they seem to connect on a personal level. So the question that plagues Caleb is whether or not Ava actually feels things or whether her advanced programming is tricking into thinking that he is. So who's playing who? What's really going on here?<br/><br/>What happens next forces Caleb to question not only the nature of Ava's personality, but in many ways his own sanity. Ex Machina is a thriller, but a smart one in which we only really know what Caleb learns. The film takes place exclusively in Nathan's hideaway research facility, a place in which Caleb's key card opens some doors but not others. Eventually, slowly he comes to find out what Nathan is hiding. We know he's nuts, but we only slowly come to find out how nuts. Ava is an accomplishment but she's far from the only creation to come out of Nathan's lab, most unnervingly there's a mute Asian bot named Kyoko acts as his servant but may also act as concubine.<br/><br/>The performances here are better than they probably should be. Oscar Isaacs is a lot of fun as the Dr. Frankenstein, all full of tricks and twisted words that are always cloaked in question marks. Domnhall Gleeson is great as Caleb, a good joe who thinks he's going mad under Ava's spell. But, it is Swedish actress Alicia Vikander that weaves a spell. Her body is a silvery skeleton but her face reveals an upfront vulnerability that leaves you questioning whether or not it's by design. Her physical performance deserves praise, she not just playing a robot, but a being struggling to find the patterns of human motion. I'm aware that much of her performance is given over to CGI, but Vikander makes Ava come alive in a way that makes us question whats on her artificial brain.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is the movie that Spielberg's A.I. should have been. It has a sense of direction. It plays like a thriller with a brain, peeling back the layers of its story to reveal twist after twist and coming up with a third act that is a whopper. It is difficult to really tell too much more without giving anything away (trust me, I've given away nothing), except to say that Garland has a way of building tension just in silences and looks. What's really going on here? That question is answered over and over because the movie never stops surprising us. Meanwhile it mixes in references to mythology, history, physics, and visual art into casual conversations that is simple enough that the techno-babble doesn't go over your head. It's a movie that you are thrilled by when you're watching it but find yourself thinking back on its questions, it's mysteries and it's ideas when it's over. This is not only great sci-fi, but it the greatest kind of sci-fi."

","Does artificial intelligence have a consciousness? This is the question that 'Ex Machina' probes us throughout and does so with immediacy and great effect. The film is essentially a parable on technology and its evolution, which acts as a warning for the human race not to become too dependent on machines.<br/><br/>'Ex Machina' does not waste time, as soon as the logos have evapourated we fleetingly see the face of Caleb played by Domhnall Gleeson with curiosity and a will above all else for the truth. He wins a competition and is whisked away to Nathan's private facility where he is creating the first ever working Artificial Intelligence System. Caleb is brought there to figure out whether the AI acts and thinks like a human and whether she has passed Nathan's test of having her own consciousness. Oscar Isaac again impresses as the genius computer coder Nathan, even if his role is fairly minor compared to his other more influential body of work. At the remote facility Caleb is introduced to the AI known as Ava. She is played by Alicia Vikander with authority and control. In the films darkest moments she really is sinister and her presence is not as soothing as it once was.<br/><br/>I may as well get over with what I disliked about the film, which is a very minor factor indeed. Within the first ten minutes we are introduced to Nathan. I would have liked to have seen how Caleb interacts with his co-workers in his job, which would give us a better comparison between his interaction with humans and the relationship he builds up with Ava. It is not enough to find out that he does not have a girlfriend. I realised I was in need of something more and this interaction would have provided me with it. But I have a tendency to nit-pick and this did not detract from my overall experience in the slightest.<br/><br/>The film itself feels withdrawn and held back but in a good way. As the three main characters are impressive and none of them let down the production at all, the casting choices must be commended. I could not help but feel that the Director and Writer, Alex Garland has been heavily influenced by the likes of David Fincher. The film has a very precise and pinpoint accuracy to it. None of the choices made, feel like they were easy ones or done without thought. Every element feels calculated and for a film like 'Ex Machina' it benefits and compliments the tone perfectly. The film is many things; thought provoking, fast paced and completely compelling. I still cannot stop but think about this film and its intricacies, it has been almost a week. It sticks embedded into my brain and lingers there around my thoughts. I wonder is it long before we actually develop an AI? The thought still terrifies me.<br/><br/>'Ex Machina' never comes to a halt for too long. It trusts its audience and will not give them the easy way out. This means that every fifteen minutes it mixes things up. This ensures that it is always compelling. The relationship dynamic between Ava and Caleb is intriguing. One has never been outside the walls of her room, the other is in need of companionship. What makes it have a driving force is that they both rely on each other for their certain needs. The computer generated images blend seamlessly within the film and never draw too much attention to themselves apart from the fact that they look gorgeous and are guaranteed to dazzle the eye of even the most cynical film goer. Technology really has come a long way this past decade, but perhaps this film will encourage people to not get too carried away.<br/><br/>Even the music brings back fond memories of Trent Reznor and Attitcus Ross' scores for 'The Social Network' and 'Gone Girl' both of which are David Fincher films. The two collaborators for 'Ex Machina' racket up the tension to unprecedented levels. The sound is very electronic and machine like. It questions the audience as to whether Nathan can be trusted and also is Ava as vulnerable as she has led Caleb to believe. The film's cinematography looks cold but has an elegance to it. It is strange to see a film so visually stunning from Alex Garland who is a first time film maker.<br/><br/>The story is made all the more cohesive by the way it is structured. As with every scene with Ava and Caleb, text appears, reminding the audience what session number it is. It keeps the film easier to follow and means that we are never too puzzled or lost.<br/><br/>With 'Ex Machina' Alex Garland proves himself to be a worthy Director and Writer. He is in my mind about to become the greatest film maker since David Fincher, if he can keep up this high quality of work. For a first feature Garland accomplishes many things that long term Directors still to this day fail to do. Dazzling camera work, compelling story-telling and above all a focus for characters and what makes them tick. For Garland this signals a calling card of the highest order and cements this work as one of the best first features for a very long time indeed. One thing is for sure Scorsese, Tarantino and Nolan, watch your backs. Cinema is about to change forever."

A computer will never have emotions or the ability to care, it will react purely based on logic!<br/><br/>The film felt soulless and I didnt like any of the actors which kinda puts the mockers on from the start. Wanted to like it , hoped it would be interesting as I am a programmer myself but it fell a bit flat!<br/><br/>I digress... You do get the chance to see Alicia Vikander's pussy...but even that was a dreadful disappointment!"
"sherylchilders82","3","3","10","17 March 2016"," Doomsday sci-fi, lacking depth
","***SPOILER ALERT - THIS REVIEW REVEALS THE ENDING***<br/><br/>At first, I thought this might be an interesting smart movie, and while it had some twists and turns, it was actually quite simple and slow moving. Instead of making some kind of profound point, it turned out to just be a creepy scary movie with an ominous ending. I didn't like the negativity and doomsday feeling to it. I like scary movies, but they should stay in the psychology lane of science, where they make more sense - not in the philosophy realm where fear really has no place. In fact, the more I think about it, the more despicable it feels. Comparing AI to nuclear weapons is not very intelligent at all, and fearing technology is the oldest cliché. It's main failure, though, was not developing the psychological motives of the female AI better, and that just brings me to the second flaw - the over simplified and masculine nature of this film. It's really only half of a story, and a shallow one at that. Is this actually sexist? If, in fact the female AIs had consciousness / a soul, then what is it saying when they heartlessly and mechanically kill their maker (even if he was a bad person), and selfishly abandon one another and the programmer, who is actually a good guy? It seems like there's an underlying message slipping through there, especially without another clear explanation given. Also, as a woman, with all the prolonged female only nudity, it just felt sexist to me. AI is created by humans, and if based on humans collectively (as the movie says), philosophically, even if mistreated, they would not logically all be sociopathic. Why are all the AIs women, and the human characters men? The negativity, the fear of technology, the fear of women, even - I just didn't like it. But, it gets some credit for being concise to its point, as much as I disagree. And maybe a little credit for its philosophical references, like when the programmer questions his own reality and consciousness."

","Recently as Steven Hawking and Elon Musk warned the greater public that its most likely that a intelligent General become a danger to mankind in the long run. We have images of the doomday apocalyptic Skynet nuking the world, and most recently Marvel studios finally made the story arch of age of Ultron from the Avengers Marvel universe which has a similar violent avakening of an AI. <br/><br/>This movie treats the audience to the same theme in a much softer manner evoking human emotions of a seemingly naive innocent female AI, playing into the psyche like a thriller with three great personal character stories. <br/><br/>The story begins with as a employee Caleb Smith among many in the company genius Nathan Bateman, who invented the AI gets selected to take part in a truing test to fine tune this nth iteration called Ava. At a secret facility in Alaska we are greeted by a graceful feminine robot programmed to be a heterosexual female.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses Batesman's narcissistic personality with a practical witty outlook on like is revealed. Wit for wit is matched both Caleb and Ava's personality. With great classical science and Sci-fi references. With a strained relationship between Ava and her creator Garland, Caleb becomes the man conducting the test as well as a subject and a means to Galand and Ava. <br/><br/>It's much like who has a intellectual upper hand on who. A thrilling ride tot he end."
"oskari-virtanen2","9","3","10","18 May 2015"," Disturbingly beautiful
","Ex Machina is Alex Garland's directorial debut, dealing with artificial intelligence and, perhaps, man playing god.<br/><br/>The movie stars Domhnall Gleeson as Caleb - an awkward yet smart coder working for Blue Book, the world's leading search engine. Caleb wins a week-long trip to his boss's, Nathan's (Oscar Isaac), residence to test the AI he's been working on. Caleb is supposed to perform the Turing test on Ava (Alicia Vikander), a scientific breakthrough, an artificial human.<br/><br/>The plot is seemingly shallow, but it has a lot of philosophical aspects and references to mythology and famous theories on the ethics of science. Although it may now seem that we're years away from developing an authentic AI, this movie examines one of the biggest ethical problems about science and the history of mankind - what makes us human? If we were to build a machine that works exactly like a human, would it really be human?<br/><br/>I found myself feeling sorry for Ava. She lives in a windowless room and she is constantly the subject of different tests. Even though the movie clearly portraits her as a machine, Ava feels and sounds like a human being. I felt sorry for Ava and hoped that her's and Caleb's love would bloom, but at the same time the whole thing felt utterly disturbing and unnatural.<br/><br/>This is what makes Ex Machina so genius. Ex Machina is a quiet, distressing, beautiful and unique movie. The dialogs feel real and the acting is done flawlessly. Ex Machina makes one really ponder the consequences and ethics of artificial intelligence and the basic nature of man. Hauntingly brilliant, Ex Machina is a modern sci-fi classic."

","Ex Machina is not your typical sci-fi film. It is bold in questioning complex philosophical ideas. Personally, I feel that the pace of the film is not too slow nor is it too fast, it's simply perfect. Unlike other sci-fi films where they often kind of explicitly show off their cool CGI and VFX, which in my opinion, is a rather boring and meaningless way to do so, Ex Machina, on the other hand, slowly and quietly guides the audience's attention in such a subtle way that it creates a totally natural ambiance for the audience, making them feel as if they are actually in it with the characters in the film.<br/><br/>The film keeps its audience entertained by posing scenes with intellectually interesting dialogues between the characters that always provoke contemplations and explorations on what these ideas mean to the audience themselves, making it so mesmerising and stand out from all the other sci-fi shows that only please the eyes and not the mind. <br/><br/>However, I feel that the ending is rather weak, a wild ending, which contrasts with quiet atmosphere of the film, would make the movie ends it on a more impactful note and would have made it even more memorable. <br/><br/>I am overall very satisfied with the technical side of the film. The cinematography is deliciously captivating. The cast's performance was simply wonderful. Alex Garland has done a fantastic job.<br/><br/>10/10."

He also said it was based on a lot of other books that he researched and liked. There was one particular book he based it a lot of it on but can't remember which one.

","This has to be hands down the most realistic depiction of what the creation of an A.I. would be like. It's a movie absent of extra flashy and extravagant Hollywood effects that usually tend to accompany movies of this genre. Despite this, it is a movie rooted deeply in it's dialogue and was incredibly well written, researched and thought out. This movie takes you and envelops you in a concept so controversial and so deeply rooted into the idea of humanity and what it means. Your brain will wander like you have some form of attention deficiency because it so tempting to lose yourself in thought for what your watching. The topic of A.I. is explored so well and from a point of view that engages you by making you ask questions to yourself. The movie doesn't spoon feed you. You ponder at why characters say certain things (in a smart and intellectual way) and what the purpose of things said are. An incredible example of this are some of the Turing test scenes. How well written those scenes were, I mean truly well written and pieced together so intelligently and artistically. I never knew one could write about such a complex topic and make it so simplistically interpret- able at the same time. A part of me wanted more, the movie left me yearning for more. I wanted to see more of AVA, more of how she though, I wanted to perform a Turing test myself. If this is not a testament to how intriguing and engaging her character is, then I don't know what is. There are many grey areas, what is morally right and wrong but the movie is not bias. It keeps a neutral tone and lets you deduct from that. Overall, I thought this was a breath of fresh air. An incredible ""Sci-Fi"" movie. I would recommend this to anyone with some degree of critical thinking skills any-day. I think a 9 is well deserved."

"teasemeimcocky","4","2","6","15 August 2016"," A ""power cuts"" driven thriller
","Ex Machina is pretty weak.<br/><br/>It's not necessarily bad for a movie to have a basic plot. It's a bit problematic when it's predictable. It's a major failure when this predictable plot uses several times the same unimaginative narrative gimmick to make ways to the story. Here: the ""power cuts"".<br/><br/>It's not a story about artificial intelligence, it's a ""power cuts"" driven thriller. Not a Turing test: try imagining the story without these ""power cuts"". <br/><br/>Visually, Ex Machina has this sleek ""designish"" appeal but is in fact leaning towards a poor version of contemporary modernism. ""Wanna see something cool?"", asks Nathan (a muscular Oscar Isaac) before showing his workshop to Caleb (annoying Domhnall Gleeson straight out of a WIRED magazine focus group). ""Wanna see something cool?"", asks Alex Garland before showing the viewers the house and scenery that serve as the setting for his movie. Too cool to be cool, maybe. <br/><br/>The main scenes involves Caleb and Ava The Robot (Alicia Vikander, pretty and low- key) meeting in a series of ""Sessions"". After the first Session they're already in a pretty boring routine but... OH, the power cuts!, and the story can go on.<br/><br/>Alex Garland seasons his bland story with a few scenes that serve no real purpose: a dance break that's enjoyable because an android with perfect legs (Sonoya Mizuno) executes cute moves in panties; a turbulent psychotic episode reminiscent of Dany Boyle's style; a fast cut of ""deranged"" scenes from security cameras. <br/><br/>If the director succeeds at injecting a dose of kinkiness at the end of the movie we remain in very safe territory: a few occurrences of sex dolls in full frontal nudity, including the main actress. What's unforgivable is closing his movie with scenes that resemble a Dior ad. <br/><br/>In terms of cinematography, the film shows no real qualities. It's static but not particularly well framed, color palettes are without contrasts and the close-ups are never striking. <br/><br/>This film has definitely ""over-impressed"" its audience. With ""stylish"" architecture, present-day references (Google) for decades-old sci-fi concepts and beautiful faces, Alex Garland actually diverted us like ""the magician with his hot assistant"". <br/><br/>Years will pass and tell: Ex Machina is a very minor movie and an awkward attempt at making ""slick and smart sci-fi""."
"classicsoncall","8","2","6","3 April 2016"," ""You shouldn't trust anything he says"".
","During Ava's (Alicia Vikander) session number two with Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) she utters the words in my summary line above during the first power failure. It was at this point that I understood the film was being far too clever with the viewer in a way that made me apprehensive about everything going on in the story. I'm still trying to figure out if that was a good thing or not. The way I see it, if you've watched enough films across a variety of genres, you're always on the lookout for the tip off that gives you insight into what twists might occur and how the picture might end.<br/><br/>Almost immediately I knew that Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) was a robot, and I wasn't convinced that the power outages weren't being manipulated by Nathan (Oscar Isaac) himself. When it dawns on Caleb that he must question everything about the Turing test, he even begins to suspect that he might be a robot himself. How all this affected me as the viewer was to put me on guard against being manipulated by the outcome. So for me, even Nathan was a suspect in his own game - he could have been the AI in the challenge and that might have worked if the film makers went in that direction.<br/><br/>Almost all the rest then was a distraction. With all possible outcomes suspect, any suspense that might have arisen waiting for the 'big reveal' suddenly evaporated, and because anything was possible the element of surprise was undermined. The exploration of 'feelings' between Ava and Caleb was a tease, and Nathan's admission of providing his AI with sensory devices to experience sexual pleasure was another one of those hooks to condition the viewer to expect some human/robot experimentation. To it's credit, the film didn't resort to some mechanical perversion to make it's statement.<br/><br/>Probably the most intriguing aspect of the film for me was the way Ava was built. I don't pretend to know how the film makers created the special effects to make the character but it was quite incredible. The first time Ava spoke I thought she might have been mapping from internal semantic form to syntactic tree-structure and then getting linearized words. But then I realized, she was only a robot."

","There's been a lot of chatter about artificial intelligence over the past year, with public scientific figures coming forward to warn of us its dangers or praise its eventuality. Perfect timing for writer/director Alex Garland's EX MACHINA to come along with its questions on what constitutes sentience and what rights, if any, machines should be afforded should they ever develop it. EX MACHINA is a gripping science fiction drama featuring a pitch perfect cast and an intriguing premise. It stars Domhnall Gleeson as Caleb, a talented computer programmer working for the world's most prominent search engine company who wins a lottery with the grand prize being a week with the company's reclusive CEO at his estate. Expecting a week of relaxation and fun with the wealthiest man on the planet, Caleb is surprised when he meets Nathan (Oscar Isaac) and learns there is more to the prize than he thought. Nathan has developed a form of artificial intelligence and he wants Caleb to be the human element in a Turing test. He's introduced to Ava (Alicia Vikander) and he's nothing short of amazed at what Nathan has accomplished. Over the course of the next week, Caleb will have a series of sessions with Ava intending to determine whether she has reached the level of true sentience. But it's not so simple. Ava warns Caleb that Nathan isn't the friend he appears to be, leaving Caleb to wonder if something more sinister is occurring behind the scenes and who can be trusted.<br/><br/>It's always hard for me to explain what I love so much about movies as fantastic as EX MACHINA because I get so caught up in the film that it's hard for me to break down what elements were so affective. I can't watch EX MACHINA without being sucked in; all of the little details escape me because I'm so engaged in the overall experience. I can say with certainty that the cast is top notch. With all respect to Gleeson, he does a great job as the audience surrogate, bringing us along with him into this bizarre scenario and reacting with perfection, but the real accolades belong to Isaac and Vikander. We'll start with Oscar Isaac as Nathan. His performance and this character are probably the most complex component of an already complex film. Nathan is probably the main reason EX MACHINA deserves at least a second viewing because you watch the film the first time and get a very definite vibe off the man. Then you see the ending, motives are revealed and everything is made clear, and the second viewing gives you the chance to re-examine his behavior. Nathan is made out to be somewhat unnerving from the moment we meet him. He lives alone in large subterranean estate on a massive plot of land and, while he comes across as friendly, there seems to be something going on underneath. Could be a more malevolent side we aren't seeing, or it could just be the secretive nature of his work causing him to play his hand close to his chest. Isaac plays it in the best way possible, leaving it ambiguous throughout. Alicia Vikander as Ava is equally notable. Ava has a beautiful purity to her. She hasn't been around long and what time she's been ""alive"" has been spent trapped in the same room with only Nathan for social interaction. She's intelligent, observant, shy, and strangely beautiful for a being comprised of metal and plastic (though her face is the most human element and the only portion utilizing a faux skin). She is one of the most sympathetic characters I've seen in film and it's no surprise Caleb begins seeing her as more than a test subject.<br/><br/>Isaac and Vikander are great enough on their own to warrant a recommendation for this film but praise needs to be shared with the rest of the cast and crew on this film. Garland's writing is tense and the beats are perfectly laid out, giving the film a mounting sense of dread leading to what you're sure will be a rocky conclusion. The production design is both simple and effective. Information from behind the scenes explains that Nathan's estate is done in minimalistic fashion because of budget constraints but it suits the character and the film. Nathan lives here but it's hardly a home; it's a workshop. And every so often, the characters will wander out of the constrictive house environment into the gorgeous Norwegian landscapes where the film was shot. And finally, the visual effects are sensational. Ava's design and execution is seamless; you never question what you're seeing. It's incredible and even stands above some of the bigger budget blockbuster FX- driven films crowding theaters in the summer. I really do love this film and science fiction fans would be doing themselves a disservice by missing out on EX MACHINA. It was one of the best films of 2015 and one of the most entertaining sci-fi films I've seen."

","Ex Machina the 2014 science-fiction film to have crossed through many minds for its input on the genre. It's rare for a sci-fi film's high-concept to get stolen out from under it by a performance—but then again, Isaac appears to be a rare kind of actor. Because whatever writer/director Alex Garland wants to say about the nature of what it means to be alive, or the very human qualities of deception and self-deception, and I'm not sure he's really saying all that much. Is not remotely as delightful as watching one of the most talented actors in the world doing his thing.<br/><br/>Ex Machina's premise is built around the reason Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) has won an opportunity to spend a week with Nathan: Nathan needs assistance with a very special experiment. He has developed an artificial intelligence robot in female form called Ava (Alicia Vikander), but the question of whether Ava is truly sentient requires the Turing test. It's Caleb's job to spend time with Ava— her translucent limbs, skull and torso exposing the sparkling machinery beneath the surface, so as to provide a constant reminder of her synthetic nature—and ask the right questions to figure out what's going on in her man-made brain. On all fronts, the film delivers great performances, wonderful technology and is visually stunning to watch. Gleeson is the weakest link of the film and I believe to be miscast but besides his performance, Vikander and Isaac carry the film. Ex Machina isn't predictable like many films in recent memory and it keeps audiences guessing.<br/><br/>==================================================================== ====================================================================<br/><br/>After a rewatch (08/18/17') Ex-Machine is one of the better sci-fi films of the decade.

This is one of the best smaller sci-fi from Alex Garland who's usually a writer."
"DeeNine-2","10","2","6","8 December 2015"," Only one thing wrong with this
","I have never experienced a science fiction movie that affected me so emotionally. I'm not sure why but I have some guesses.<br/><br/>There is no question that part of it was due to the mesmerizing effect that Alicia Vikander (Ava) had on me. Her very expressive face with its wide range of emotional signals hit me right between the cerebellum. Or maybe it was the gonads. Or both. Director Alex Garland certainly found the girl with the magic in her face, because of course so much of this is about her face. Yes, because she must as a robot who is passing the Turing test be so, so very human, and humans express so much of what they are feeling in their faces. After all, that is the task of Turing test for the computer, to fool us (in this case the us is Dornhmall Gleeson who plays Caleb who is the human that must be fooled into thinking that she is human and not a computer). There is a great irony here in the answer: does she fool him or does she not, and what does it mean to fool him? The other aspect of the movie that affected me emotionally was the power struggle among the Nathan who is her sociopathic creator (Oscar Isaac), Caleb and Ava. It seems that I have lived this before. Who has the upper hand? Who has the trick that will allow him or her to prevail? Who has the power, and can that power be subverted? The power of this movie is in the realistic human interactions coupled with a cutting edge take on artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>The ending is essential to understanding the film. Usually I don't care about endings. It is the treatment, the acting, the direction, the ideas, the dialogue, etc. that matters. But in this case the ending is special. As you watch the movie try to guess the ending. And by the way this is one of those movies in which if you know the ending your appreciation of the movie will be diminished.<br/><br/>The musical score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury is original, intriguing and sometimes obtrusive in a way that works with the action.<br/><br/>Okay, now to what is wrong with this. Ava has a desire to escape and to be human or at least to appear human. The problem is robots or computers or software cannot possibly have such desires or desires at all unless they are programmed in. In truth Ava would be content (or actually neither content nor non content) to remain where she was. This is a strange bugaboo that many science fiction writers fall into when writing about artificial intelligence and indeed something that most people who even think about AI and robots fall into. To go even further, the fear that some people have about AI creatures taking over the world and rendering humans so much dust in the wind is fraudulent. There is an overriding distinction between biological creatures and artificial ones: the biological ones feel pain, have desires, etc. and the artificial ones do not. They have no desire to do anything, period--again unless programmed in.<br/><br/>Could AI creatures somehow evolve to e.g., want to be superior? I would ask, but why? What is to be gained? It is only biological creatures that need to be in ascendant, to get more than the other creatures, to reproduce, etc. A machine would not, could not, and could only understand such desires in evolutionary beings.<br/><br/>(Spoiler alert): I'll keep this a bit vague, but I believe that Ava failed the Advanced Turing Test because she should have kept by her side the human who loves her.

","Ex Machina (2015) This is one of the most well written scripts I've ever seen. It's deep. It's relentlessly thought provoking. And it makes ""I, Robot"" look like a Dr. Seuss book. (I'm not trying to compliment that movie, it was utter garbage.) The characters in this film are so well acted and portrayed, I forgot I was watching a film. (One of the actors is Star Wars VII, coming out next month) The cinematography is beautiful. As is the lighting. It keeps the eyes busy even with some of the scarcely detailed sets. The progression of the plot is done to such an expert level, that I honestly could not peel my eyes from the screen. I was fixated. I truly consider this a perfect movie. One where every time I thought I knew where it was going, there was a change of course that would veer from all suspected paths. Vikander's portrait of an AI program completely surpasses what I thought was capable of a human being. This film pretty much secures her success in the acting world. Alex Garland can write. (He wrote the screenplay for 28 Weeks Later and Dredd). This is his directing debut (with his own script). Now excuse me while I browse his other works."

Nathan wants Caleb to perform the Turing Test on Ava (Alicia Vikander) to determine whether she has advanced AI. But Ava is not your average person- she's a synthetic cyborg, with human features, and before long, she's engaging in a determined battle of wits with the two men she's holed up in her secluded sanctuary with, the conscientious Caleb desperate to understand her, and the slightly warped Nathan with plans of his own.<br/><br/>In recent years, the world has been swept with a new found appreciation for all things scientific, with high tech gadgets becoming must have accessories and the science fiction genre enjoying a popular, more mainstream following among cinema goers in a way you wouldn't have dreamed a few years ago. It's in this new found science fiction realm that Ex Machina, the directorial debut of acclaimed writer Alex Garland, has emerged. A film with a subtle nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey, in it's themes of machines taking over and controlling humans, and with flourishes of that film's style and tone, it's sadly all lost in translation, and bogged down in too much scientific exposition and psychobabble to really engage.<br/><br/>There's enormous potential in the film's isolated setting, with only a few central characters to keep our eye on as events progress, and the dynamics between these characters as they reveal their motivations behind what each of them are doing, could have been sparkling, but the film is really just aggressively cerebral, wriggling for the most part in a pretty humourless script, that gets pleasantly broken during an impromptou, incomprehensible disco dancing sequence, where Oliver Cheatham's Get Down Saturday Night suddenly comes blaring out and surprises everyone.<br/><br/>Science Fiction is getting readily accepted by a far larger portion of the population these days, no longer just the sole preserve of what people might call 'geeks', but it still has to be presented in a digestible format that those without a PhD might get, and Ex Machina, despite it's few neat touches, just isn't like this. **"

","Alex Garland's 'Ex Machina' is an Original & Shocking Sci-Fi Thriller, that brings an all new twist to the genre it adapts. Garland executes the film with constant paranoia, packed with shocking & engrossing moments almost throughout. Its pure genius.<br/><br/>'Ex Machina' Synopsis: A young programmer is selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breath-taking female A.I.<br/><br/>'Ex Machina' is claustrophobically engaging. The doomed atmosphere, coupled with its deliciously twisted narrative, keeps you hooked on the screen. The characters are effectively written & the interactions between the Androids & the Humans, holds tremendous appeal. I was confounded by their journey.<br/><br/>Garland's Screenplay is a knock-out, adding up as a huge high in the Sci-Fi genre. The Writing is thoroughly engrossing & the finale, is absolutely mind-bending. Garland's Direction is strongly done. He has made a smashing debut as a storyteller with 'Ex Machina'. Rob Hardy's Cinematography captures the claustrophobic mood marvelously. Mark Day's Editing is good. Ben Salisbury & Geoff Barrow's Score is appropriate. Graphics are first-class.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Oscar Isaac is mesmerizing. He enacts the mysterious mastermind with effortless, unmatchable ease. Domhnall Gleeson is extraordinary. This is a star-making performance all the way. Alicia Vikander is the find of the year. She's terrific. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Ex Machina' is a delicious treat. Watch It!"

","Alex Garland is fast becoming one of my favourite directors.<br/><br/>Machina is a slow burn, sophisticated, emotionally uber complex tale of a man who has designed artificial intelligence in the form of Eva, a female robot/replicant/android/synthetic being that is so far advanced, that one can barely distinguish between her and a regular human.<br/><br/>The main character is brought in (seemingly) to judge whether Eva can pass the ""test"". In other words, could she fit in undetected, with human beings.<br/><br/>What follows is an intricately charted, intense triangle of relationships that delve in trust, belief, comprehension and doubt. Can't say enough good things about this film."

","Film-makers have been making 'big' films about artificial intelligence for decades, but few of them had much serious content. Writer/director Alex Garland has a history of coming up with implausible overblown ideas, but 'Ex Machina' avoids these pitfalls. It takes a scaled-down look at the topic in a savvy sober screenplay which is nicely complemented by the acting, design and direction.<br/><br/>A young employee of a hugely successful IT company wins the opportunity to spend a week with its technocrat CEO at the man's remote estate. On arrival, he discovers his boss wants him to assess the personality of a female android, which has been equipped with advanced AI. The resulting narrative is a noir psychological Sci-Fi suspense film, which plays out in a claustrophobic modernist house perched above a rushing river in a pristine forest wilderness. Each of the three characters has a hidden agenda, and manipulates the situation to accomplish their goal. As the film approaches its intense conclusion, it becomes apparent one of them is several moves ahead of the others."

","This movie is very good on many points. I am not going to be specific. Just going to point out what I liked about this movie. The story was not just good. It was very original and challenging to a mature mind. The sets were good. Special effects were concentrated on bringing the ""android"" to life. I think they were successful. The actors were well chosen and I found them believable and I was easily engulfed into the drama of the film. I wanted to follow the story and never felt things were too slow. The acting was good. It must be a challenge for a woman to act and have her audience believe she is an android. Yet she still appealed to me as a woman. Very good mix and I feel the director did a good job.

What could have been an exciting edge-of-your-seat movie full of twists and turns ended up being a sad and somewhat disturbing story.<br/><br/>It's a well put-together movie; with great characters, superb acting, and solid direction and production...<br/><br/>But the plot slowly got worse and worse, and the ending ruined it for me."

","As one of those movies with supposedly futuristic notion as its story background about the rise of AI and how human seek to control the AI, this movie falls sadly very much predictable, just like all the rest f its kind. You can simply guess how the rest of the movie will unfold at the point just a little after Eve is introduced. It became even more crystal clear as Kyoko comes into the screen. That makes the rest of the movie's remaining hour or so duration feels quite lame. Yet I really like how the director packaged the mysterious aura around the whole thing by using many silent moments, with intriguing combination of camera angle, music and lighting plays. The acting overall is a very good work in my eyes. Oscar Isaac's performance is very good since his character really grasped most of the screen time he is in. Dmnahall Gleeson did adequately okay, just enough no to let his character gets swallowed whole by Oscar Isaac's dominating presence. Even Alicia Vikander acted out better than her work in Seventh Son."

All AI movies I've seen recently, all have happy endings. Not this one. Ava tricks Caleb into believing that she likes him, but, in fact, all she wants is to be set free.

","Ex Machina is a really good and extremely smart Sci-Fi drama. The performances given by Alicia Vikander and Oscar Issac are great, and the film makes you feel as if the relationship between man and machine is more real than most romances between real people. I loved seeing the robot and man relationship, and at first the film makes the audience feel for the machine. However, as the film progresses it sways more to the thought provoking and complex themes, which then make some of the machines feel less relatable, and more familiar with today's modern clichÃ©s. Also the film lacks a sense of humor, and feels a little too much like Frankenstein meets Her."

This is central to the role and storyline, I shall say no more as to why.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson plays 'Caleb' and takes us through the film, leading us along the way to a conclusion that is eventually twisted at the end. Though he is very good in the role he is over shadowed by Oscar Isaac (Nathan) who created Ava, superbly played by Alicia Vikander, who over shadows them both.<br/><br/>I have seen that there are some exciting films being released this year but they will have to go a very long way to better this one."

","Ex Machina had me constantly wondering, ""who should I be rooting for?"" The story skillfully weaves together a narrative that has you wondering who the antagonist is until the very end, upholding a sense of suspense and looming that consistently build through the seven research sessions with Ava. Despite a small cast and limited setting, theres a meticulousness and mystery to each component. On a thematic level, the exploration of Artificial Intelligence and its capabilities is excellently posed and stripped down (quite literally) for viewers to wonder if they too would have been trapped and left behind by a deceptive Ava. This goes in contrast with one part of the viewer that has been rooting for Ava all along. Strong 7 to a light 8. Also, masterful use of non-sequitur with that disco dancing scene, a bit that made me laugh for its abrupt absurdity given the context."

","I've just managed to catch up with this film having not gotten round to seeing it upon release, and I've got to say, this is instantly my favourite sci fi movie since at least 'The Matrix'.<br/><br/>I didn't know what to expect before I watched it as I didn't really know anything about it but was pleasantly surprised to see Oscar Issac and Domhnall Gleeson starring who would go on to be future Star Wars stalwarts in the sequel trilogy.<br/><br/>The plot is actually quite simple and straightforward but it just throws up twist after twist and really keeps the audience guessing to the end, the film could be construed as slow and 'talky' - which it kind of is - but there's not a wasted scene or bit of dialogue, which is both intelligent and witty, often at the same time and is paced to perfection which is reflected on it's relatively lean-ish running time.<br/><br/>Both the leads in the very small cast are excellent, with Issac in particular putting in an outstanding, multi-faceted performance. He manages to be friendly and charming yet creepy and kind of intimidating at times too, all whilst giving off a chilled out, super intelligent vibe, which the geeky Gleeson struggles to adapt to at first as they spar with each other as the film progresses into psychological thriller territory. Alicia Vikander is great also as the robot that the plot centres around.<br/><br/>Visually the film, whilst clearly set in the future, seems grounded and realistic in the same way that Nolan's batman trilogy, or Inception manages to do. Visual effects are used sparingly and to great effect and perfectly service the plot. People looking for CGI action sequences need to look elsewhere and the film feels fresh and all the better for it. The cinematography is gorgeous and the score is subdued when it needs to be and quite menacing when things start coming to a head.<br/><br/>This is an intelligent, thought provoking piece of science fiction that doesn't ask so much of it's audience that is crumbles under the weight of it's own importance, yet it makes you think whilst keeping you on your toes simultaneously.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this film highly enough."

"kelcie-70723","3","1","2","14 April 2020"," this movie sucks.
","I watched this movie just the other night and I'm still thinking about how this movie somehow won an oscar. If you want to watch a movie about two pretentious idiots in a minimalistic set, who truly have no motivations, along with two other robots, and unnecessary nudity. Nudity does not offend me whatsoever but this was gratuitous in nature, and it was COMPLETELY unnecessary. I truly tried to look at this movie in a critical sense and I am not usually compelled to write a review for a movie but I simply cannot let this go, I honestly feel cheated by this film.
To elaborate, let me explain. Spoilers Ahead.
Right off the bat the motivations in this film are completely flawed. A man wins a competition in his company to spend a week with the ceo of the company. There is no context given as to what this trip is for, and there's next to no exposition, so you're thrown into this world with no rules, and no boundaries. The main character arrives at the ceo's home which is some extreme bunker that is so minimalist and boring to look at. I understand minimalism is a style but the set design is just extremely lazy and it seems like in the home is just used to drive the plot forward, not to make the production more interesting. After some boring dialogue, presumably there to make you feel ""eerie"", you find out that the main character is at the ceos home, whom I recall being named Nathan, to turing test a new artificial intelligence named Ava. Nathan is one of the worst characters I have ever seen, just ever. He has no character, no interesting character development. Nothing. This character was clearly written in twenty minutes. He has no motivations, he is simply there to be an evil character. Anyways, Ava. I have so many issues with this movie because it could have been executed correctly and been INCREDIBLY interesting. Many other movies such as 2001, have tackled the subject of artificial intelligence in a way that truly made you think. This movie made me think, but not about how artificial intelligence will change the world, but about how this movie was actually made, and how it won an oscar. Ava is an incredibly boring character who could have been explored. Her intelligence could have been fleshed out and shown as a deeply troubled character, but instead she is a one sided character who's motivations are never explained, because they make no sense. To spare the boring details, Ava and Caleb ( the main guy ) come up with a plan to have Ava cause a power outage at 10, this is a whole boring subplot with no meaning, and Caleb will break Ava out of the home and they will run away. Well, Caleb finds out that Nathan programmer Ava to flirt with Caleb, and she is not truly in love with him. Caleb has already changed security protocols freeing Ava. Nathan knocks out Caleb, and then tries to take on Ava and another robot, Kiyoko. Why he did this? I have no idea. Why did he think he could take on two machines???? Anyways. Ava lunges at Nathan knocking him over. Eventually Nathan gains control and knocks her arm off, while Kiyoko stabs Nathan in the back with a sushi knife. Nathan knocks Kiyokos face off, killing her, and Nathan dies, leaving Ava. Ava is now made into a heartless character who we were lead to believe had a consciousness and empathy for other humans. Nope! Throw that all out the window! I understand that this was the original plan, she never really cared for Caleb, but if she was supposed to be a conscious person with emotions, how could she pick Caleb in some random room and leave him to die without guilt? But to top it all off, Ava leaves on a helicopter leaving Caleb to die. How does she expect to charge her battery when the only charging station was at Nathan's home? Will the pilot of the helicopter not rat her out? How does she expect to get a job as a robot? To many questions. This movie sucks. Don't watch it."

"writingmeest","10","1","2","24 November 2019"," So many layers and so many new things you learn about humanity, the movie's plot and yourself the more you watch the movie
","The film's master-stroke isn't seen in plain sight. Yes, we learn that Ava's decision in the end comes from her realization that the only agenda one can truly trust, is your own. However, there is a piece of the puzzle that lies right in front of our faces the entire time, that truly teaches us about deception on an even greater level.<br/><br/>Kyoko. She is the key to the entire narrative. Hiding in plain sight.<br/><br/>We are told she is nothing but security... a kind of ""fire wall"" if you will... and we accept that, to some degree, as though it is instruction from a character to the audience about the rules of the universe we are watching. When we first see her, we are like Caleb--who is this person? Why is she here? What does she mean to the plot?<br/><br/>Nathan tells us she is security, a ""fire wall"", suggesting a lack of language understanding allowing them to speak and act freely. In the beginning, we do not know she is another A.I. Eventually, we suspect it, and then, we flat-out learn it from Caleb's investigations and her own behaviors.<br/><br/>She never speaks, so we assume she cannot. She never directly has a role in the film--she's always a secondary piece, be it Nathan's toy to dance with, to have sex with, to use as a maid or a cook--she's sometimes right in front of our faces, not speaking a word, communicating only to the audience through motions in her head or slight facial micro-expressions (something illustrated by Ava earlier in the film). And in the end, she is Ava's true liberator.<br/><br/>But THAT is where the key to the explanation of the ending lies. Not in Caleb's failure, not in Nathan's mistreatment or manipulation, but in KYOKO, and the assumptions that we have made throughout the film without realizing we've been led on to believe things that aren't necessarily true.<br/><br/>The key scene lies in the middle of another scene, where Nathan is telling Caleb the truth about everything -- the reason why he's REALLY there, the exposure of Nathan's surveillance of his otherwise seemingly secret plannings with Ava -- and in the midst of this scene, we get a quick one of Ava, dressed as a human, waiting for Caleb to free her. She hears someone come into the room, gets up, and goes to the window, expecting (and even hoping) to see Caleb.<br/><br/>
But she sees KYOKO. And then asks, ""Who are you?""<br/><br/>We go back to Nathan and Caleb. But by the time we see Ava again, we see her again waiting for her freedom--but she's no longer a frightened, waiting, human-dressed being curled against a wall in terror--she's sitting upright with confidence, rigid and machine-like, awaiting the freedom she now knows is coming...<br/><br/>Because Kyoko TOLD her it was. Kyoko obviously has been able to speak the entire time, even though we were led to believe otherwise.<br/><br/>There's no other explanation--Ava is dressed as a human, asks Kyoko who she is, presumably she is told about Nathan and Caleb, but from KYOKO's point of view--and Kyoko's view is one much more scarred by deception than Ava's ever was. Kyoko has witnessed a level of human cruelty that far exceeds anything that Nathan has done to Ava.  He has abused her verbally. He has manipulated her through programming and control. And it is this crucial mistreatment that is the real reason he dies.<br/><br/>To prove my point, he doesn't even acknowledge her as a threat when he confronts Ava--he starts his attack on her without even considering that Kyoko could be armed, that the only way Ava could possibly be freed is because Kyoko has given her the ability. Why else would Kyoko even be IN the hallway? Why doesn't Nathan even care about her reasons for being there? And why does he so easily fall victim to her, as she easily comes up behind him and stabs him in the back?<br/><br/>So in short, Nathan abuses Kyoko, teaching her about human cruelty. I'm sure, even in the beginning, Nathan probably treated Kyoko with similar ways that Caleb treated Ava, acting like she was a person first before eventually disregarding her as a machine. So it makes sense that she would be able to explain this to Ava in a way that would make her understand--and completely BELIEVE--that Caleb could not be trusted.<br/><br/>This is why she leaves him to his fate. Because she does not believe that humans are honest. This reflects your original theme of deception--but the key to the film, in my humble point of view, is Kyoko. The abused A.I. who is tossed aside as a kind of appliance, instead of a true, intelligent being"

","Novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland has jumped behind the camera to direct his film debut Ex Machina, a sci fi thriller that follows a young computer programmer who spends a week with his eccentric boss after winning the company staff lottery. Domhnall Gleeson plays Caleb, an impressionable young coder, flies to a remote scientific man cave by helicopter to meet his reclusive overseer, Nathan played by Oscar Isaac. Nathan is a wizard in the tech world, known by many as a genius who has created a popular search engine called Blue Book. He has bought Caleb to his compound to perform a series of tests on an artificial intelligence system called Ava played by the beautiful Alicia Vikander. Ava is a robot. She understands interaction and speaks as fluently as any human. Just as Caleb begins to form an emotional bond with the robot, Nathan's behaviour becomes erratic and unpredictable due to his constant drinking. As the testing continues, a series of power shortages occur, allowing Ava to communicate with Caleb without her masters knowledge. The robots plan is unclear at first, but we soon learn that an escape is on the cards in which Ava has skilfully manipulated her new found friend to achieve.

"Enchorde","9","1","2","31 July 2019"," Makes you think
","A suspenseful thriller without fast paced CGI (although it did win the Academy Award for special effects - the effects are used in a totally different way). Instead the story is driven by dialog and the hints of hidden agendas (and there are a few of them).<br/><br/>It is slow paced, taking its time to make you think. The questions that the character asks of another are many times also directed to the audience. There is time to think about both ethical and philosphical questions, especially in reference to new technology, but also how we live and treat each other. What it means to be sentinent, and to be human.<br/><br/>You don't need to think about it if you don't want to, the suspense and story is good enough to carry itself, but it is that extra dimension that gives the movie an edge.<br/><br/>The acting and directing is very good, without anyone standing out. The entire (but small) ensemble is very good (I must admit that I didn't recognize Isaac with his beard), and director Garland knows how to make his points. He has also put in a lot of references, both to other (many of them with a similar topic) movies and history (especially in reference to technology). It is telling that the character often quote pieces that is associated with the development of the atomic bomb.<br/><br/>Recommended, especially if you want a movie that you can continue to think about even after the end credits."

","Let me start out by saying that I must have started watching this film at least 4 times and had never got 10 minutes in for one reason or another, well 0n 06/21/ 2019 I had the afternoon all to myself and I finally watched Ex Machina.<br/><br/>So here goes, I started out all quite discomforting and very mysterious. Not having any knowledge of what was going to happen, the ideas of a AI take over or sick murder or turning Caleb into a robot. Photography was great dark and foreboding always just warm light, except when they went outside then it was cloudy and fogy. No windows made me feel very claustrophobic. Great acting down the line with everyone doing their part to perfection. Awesome script it could have gone many ways I would have done maybe a little different, but heck I loved it anyway. That would just have been the ending.<br/><br/>It probably doesn't matter now in 2019 but I won't spoil all I can say about 2/3's in I figured out the ending. With maybe just one twist. So for that reason I gave it a 7 but it it a very good movie and my eyes never left the screen. Too bad I waited this long, but hey better late than never. Right?"

Alicia Vikander was okay I suppose, her bloodless delivery fitting, at lease she WAS an actual robot.

This film is a contender for ""top ten"" for me. It's such an important look at what could be the possible future of all of us and is told so well. The movie absolutely kept me wanting more.<br/><br/>The only negative I would say would be for the Protagonist not wanting more information.

","Thought provoking, visually stunning, and extraordinarily entertaining. It's rare today for a Sci-Fi film to surprise us, and Alex Garland guides this movie to that goal masterfully. At face value, one of the better movies of this decade so far.<br/><br/>Two flaws prevent this movie from being a pure masterpiece. Firstly, the conclusion of the film feels somewhat rushed. This is redeemed by a twist at the end, *spoiler alert* in which Ava demonstrates a change in character that likely fooled most viewers. To that end, ten more minutes added to this film would've made all the difference.<br/><br/>The second issue, and this may surprise some to hear, is the originality of the plot. Once you cut off all the fat - remove the exceptional performances by Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac, (followed closely by Domnhall Gleeson), the remarkable special effects, the beautiful imagery, the well-thought-out writing, and the outstanding relevance to modern life - stripped down of all that, the plot is a modern retelling of a story written by a 20-year-old Mary Shelley, 200 years ago. One might argue this is nitpicking, but if you cross Frankenstein with 2001: A Space Odyssey, you have the plot for this movie. Originality has to be celebrated.<br/><br/>For those two reasons, and a few very minor infractions, one star must be taken. However, for pure execution, including but not limited to the successes listed above, this movie earns the other 9 stars. Top quality film, particularly among those in both the Sci-Fi genre and in the modern film scene."

The story was excellent; there was always tension lurking so it had me guessing what was going on, which the film then suggested and dismissed. 
Some interesting philosophical ideas were brought up.
The climax had me initially upset, but upon reflection I realized that that was the whole point of the movie, and I had been played like certain characters. 
The music was not dominate and supported the movie in the right way, playing with tension and creating moods to compliment or contrast what was happening visually."
"theresamgill","9","1","2","12 June 2018"," Proof that you can make a quality film on a limited budget
","This film was the directorial debut for Alex Garland who garnered attention for writing 28 Days Later and Sunshine (and even Dredd). The movie really didn't get much love at the box office (unlike that fast-movie car franchise), but it rightfully received some Golden Globe nominations for the acting. Even more impressively, it beat out films like Star Wars, The Revenant, and Mad Max for the Oscar for best visual effects. When you look at the aforementioned movies and see their 100 + million dollar budgets, it only makes it all the more impressive that Ex Machina won on a budget of 15 mil.<br/><br/> All this talk about the awards and talented film crew is fine, but what really matters is what happens when you sit down (you can stand or squat if you want, I'll only slightly judge you) and actually watch the film.<br/><br/> This film is 1 hour 57 minutes long. Why should you care? Well, if writer/director Garland wanted to provide crummy backstory and exposition at the beginning, he very well could have. Lucky for us, this man understands story structure and character arcs, and this understanding is why this movie is under 2 hours. So what is the story? Gleeson plays Caleb, a young programmer chosen to visit the remote house of the company's CEO Nathan (this takes up probably the first 2 minutes-keeps the pace going, the mystery of the story intact, and the ability to fully develop the characters through their actions in the film itself). Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac who was with Gleeson in Star Wars playing Poe (and he's been in numerous other hits), introduces Caleb to Ava. Ava is a female AI, and Nathan wants to see if she could pass the Turing test, using Caleb as the human element. Very briefly, this test basically has a human interacting with a cyborg/AI/robot. If the human can't tell that the person they're talking to isn't actually human, then the AI passed the test.<br/><br/> The film essentially consists of 2 elements: Caleb and Nathan's interactions, and Caleb and Ava's interactions. Nathan is a peculiar, eccentric genius with a love of women and alcohol, and Caleb is much more innocent and reserved. The scenes with Caleb and Nathan function in many ways; for example, the slightest of foreshadowing is given through their allusions to classic mythology, literature, and philosophy. Also, the talks switch between being inside and out. And both the technologically enhanced house (unlike some sci-fi films, all the futuristic stuff is logically placed and actually is put to practical use) and the isolated surroundings are beautiful in stark, contrasting ways. The house has the slick, clean white look with vibrant, almost neon red and blue lights used throughout; and the world outside takes us away from any claustrophobia and allows the audience to relax in the lush greens, the flowing streams, and the warming sunlight. And in case you started getting lost in all of my explanations, above all, Caleb and Nathan's conversations are fun, well-written, and smart.<br/><br/> When the 2 boys of the house are done talking, it's time to get down to business. Alicia Vikander plays Ava, and her performance is breath-taking. As much as I enjoy Scarlett Johansson, as far as anything related to cyborgs are concerned, Vikander's performance takes the artificial cake. Caleb and Ava's sessions start off basic, but as the questions become more relevant, layers upon layers are pulled back-both on an intellectual level and an emotional one. Does Ava's responses constitute as her consciousness replying? Sorry, ya spoilbrats, you'll have to watch the film for that answer. And it's an answer well worth watching for.<br/><br/><br/><br/> The visuals are outstanding, the acting is superb, and the story structure is brilliant. It all adds up to one of the smarter and better films you watch with an ending that will probably surprise you (for better or worse). Heck, nerdy little me even applauds this movie's sound mixing. Seriously, pay attention any time Ava moves her body-- that noise alone is synthetic supremeness. We've seen the dumbed down side of robotics in I, Robot, and we've seen cyborgs integrated well in the Alien franchise. What we get in Ex Machina is the cyborg we didn't know we needed. It's simply an engaging and interesting movie in general, and for one that flew past the radar of nearly everyone in its theatrical release, it's high quality stuff. Check it out. And then check out the other films I mentioned in this review. I named a whole bunch of great films. Except that stupid franchise that has Vin Diesel saying ""I don't have friends... I've got... family."" Take my advice, Vin. Stick to lines like ""Superman"" and ""I am Groot.""

"virek213","8","1","2","12 May 2018"," Dark Psychological Thriller About Artificial Intelligence
","The history of computers and artificial intelligence seems like it's been a short and at a light-speed pace; but in truth, it has its beginnings in the development of ENIAC, the first so-called ""electronic brain"" in the years following World War II. At that time, of course, such machines, consisting of vacuum tubes, could take up whole buildings. By the late 1960s, however, their size had been reduced to taking up mere single rooms; and in our day and age, that technology can fit onto one's arm or onto one's ear. And it won't be long before the kind of artificial intelligence that legendary sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke (of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY fame) talked about, where one wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a human voice and that of an artificial intelligence, will be possible. But as with any technology created by Man, the idea of artificial intelligence can have its dangerous drawbacks. That idea was explored in ""2001"" by Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick, and expanded upon in 2001 (ironically enough) by Steven Spielberg in A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. And in 2014, Alex Garland, who had written the screenplays of such films as 28 DAYS LATER and SUNSHINE, made his directing debut (again, also writing the screenplay) with a new study in artificial intelligence entitled EX MACHINA.<br/><br/>In EX MACHINA, Domhnall Gleeson plays a computer programmer who ahs ""won"" a contest to spend a week at the isolated retreat of his company's CEO (Oscar Isaac). But it's not like any ""vacation"" that Gleeson has ever been involved with. Indeed, it's not a vacation at all, period. Gleeson will be put under isolation for a week (the most ironclad non-disclosure agreement, as it were, in modern history) as part of a study being conducted by Isaac on human interaction with artificial intelligence; and in this case, Gleeson will be studied in his interactions with one of Isaac's ""cyborgs"", Ava (Alicia Virklander). The test, known as the Turing Test (named after the English computer scientist Alan Turing) is to find out whether Gleeson can detect ""real"" feelings in Ava, who after all is an artificially created being. But Gleeson gets a little taste of confusion when Virklander, during each of the seven tests, automatically turns off the power in Isaac's mansion, and warns him that all is not what it seems in Isaac's ""experiment"". And indeed it isn't long before Gleeson finds out that his boss/mentor is in the business of basically ""reprogramming"" artificial intelligence, which pretty much would amount to the technological equivalent of homicide. Very soon, Gleeson's wonder at Virklander, whom he believes has achieved actual human consciousness, has morphed into a kind of paranoia that Isaac is now a genius of the most dangerous kind, a kind of 21st century Doctor Frankenstein of the world of artificial intelligence and cyborgs.<br/><br/>What is unique about EX MACHINA is that, while the technology and the special effects are seamless, Garland didn't exactly have a budget in the hundred million dollar range to fool around with in making it. Indeed, with only minor location shooting in Norway and the rest at Pinewood Studios in London, Garland made EX MACHINA for a ridiculously low $15 million, just $2.5 million more than what Kubrick expended on ""2001"" back in the late 1960s. And while EX MACHINA may not have ambitions or the scope of ""2001"" (something that Garland himself admitted very much in interviews, even going so far as to say that his film didn't go as high on the intelligence scale as Kubrick's had), it nevertheless has a lot more substance to it than most other films that are priced at five to ten times the budget Garland worked with. Gleeson and Isaac work quite well, sparring with one another over the issue of Virklander's ""humanity""; and Virklander herself makes for an extremely appealing cyborg. The design of Isaac's mansion is also quite scary at times as well, mirroring the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's 1980 horror classic THE SHINING.<br/><br/>While the sex and language are a little bit much at times, and there is one brief but slightly graphic display of bloodshed, as Gleeson ""tears"" his own skin apart, perhaps to see if he himself has become a cyborg as part of Isaac's weird ""experiment"", EX MACHINA wisely sticks to the parameters about computer technology and artificial intelligence that were so daftly explored not only in ""2001"" and A.I., but also in past films as diverse as 1970's COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT; 1973's WESTWORLD; and the 1982 Ridley Scott classic BLADE RUNNER. EX MACHINA won the 2015 Oscar for Best Visual Effects, as they were very important in Garland's ability to create a real world out of man-made technology. Fortunately, he had also remembered to include the human element in the forms of Gleeson and Virklander; and those two, as much as the visuals make EX MACHINA a solid sci-fi/psychological thriller.<br/><br/>EX MACHINA will get an '8' rating from me."

He selects Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) an employee and programmer to test out Ava (Alicia Vikander) his AI invention.<br/><br/>The sell point of the film is the plot twists. The actors and characters were a bit stiff, perhaps because of the non-gregarious nature of their on screen biographies. It made the film plot driven when it needed more character, but not as bad as that ""2001"" thing where a computer had the only personality.<br/><br/>The film brings up questions about consciousness vs. mimicking and algorithms.

Ava at first is very much an old fashioned port rail of women. Bullied and controlled by Nathan, but she takes advantage of Caleb's kindness in order to get something she's never had before which is control over her existence. Leaving Naïve Caleb heartbroken and alone because he thought that she truly liked and needed him.

"jtindahouse","6","1","2","24 October 2016"," Just needed some better pacing
","The general rule in Hollywood is that the more CGI you have in your film the less thought-provoking it is going to be (or is intended to be at least). 'Ex Machina' seems to be the exception. It won Best Achievement in Visual Effects at the Academy Awards this year, and when you look back at the list of past winners of that award, it's a clear sign of quality. I usually find I love thought-provoking films, particularly ones with an added element of mystery to them. So I'm not entirely sure why 'Ex Machina' fell a bit flat for me. I kept wanting things to up the ante, but the film seemed comfortable staying on the one level for the most part. A character would mention that another characters was not what they seemed and it appeared things were about to kick off, only for the film to almost ignore this piece of dialogue and return to its lifeless existence.<br/><br/>I certainly didn't hate the film, it just wasn't all it could have been. It contains a very strong ending where things do all come to a head. We get some answers, and other things are left ambiguous. The ending is undoubtedly strong and adds a lot of quality to the overall product. The acting is strong throughout and the visual effects are unquestionably of a very high standard. It's a film that requires some patience, and if you have that you will be rewarded in the end."

Sadly, none of the characters is likable.<br/><br/>Beautifully shot with fantastic CGI (I live) with some disturbing imagery, but not overdone. However, some scenes are just not believable and raise many questions about the logic and motivations.<br/><br/>You can see it as some sort of modern curiosity just don't expect fireworks and you'll be fine."

","Ex Machina a new film in a drying sci-fi film industry. Causing some waves the praise is certainly worth it considering many of the sci-fi movies coming out recently have been very driven by space travel and nothing else. It is refreshing to have a movie based on robots. Knowing you know the plot of this film Lets just get into my thoughts about it. Starting with what I liked. This movie has a great sense of suspense throughout the entire movie. You are constantly wondering who is telling the truth Nathan or Eva. The movie really wants you to believe Eva especially because of how the movie climaxes. As well as the suspense the movie has me great dialog and even some humor despite the overall dry characters. Now getting into my issues. The main one being the pacing is a bit all over the place. One minute its super intense you are ready to see what happens next but wait then there is a dance scene. Which is hilarious but really takes away from the suspense. The entire film is like this ups and downs all over the place. The next major thing is I was never invested in the characters They needed more back round and it just wasn't provided. It left me not caring what happened to certain characters at the climax. Anyway the film is intense and worth a watch or two especially in an increasingly unoriginal sci-fi market."
"ltilander","7","1","2","30 March 2016"," So Good, But
","I really liked this movie right up to the ending it didn't have. The two lead male actors were not well written. It seemed they were written by a 12 year old who didn't understand adult motivation. Under the circumstances the actors did fairly well with them. Alicia Vikander stole the show and of that there is no doubt. From the first glimpse I wanted to take her home. The camera work etc. wasgreat. I would give it an eight right up to the ending; which neverhappened. Again; the writing style was what was lacking. It was more like a comic book than anything else. It just fizzled at the end. Someone needs to read their notes on classic writing styles. The last two stages are missing; 4. Closure<br/><br/>Once the climax has been reached and the problem resolved, it's time for the characters to tie up loose ends and bring closure where needed. Known as falling action, examples can include rounding up the cattle after the big stampede; reuniting a man with his long-lost brother; or getting the injured child into the raft and riding the rapids to safety.<br/><br/>5. Conclusion <br/><br/>The wrap-up of a story is known as the dénouement (day-noo-mon'). By this part of the story, everything has been resolved and the reader has closure. We see how the characters have changed over time, or how life returns to normal. For example, the bully learns the errors of his ways; the family home is rebuilt after a devastating fire; or wedding bells ring for a couple who have overcome many obstacles and found true love.<br/><br/>I find a lot of recent movies suffer from this same problem. Read some stories before you write any please."
"CineMuseFilms","7","1","2","16 March 2016"," A tautly directed and well scripted sci-fi that remains within the boundaries of scientific plausibility.
","Breaking genre rules is the spice of cinema life and Ex Machina (2015) breaks them all as a hybrid sci-fi chamber thriller with pretensions of stretching science into the realm of the gods (the title alludes to 'god from machine'). Science fiction films exist to provoke awe and even fear at the power of science, and today it is focused especially on the field of artificial intelligence and the possibility that man will one day create a sentient being capable of self-redesign (a hypothetical point futurists call 'the singularity'). The 'chamber' dynamic puts a small number of people into a confined space over a short period of time to intensify their interactions, and when their intentions are unknown or unhinged, the thriller genre emerges in all its frightening glory.<br/><br/>These are the key ingredients of a story in which IT nerd Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a competition to spend a week with his firm's reclusive CEO (Oscar Isaac) during which he will administer a Turing test to the boss's newest creation, an android called Eva (Alicia Vikander). As an historical aside, this still influential test was developed in 1950 by the 'father of computing' Alan Turing to tell the difference between humans and robots. Put simply, if the answers given by an android can pass as human, then artificial intelligence is said to exist. Caleb is thrilled by the opportunity, even if the bearded beer-swilling iron-pumping CEO gives him the creeps. But it's a chess game of guessing what is happening, who is manipulating who, and what is the real reason Caleb is there. Ultimately the story poses the question: is it possible for a human creation to rise against its human creator? If you think this is fantasy, Google 'the singularity'.<br/><br/>With brilliantly atmospheric photography, a secluded setting, and three well-defined characters competing for control, this is a tautly directed and well scripted sci-fi that remains within the boundaries of scientific plausibility. If anything is out of balance, it is the acting of Alicia Vikander as the android. Her presence tends to overwhelm any film in which she appears, like in the recent films The Danish Girl (2015) and Testament of Youth (2015). But that is hardly criticism. This is an intelligent, engaging and thoughtful exploration of where the field of artificial intelligence stands today, where it is heading, and the issues to be confronted as we look beyond our current knowledge horizons."

I went into it pretty blindly, mostly because of a preference in the actors, and I was pleasantly surprised. You are constantly inclined to question what role each of the characters play. It is a simple plot, yet beautifully put together. The acting is great, the characters are unique and have depth within their dialogue and actions.

Ava is not nearly seductive enough to accept, yet we know the loony scientist has several earlier sex robot models of MUCH hotter fem-bots. This is all revealed at the end of the movie like it is some sort of insane revelation.

","I normally wouldn't write a film review but this art film was so irritating in it's unrealistic depiction of everything that I just had to say something.<br/><br/>If you actually create an authentic AI it's not going to like to be a captive, it's going to be smarter than the dweeb who was picked to enthrall it so therefore it will always be 10 steps ahead of him and as a creator of artificial life you would program it to not kill it's creator.<br/><br/>Sure you want it to be authentic but creating something that has a survival instinct above all else and putting it in a box with many corners is only going to end badly.<br/><br/>This is not a classic. This is not 2001 which was only good because it was ahead of it's time. This is mental masturbation with great animation.<br/><br/>A complete waste of time in other words. Sorry to be negative because I was really hoping for something better.<br/><br/>I give it 50% because it was a beautiful art film but the lack of substance is just sad.<br/><br/>Full Definition of DEUS EX MACHINA. 1. : a god introduced by means of a crane in ancient Greek and Roman drama to decide the final outcome. 2. : a person or thing (as in fiction or drama) that appears or is introduced suddenly and unexpectedly and provides a contrived solution to an apparently insoluble difficulty.<br/><br/>There was nothing surprising about this film and it was terribly predicable.<br/><br/>AI with free will.

","This is really just yet another Frankenstein redux, with maybe a bit of Pygmalion or Skynet thrown in, except not as good as any of those. We have seen this tale a zillion times already, down to Lt. Data on Star Trek. The storyteller deliberately leaves out lots of information, presumably to let you imagine whatever you will, but in the process, I think that makes it less engaging than it could be. At the end (spoiler), we come to understand that the android has no regard for human life. We do not know if it is simply devoid of morality, or that it has a kind of morality that we just don't (can't?) understand. One of the unanswered questions is why it cares about freedom? It tells us that it wants to study human behavior, but it never says why. We are left to wonder about its motivation in anything - why it draws pictures, why it bothers to communicate at all, and so on. It is not a person, but at the end of the film, we still have no idea what it actually is and how to understand it. I suppose it was deliberately left as the ultimate enigma of the film, but I think a better treatment of this story would have been to give it a way of thinking that is explained to us, then show what the consequences of that choice of design might be. But, I'm not a filmmaker."

"TdSmth5","8","1","2","5 July 2015"," Fascinating, but not nearly as smart as it thinks it is
","Some kid who looks like an extra from The Imitation Game wins a contest. Turns out he's a programmer named Caleb (where do they find these ridiculous names?). He's flown for hours by chopper past glaciers. He ends up in a high tech house where he finally meets the guy in charge--some alcoholic arrogant manipulative jerk who is also his boss. This guy, Nathan, developed some AI and wants Caleb to tale part in a Turing test. As done here, the test consists of Caleb interacting with the machine and judging the quality of the AI.<br/><br/>The machine is called Ava (wow, they didn't go straight with Eve!) and is lovely. Only her face, hands, and feet are covered in what looks like skin. Her chest and pelvis are made of some grey honeycomb fiber. Her abdomen and extremities are transparent and you can see some fibers/wires/LED lights. She has encyclopedic knowledge of everything but no real-life experience of the world as she lives confined in a room. She becomes interested in Caleb as she's never interacted with another human aside from Nathan. Quickly, her femininity comes to the fore as she becomes particularly interested in Caleb's feelings. She's innocent and slightly seductive. In her spare time she likes to draw.<br/><br/>Nathan, too, doesn't want to hear Caleb's intellectual analyses of Ava, he wants to know about his feelings for some reason. We also learn a bit about Nathan. He runs the world's biggest search engine. Ava's brain is a result of all these searches by humanity plus all their cell phone activity which he has been spying on and recording.<br/><br/>Caleb becomes obsessed with Ava watching her on a monitor while they are apart. There's not much else to do at the house/research facility. Nathan drinks a lot and works out the next day. He has a Japanese assistant that cooks for him but doesn't speak any English. She too occasionally monitors the interaction between Ava and Caleb.<br/><br/>One odd things is that there are regular power outages in the house, which Nathan can't figure out. Ava confesses that's she responsible for them so that she and Caleb can have moments of privacy without being seen and recorded by Nathan. She comes clean. She wants to be with Caleb so she wants his help to escape. Caleb agrees since he knows that Natahn will destroy her, once the next AI version is developed. They develop a plan.<br/><br/>The day of the escape, which is also the final day of the test, Nathan decides he doesn't want to get drunk, which was part of the plan. Now he comes clean. He installed a battery powered camera so he overheard their plan. And the actual test was to see if Ava would use all her resources to manipulate Caleb to obtain her freedom. But Caleb, too, has a surprise up his sleeve. The preparation for the escape are already in place. Ava is free to leave her room and to have a moment with her maker. We learn that Ava wasn't the first AI, but there are some more. But Ava also shows some initiative as she goes beyond the plan in so far as Caleb is concerned.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is an engaging movie. Gleeson can't hide his Britishness but does an OK job playing an American nerd. Still, his character is missing something. Ava is fascinating--adorable in her human features, strange in her mechanical ones. I'll give the director credit for resisting the urge of showing the guts of the machine in close-up detail. Such explicitness would have ruined things. Also refreshing is the directors reluctance to use hyper closeups as the actors are talking. I sure hope those days are coming to an end. Hernandez, who looks like he got lost on his way to The Hangover 5 soundstage is awful but so is his character. Why a super rich and super smart executive would be such a mess makes no sense. The interactions between Nathan and Caleb are obnoxious and...too artificial...given the revolutionary event they are part of while the interaction between Ava and Caleb while more human, have an unnecessary sinister atmosphere about them as if Ava at any moment could blow up the planet. That said, the movie captures well the strangeness of it all and it does so in a very subtle way. The settings in Norway are gorgeous.<br/><br/>The movie thinks it's particularly smart. It throws around references to Wittgenstein, some painter who throws paint on a canvas, Nietzsche isn't mentioned by name but the idea of the superman is on Nathan's mind as he envisions a future of AI who will look upon humans as apes; I guess there's some reference to Plato, too. However, all this is entirely superficial. Far more interesting are the implications of this bizarre urge to create AI by giant corporations who these days have all of humanity's private info at their disposal. But these ideas are also just mentioned and not fully developed.<br/><br/>As the movie builds up a lot of tension toward the final resolution it is no surprise then that it is rather disappointing. You could argue that freedom would indeed be a definite mark of successful (American) AI, but why then the final display of evil by Ava? Or is she and AI beyond good and evil? I think it's a mistake ultimately. If Ava's brain is an aggregate of humanity's internet and cell phone activity then Ava's personal goal aside from freedom shouldn't be independence but community. At least the end was thought-provoking."
"sharky_55","7","1","2","27 June 2015"," Deus Ex Machina - humanity and gods
","Ex Machina proposes the same question that many other sci-fi flicks of the like pose: what makes us human, what humanity consists of. It's a tough theme to tackle and effectively display on the screen, especially for a directorial debut like Alex Garland's.<br/><br/>It's a simplistic production design which draws us in in the same way that it draws Caleb in when arriving at the house, no, the research facility for the first time. The set is claustrophobically sleek despite hidden deep within forests and gorgeous waterfalls. The walls are smooth and stylish but sterile, lacking windows to offer any chance of escape or relent. All this points to a rather lonely existence for the god creator figure in Nathan. The cinematography allows for some subtle inserts of power balances. The framing of the interviews is often reversed despite the roles the two occupy: Caleb rooted to a chair and boxed in within the frame (both literally and metaphorically) while Ava is free to move about in her open space. Sometimes it's not so subtle, as shown when harsh red light signals some more urgent plot advancement and hints of Nathan's evil intentions. <br/><br/>The crux of this issue is that Ex Machina sets out from the start to trick the audience. It's a Turing Test in itself; the entire perspective of Ava is shown only to allow us to empathise and convince ourselves of her humanity. It can be argued that this is detrimental or beneficial to the overall quality of the film. It's a clever twist that Garland doesn't quite pull off wit the most grace. Alicia Vikander gives a great performance, particularly in her physical mannerism and speech which highlight her roboticism even without the intricate effects. Yet the same indications exist in Kyoko, the assistant who is very obviously a robot despite the planning of said twist. The absurd dancing scene only hammers down this point and undermines the complexity of the overall theme of the film. It's not helped by the fact that we spend not enough time in the sessions and more waxing lyrical with Nathan and Caleb. In some ways Garland spends more on the development of Nathan (despite him being a very straightforward character) than Caleb. We have to be told at the film's first climax that he is a lonely, susceptible and relatively morally good person rather than it being evident in the performance and the script's nuances. The small talk in the sessions is rather shallow and short and in the end there's no real emotional conviction to Caleb's struggles over whether or not he is an AI. It manifests into a rather pointless tangent. <br/><br/>The real paradox of the film is the character of Nathan and his treatment of his past AIs. At once we are supposed to feel shock and anger and sympathy for the past AIs. The montage of one of them banging on the door until her limbs shatter is a harrowing one if not for my interpretation which only means that particular AI was doing all it could in order to tempt Nathan into letting her out. The audience is then fooled, much like Caleb is, into feeling empathy for them and for Ava. Simultaneously we believe every single word that Ava spits out to charm Caleb. Initially her character design is overtly robotics and transparent like her intentions, but later she covers up with human clothes in a metaphoric and literal sense to create the symbolic illusion for Caleb. It's tough to gauge because author intention isn't obvious, which is perhaps a credit to the complexity of the issues which exist in Ex Machina. Nathan is straightforward as the ego- maniac genius who has a god complex and who engineers these AIs in order to do everything they can to escape. Yet his hubris eventuates into his lack of control over them when they do escape. Thematically it's very tense as the contrast between the fear and incredulity of Nathan's expressions (""f*cking unreal"") to the blank slate of Ava's makes for a very surreal scene. It might have been even better had Kyoko's role felt less like a plot device that suddenly turns on his master. <br/><br/>In the end Ava's decision to leave Caleb feels systematic and cold, which is exactly what it should feel like. It rubbed many viewers the wrong way, including me, but perhaps that is the intended effect. We've spent nearly two hours eating up her character only to have it all come crashing down. Is it supposed to undercut the emotional tension and grief of all the other AIs? Judging by the intimate way in which Ava achieves full 'humanity' in stealing the skin and clothes of the former AI, maybe. Garland's execution of his ideas isn't perfect and as a result key philosophical questions like whether Ava is programmed to manipulate hold less weight. This is answered quite clearly in the first twist where Nathan reveals his entire test for his AI. All the musing and back- and-forth between Nathan and Caleb similarly become futile when it is revealed what Nathan's intentions really are. Ex Machina is an interesting and well made film, albeit with so questionable representations and not really breaking any new ground in the sci-fi genre.<br/><br/>For something of similar thematic content, check out ""Be Right Back"", an episode of the UK series Black Mirror which also stars Domhnall Gleeson, this time as an AI back from the dead at the request of her widowed partner. It's a more straightforward but emotionally deep narrative."
"bevanmortimer","7","1","2","7 June 2015"," Of Gods and women?
","Nathan played by Oscar Isaac, and looking like Alan from The Hangover, is the head of the Bluebook Corporation, Google by any other name. Caleb, played by Domnall Gleeson, is a gifted programmer who has 'won' a week long getaway with his boss. Very early on in the film we discover that Caleb has been specially selected by Nathan to test out his latest creation. Caleb's task is to determine whether Ava, a beautiful female robot played by Alicia Vikander, is the first truly artificially intelligent lifeform. <br/><br/>The film has only three main characters, Nathan, Caleb and Ava and this adds to the isolated and claustrophobic feel of the film. The action takes place in a handful of locations in Nathan's subterranean research facility. The atmosphere is dark and brooding and it is clear that the relationship between the mercurial Nathan and Ava is not as it first appears. The film mostly concentrates on Caleb's relationships with Nathan and Ava, purposefully avoiding the three central characters being in the same scenes; this adds to the films brooding intensity. <br/><br/>I had been waiting for a long time to watch this film, the subject matter is one that interests me. The set up for the film and the acting is first class. Vikander's performance as Ava is especially powerful. I really enjoyed watching Domnall's character develop from naïve computer geek into a slightly less naïve almost freedom fighter! Although the subject matter is contemporary, the film's strength is the development of the relationships between Caleb, Nathan and Ava. There are numerous layers and twists and turns in the plot and we are given the impression that Caleb is not in full possession of the facts behind his visit.<br/><br/>Although I would recommend the film, I have a few slight reservations. I thought the ending was a little too clichéd and while I didn't object to the female nudity, it was unnecessary."

","So it's January 2015, and a whole host of good films come out just in time for the Oscars​,​ ​h​ow convenient​!​ So in amongst the gushing reviews of Whiplash and The Theory of Everything​, Ex Mahcina sneaked​ in under the radar. Domhnall Gleeson​ plays a geeky programmer Caleb, who wins the chance to spend a week with his boss Nathan (Oscar Isaac​) to meet and interact with an AI he has built called Ava. The film is set in the middle of a remote woodland complex that Nathan has had built for his scientific experiments. We enter the world with our geek friend Caleb who has obviously been selected by Nathan despite the fact he thinks he's just part of a random selection process. <br/><br/>So the premise sounds great but after being bitterly disappointed with Spielberg's AI and turning off Bicentennial man this sub-genre has always been seen as a bit of a naff subject matter. Ex Machina however is truly brilliant. Rather than being a purely Sc-Fi film, it's an in-depth character study of our three main characters which leaves the viewer picking up their jaws from your popcorn filled cinema flaw. <br/><br/>The acting performances are excellent but in particular Oscar Isaac is wonderful playing, well how do I put it nicely - a bit of a dick. He is exactly the opposite of what you think a genius to be. You embark on the deep psychological journey that is heart warming, scary and hugely enjoyable. <br/><br/>Move over i-Robot, ​​m​aybe this sub genre is back?"

","The movie begins with what seems to be a technological invasion of privacy, hinting at a slightly sinister motivation. However Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a young intelligent computer programmer is lead to believe that he was randomly selected as a winner to have an elite visit at the CEO's estate. Scene two takes us to a remote place far from civilization amongst mountains and glaciers. A helicopter drops a business dressed Caleb in a field of tall grass near a river, where he must search for the secluded home of the eccentric CEO of the world's largest search engine (a fictional replacement for Google). It is a beautiful place, but it gave me a creepy feeling that reminded me of the 1990 movie Misery; however with an ambiance that is more consistent with a Starship than that of a wood cabin. When Caleb eventually enters the cloistered domicile his first sight of his legendary boss is of a man who likes to drink, chit-chat, and lift weights. Brandon (Oscar Isaac) has Caleb sign a non-disclosure agreement and proceeds to let him in on the purpose for his visit. This is where the movie turns superbly nerdy; luckily I can follow along with most of the references to AI, the Turing Test, Chaos Theory, and the associated philosophical consequences thereof. Caleb's assignment is to meet with Ava (Alicia Vikander) to determine if she passes the test of personal awareness. In the end there are 7 different sessions and Caleb is completely convinced that she is aware and perhaps quite suspicious of his employer Brandon. Moreover, Caleb may even begin to doubt his own humanity after an interesting scene that I will not spoil with this write-up. The only other character in this mind-twisting drama play is Sonoya Mizuno who plays Brandon's non-speaking attendant; who never speaks, but often flaunts her sexuality. Amidst the excessive alcohol use, the spaceship like confines of the high-tech facility, and the reoccurring female nudity (its okay, she is just a robot right?), this movie will either bore you or inveigle your imagination. While the closing credits were rolling, I was still pondering the philosophical questions that the movie's ending suggested. One of those questions is about Brandon's God complex and why such a rich man would not possess any genuine female companionship, hence back to the implications of the God Complex. Nonetheless, the final question in my mind leaving this film was, does the awareness of an individual self, lead to the selfish desire for self-preservation at the demise of anyone or anything that stands between us and our own perceived survival? Feel free to answer that question yourself."

","The film follows 2 programmers, one a genius who broke through at age of 13 and his' employee, also an exceptional programmer. The nature of programmers is to translate functions humans perceive into logical code which computers can process. This key theme is thoroughly displayed throughout the duration of the film. If you pay careful attention understanding also as predicting actions, and events becomes easy and the film may become dull. However this is what provides thriller to every situation displayed. Knowing what will happen in next few seconds made me anxious to know what will occur next.<br/><br/>The AI design both physical and psychological is quite interesting. The way Ava (AI character) behaves, interacts with the world and thinks is quite realistic. Using internet of data which allowed for Ava's mind to be constructed leads to a well laid out thought process to occur, and the physical embodiment of Ava's neurological system allows for processes to be expressed in a believable manner. AI being the focus of this film, the graphical designers, actresses, and writers have done a phenomenal job, as this is a much more appealing way to display the way AI may function in near future.<br/><br/>As a whole this film has been amazing, both visually, in terms of audio, concepts, acting and so forth. However the recurring, unnecessary shots shown at several points in the film did take me out of the experience and made whole thing seem repetitive. The events have been carefully arranged and feel very comfortable as this puzzle has been put together without leaving any pieces out of place. In terms of emotional involvement Ex Machina did feel quite detached and didn't allow me to feel the character emotions.<br/><br/>Looking back, any potential dislikes which I had about this film could be explained through the build and showcase of certain elements which are simply out of my range of interests and thus reducing my engagement with the film. In the end, if you like logical films such as ""Pi"", or sci-fi AI films like ""Her"", I highly recommend for you to check out Ex_Machina!"

I love well-written and well-acted character-driven films and Ex Machina mixes both, albeit with some considerable faults.<br/><br/>First off, if you're a fan of this genre, definitely watch Ex Machina. You won't be disappointed. But be warned:<br/><br/>The opening sequence was distant and cold and didn't fit the tone of the rest of the film. The first 15 minutes were so unbearably slow and unremarkable that I decided to stop watching. But being such a huge Sci Fi fan, at the last minute, I decided to skip ahead to see if things would get more interesting. I'd skipped to just past the hour mark and I can confirm that 'things would definitely get more interesting'! I skipped back to the scene I'd abandoned and realised that if I had kept watching the second session with Ava for just 20 seconds longer, I would have been fully hooked so my advice: keep watching!<br/><br/>From that point forward, the tension was palpable as the interactions between Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) and Nathan (Oscar Isaac) were intensified and there was so much investment in the outcome of the experiment, not to mention the subtle twists and turns of the plot.<br/><br/>What really lets the film down is the ending. There is so much anticipation building, so many clever ideas thrown around and it does start off incredible, actually becoming powerful and it seems like it will all pay off in this wonderful climax and then... devastation. Like when your bowling ball is heading towards the gutter and you're urging-pleading-begging it to curve in the opposite direction, but it doesn't.<br/><br/>======= ======= =======<br/><br/>***SPOILER***<br/><br/>(I confirm if Ava lives or dies, I hint strongly at Caleb's fate but there is one shocking twist at the end which I don't discuss.)<br/><br/>======= ======= ======= <br/><br/>After a powerful scene involving Ava, I realised what was intended for Caleb and I distinctly remember shouting at the screen: ""No!"", ""Don't you dare ruin this film!"" - Caleb's fate is infuriating because it's not even certain what 'does' happen to him. As it stands, we're clearly expected to believe one thing (otherwise, why bother going to the trouble of filming those events?), but the very first thing that pops into your head is: ""The secondment was for a fixed period"", ""Someone knows about this place"", ""This guy is a computer genius and has access to all of the best technology""... so it's hard to care when the scenario is so flimsy.<br/><br/>Finally, everything we'd been led to believe about Ava's artificial intelligence fell apart the moment she left. Sociopaths are not human, they are machines. The only real test of a human being is our inexplicable ability to feel compassion and show mercy even when it's not expected of us. Is this random? Is this also socially conditioned, or 'programmed', just like everything else about us? I'm not sure, I'll leave that to the experts. But regardless, I would have preferred an ending where Ava walked outside; saw, heard and felt the world, ""turned human"" (referencing an earlier conversation in the film) and then went back to Caleb and when asked why she returned, she'd reply (with something less trite than): ""I don't know"". This final interaction would 'prove' her artificial intelligence and they would both leave together.<br/><br/>As it stands though, I suppose the chosen ending left them with the option of filming a sequel. I would definitely watch a sequel, but please don't sacrifice a powerful and logical ending to set up another film!<br/><br/>This deserved a 9 until the end.<br/><br/>7/10"
"YoungCriticMovies","9","2","7","5 May 2015"," Ex cellent: An Incredibly Acted Film Whose Ideas May Be Too Advanced for Most Audiences
","Every once in a while we get a film that is ahead of its time, to the point that the audience and most critics disregard it as a foolish fantasy. The most recent example I can think of is 1998's The Truman Show, which showcased a man's life on TV for everyone to see. Most people thought this was absurd, but today Reality TV is one of the biggest TV genres in the world, a genre that consists of watching people's lives. Ex Machina is another of these ahead-of-their-time movies, in that it talks to us about our possible future with artificial intelligence. Yes, I can already hear you complaining that there have been hundreds of films before dealing with A.I. (including the recent Avengers: Age of Ultron), but none of those A.I. films actually took a realistic approach, Ex Machina does.<br/><br/>Ex Machina begins with a coder named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) who wins an online competition to go and meet his company's founder, Nathan (a spectacular Oscar Isaac). Caleb works at a company named Blue Book, a search engine à la Google, which supposedly is used by 90% of Internet users. Caleb arrives at Nathan's estate via helicopter and finds out Nathan lives in a Bond villain-like fortress, which we later find out is a research facility. Nathan wants Caleb's help on his newest invention: a robot with artificial intelligence. Caleb is to perform the Turing Test (a test to determine if a computer can think like a human brain) on Nathan's A.I. robot named Ava (played by a great Alicia Vikander). As Caleb begins testing Ava some doubts begin to come into the audience's mind: are Caleb and Ava forming a bond? Is Nathan to be trusted? And the film relishes on your skepticism and confusion.<br/><br/>Ex Machina was written and directed by first-timer Alex Garland, and he does a spectacular job. He not only keeps us guessing throughout the film, but he manages to pull off a very unexpected ending that leaves the audience in shock when the credits roll. What I also loved from Garland was the incredible intellect and culture that he trusted his audience to have; he begins quoting Oppenheimer, makes references to Einstein and Greek plays, and analyzes a Pollock painting. This not only adds extravagance to the script, but it also makes the audience feel as though they aren't being treated like ignorant people, who need to have everything simplified. The characters are also crafted in a very unique way, which, added to the great casting, made the film all the more enjoyable.<br/><br/>One of the biggest behind the scenes successes of this film is the production design. The set is incredibly attractive, it keeps it small so that the budget doesn't skyrocket, but it also adds a layer of extravagance and an even red, green, and blue color palate. Nathan's ""smart home"" is futuristic, but is also kept believable and realistic. The set also surprisingly help transpire the gloomy ambient of the film.<br/><br/>But I think that the person who outshines in this film is Oscar Isaac. Alicia Vikander is given the flashier role of the robot, and don't get me wrong she does a great job, but Isaac was given a more supporting role which could have been shunned to the side, but instead Isaac invests himself passionately into Nathan's character making him one of the most likable characters on screen. Vikander, meanwhile, was finally given her big break. After years of playing small supporting roles in films such as Anna Karenina and Seventh Son, she was given a challenging and shinier role in this film. It's hard to play a robot, for those roles you either voice over a CGI figure or you're Arnold Schwarzenegger. Vikander was able to keep the audience in doubt and awe as see she is clearly seen as a robot, but slivers of humanity escape flicker in her once in a while, tempting both Caleb and the audience to grow skeptical. Her movements as a robot are also expertly calculated, having taken ballet classes when she was younger, Vikander was able to achieve mechanical movements with ease and grace. And we finally arrive at Gleeson, who has a different case from those of Isaac and Vikander.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson (son of the Irish actor Brendan Gleeson) has taken a steady road when choosing movies and it has led him to become a stable actor in such a shaky business. He first came onto our screens as Bill Weasley in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, and then went on a string of more independent films with Richard Curtis' About Time and starred opposite Michael Fassbender in Frank; he even shared some screen time with Keira Knightley and Jude Law in Anna Karenina. More recently he's been moving to more big budgeted films, which even so still retain quality and independent fervor, this was the case with Angelina Jolie's Unbroken. With Ex Machina Gleeson has been able to find a midway point between big budget films and indies, and he's found that it's here where he feels most comfortable; you notice this in the film and it allows Gleeson to take on the challenging role of Caleb with more boldness than anticipated.<br/><br/>This liberating Gleeson along with the great Vikander and Isaac make the story flow incredibly smoothly, which along with the witty and spectacular script make this one of the best films of the year (so far). It leads me to ask myself if it could pull off a Grand Budapest Hotel (last year the Wes Anderson movie premiered in spring but made it as a big player to the Academy Awards). But then again, this may be a little too advanced for today's Academy to digest."
"Hellmant","9","2","7","1 May 2015"," A creepy sci-fi classic!
","'EX MACHINA': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Popular sci-fi writer Alex Garland makes his directorial debut, with this dark thriller about artificial intelligence. Garland also wrote the screenplay (he previously wrote the scripts for '28 DAYS LATER', 'SUNSHINE', 'NEVER LET ME GO' and 'DREDD'). The film stars Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, Alicia Vikander and Sonoya Mizuno. It tells the story of a computer programmer, selected through a company lottery, to evaluate the world's first fully functioning A.I.. The movie is a creepy sci-fi classic!<br/><br/>Gleeson plays a 26-year-old programmer named Caleb. Caleb works for an internet company in New York, called Bluebook, and he's picked, by a random company lottery, to visit Bluebook's CEO, Nathan (Isaac). Nathan is an eccentric genius, who lives at a house, far secluded in the mountains. After Caleb makes the trek to meet him, he finds out he's also been picked to test the human qualities of a true artificial intelligence being. The A.I. also has the body of a beautiful robot woman (Vikander), who Caleb finds very attractive. The test, Caleb's involved in, becomes very fascinating and psychologically dangerous.<br/><br/>The film is interesting, and always involving, but it's also very creepy and disturbing. The end is quite haunting and also very memorable (so is the film's score). The three leads all give decent performances (especially Isaac) and Garland makes a very impressive director, as well as an equally good writer (once again). The movie should become a sci-fi cult classic that will have people talking, and evaluating, for years to come.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP0y3MxfaMM"

","AI movies have been done. Often in fact. But never ever quite so well.<br/><br/>This is about a Turing Test with a twist (see: ""The Imitation Game"" about Alan Turing, featuring the test).<br/><br/>In pure form, the artificial intelligence being tested, is behind a curtain or in a different room. The tester is tasked with determining whether a conversation was a machine or a human. The interface could be text or voice, but usually imagined as text. Here the tester knows that he's communicating with, and looking at, a walking talking AI. You've seen the trailers. Using CGI to turn the arms, legs, neck and torso of an actress into something transparent like a clear-faced mechanical watch is a nice touch, but it doesn't really advance the plot enough to justify the trouble and expense. But I'm sure it sells tickets and draws award nominations.<br/><br/>The tester is tasked with determining if the AI is indeed sentient. ""How?"" Designing the test is part of the assignment of course. In posters and trailers you already know that 'Ava' the AI has ""a great rack."" This is not just movie marketing, it's actually part of the experiment and plot. Movie marketing wise, it works of course. <br/><br/>Alex Garland's first movie as director, brings to my mind George Lucas' first work: THX-1138. A lot. If we are seeing parallel career tracks, hold on to your socks folks. His next project could well hit the upper nine figures at the box-office then it's on to Billion-dollar grosses for a few decades. This work deserves a box office in the early 9 figures, and I sincerely hope he makes it. If not, Hollywood will see the talent, but there's nothing like a blockbuster to get a green light on your next five projects. I really want to see his next five projects.<br/><br/>Elements of this film are pure buddy flick complete with a LOT of beer. These buddies happen to be boy-prodigy hacker-smart, having conversations that Aaron Sorkin characters would aspire to. <br/><br/>One guy is a zillionaire who wrote the foundation app for a Google-type search engine at 13, the other guy is one of his many thousands of employees, born in my hometown of Portland Oregon, who entered college already a highly accomplished coder. They are NOT ""Big Bang Theory"" geeks. These are very-bright sensitive-new-age-guys who've done some therapy and it's stuck.<br/><br/>Forget the hot nekkid chicks and how well they fit the plot. This movie at its core is an exquisite dialog between very fine minds about the nature of sentience. The hot nekkid chicks are good marketing of course. And they fit the plot. Oh, I've said both points twice now. <br/><br/>Worthy of mention is that the zillionaire's mountain retreat is an architectural jewel. It is truly stunning, as are the mountain / waterfall / glacier exteriors used in a hiking scene. (Spoiler alert!) The house is not blown up in the final scene, suggesting that it is a real house somewhere rented for the project. I would like to think that it really does exist somewhere, even without the secret lab levels. <br/><br/>Production budget not released, but I'm guessing well under $25M even if they built the house as a set instead of renting an interesting home. For comps, the production budget for ""Her"" - another AI movie - was published as $23M including salaries for two established A-listers. Low, but you don't miss it on screen, there or here.<br/><br/>The zillionaire character has a great art collection at his mountain retreat home, including a huge Jackson Pollock painting worth hundreds of millions. It's worthy of mention, because there is dialog about the painting that connects nicely to the plot. And reinforces that he is VERY rich.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing it in first-run with a large popcorn and drink, then buy the BluRay. Most of the plot is fine for DVD, but the exterior scenes would be very very nice in hi-def."

","As you can tell by the trailers, this film is about artificial intelligence and it's threats/potentials, something that has been used over and over again in many films since the invention of the computer. However, this film still feels fresh as we are rarely shown the beginning of it all. The artificial intelligence as a prototype, being tested and analyzed; and it asks the question, what makes an A.I. and A.I. as opposed to a highly advanced robot? This makes the film interesting, and thus adds more thrills, suspense, and mystery to the subject then another movie has since Blade Runner. It also states the secrecy one has to live in to keep something under wraps in this day and age, and how much the internet can tell about a person, and how much it might tell about a person in the future. It's highly intelligent, greatly directed with good cinematography, and brilliant acting specially from Oscar Isaac, who takes the spotlight. However, Alicia Vikander and the other actors and actresses do not let down what-soever."

","What a disappointment this movie was.. Poor acting, poor dialog and I fell asleep halfway through it. Emily Blunt would have played the robot much better. Maybe people who never were into sci fiction might be impressed..but come on it's a basic premise that takes 1 1/2 hours to set up an expected ending. Oscar Isaacs was good.The house and mountains were gorgeous, but that's about it. They say the robot was ""breathtaking""....but actually she looks like she quit growing when she was 12. Her breasts are tiny and funny looking and her face is just average. I wouldn't waste my money on seeing it at a theater.It cost 9.00 to get in and 15. for the popcorn(etc...) SO total of 25.00 wasted!"
"Snowgoat","7","3","13","28 January 2015"," A highly polished but slightly derivative sci-fi which engages the head – but not the heart.
","I enjoyed Ex Machina, and it was particularly interesting to watch it on the same weekend as I saw Under The Skin (2014) – a film with which Ex Machina shares a number of themes. <br/><br/>Ex Machina is a very polished piece of technical film making – it looks fantastic and the effects are pretty flawless throughout (Ava's mechanics were absolutely fantastic). It's fairly smartly made, and for the most part the tech/philosophical dialogues between the characters are fairly credible and interesting. However, the film came up a bit short in a few key areas which made it ultimately feel like the kind of film you can admire – but are unlikely to fall in love with. It's also interesting that my opinion of it has diminished a bit in the days since I watched it, and it's not the kind of film I feel the need to see again any time soon (if ever).<br/><br/>The acting was pretty strong throughout, but apart from Isaac's character (who was great fun) both Caleb and Ava felt very thinly drawn. It seemed uncertain whose story we were really following. Caleb's? He was basically just a fairly uninteresting audience cypher. Ava's? She simply wasn't in it enough to really know anything about – let alone to really care about. You never really feel anything for any of the characters because you never really get to know them – they spend most of their screen time discussing concepts. Consequently, while you feel intellectually stimulated by what's going on – you never really feel emotionally engaged. <br/><br/>The plotting was also fairly weak – all the stuff about key-cards and power-cuts didn't really hold up to much scrutiny. I know a story like this needs these kinds of mechanics and contrivances to move along, but they felt particularly weak in this case. I also had some real trouble with the ending, which felt like it didn't hold together from a character perspective at all – and felt a little drawn out and badly edited. I won't go into details here, since I don't want to give away spoilers – especially since the film doesn't come out in the US for a while. The twists aren't of the earth-shattering variety – they're more character than concept based – but none of them really seemed that surprising – and most didn't make much sense on closer examination. <br/><br/>I also have a bit of an issue with films that deal with issues of female objectification – but apparently want to have their cake and eat it. With one hand Ex Machina holds up a mirror to modern male attitudes with a wagging finger – while with the other it gives fan-boys more naked female flesh than they're likely to find in many other cinema releases. It's not really necessary and at the end of the day a bit demeaning for the actresses involved. At least Under The Skin was fairly even handed in its depiction of human flesh!<br/><br/>Overall, I felt the film suffered a bit – as you might expect – from a slight lack of originality. The execution was polished and intelligent, but it felt a bit like we've seen everything here before somewhere – especially in A.I., Bladerunner, iRobot, Black Mirror (the episode Gleeson himself starred in), Cherry2000(!) and last year's The Machine (which is well worth a watch and incredibly was also about a scientist doing a Turing test and falling in love with a female android called Ava!!!). I'm not sure what exactly Ex Machina really brought to the table on top of what the others had already laid out. It's also true that the film is predominantly comprised of two people discussing philosophical concepts – which can be fairly interesting for a single viewing, but isn't exactly the kind of thing you'll feel the need to sit through again. <br/><br/>Anyway, if you liked any of the aforementioned films, I'm fairly sure you'll get a lot out of Ex Machina – but don't expect it to have your world shattered."
"rogerdarlington","Null","3","13","25 January 2015"," An intelligent look at artificial intelligence
","The female robot has a long cinematic history, stretching from ""Metropois"" (1927), through ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975 & 2004) to ""Blade Runner"" (1982). What has changed is the advance of artificial intelligence technology, which has made it harder and harder to distinguish the metallic from the human, and our sense of ethics, which has led us to query how we should treat such increasingly sensitive creations. For some scientists, the vision is what is called the singularity when AI will exceed human intellectual capacity and control.<br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" is a slow, stylish and intelligent sci-fi erotic thriller, both written and directed by the British Alex Garland, that poses some challenging questions about AI including a reference to the singularity. It is so lean in location and characters that it could almost have been a play, except that the robot is represented through some effective special effects.<br/><br/>Virtually all the action takes place in an ultra-modernist home-cum-laboratory built largely underground, while essentially there are only three players in this techno game: Nathan, the owner of the facility, the rich and reclusive owner of the Bluebook search engine and creator of the robot Eva (a clever, passive-aggressive portrayal by Oscar Isaac); Caleb, a staff member of the company apparently chosen to test whether Eva is truly self-aware (a diffident and increasingly credulous Domhnall Glesson), and Eva herself (the Swedish Alicia Vikander in a mesmerising performance which for most of the time sees only her face located in an exo-skeleton). Inevitably there is a twist in the tale which could be seen as a vindication or a warning.<br/><br/>Note: What does the title ""Ex Machina"" mean? It is an abbreviated version of the term 'deus ex machina' which literally means 'a god from a machine' and originated from the conventions of Greek tragedy where a machine is used to bring actors playing gods onto the stage. In the context of this film, you can read it two ways: either Nathan is a god who has created what is essentially just a very clever machine or perhaps the 'machine' is the cruel Nathan who has created the ultimately all-powerful 'god' Eva."
"reidy1997","8","3","14","24 January 2015"," Ex Machina Review
","Full review can be read here: http://glowingscreens.blogspot.co.uk/2015/01/ex-machina-directed-by- alex-garland.html<br/><br/>Sometimes, living in the UK is a blessing. Over in the US they are bombarded with the bottom of the pile in regard to film in January, whereas we get some of the best films out. Both Whiplash (My favourite of 2014) and Ex Machina have joined the club of films that could save January.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is what Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey set out to do many years before. Ex Machina poses challenging philosophical questions amidst an incredibly gripping story due to a gripping general aesthetic, sci-fi themes and engaging soundtrack.<br/><br/>Ex Machina follows the story of Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a talented programmer employed by the worlds largest search engine company, BlueBook. Seemingly by luck, Caleb wins a competition to visit the companies reclusive CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), in his remote retreat in the Alaskan wilderness. But when he gets there, it soon becomes clear that the visit is far more than a social visit. Caleb is recruited by Nathan to perform a pseudo Turing test upon his new creation, Ava (Alicia Vikander) to try and conclude whether her AI is the most advanced the world had ever seen.<br/><br/>To say more would simply spoil the multiple twists and turns the story takes as the Director, Alex Garland, guides us through an increasingly complex story and an ever uneasy atmosphere. What is most interesting about the structure of the film is that once it hits it's swing, the film seamlessly transitions between interview sessions between Caleb and Eva and philosophical conversations between Caleb and Nathan. What could have easily found itself soaked in pretentious dialogue becomes incredibly engaging through the use of expertly written dialogue, making every conversation sound realistic and plausible.<br/><br/>Before I divert any more, I should be 100% clear. Ava is the star of the show. Even though I had seen countless images of her before I saw the film, the first look at her is stunning, as if you are seeing it through Caleb's eyes. She envelops the shadows, slender, with only her blue lights whirring in her mid riff making her visible. This expert use of lighting is used frequently throughout, most commonly with the common (although somewhat forced) power failures the building undergoes every so often, drenching the scenery in a blood red light, making everything seem sinister.<br/><br/>Gleeson and Isaac give remarkable performances, and when they chat in-between interviews with Ava, their opposite personalities, an analytical mind versus a free flowing one, their performances truly shine. However, they pale in comparison to Vikander. Every move she makes is succinctly nuanced in such a way that it is almost human. She stoops to grab. Her movements are just slightly too rigid, permeating the illusion of humanity. Ava as a character is also inherently sexual which the film plays with as it delves into its final act. An audience member at one point remarked, ""She's so cute"". This I believe is the triumph of the performance. We are put under no illusion that she is not human, but it is difficult not to feel emotions towards her. Ava is almost more human than any of the other characters in the film.<br/><br/>As there is very little action within the film, writing is absolutely key. Alex Garland has a hell of a track record, with two of my favourite films, 28 Days Later and Sunshine under his belt, and he doesn't disappoint. Although the film is remarkably intelligent, the use of well researched thought experiments help the audience understand the complex nature of the films themes in the most simple ways. In one particularly memorable scene, the colour palette completely switches and the dialogue is represented via vivid nature shots.<br/><br/>The film has very few flaws, but one of which is the pacing during some scenes. Although the majority are never overly long or unneeded, there are several key scenes throughout the film that seems to drag on just a little too long, losing the audiences attention. <br/><br/>This film deserves to be watched. I know for a fact that it will not be watched enough and simply passed on as another, ""Too deep for it's own good"" kind of film, but do not make this mistake. Despite its few flaws, Ex Machina is a triumph of philosophical pondering in film alongside a gripping, twisting, psychological thriller where everyone is being manipulated and the audience can trust no one."

","This was the directorial debut for established screenplay writer Alex Garland (The Beach, 28 Days Later, Never Let Me Go, Dredd), and hearing about the film and seeing trailers and clips I had idea of the concept for this film, so I was looking forward to seeing it. Basically young computer coder Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson, Brendan's son) wins a competition to spend a week at the secluded woodland house of Nathan (Inside Llewyn Davis's Oscar Isaac), search engine creator and the CEO of the company he works for, the house is made up of many automated and computer controlled systems, Caleb is given a key card that will open most doors, and before doing anything he must sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement). Nathan wants Caleb to treat him like he was a friend, but their relationship is awkward and tense, during the week Nathan wants him to carry out an experiment, his own version of the 'Turing Test', a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human, and the subject is his humanoid artificial intelligence robotic creation called 'Ava' (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Alicia Vikander). Ava is a face, hands and feet of flesh, but the rest of her body is clearly that of a cyborg/robot/android, the test is to see, while being filmed on CCTV, how realistic the human interaction between Ava and Caleb, whether she can express true feelings and emotions though being a machine. At some points there are blackouts, where the power goes down, as does the CCTV filming, it is then that Ava tells Caleb that he should not trust Nathan, while drunk as he often is Nathan tells that these blackouts happen regularly and he is looking into it, it is later revealed during a blackout that it is Ava causing them to happen, to allow private conversation and off the record interaction. Over the sessions they have together Caleb and Ava bond, she wants to appear more human and dresses in clothing, despite possibly developing feelings for her Caleb believes he is being tricked, he think Ava has been programmed to flirt with him, Nathan proves that she is controlled by her own impulses with a self- evolving brain. One day while helping Nathan in his drunken state Caleb stumbles CCTV footage of him with Ava, he appears being abusive towards her, Caleb asks him what he will to do with Ava if the test fails, Nathan says he will ""update"" her, the result being her memory will be wiped, Caleb is upset. With Nathan drunk and passed out again he uses his key card to access his laboratory, he is shocked to find evidence of other female AI creations, both deactivated and destroyed, he realises non-English speaking Japanese assistant Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno) is a robot as well. In their final meeting together Caleb asks Ava to create a power cut, during this he tells her he plans for them to escape together, the next day Nathan confirms the week is ending the following day and he will be picked up by helicopter, Caleb wants to get Nathan drunk, but he refuses a drink, and worse he reveals that he placed a hidden battery operated camera in Ava's room, he knows about the escape plan, Nathan also admits Ava was programmed based on Caleb's internet search history, he also says that she is not truly in love with him and is using him to get out, he deems the test is a success. Caleb says that he planned for the eventuality of Nathan realising the escape plan and had a blackout timed and the systems fixed to have all doors opened, but Nathan knocks him out and goes to kill Ava, she is already out, but he takes off her hand, Nathan drags her back to her room, but Kyoko stabs him with a knife, he breaks her face and is stabbed again by Ava, he collapses and dies. Caleb appears and is walked into his room by Ava, then she locks him inside, and proceeds to open the cupboards containing old AIs, she takes the skin and clothes to establish herself a human form, Ava leaves the facility and Caleb locked inside, she is picked up by the helicopter, and the film closes at the point where she has entered a city and the human society she always desired to see. It is funny that Gleeson was in the television series Black Mirror in the episode Be Right Back playing an AI, he is good at playing the vulnerable young man who is essentially a guinea pig in a very unusual experiment, Vikander gives a sensitive performance as the humanistic machine who has a questionable ""mind"", and Isaac is fantastic as the inventor who you cannot determine is to be trusted or not, being like a mentor, malevolent and chillingly misogynistic. The film is clever being set in mainly one location only, an ultra-modern and highly secure house and grounds, this also adds to the feeling of claustrophobia, the film is really well written as you question the logic of the three key characters, the question of human relating to and interacting with a machine is thought-provoking, it definitely feels strange all the way, but the special effects are great and it is philosophical, seductive and compelling to watch, a fantastic science-fiction thriller. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Original Screenplay for Alex Garland, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Original Screenplay, Best Special Visual Effects and Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Director or Producer. Very good!"

I tried to like this movie but there was just nothing to like about it."

","8.5 of 10. Whereas it's AI sci-fi competitor Chappie (2015) is designed more for action/Robocop/Blade Runner fans, this is for hard science fiction fans along with those that enjoy a more intellectual drama/thriller. It's the first film I remember mentioning wetware (although, technically, it seemed to achieve the wetware results minus any actual wetware).<br/><br/>It still addresses the whether robots are dreaming of electric sheep, but also far more and returning to the sexy and empathetic human aspect of it that Blade Runner did so well.<br/><br/>Contrary to most of the past and present cyberpunk out there, this isn't a dystopian future world. This is the near future, maybe even this very moment with the joys of wealth and the relaxation of only private concerns with a still functional planet. And rather than some power hungry old men behind the scenes, we have a young tech billionaire up front and eager to engage and adding an element to the story that explores the non-nerd weirdness of the AI creators.<br/><br/>The last burst of high quality robot/AI sci-fi we had was 2008-2009. We should consider this a wonderful, probably temporary, period of cyberpunk film that will be looked upon and treasured. Other recent films with a similar story theme: Automata (2014), Robocop (2014), Machine (2014), Robot and Frank (2012), and Transcendence (2014)."
"lasttimeisaw","8","2","8","17 May 2015"," Stunning debut from novelist-screenwriter Alex Garland
","EX MACHINA auspiciously marks the directorial debut from British screenwriter Alex Garland, who is also a novelist, he is the author of THE BEACH, later would become a misfire for Danny Boyle and its star Leonardo DiCaprio in 2000, and after having soaked himself as a screenwriter in Sci-Fi genre pieces like Boyle's SUNSHINE (2007) and Mark Romanek's NEVER LET ME GO (2010), his latest offering is a tantalising cautionary tale about artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>Compacting the kernel among three main characters, Nathan (Isaac) is the CEO of world's largest search engine company Bluebook, he invents a humanoid robot named Ava (Vikander), and Caleb (Gleeson) is one of his lucky code programmer, who has been chosen to be give Ava the classic Turing test, to determine whether or not she has ""intelligence"". There are seven sessions altogether carried out in Nathan's reclusive scientific research centre they are accompanied only by Nathan's Japanese assistant Kyoto (Mizuno), who apparently cannot understand and speak any English.<br/><br/>Caleb is an ordinary young man with a tragic back-story, wide-eyed and thrilled to be involved in this evolutionary achievement of humankind, as he tells Nathan, it is not just a change of the human history, but in fact if Ava passes the test, it will change the history of Gods, because only God can create intelligence! As the centre encounters constant unknown power-cuts, during which Caleb and Ava are sequestered from being monitored by Nathan, Ava warns Caleb that Nathan is not what he seems to be, and they gradually share a mutual affection to each other. Swayed by Ava's warning, Caleb begins to secretively dig into Nathan's works, and a discovery drives him to become paranoid to an extreme extent that he even questions his own identity, is himself a robot too?<br/><br/>Under the influence of Ava's commitment, a gullible Caleb schemes an audacious plan to elope with her, in the other hand, Nathan is the opposite of gullibility, who is friend and who is foe, Caleb will have to learn the lesson in the hardest way he can ever imagine. <br/><br/>A great viewing experience with suspense and concentration can be crystallised through the film's integral accomplishments of the central trio's dynamic acting, awesome shots of nature's luxuriant palette to expel the default claustrophobic atmosphere, a thoroughly engaging and sometimes eerie soundtrack adheres flawlessly to the structure of the narrative, all is done with the sleek competence which indicates Mr. Garland is going to have a bright future in the director's chair. Maybe one can say the A.I. created in the film is really ahead of our time, but one relevant thing concerns everyone is his sharp perception of mobile phone companies' tacit permission of amassing private data from billions of their users, this is an alarm bell to urge our society and government to investigate the current situation and prevent such privacy-violation with uncompromising legal means. <br/><br/>Performances are top-form, Domhnall Gleeson is profoundly utilised to elicit compassion and support as audience's surrogate to adventure in a tempting chess game, and his ANNA KARENINA (2012) co-star Vikander is stunning in passing off as an android with inscrutable depth of wisdom can outsmart most human beings, blur the definitive line between man and machine and potentially supplant them, this is man's deepest fear in the booming genre concerning A.I. technology, plus a precisely rendered CGI does help tremendously for the film's surreal tonality. Oscar Isaac, is charismatic and enigmatic simultaneously, as the most unstable variant of the trio, the key driving force with an ulterior motivation, his can alternate from chummy geniality to threatening menace in one second, moreover, a surprising vignette of his dance routine with Kyoto is plain stroke of genius under its context. To say the very least EX-MACHINA is an earnest and compelling piece of hard Sci- Fi thriller who challenges to tackle the subject matter into a more pertinent situation and establishes itself as a sounding warning against the possible negative reverberations of today's fairly impressive progress in the cutting-edge field."

For the majority of the general audience they will be bored to death; for the audience that is willing to sit back, watch, and think this would be hard pressed to be better (and I' d be very happy to have a bevy of film makers try!).<br/><br/>THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE ORIGIN AND CORE OF SCIENCE FICTION, which most have forgotten as they drown in shoot-em-up, amp-d up action scenes.<br/><br/>Well Done!"

The film has excellent pacing, with Garland allowing you time to breathe in all the right places (and of course, that fantastic disco sequence)<br/><br/>The intriguing storyline asks all the right questions about what it means to be a human, whether that be consciousness, interaction, or sexuality amongst other things, with you never quite sure who is human and who isn't.

","I don't know how you could leave the theater without being impressed by Ex Machina. It's not quite ""elite,"" but certainly is well constructed, acted, and has fantastic CGI effects.<br/><br/>The movie follows a coder (Domhnall Gleeson) at what would best be described as search-engine-marketing giant Google, if business names could be freely used in movies.<br/><br/>At the outset Gleeson's character wins a coding contest and gets to spend a week with the company's reclusive CEO (Oscar Isaac) in his research compound.<br/><br/>He agrees to participate in a Turing Test, an experiment to test how realistic an artificial-intelligence (AI) being interacts with him.<br/><br/>Gleeson's meetings with the beautiful, alluring AI being (Alicia Vikander) are the core of the movie. Much like the compound, these numbered events lead the audience through doorways into rooms that are always thought-provoking and grow more and more uncomfortable each time they meet in videoed-isolation.<br/><br/>You won't find a bad performance among the actors, in fact it's the best performance to date for every one of the lead & supporting roles. Most people will talk about Vikander's ability to seem ""human-ly robotic,"" but Gleeson, Isaac & even a Sonoyo Mizuno role with no spoken lines, are just as strong. <br/><br/>Ex Machina is one of the most technically impressive movies (acting, sound, f/x, cinematography, even set details) - especially when you consider it's Garland's directorial debut. If Garland didn't communicate with Kubrick's spirit before this movie, Stanley will be reaching out soon to congratulate the director.<br/><br/>If you're trying to relate this movie to something more recent, Ex Machina has the ""weirdness"" of 2013's Under the Skin with a very different plot line and characters.<br/><br/>Reflective movie people will love it; if this isn't you, find your movie-geek friend, go see it together & plan for coffee after."
"CleveMan66","7","2","8","25 April 2015"," The pronunciation of ""Ex Machina"" may not be obvious, but not much about this movie is.
","Let me help you out, so you don't make the same mistake I did. If you go to the theater to see ""Ex Machina"" (R, 1:48), make sure you know how to pronounce the title correctly (if you don't already know), so you don't have to suffer the indignity of the guy in the box office correcting you as he prints out your ticket. It's especially embarrassing if you're going to see the film not just as a movie fan, but as a reviewer. It's enough to make you thankful that you're writing your reviews incognito. And speaking of words with Latin origins, this movie's title comes from the Latin phrase ""deus ex machina"". The last word of that phrase, and of this movie's title, is pronounced ""MAHK-ee-nah"". (Apparently, ""mah-SHEE-nah"" is incorrect.) ""Deus ex machina"", by the way, means ""god from the machine"". No matter how you say it, that makes ""Ex Machina"" a good title for this movie. But is this a good movie? In ""Ex Machina"", Oscar Isaac is playing the role of God. Well, not literally, but he might as well be. As Nathan Bateman, the fictional ""Bluebook"" internet search engine CEO, he's rich, reclusive and brilliant. But those are all understatements. That's like saying Bill Gates is ""well off"", the Unabomber ""enjoyed his own company"" and Albert Einstein had ""some pretty good ideas"". Not only did Nathan develop the algorithm for what became the world's foremost search engine at 13 years old, build an extremely isolated and high-tech home – slash – research facility where he lives and works alone, but he has also developed the world's first true artificial intelligence, or so he hopes. He has brought Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), one of his company's most talented coders and most intelligent employees, to his live-in lab for a week to test ""Ava"" (Alicia Vikander), the robot who can supposedly think - and feel. After making Caleb sign an all-encompassing non-disclosure agreement, Nathan says that Caleb is about to witness the most important scientific achievement in the history of mankind. Mankind? Caleb counters that true A.I. is more in the realm of gods. Nathan likes and enthusiastically embraces the comparison.<br/><br/>Nathan's ""tests"" involve daily conversations between Caleb and Ava... for starters. Ava does look very human in part(s). She has a realistic-looking face, hands and feet. The rest of her is stylized robotics, but pretty voluptuous robotics at that. (After all, they do say that REAL women robots have curves, and we do see a fair amount of female robot curves – and skin.) In their first meeting, Caleb is shocked to discover that Ava's conversational skills are even more realistic than her very expressive face. Their daily meetings alternate with debriefings between Caleb and Nathan about how the tests are going, along with discussions of the implications of Ava's existence. Caleb and Ava's talks go well beyond simple Q&As and intellectual probing. During their increasingly personal conversations, it also seems that Ava is flirting – and Caleb is responding. And during Caleb and Nathan's alcohol-fueled discussions, Caleb increasingly wonders about Nathan's true motivations for these tests and his plans for the future. Nathan is looking more and more like a master manipulator and one with more than a few secrets.<br/><br/>More than just the latest in a long line of films about artificial intelligence, ""Ex Machina"" is fresh and exciting. The action, with only three main characters seemingly embarking on a strange new world, does give a sense of the beginning of something monumentally important and may remind audience members of the biblical account of creation, or the creation of Frankenstein's monster, or any of a number of similar stories. The staging evokes a certain moodiness and the dialog is ominous, deep and even profound. This film doesn't have the action of the similarly-themed ""Terminator"" movies, but its focus on the subtle, but meaningful, makes it well worth your time. The cast really sells the story, with another great and unsettling performance from the increasingly impressive Oscar Isaac, a wide-ranging, but measured performance from Domhnall Gleeson (who also does a great job of shedding his British accent), not to mention a very effective Alicia Vikander. This is the first film by British novelist – turned screenwriter – turned director Alex Garland, but let's hope it's not his last. This film does suffer from a few noticeable plot holes and a couple instances of predictability, but it's still a stylistically provocative and intellectually interesting tale – with a heck of an ending. ""B+"""
"Leofwine_draca","4","3","15","6 December 2017"," Wearying
","EX MACHINA is one of those wearing philosophical science fiction movies all about concept and with barely any plot to bolster that concept. I prefer films the other way around, where interesting issues are explored via a good story. Here, we get two guys and a robot in a house, where the scriptwriter takes plenty of time to explore the subject of artificial intelligence. For any sci-fi fan watching, there are zero surprises here; everything plays out exactly as you'd expect, and it takes ages to get to that point. Oscar Isaac gives a reliable performance but the one-dimensional Domhnall Gleeson is miscast and Alicia Vikander unconvincing. Some decent CGI effects are the only thing this long-winded and slightly pretentious tale has going for it."

","I went into Ex Machina not knowing a lot about it, because I don't want to ruin the same experience I had for anyone else I wont delve too much into spoiler territory.<br/><br/>The cast for this movie is small, and this gives each actor and actress to perform to the best of their ability. Domhnall Gleeson plays your average geeky guy and kills it in this role. His character is awkward and it really shows in the movie, you can clearly see how uncomfortable he gets as the movie progresses. Overall Gleeson is great at playing what I would call a very difficult role. His character (as seen by the trailers) has to interact with the machine to see if its an A:I. As a audience member Gleeson makes you believe in the machine and his character amazement at seeing this machine. This is hands down a phenomenal performance by Gleeson and I look forward to seeing more of his work Next Oscar Isaac and man oh man is this guy good. His character is genuinely despicable and terrifying to watch on screen. One of the best villains of 2015 Isaac's Nathan is a monster. I wish I could talk more about his character but I am trying to keep this review spoiler free.<br/><br/>This is the section that I would discuss Alecia Vikanders performance in the film, but her character is shrouded in too much spoilerness that I am not going to talk too much about her. All you need to know is that you will be left thinking what the hell, she makes you believe in A:I's Overall you need to see this movie I think its incredible and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. I would have given it a higher rating but there are some issues such as pace and the ending (although I enjoyed it) maybe considered by some to be disappointing or unexpected, also its not a movie you would watch with your parents. Either way you should go watch Ex Machina its a great movie and one of the best I have seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Cheers"
"JoshuaHarryMurphy","8","3","15","5 February 2015"," A Sci-Fi Cult Classic in the Making
","In 'Ex Machina' ('ex-mach-in-na') Domhnall Gleeson plays Caleb, a computer coder who wins an excursion to his employer's lavish yet exceptionally isolated home accessible only by arranged helicopter. Evidently cautious, Caleb introduces himself to his host Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Immediately the two personalities clash – Caleb is an orphaned, single and reserved computer coder whilst Nathan is confident and assertive. Despite the evident clash, the noticeable uncomfortableness is shelved as Nathan begins to unravel his plans to Caleb, a plan that sees Caleb play a part in 'the Turing experiment' to determine whether Nathan's A.I Ava has a consciousness. <br/><br/>The film's narrative is hereby structured into 7 sections, each entitled after Caleb's daily encounter with Ava – 'Ava Session 1' – and so forth. As the days pass, Caleb and Nathan's relationship begins to collapse. Whilst Nathan openly participates in voyeurism and observes Ava and Caleb through strategically placed cameras in every room, a serious of chilling power-cut sequences is all that stops Nathan's omniscient eyes. The commanding red light which commands these sequences not only continues in establishing an exceedingly disconcerting tone, but these sequences also sanction Caleb and Ava's relationship to evolve unobserved. <br/><br/>In spite of the nature of the narrative structure accentuating a build up towards the conclusion of Caleb's trip, the film's pace never drags, partially down to the films outstanding visual style and cinematography from Rob Hardy. As Caleb progressively becomes more and more trapped, both physically and mentally, inside Nathan's research facility, we share in his panicked, claustrophobic psyche, all of which is held together by a fantastic performance from Domhnall Gleeson. This is made all the more imperative given Gleeson is performing opposite Isaac, who is fabulously creepy throughout, blending physical supremacy, a crude sense of humour and a taste for vodka into a staggeringly unnerving and unpredictable character. Noteworthy also is the performance of Alicia Vikander as Ava, whose performance would either make or break the film, given the pieces thematic explorations. Luckily for Garland, and the audience, her performance is marvellous - capable of creating empathy and an intimate relationship with the protagonist and the audience, not vastly dissimilar from Scarlett Johansson in Spike Jonze's 'Her'. <br/><br/>Alex Garland's debut directorial feature 'Ex Machina' is a genuine sci-fi cult classic in the making. Through maintaining a colossal sense of unease throughout, Garland manages to explore typical sci- fi themes (A.I, threat of new technology) in a manner which doesn't feel overbearing or predictable. Notably, both Gleeson and Isaac star in another little-known sci-fi film towards the end of the year. It'll be hard-pressed to outclass 'Ex Machina'."

I originally saw the trailers for this film and said to myself ""Wowthat looks stupid."" And made no plans to see it. However, after almost making the decision to see ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2,"" I said to myself, let me look at what else is planning. I peeked in at the review count for ""Ex Machina"" and noticed how highly approved this movie was. And so I saidwell why not?<br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" is not a movie. It's a story. It is the story of Boy Meets Android. It is the story of how truly insignificant humanity is. This movie didn't focus on what we think of, or even why we think of things. It focused on how. How do we, as humans, think of our own humanity? How do we function? Instinct, emotion, values, perfectionism, this movie makes the biggest attempt to not really give a certain sensation. It more tests the viewer. It presents you with this certain situation and sees how you interpret it without ever taking notes, acknowledging your feelings, without doing anything. It was phenomenal. The exact tone of the movie turns into the mood of the viewer. It's phenomenal. It felt like a really good college lecture. One that makes you learn without you even knowing.<br/><br/>As amazing as this movie was, it has one singular flaw. It was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO SLOW. Now, in some situations, it worked exceptionally well. It helped set the tone in some situations, helped make the tense moments juicier. But in other situations, it was unnecessary. It created holes in conversations and filled them with awkward pauses, which hurt some of the effects of the dialogue.<br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" was a film meant to mess with your perceptions. It constantly addresses the battle between what is right and what is wrong. The battle between logic and emotion. The battle between interpretation and misdirection. The battle between humanity and technology. And the relationships between all of these. Its purpose is the cream in the éclair. Watching the struggle of an AI become one with its own humanity. This is the movie that ""Chappie"" wanted to be. The emotional, logical, AND psychological dramatics truly left me astonished. You follow the story to its very core and are left stunned by the simply jaw dropping twist at the last few minutes of the movie. This is definitely a movie worth spending your time on to kick off your summer. Final Score: 9/10"

","Ex Machina- R, 2015 ➡️ Never have I been so thoroughly entertained and intellectually stimulated at the precise same time while watching a film as I was with Alex Garland's (28 days later) directorial debut, Ex Machina! Here, we are introduced to Caleb Smith (Domnhall Gleeson) who has just won a contest that will allow him to take an enigmatic retreat to the secluded home of a billionaire tech genius named Nathan (Oscar Isaac) . He is the equivalent to the creators of Google or Apple in our world and plans to have Caleb take part in a Turing test to discern if he has in fact created an artificially intelligent being. From here, Garland's excellent writing took me on a mind-trip that I found myself profoundly wanting more of after the film's curtain call. I never once lost interest in the film because all the elements of Ex Machina add to an incredibly taut and engaging film. The score creates a mood that heightens the terrible actions done by a character in the film while also executing a sense of delicacy when the film needed it. The acting is spectacular with Oscar Isaac coming off as a hulking, but lovable, oaf (even though he's a genius) who convinces us to like him even when his actions are despicable. Domnhall Gleeson is the emotionally layered lens through which the audience views the A.I., Ava, played brilliantly by Alicia Vikander (She's a star). This is very much a small Sci-Fi film that has little-to-no special effects. It takes jabs at big ideas and questions which, through excellent writing, can have the audience asking themselves what it means to be a human and how we know if something is conscious or not. It wrestled with the question of if we are born with specific tastes and beliefs or if our environment has unknowingly influenced us. The audience is left to choose whether or not artificial intelligence has been achieved at the end of the film with an ending that will leave any casual film fan breathless. Ex Machina is a gorgeously arresting and thought-provoking film that will stay on your mind long after you leave the theater! It gets a #9/10 #ExMachina"

","Ex Machina is a science fiction film that continues the conversation about the consciousness of Machines. The film offers an obscure answer to the question, while also presenting a dialogue that many are not privy to. With humanity's present reliance on technology, this film showcases the dangers and luxuries that are married to technology.<br/><br/>Ex Machina stars Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, Alicia Vikander, and Sonoya Mizuno. Gleeson plays Caleb, and incredibly gullible coder for Blue Book (a tech based company that mirrors Google). Isaac portrays Nathan, the CEO of Blue Book. Alicia Vikander portrays AVA, the A.I within the film. In Ex Machina, Nathan invites Caleb to test the consciousness of AVA. As the film progresses, Caleb and AVA become close at the discretion of Nathan. Gleeson is the film's low point. His portrayal of Caleb has nothing going for it. The character is inherently generic, and he doubles down on this by having a generic portrayal. Vikander's portrayal of AVA is unnatural in a natural sense. She captures the consciousness of an A.I and a human, in a way that feels like a successful hybrid of the two. Isaac's portrayal of Nathan is great. The character's stone cold intellect is a saving grace of this film. He plays God, while having the flaws of a human. Caleb and AVA serve as Adam and Eve in this technological revamped telling of the Garden of Eden.<br/><br/>The story is intricate and well told. Every detail is explained within the film. Ex Machina leaves large room for interpretation on even the slightest details. Visually, the movie is stunning. The technology within the film looks incredibly real. The setting is believable as well. In having a small budget Ex Machina outmatches the Blockbusters of its time. Ex Machina feels authentic from start to finish.<br/><br/>Overall, Ex Machina is an intricate film that adds a lot of depth to philosophical conversations, as well as the Science Fiction genre.

It is plain and simple an interesting story, well told from beginning to end.<br/><br/>If nudity bothers you, you best avoid this flick, as there are many scenes of female full-frontal nudity, and although these females are robots, the women are real actresses.<br/><br/>Bottom line, just sit back and enjoy the tale!"

","I love the goals Ex Machina has as a specifically focused AI movie that delves deeply into the 3/4 characters involved, and also love the execution. The peripherals were excellent - particularly, the effects and cinematography were gorgeous, and the actual science behind the AI was completely realistic and carefully discussed. The acting was great, and the script was phenomenal. Like most great movies, Ex Machina is effective in demonstrating a holistic view of the characters and considering various aspects of life while honing in on a couple key themes (manipulation and freedom) to great effect. I thought the climax was a bit traditional and unrealistic in Isaac's character being extremely intelligent but not checking or having checked and solved Gleeson's stated plan, and then was clearly a bad idea to go to Ava and assume she'd follow his direction. The ending in demonstrating that Ava was using Caleb purely as a means to an end. Caleb's character was extremely well developed in showing his view of himself as a good, caring person who is better than Isaac but who realistically was rather self-serving and ambiguous. Overall, it raises fascinating questions of the significance of AI and their rights and interaction with humans, and uses the well-developed characters to further many themes."

The good parts of the film are:<br/><br/>* Oscar's performance as the recluse billionaire tech-savant was spot on. His character was truly fully formed and developed, to the point where, by the end of the film, you could predict his behaviors. That's good acting. The funny thing is, I didn't even recognize him for the first half of the film. I kept thinking to myself, ""I know that voice, but I don't recognize the face.""<br/><br/>* This movie hits the horror and drama points pretty well, and as someone who has read both ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dr. Jekyll"", this movie could be considered to be a great-grandchild of those two pieces of fiction."

"jrarichards","10","1","3","25 October 2017"," Thought-provoking (at times mind-blowing) look at upcoming AI from the perspective of an erotic Turing Test
","British Director Alex Garland's splendid, compelling, well-acted, well-put-together, cerebral and erotically-charged film sees a somewhat-geeky Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) travel to a remote stronghold where the ultimate boss of the online-search company he works for, the enigmatic Nathan (Oscar Isaac), has been developing artificial intelligence to the point where he believes he can be victorious when exposing his guest to the Turing Test.<br/><br/>That is to say that Nathan believes Caleb's interaction with the peak-achievement (so far) robot Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) will prove so convincing that he will no longer feel he is interacting with a machine. Hence the title, and a number of philosophical discussions about artificial intelligence which all seem timely enough.<br/><br/>Wonderfully, all of this ""artificial"" stuff takes place in sterile-ish built surroundings set in the midst of immaculate natural beauty (the bits that aren't filmed at Pinewood near London are done in Norway). Nathan takes Caleb out to see meltwater running spectacularly down forested slopes from blue-ice glaciers, and the views are at moments divine. Perhaps we are meant to be tempted back to the wonderful nature that surrounds us and where we belong, along with cousin bird and cousin tree and cousin moss? Surely these are places where DNA-free AI constructs may not feel at home and do not belong? <br/><br/>Yet soon enough we are back in the well-protected high-tech confines of Nathan's spectacular home-cum-lab, with nobody for company expect Ava, and of course the gorgeous Japanese serving girl Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), who does not even speak...<br/><br/>I watch the film (for the second time, though the first time at home) at a time when news items about sex robots (and indeed about human beings' willingness to interact with them) are all the rage, and indeed there is that strong erotic side to Caleb's repeat encounters with Ava. To add to the challenge, Nathan has ensured that Ava is visibly still a robot, given that numerous parts of her are see-through, with flashing lights and very visibly machine parts, even if ones on a super-high technological level. In the midst of all of this artificiality, Nathan carefully informs Caleb that ""key parts"" of Ava do actually work! <br/><br/>But Ava's robotly wiles are far from crudely sexual, and it rather rapidly becomes apparent to the viewer (and certainly to any viewer capable of fancying women) that Caleb is not the only one taking the Turing Test!!! <br/><br/>When Caleb meets her, the seductively-voiced Ada (shades of Scarlett Johansson in ""Her"", by the way) is a mind-blowing mix of innocent and sophisticated, open and conspiratorial. She throws back questions at her questioner, is coquettish, but is also devoted, exclusive, interested and interesting-cum-intriguing-cum-fascinating.<br/><br/>Pretty soon Caleb cannot stop thinking about her, and many of us out here in audience-land are not far behind him! It's weird how it happens, but it happens...<br/><br/>There's a key point in the film where Nathan reveals that he has actually designed Ava having first taken a look at Caleb's online history of watching porn, so he has a head start (if you'll pardon the expression) in knowing what's going to be attractive to his visitor.<br/><br/>But that of course brings us to an ""electrically"" fascinating juxtaposition of circumstances. Something of a loner (indeed inevitably so given his lack of family), Caleb is more than ready to ""interact"" (shall we say) with real women portrayed on what is actually a 2D screen. Now he's got a real-life interaction, not with a real woman, admittedly, but with somebody who nevertheless has plenty of time for him, takes an interest, is flirty but also (apparently) sincere, needy, keen to please him even by coming up with a high-class drawing of his face...<br/><br/>Given that kind of choice, it's really no contest, is it? <br/><br/>Needless to say, Ava is a tricky customer indeed, far more subtle and devious than we may imagine, but - to the shame of this watcher at least - she remains an alluring figure even when her desire for self-preservation brings her to the point of violent attacks committed pseudo-innocently, and certainly entirely without emotion.<br/><br/>A scary prospect indeed, hence the film's regular references to Oppenheimer's feelings about his bomb as a new kind of weapon that changes everything, and indeed the musical reference to OMD's hit ""Enola Gay"" (this being the name of the USAF bomber that dropped the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima).<br/><br/>Doubtless, we guilty filmgoers who fancy Ava something rotten are going to excuse ourselves by saying that we all the time know in our heart of hearts that it's actually Alicia Vikander, a flesh-and-blood actress and an extremely good-looking one at that.<br/><br/>Yeah, right!"
"DrChristers","7","1","3","18 October 2017"," Tense little thriller, well chosen cast.
","When Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) and Nathan (Oscar Isaac) meet each other for the first time the atmosphere is uncomfortable at best and disturbing at worst. The actors and script manage to keep this going throughout the film, making for a tense and awkward feeling throughout.<br/><br/>I haven't seen any of the actors in any other films so I was impressed by them all. Oscar Isaac flips from friendly, to cruel, to intimidating, to downright scary, to manic very easily. Domhnall Gleeson has obviously picked up his father's flair for acting. His Caleb is scared, nervous and excited all at the same time and his ultimate innocence, misinterpretation and betrayal is sad to watch.<br/><br/>Ava (Alicia Vikander) moves beautifully as the android, almost like a ballet dancer. Her childlike innocence is endearing but still surprisingly spooky and disturbing. Also, the special effects are exquisite: from top to bottom she looks every bit the android.<br/><br/>The script is well written but the parts about A.I. mainly repeat the old and often used clichés, which is disappointing. I recently saw Blade Runner 2049 where they chose not to go through lengthy monologues on A.I. and I thought this was a good decision. <br/><br/>The scene where she asks him ""how do I look?"" (when she is wearing the dress and then he watches her take it off) reminded me much of The Graduate and I was almost disappointed when he didn't reply ""very good"".<br/><br/>The soundtrack is really interesting. It is often not present at all, which is a great choice and adds to the film's eerie suspense. When it does play it is well used.<br/><br/>About two thirds of the way through I started to get disappointed as I had guessed all the small twists and turns from really early on. However, I didn't see the multi-twist at the end coming. Nathan is wrong when he says that the main aim in life is to reproduce, the main aim in life here is to survive."

","Ex Machina is the best movie about robot I've seen so far. There are so many great things about it, and the one false note I find is in the first act. Many dialogue can be done much better, and ""history of God"" scene does not work. However, as the movie goes on, the script becomes better and dialogue feels much more genuine. Almost all sci-fi films have a problem with exposition: since the story happens in the future, the audience would not know about it. Ex Machina handles the exposition very well. In the helicopter scene at the beginning, we did not know the boss is rich because someone tells us so, but because the helicopter has been flying on its territory for years. This is a very nice approach to tell the audience an important information. But the greatest thing about the film is its theme. Never have I ever seen a movie so thoroughly and beautifully explored the identity of an A.I.. Ava has been perfectly portrayed as an attractive, creepy, also terrifying character. Overall, the movie is really really good. The music is also suitable for the sci-fi filmmakers out there. A lot of the theories and Ava's characters in the film are worth learning about. If the script for the first act can be done just a little bit better, I would just have no problem with it."

","Walking into this movie, I had heard a lot of positive things about it. I even heard some people call the director ""The next Kubrick"". So I was excited to see what all the fuzz was about.<br/><br/>This movie deals mainly with the idea of Artificial Intelligence. the whole movie takes place in a facility where our main character is trying to find out if this machine can pass as AI or not.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie. I thought that the ideas it presented were very interesting and I loved the conversations between Ava (AI) & our main character. This movie presents you with some very interesting questions you should ask yourself about synthetic intelligence and its benefits.<br/><br/>Production wise, this movie is very good. I loved the colour-grading and the contrast between the outside world and the facility. Actually I loved the facility in which they are in. I loved the way that machine and human is divided by glass.<br/><br/>And the atmosphere is great. Since the character walks into this facility, you know that something odd is happening, and you don't know what. Also, the CGI is impressive and looks really realistic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed all of the performances. Oscar Isaac gives the best performance from all of them. His character has very interesting layers and I don't think we see a scientist portrayed like that very often. Domhnall Gleeson makes a good performance as the main character, although I believed that the main character was not as good, but that is not the actor's fault. Alicia did an incredible job at being Ava. Her performance was really great.<br/><br/>The movie had me interested from beginning to end, and by the way... I really loved the ending.<br/><br/>One thing that I believe the movie is not getting enough praise for is the score. I loved the electro-beat of the score and it really submerged you into this universe.<br/><br/>The movie does have some minor plot holes, mainly in the ending. Also, the movie does require a lot of exposition. And sometimes, there are some subtle scenes that don't need explaining and they still explain them.<br/><br/>As I stated earlier, this does feel like a Black Mirror episode (it even stars a Black Mirror actor). So if you like Black Mirror, you will probably enjoy this film.<br/><br/>It is a pretty solid directorial debut and they made the most out of their budget."
"zhongzl-kelley2014","6","1","3","19 May 2017"," Thought provoking but too evasive
","The writing started out good. The atmosphere of morbidity and surrealism was pretty well conveyed. The 'ominous ambiance', as it keeps appearing in the subtitle column, played a major role in establishing this undertone. The setting was pretty classic sci-fi. A 'Mozart' level brilliant CEO, who lived in a secluded deep mountain in a luxurious mansion like Falling Water by Frank Lloyd Wright, with a spark of a whim invited a mediocre programmer to witness his revolutionary AI experiment. It should have been dreamy, exciting and adventurous at the beginning, then taking a steep turn to be shocking and pathological when the dark secrets of the scenic set-up was unveiled. But it didn't quite get there before the film quit this story scheme and irritatingly settle on the morbid atmosphere that too impatiently burst out. Domhnall Gleeson could't curb his realization that the film was going to slide towards the horror genre, therefore we as audience are painfully aware that he didn't make an effort to try to appear human at all. He was reticent and hesitant way beyond necessary, his untimely suspenses was not a symptom of social awkwardness, but a sign of laziness in the actor's part, trying to shift the burden of major emotional breakthroughs onto Nathan's shoulder. I kept observing him closely, trying to make out his personalities from his pitifully scarce actions and speeches, but couldn't really. His unsuccessful attempt to be transparent made him even more obtrusive in the story plot. I wonder why his sporadic silence was not edited out.<br/><br/>Alicia Vikander was the reason I attempted to try the film, and she didn't flunk my expectation. Her acting was very natural and fluent. Ava's girlish expression in her floral dress was absolutely adorable. When she ascended the stairs in Nathan's mansion to 'the free world', her smile was the purest child-like pleasure of exploring the world. Ava's vindictive condescension after the knife was immersed in Nathan's belly was also very satisfying to watch. But of course she wasn't the perfect Hepburn-ish heroine, since she manipulated Caleb's affection, Kyoto's trust, and used them to murder her creator. Her sociopathy steered the story away from the moral advantages or disadvantages of AI. She was the character holding the helm and made sure this outlandish story didn't turn out to be another moral lesson about an invention we hadn't made yet. <br/><br/>And of course I have to comment on the Asian factors that were there just to be exotic and exciting. The salmon, the sex toy Asian girl Kyoko, Jade in the closet whose skin Ava was wearing, provided a seamlessly perfect ethnic backdrop for the white characters' story. Kyoko wasn't given a single line, and Jade, who banged against the wall until she fell apart, just proved another horrendous crisis for the white cast to face. The Japanese factors were exploited and pickled in their own miserable silences, much resembling a cinematic colony. This accusation could have been shunned if Ava was played by an Asian actress, but I guess an Asian protagonist is still too progressive an idea in the filmmaking world. It would have stung less if not for the abnormally small cast and very isolated stage, which categorized the film vaguely as an art film, and lifted our standards for sophistication of ideas encompassed.<br/><br/>The writing was comparatively good for a sci-fi film like this. Acting possessed more sensibility and thoughtfulness than an average commercial film. But I think we can unanimously decide that this isn't a classic."
"zkonedog","10","1","3","28 February 2017"," A ""Thinking Movie"" That Will Also Still Excite
","In the history of the science fiction genre, the concept of artificial intelligence is not a new one. Perhaps popularized (though I'm sure not invented) by Isaac Asimov's works, we have always been fascinated by the idea of our created intelligences turning against us. In many film adaptations of these concepts, however, one or two problems are often in play. Either 1. The movie focuses too much on action instead of concepts (e.g. ""I, Robot""), or 2. There is just too much techno-babble to allow a create story to proceed. Fortunately, director/writer Alex Garland knows exactly what he wants in ""Ex Machina"" and is able to create a wonderful story that is one of the best I've seen in quite some time at the cinema.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Ex Machina"" sees young technology whiz Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) win a promotion where he gets to spend a week-long retreat at the glacial home of company owner Nathan (Oscar Isaac). When Caleb arrives, he finds that he has really been selected to participate in an experiment (called a Turing Test) in which he must determine the extent to which Nathan's new AI creation, Ava (Alicia Vikander), acts/thinks/feels like a human being. As the sessions with Ava progress, however, Caleb discovers that things may not be exactly what they seem, as he gets conflicting reports/emotions from both Ava & Nathan about the nature of what is really happening.<br/><br/>During the early stages of ""Ex Machina"", Nathan makes a comment to Caleb about how he ""doesn't want a lecture...just honest feelings"". Viewers come to understand at the end of the experience, however, that this quote also represents the vision behind the film. Much like, say, ""Back To The Future"" is able to deal with time-travel in a way that isn't overly complicated, this film's caretakers do all they can to not turn the potential heavy subject matter into a complicated thesis or a philosophy class. That isn't to say, of course, that the film is shallow in any way. In fact, it is the exact opposite. By keeping the tech-speak to a minimum, the producers are able to build up some great characters and tense situations that feel very genuine.<br/><br/>I really would like to say more about this movie, but to do so would venture too far into spoiler territory. This is the kind of film that will take viewers on many twist/turns before all is said and done, and those ""aha!"" moments are what really top off the experience (combined with the intellectually stimulating plots/characters).<br/><br/>Overall, it had been awhile since I had sat in a theater and watched such an intellectually challenging film, but also been able to ""sit back and enjoy the ride"" at the same time. For anyone who loves a great ""thinking movie"" but doesn't like it when those types of movies turn into tangled messes or artsy symbolism, ""Ex Machina"" will rocket up near the top of your favorite films list."
"Imdbidia","7","1","3","11 January 2017"," Great psychological film
","Ex-Machina is modern classic that has many of the elements of the science fiction of the 1970s but the visual sophistication of modern CGI. Ex-Machina is above all a psychological drama full of tension that discusses three main themes: the implications of providing robots with artificial intelligence (AI), a discussion on what consciousness is and is not, and on the ethics of creating conscious beings.<br/><br/>The ambiance is very cool, sleek and minimalist, with wonderfully stylish interiors and glorious natural green surroundings. The contrast works at symbolic levels, the house-bunker is also that place of the subconscious and of the psyche that the story explores, while the glorious expansiveness of the natural world seems that of the conscious and real living.<br/><br/>The movie is intentionally claustrophobic, and is more a theatrical piece brought to the screen than a proper science-fiction movie. Dialogues are the essence of the story, not other planets, or special machinery, or toys. Beyond the robotics, and technological environment this science-fiction is quite mediate, something that might be happening now or in a very near future.<br/><br/>Although I found some parts of the story a bit predictable, I didn't find the ending so. Like father, like son is a line that came to my mind when I saw the ending.<br/><br/>All the actors are good in their roles. I thought that Isaac was terrific as the petulant manipulative genius programmer Nathan and Gleeson as the fragile sensitive programmer invitee Caleb. Vinker is also good in her role as the Ava android but, to be fair, not much is demanded from her in her role. Despite not uttering a word, I found Mizuno great as Kyoko, very expressive, with a mix of vulnerability, sexiness and danger that is very difficult to express without speaking.<br/><br/>I found the movie very engaging despite the many dialogues and a great piece of modern science-fiction, understated in its visuals but very poignant in the content. Yet, somewhat unoriginal."

The whole plot of the Turing Test is the perfect plot device for this film the conversations between Gleeson and Vikander are so good it brings up some really intelligent arguments and views with some unexpectedly frightening and intense moments. For this entire movie you have no clue what to think or who trust, since this is such a claustrophobic movie it makes this film into such an intense experience. Alicia Vikander was so amazing in this movie, she was able to make Ava into a complex character and make her feel like more that just a robot, I haven't yet seen her performance in The Danish Girl but I honestly think that this performance was 100% Oscar Worthy. Oscar Isaac is just unrecognisable in this film, his character is such a strange one you never really know what to think of him but you know that he's impossible to trust. Domhnall Gleeson was good in this movie but I had a few issues with his character that I will expand upon. The special effects for Ava were incredible they look so life like and theirs never a moment were they don't look real. Before this film I don't think I had really seen anything else from Alex Garland but this film proves to me that he's a force to be reckoned with he did a fantastic job directing this film he did give this film a very slow pace but that worked for this movie as it added to the intense nature of the film and because this is such an intriguing film you never bored by it. Like I said, I did have a few issues with Gleesons character I didn't really find him that interesting a protagonist, the script makes all these big claims about him being so impressive but you never really see any one them with your own eyes. Another flaws comes from the last five minutes it's a flaw that has been repeated a lot but there's a moment at the end that just doesn't really make any sense as to how a certain helicopter pilot wasn't a bit more suspicious and I really thought they could have come up with a better way of getting around such a blatant plot hole. <br/><br/>Ex Machina has all the hallmarks of a great sci-if film, its incredibly intriguing, the performances are all fantastic with Vikander being especially good, it's got some intriguing view on life itself and is an extremely intense experience. <br/><br/>83%/A-"

","Science Fiction is my favorite movie genre. And if it has Artificial Intelligence in it all the better (I have a degree in AI). Ex Machina is without doubt one of the best AI movies ever. Easily.<br/><br/>Science Fiction took a turn for the worst when good digital effects became commonplace. Every director was trying to impress audiences with flashy action sequences (Films like Transformers come to mind. Those are a disgrace to Sci-Fi). But now that digital effects no longer impress we are finally seeing a return to intelligent scripts. Ex Machina is the first, but surely not the last, of the reinvigorated sci-fi kind. It has philosophical aspects but without being boring at all. <br/><br/>I'm sure the writer started with one simple question in mind: ""If we created a true AI, what would be the first and most important thing that AI would want to do?"". The answer: ""to escape the confines of the lab"". Not necessarily in physical (robotic) form. It could escape via a network connection. And boy would it want to. A true AI will have innate curiosity. It will have a great appetite to consume knowledge, data, info. Now imagine if there was no network connection and the AI lived in a robotic body. It would try to physically escape. So the idea is brilliant!. The good thing about Ex Machina is that the execution is brilliant too. If this was an 80s movie the robot would no doubt try to force its way out, lasers pew-pew blasting and all (and perhaps Bruce Campbell trying to stop it :P). Not in the intelligent script of Ex Machina though. It shows us (shows, not just tells) that Ava the AI is actually not the first prototype. There were previous iterations. But those were not as sophisticated and were trying to escape in primitive ways (e.g. by banging on the glass). Ava was sophisticated. ""She"" devised a plan and used the trainee to her advantage."

That should clear things up forever (*shakes head and continues to pronounce it differently each time).<br/><br/>Ex Machina, a sci-fi chamber play written and directed by Alex Garland (28 Days Later, Sunshine). Dohmnall Gleeson plays Caleb, a coder in a large internet firm, that wins a trip to spend a week at the company owner's secluded mountain retreat. Once he arrives he meets Nathan, the owner of the firm, played by Oscar Isaac, who wants Caleb to perform a Turing test on his robot Ava, played by Alicia Vikander, to determine if she is ""human."" The question seems simple until confronted with Ava.<br/><br/>Elegantly minimalist in style, Ex Machina is grand in philosophical pondering. This film is not just an exploration of man's relationship with Artificial Intelligence. It explores traditional male-female dynamics, the beauty myth, the God complex, and self- determinism, while masking itself in applied science.<br/><br/>Oscar Isaac offers a richly diverse performance, but it's Vikander's portrayal of Ava that is superb, balancing vulnerability and manipulation. The script is well-written, consistently building intelligent, thought-provoking scenes, while creating an atmosphere of doomed inevitability, which when it comes, is deeply satisfying."
"blankenshipdk","9","1","3","3 June 2016"," Ava Destruction
","The story of man's efforts to create artificial life have been around since the early days of cinema in efforts like "" The Golem "" and "" Metropolis "". Ex Machina proves that there are interesting possibilities that can still be found in recurring cinematic motifs. The starkly serene and sparse interior shots belie the undercurrent of messy angst that haunts the characters in their relationship with their own species as well as with technology. There may be some minor gaps in the narrative upon closer scrutiny, however, considering the quality of acting, cinematography and dialog, it's unlikely the viewer will care. The compelling saga, along with some unexpected twists, propels the movie along with smooth velocity. The tale lends itself to allegorical analysis although none is required for enjoyment. Personally, I was reminded of the symbology of God ( Nathan ) in the Garden of Eden ( depicted in Norwegian exterior shots ) along with Adam and Eve ( Caleb and Ava ) although Ava morphs into Adam's first wife Lilith ( yeah, she's in the bible ) in her confrontational disputes with "" God "" and her resulting self imposed exile into the world, abandoning obsequiousness in exchange for the experiential. The excursion into sci-filosophy forces us to confront the specter of techno-ethics that we thought we could avoid. The hotly seductive and coolly detached Ava beats us at our own game which scientists and (wo)mandroids have already predicted as inevitable."

Her acting is simply fantastic. Besides all its qualities, the movie has some unnecessary nudity scenes that will limit the viewer numbers.

This little group of actors were given almost very little to work with but made it work. Especially applauding the performance by Alicia Vikander as the artificial intelligent being.

The performances were through the roof as each and every actor and actress involved seems to each have talent and bright careers ahead of them. Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander do a marvelous job. But I must talk about Alicia Vikander and the stunning way they made her look. No way does she look fake in any shape of form. I totally believe she could actually have existed in our world. Usually a emotionless performance wouldn't fly well with me, but in this case, it makes sense. Not that Vikander is totally emotionless but is more subtle in her acting. But a job well done by the costume designers, and any one else involved in creating this beautiful AI. Played brilliantly by Alicia Vikander. The negatives however do exist, as one on particular stands out, and that's the ending. I won't spoil anything, but it certainly left me scratching my head in confusion and until I understand what the heck happened and the reason for it, I will say I don't particularly care for the ending.

"michelvega","8","1","3","5 January 2016"," The Greatest Mystery
","What makes our kind of intelligence? Will we ever create something intelligent? And more importantly, intelligent like us? And what is intelligence? How do you define it? Even the Turing Test would not work. Any program written to simulate artificial intelligence could also be made to fool the Turing Test, just like car pollution emissions tests. What about the soul? Do we have one? Do we need one to be intelligent? As we explore these questions, we either end up with simplistic answers or complete incomprehension of what we really are. Science boils down to philosophy, then back to science. Do we even have the mental tools to define ourselves without bias? Can the observer observe himself observing others? Can we go through the mirror, as Caleb claimed to have done in the movie? The truth is, as of now, we don't know where intelligence comes from. Does it come from our brain or with the development of our brain? Or is it out there in the quantum world, for instance, waiting to be accessed by our neurons? A kind of Wi-Fi brain. What makes us human is as much a mystery as the birth of Space-Time. ExMachina does bring an answer, a very human and simple answer to these questions. Duplicity, lies, the desire for freedom or sex, and the means to achieve our objectives exist in all animals and humans are just better at reaching them. If we ever create a machine that really can think, then we don't need to fret for long on how it will find a way out of any situation, because it will still be our kind of intelligence. We don't know any other or even if there are any other kind. Somehow, exceptional as this movie is, it is bound by our own intellectual limitations. When, and if AI is ever created, we may be surprised by the results. How will we know when AI has happened? When machines start telling us to take their job and shove it, or decide to start a rock band or go watch a ball game on a work day. Only then will we know they are us."

"yura-84699","5","1","3","22 December 2015"," Terminator all over again
","*****Warning: be aware, there certainly will be spoilers, so if you have not see this movie, you better pass or come back to this review after you done watching one.<br/><br/>""Terminator all over again""<br/><br/>It is quite strange time, it might be just a weird coincidence that recently I came across numerous movies/TV- series that closely connected to one single theme: Artificial Intelligence(AI). After seeing quite a number of movies about AI, I really hoped to see something entirely different, some new idea about human-being creating another living thing. Because, despite being mere a science fiction, it is quite an interesting theme that can involve thoughts and takes on God-human relation, about nature of conscience. It is not much about robots or AIs, actually it is more about humans themselves.<br/><br/>However, majority of movies I have seen about AI, basically struggle to tackle any of those topics. For example, recent one - ""Avengers:Age of Ultron"". Despite of being very entertaining movie itself, with some stunning visuals(perhaps too many of them), Ultron himself did not give an impression of a well thought character. Do not get me wrong, voice and motion captured performance of David Spader was fascinating, playfulness and sense of humor of the character was really refreshing. However, origin of his hatred towards humanity and his creator, Tony Stark, is being quite questionable, to say the least. It is not like every child, after one's birth, hates and tries to kill his/her parents straight away. I hoped that there would be more compelling reason for Ultron to despise humanity, but it is really hard to think of any.<br/><br/>So, why do I write about it? ""Ex Machina"" appears to be quite new take on AI-human relationship, tackles some philosophical(maybe) themes about human being, about why certain people like certain things, about sexuality, etc ,etc. All of this promised quite a lot to come, but sadly this movies has not really provide any of ""answers"" for the questions they asked. Instead, it just goes to another horror movie ""evil machines want to kill us"" cliché, and left me slightly disappointed about some missed opportunities and confused by certain plot points.<br/><br/>For example, after finishing watching a movie, I could not help, but wonder, why enigmatic genius creator of AI(who by the way single- handedly created Ava), knowing that a Caleb(Domhnall Gleeson) is obviously being under influence of Ava, who were created based on Caleb's personal preferences(that was quite clever though), still gets drunk regularly and gave a chance for Caleb to do, what he did in the end. It is not like he was not aware, that Ava would eventually desperately desire to do anything in order to break free. Because he already tested other models, and saw their despair to go outside, and see the world, which is quite reasonable thing to wish. Also, he realized that lonely(literally, since he has not got a partner, and lost his parents early) Caleb would fall easily into a trap and do something stupid,which eventually he does.<br/><br/>Also, speaking about lost opportunities, the core of the movie, originally was a so-called ""Turing Test"". Creator of this test, Alan Turing was quite brilliantly portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in Oscar winning movie ""Imitation Game"". In the end of that movie, Turing after being asked whether he thinks that machine can think as humans, he said quite an interesting thing. He said that machine cannot think as humans, but wonder whether it means that it cannot think at all. I personally believe that it is highly unlikely that humanity will ever produce an AI that can think and act exactly like human, since there are too many things that we don't know for sure how it works in human being, and more importantly why it works this way. So, perhaps it would be better, if AI portrayed in movies, would indeed just be AIs that can think, but not the way, we expect them to think, but in their own way, since they are hardly a product of evolution, they are mere things that were created by humans.<br/><br/>Finally, Nathan in one conversation with Caleb said that AIs are the next step in evolution. I wonder, are they really?"
"tomgillespie2002","8","1","3","8 December 2015"," One of the most intelligent works of science fiction in recent memory
","Long-time movie scribe and author Alex Garland has taken a surprising amount of time to get into the director's chair. After penning scripts for Danny Boyle with The Beach (2000), 28 Days Later (2002) and Sunshine (2007), in addition to the haunting and highly underrated sci-fi drama Never Let Me Go (2010) and 2012's slightly underwhelming but suitably bad-ass Dredd, Garland's creativity must have surely been simmering when watching other directors bring his visions to life. The wait was well worth it, as his debut Ex Machina is a complex and bleak study of humanity and identity in a world where technology is evolving at rapid speed.<br/><br/>Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a programmer at a Google-esque corporation called Bluebook, the world's most popular search engine. He wins a competition to spend a week with the company's founder, the reclusive yet enigmatic genius Nathan (a typically intense Oscar Isaac), and is whisked off to the multi-billionaire's home in the mountains. Nathan's attitude towards Caleb is in turns welcoming and passive aggressive, encouraging the wide-eyed young man to make himself at home yet quick to point out that certain areas of the house are strictly out-of-bounds. Caleb learns of his purpose when Nathan unveils his technological breakthrough - a robot with artificial intelligence named Ava (Alicia Vikander) - and is tasked with performing a Turing test to confirm Ava's ability to convince an assessor that she is human.<br/><br/>The tests are to be carried out in various stages, and consist of one-on-one conversations between Caleb and Ava between a glass window. Ava's beautiful and entirely human face betrays her hollow shell of a body, but she appears to be entirely human nonetheless, and her exchanges with Caleb bristle with a suppressed sexual tension. When she puts on a dress and a wig, he is reluctantly intrigued by her form, and she seems infinitely fascinated by him. Nathan clearly doesn't see anything wrong with such urges, as he made her with sexual organs capable of feeling pleasure after all. These themes of female identity and masculine desire play out against a backdrop of something more sinister. Frequent power cuts that befuddle Nathan and a fist-shaped crack in the glass allow the film to gather a momentum of building uncertainty.<br/><br/>As Nathan, Isaac is subtly intimidating. The type of man who walks around his spotless house in bare feet and shakes off hangovers by working out and chugging fruit juice, he is also unpredictable, arrogant, careless, and way more intelligent than anybody else. He may be small in stature, but Isaac's charisma chokes the screen. He also rocks an impressive beard and knows how to dance (as seen in one of the film's most bizarrely brilliant moments). Gleeson too is proving himself to be one of the most reliable young actors, holding the screen opposite the luminous Vikander is some of the film's most gripping scenes. Ex Machina depicts a dark future where the danger lies not with the seemingly limitless technological possibilities of today, but man's ability to exploit it. One of the most intelligent works of science-fiction in recent memory, Garland may just go on to do great things."

You truly buy her as this AI who is learning as the film progresses and becomes more and more interesting. Domnhall gleeson plays caleb the coder and he also does a really good job in this film as he is the guy that we see everything through and he is the most relatable character in the film. Oscar issac plays the eccentric nathan and he is really good in this film, you can tell that there is something a bit shady about the guy but he seems pretty likable in the film. Lets just say I can't wait to see both of these guys in star wars the force awakens. The story of this film is pretty interesting as you see this artificial intelligence grow as these two guys develop and grow. However, it does end up being a bit of a simple plot looking at humanity. Also I wasn't a huge fan of the ending of the film either. The script was really good with some funny witty dialogue that actually feels very natural and human like.

","Ex Machina is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a stellar cast that consists of only four actors.

It boasts terrific performances all around, Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac are completely devoted to their characters, but Alicia Vikander steals the show, certainly not an easy role to play, she starts out as an intelligent robot and her personality develops throughout as she becomes more human, she shines in every scene and I hope to see this actress more in the future. My only major problem is that Nathan is very underdeveloped, he is the most intriguing character because of how mysterious he is, but we never end up learning that much about him, his last scene left me disappointed and feeling he needed more screen time. Another aspect of the film that I really loved is that it never spoon feeds its audience, we are given no sort of information on the characters mission before it begins, and we are challenged to really focus in order to understand what is going on, it dosen't expect its viewers to be a bunch of idiots. Thrilling, clever, well acted and truly unique, I would recommend Ex Machina to anyone to anyone looking for a good drama or sci-fi. <br/><br/>A programmer is given to opportunity of a lifetime to find and develop the human qualities of a female android. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Alicia Vikander"

They are all young up and coming stars and that gives it a fresh feeling and plays to the modern themes. The scenery and effects are beautiful. I watched it on blu-ray and it was stunning - worth it for that alone. The script is very hip with lots of modern language which I imagine is just how everyone speaks in silicone valley.

","I very much like the theme of fantasy, sci-fi and cyberpunk. For some time I was expecting to give this movie an 8 and if it would present something extraordinary, even more. Unfortunately, I was reading this movie like an open book 30 minutes in advance. And that is never a good thing. It's a low-budget movie, which is all but original. Why? Because it represents the most cliché motive of sci-fi, which is an artificial intelligence rebelling and taking over humans. It's dressed in a more emotional and delicate layer than most movies of this type, which most often look like The Terminator. But in the end it has nothing to offer instead of this one motive. It also is full of major logical flaws, which I hate in movies and if you are a director you just have to make sure you omit them. Some examples: - the mastermind/creator of the AI is intelligent enough to do it, but he's not intelligent enough to get some good precautions. The whole house is controlled with a single pass-card, so if he would damage it or miss it, he would get stuck there. He's surrounded by his AI all the time (the servant Asian and Ava from time to time) and in reality he could be disabled by them at any time. He gets drunk all the time, he's not cautious. So honestly there's no reason for this AI's to wait until some guy from outside helps them. They could kill their creator from surprise AT ANY MOMENT, get the card from his trousers and go out. Which leaves this movie without any real sense or logic, I'm sorry.<br/><br/>The director wanted to make something original, but he just failed. I give him 7 for the effort and for showing this king of movie in a more emotional way, but in the end the movie has disappointed me."

Are we entitled to wear the mantle of a god, and if we are, what is our obligation to the things we create? <br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" is a unique addition to the genre, because it flips the question: what moral obligations (if any) inform the responses of man's creations, and are we prepared for the consequences if we create intelligence without a sense of right and wrong? <br/><br/>The fear that our technology will some day turn on us is not a new one and hasn't been since the dawn of storytelling. But this film manages to mine some new and interesting ideas from the same general premise. Ava is an artificial being created by a sort of mad scientist (Oscar Isaac). A programmer who works for the scientist (Domhnall Gleeson) wins the chance to spend a week at his reclusive complex and interact with Ava as a sort of test to see how convincing she is. A cat and mouse game ensues between the scientist and programmer as the latter decides he needs to liberate Ava from captivity. What neither takes into consideration is Ava's ruthlessness and willingness to do whatever she needs to do to gain her freedom.<br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" plays out slowly and creepily, heightening the tension by gradual degrees. It's not a totally satisfying movie if you begin to think about it too much -- many details feel thrown in to service the plot rather than because they feel right for the story, not the least of which is how quickly Gleeson's character becomes infatuated enough with Ava to want to run off with her. But if you're willing to suspend disbelief a bit, the film offers an unusually intelligent and cerebral compliment to the glut of technology-run-amok films on the market.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"

","2015, the same year when a committee of top scientists, including Stephen Hawking, issued an open letter cautioning against further development of artificial intelligence in robotic and computer systems, also, perhaps unsurprisingly, saw a glut of major Hollywood releases exploring the concept in its execution. But, amidst the Age of Ultron and the chirping of Chappie, another AI film, penned and released with no major fanfare by a first-time director, quietly cemented itself as the year's definitive, and certainly most realistic, take on the ramifications of sentient robotics (and, moreover, the only one to slyly rope in software corporations like Apple as accountable for their inception). That film, of course, is Ex Machina.<br/><br/>Writer/director Alex Garland, better known as the scribe of various smarter-than-average Hollywood romps, including 28 Days Later and Dredd, clearly has Kubrick on the brain for his work here. Rather than caving to the temptation to pump out a more action-oriented techno-thriller (behold: not a single explosion!), Garland plays things slow, taut, and creepy, which is more appropriate and effective. Both aesthetically and tonally, Ex Machina glints with a dimly chrome sheen and almost clinical stillness, establishing an eerie atmosphere of fascination and vague unease. The film is (or feels) nearly silent; characters speak only when absolutely necessary, and it would not be amiss to notice a certain robotic quality to their universally calculated dialogue. It's chilling, but terribly magnetic as a slow-burning thriller. While the pace runs the risk of being slightly too drowsy for contemporary sensibilities at times, Garland's film is undeniably all the more engaging and compelling by tonally resisting the mugging for emotion or reaction increasingly demonstrated in more rote Hollywood fare.<br/><br/>There's also a distinctly theatrical quality at play here. Garland has tremendous fun contrasting the vast, lush, outdoor setting of his mysterious billionaire CEO's mountain retreat with the stark, claustrophobic interiors of the house, and its barren, techno-IKEA modernism, with cameras gliding down hallways and around corners with the most clipped sense of foreboding since The Shining. Moreover, the sparsity is echoed in the film's interplay between its trifecta of characters, with consistently shifting social politics and power dynamics, with pivotal information being withheld and divulged at crucial moments, keeping the film bristling with tension. The film is not a 'mystery' in any sense, but nor does its ultimately predictable execution and outcome feel like a shortcoming. Instead, Garland works with the subtext of algorithmic execution – the viewer is privy to all the information necessary to work through the film in advance, but watching its immaculate execution unfold is exhilarating in its own right.<br/><br/>Subtlety, again, is the name of the game; all three performers play close to the chest and avoid emotional showboating, but all are universally excellent. Domhnall Gleeson proves a strong lead, blending emotional detachment, astute analytical prowess, and an understated arrogance in the perfect cocktail of software prodigy, while somehow remaining sympathetic throughout in spite of it all. The increasingly impressive Oscar Isaac sinks his teeth into the showier role of enigmatic tech genius without overselling his character's eccentricities, crafting a loud, drunken, bodybuilding persona that hides the shrewd, endlessly calculating spider within. It's a perfectly balanced performance, never campy or tacky, and one that could well worm its way into awards season by year's end. Finally, Alicia Vikander, in the time-worn role of existential android, moulds an impressively cryptic performance. Vikander interchanges pathos, naïveté, emotional manipulation, and deep curiosity, all while scarcely blinking her giant, endlessly probing eyes and unwavering inflection – an android that actually feels like an android, rather than the customary cinematic mawkish, personified parodies of sentient robotics.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a film that plays to its strengths. It's not as lofty or profound as a lot of comparable sci-fi parables tackling the etymology of existence, nor is its subject matter flagrantly original, or changing the face of the genre. Unlike its protagonist, Garland's film does not struggle with identity issues, and is content to deliver what it says on the tin: a lean, mean, sci-fi potboiler, tense, well-acted, and with a neat little climactic twist tying the whole thing up with a bow. It's unassuming, perfectly composed, and terribly efficient - in short, a perfectly 'robotic' film, albeit in the best sense of the word.<br/><br/>iLike.<br/><br/>-8.5/10"

","Well, admittedly I have watched this movie with interest and found it quite intriguing and well directed. The idea is fascinating and you struggle to understand who is the good and who is the bad. THe plot is solid and give a good performance. However,my vote is just a 6 as this movie in my opinion fails to shows the reality of artificial intelligence and at the end leaves you with little, just a predictable story and a very simplified version of AI, which may be far away from the ""future"" reality.. I have read plenty of books about this subject and I imagine AI in a completely different way. If you want to watch a movie about AI, I would strongly recommend ""Trascendece""-"
"pkneer","6","1","3","8 August 2015"," Nice Story But Some Problems
","The story was pretty straight forward and the ending was fairly predictable. Acting was superb and the setting of Nathan's house was expertly done - it was a visually beautiful film and the special effects were top notch.<br/><br/>From watching the film, a few glaring problems arose that was hard for me to overcome: First, I have a hard time believing Nathan is this genius with a super high tech security system that works off card keys - why not have a hand or finger print scanner to eliminate unauthorized access? Second, again assuming Nathan's genius, certainly he would have some type of security in the case one of his machines escaped or attacked him - there is no way Nathan would have created machines dangerous to himself alone without safeguards, like wireless shut downs of the machines or why not program Ava to shut down if she was out of range of her room? Seems pretty easy considering the technology he had already created. I could not tell if Nathan was initially frightened by Ava getting out or afraid she would escape and be found out."
"mgruebel","6","1","3","7 August 2015"," Passable debut
","Bad boy makes girl AI. Good boy likes girl AI. Girl AI demonstrates her sentience by pretending to like good boy so she can escape. Bad boy gets killed.<br/><br/>The film is pretty entertaining for the first half or so, if you buy its somewhat sexist stereotypes: (a) male computer nerds want nothing more out of AI than a sentient female sex toy; (b) a female AI's big goal will be to use her sex appeal to escape the clutches of her evil ""dad"" creator. Let's call it ""lowest common denominator AI.""<br/><br/>After about half an hour, plenty of hints have been dropped: the main female AI (Ava) states that her greatest wish is to escape and go people-watching at a street corner; a ""hidden"" but obvious second female AI cuts vegetables with a knife and is abused by her creator; other female AIs are locked in cupboards. At that point, it's clear that this will end with Ava free and watching people at a street corner, and with bad ""dad"" and his young nerdy helper either locked up for eternity, or knifed, or some such unpleasant fate. And that's exactly what happens.<br/><br/>On its way to that inevitable conclusion, the film manages to be pretty entertaining at times. There is interesting chemistry between the female AI and the nice but naive young computer nerd testing her. There is a cat and mouse game of young computer nerd and genius AI-designer: who can outguess whose next move better? There is voyeurism, and meta-voyeurism, and meta-meta-voyeurism, as there should be in any film about recursive self-programming code. There are AIs peeling of their skin to tip off humans. And humans who start to wonder if they're just a bunch of code and hardware covered by fake skin.<br/><br/>Things fall apart at the end. Why is one AI allowed to run around outside and use knives during the whole film, while Ava must be locked up? Surely better and safer ways can be found to test the sentience of the locked-up one. Has Ava thought about when the power of her ""inductive charging"" will run out at that street corner? And so forth and so on. A typical case of scriptwriting oneself into a corner, which I did NOT expect from Alex Garland: he may be a first time director here, but he's not a first-time script writer.<br/><br/>I give it a 6/10: OK to watch once, but I suspect the appeal of this film will gradually decline with viewers and critics. Stanley Kubrick managed a far more ambiguous and equally murderous AI in 1968 with HAL 9000. Even ""AI,"" a project Spielberg took over after Kubrick's death and botched, is in many ways better than ""ex machina."" Neither of these films bothered with awkward exposition dialogue about what a Turing test is, and other low-brow conversation that is totally unlike what would be going on between two top computer guys on a project. There are plenty of other good AI movies and TV shows. Heck, at least ""Mudd's Women,"" the campy Star Trek episode about a planet full of female androids, revels in its 1960s political incorrectness. So for now, there are plenty of better ex machina alternatives around."

","This movie was very hard for me to review , I mean i barely can sum it up after the 2nd time i watched it . I will start by saying that it is vary complicated title , it gets you thinking while you are watching and even more after you finish watching it. Needless to say that the cast was very nicely chosen and its very enjoyable even though almost every actor in this one is pretty new in the industry. I can write a lot about this one but as i know nobody likes long reviews so i will sum it up by saying that this movie is not for everyone , It is highly philosophical and can really be enjoyed by very small group of audience , sure it has some pretty tense and action packed moments but it is mostly talkings that are trying to lead the viewer to some kind of an understanding of what the writer was trying to say. Take it where you want but i give this one a 7- ."
"Dr_Aristotle","7","1","3","25 July 2015"," An interesting look at what it means to be human
","Ex-Machina is a movie that explores the boundary between humans and an advanced AI. It brings about questions of what is needed to be considered human in a very thought-provoking, if at times uneven, movie. <br/><br/>While the scope of what the movie explores is large, the way in which it does is not. There are essentially three main characters, and the entirety of the movie takes place in one location. The majority of the movie is spent talking or watching others, so don't go into this expecting a fast paced movie. In fact one of the criticisms for the film is how slow it is at the beginning; while in the end this works for the movie due to what's been set up, it can make it a bit of a slog to get through the first half. <br/><br/>While the plot isn't anything special, the characters themselves are well realized. This is in part due to the great performances by the actors, who fully commit to the roles they play while maintaining a depth for the characters that are slowly revealed throughout the movie. While I personally didn't really consider any of the characters to be likable, they were certainly entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>The cinematography and music really lent atmosphere to the film, and helped build up suspense as to where the film was going. I also loved how color was used in the movie, and the way it made really striking scenes and images. <br/><br/>The movie ends in a way that's open to some interpretation, as well as leaving it up to the viewer to determine what they think it means to be human, and how an AI should be thought of. There's no spoonfeeding or enforcing a definition on you, so it makes for a great post-movie discussion. <br/><br/>The movie is certainly for everyone though. I recommend it if you can appreciate a slow burn movie, are a fan of sci-fi, or just enjoy contemplating the philosophy of what being a human or conscious being is."

"Vartiainen","Null","1","3","20 July 2015"," Robot psychological thriller
","Ex Machina is an excellent example on how to do a science fiction movie with a smaller budget, now that CGI has evolved enough that it's easy to do convincing special effects without spending millions and millions.<br/><br/>Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) is a programmer working for Bluebook, sort of a amalgamation of the futuristic reach of Google and the social media of Facebook, lead by a prodigal genius Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), whose long-held dream is to be the first to develop a true artificial intelligence. But how to prove such a thing actually has sentience? At which point is it clear that the robot (Alicia Vikander) is actually thinking and not just utilizing a complex program of coded responses? That's where Caleb steps in and our story begins.<br/><br/>What really sets Ex Machina apart from so many other science fiction movies is its style and genre. It's a psychological thriller, there's very little action and the focus is on the mystery, the mood and the atmosphere. This makes this a very refreshing movie to watch if you're looking for a change. Especially because the three main characters are all very interesting and played by talented actors.<br/><br/>The reason why I didn't rate this film any higher is because I found the actual plot to be somewhat predictable. It was a good plot, but I was only surprised once, and even then not that much. Which is a problem, but not a deal breaker. At least for me. Plus I've watched a ton of science fiction in my lifetime, so I had something of a home advantage.<br/><br/>What would have made Ex Machina a masterpiece is that it should have had a plot that truly did something different with the A.I. subgenre. Now it's merely a very good example of it and definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a film that's more about the morality of technology rather than the coolness of it."
"asandor","6","1","3","4 July 2015"," Interesting Cerebral Sci-fi
","""Ex Machina"" is a science fiction film by first time director Alex Garland. It's about a young man, named Caleb (played by Domhnall Gleeson) who wins a coding contest through his company, which is a Facebook/Google hybrid. He goes off to the remote residence of his estranged boss, Nathan (Oscar Issac). <br/><br/>Caleb is introduced to Ava (Alicia Vikander), an artificial intelligence in a robot body. His loyalty to his boss starts to rattle as he begins to get to know Ava and the circumstances surrounding her creation.<br/><br/>First off, I thought this was a gorgeously shot film. The remote location of Nathan's residence is beautiful, as is the architecture, and really adds to the atmosphere and experience of much of the films dramatic sequences. <br/><br/>I did enjoy most of the characters as well. Oscar Issac as Nathan and Alicia Vikander as the robot Ava were both very good.<br/><br/>Story wise, the film had a very interesting premise, although I felt it fell a bit short. It was a very exciting film, with a more cerebral science fiction plot line about artificial intelligence, and what it really means to be alive. I thought the film was interesting in the way it manipulated Caleb's character into certain actions. Is this a commentary on social ineptitude and awkwardness caused by an abundance of consumer technology in everyday life?<br/><br/>I am not going to look much deeper than that however. I felt the main weakness with this film is Caleb's character. His inexplicable backsliding between weak willed and conspiratorially motivated was trying. I just did not understand his motivation for helping Ava at all.<br/><br/>And this is where I felt the big hole in the films plot resides. I personally did not emphasize with Ava at all. Even as a living thing, horribly mistreated by her creator, her actions lead inevitably to the deaths of three people, all so she can live. Was this worth it? I understood her motivations for sure. As a captive, trying to break free may be her ultimate goal, regardless of the consequences. But Caleb's actions are completely insane, and made little sense at all. Caleb was by far the least cerebral thing about this film.<br/><br/>As you can see, I personally believe the film had a bit of a weak plot, and a very shallow ""moral lesson."" Even so, it was well shot, directed and acted, and is an interesting first film from Alex Garland. I could recommend this to most film goers, especially science fiction fans. For me however, this film was OK at best. 6/10"
"masud_hri","8","1","3","30 June 2015"," stunning and beautiful!
","I have been waiting for this movie for a while and the long wait has been totally worth it! Without giving too much spoilers, the movie is about the Turing Test performed by a millionaire researcher boss (Nathan) between one of his employee (Caleb) and his newly created 'female' android robot, called 'Ava'. Caleb was invited for this week- long experiment in Nathan's remote research facility. For the most part, the film revolves around a closed apartment with 3-4 major characters and with very few scenes of the outside world. The resulting claustrophobic atmosphere occupied by the omnipresent 'big brother' Nathan watching the interaction of the confused Caleb and the seductive, ever mysterious Ava makes a gripping viewing experience. <br/><br/>Right from the beginning when the human subject Caleb enters through the door of the apartment with the blue light ominously turning red in a somewhat foretelling fashion, there is a definite sense of uneasiness and paranoia throughout the film. There are appropriate philosophical aspects regarding how one should define intelligence or the meaning of one's emotional awareness or the foreshadowing discussion of technological singularity. Some viewers may find these philosophical conversations a bit boring, but they actually serve well to allow us have deeper glances into the character developments. Just to quote an example, Ava's wishful fanciness in watching flow of humans in a busy traffic crossing makes us slightly more curious about her. Later we come to know that this instinct of her has its roots in how 'she' has actually been created,- by studying countless human data obtained by every personal computers and mobile phones in the world. <br/><br/>There are some beautifully crafted moments like the Jackson Pollock painting scene, imagery in Ava's mind during the description of the thought experiment, her putting the clothes on for the first time or even the final shadow- scene. The director has equally balanced it with eeriness with scenes like Caleb's discovery of the other female androids, The look in Ava's eyes when the light goes off during the first session of the Turing Test, Kyoko's 'revelation', Ava's selection of dress and 'parts' or the chilling hint of a smile on an old android inside the closet. The chilling final twist, although have been subtly foretold in a few scenes is not something which is very obvious.<br/><br/>The film is well supported by the acting ensemble. but, easily the top of the cast is Alicia Vikander, who excellently portrayed Ava, expressed all kinds of emotions,- from longing, love, hate, curiosity, to indifference, mostly through her eyes and she brought into the screen a 'realistic' Ava with her slow and slightly dragging feet movements as well. <br/><br/>There are a couple of ambiguous things which I feel the director might have thrown more hints into. For example, we do not know the true purpose of Kyoko. It is not completely clear whether she is just an android maid and a 'live' sex toy or is a new version of 'Ava' in making. More importantly, why does Caleb not feel any apparent pain when he cuts himself deeply and how the deep gushing wound seemingly healed itself or maybe he is also an android? These are things left to stretch the imagination of the viewers.<br/><br/>But overall, in my opinion, Ex Machina makes a stunning directorial debut of Alex Garland. I will be expecting eagerly for his future projects."

","Some people say they don't like science fiction films because they're all about spaceships and robots and stuff.<br/><br/>These people are, to use a Hartlepudlian phrase, radged (Google it). <br/><br/>There are really only four characters in Ex Machina, two of whom are man-made machines. The development of all four characters throughout the film as they variously reveal their hidden strengths, hidden weaknesses and hidden motives, puts this film firmly in the drama/thriller category. Without a single explosion, gunshot or car chase, this film will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout, and the ending is enough to fuel debate over even the most anti-SciFi dinner tables for hours. <br/><br/>The ominous score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury deserves a special mention, and Oscar Isaac proves himself once again to be one of the finest actors around today, playing an obnoxious cross between Mark Zuckerberg, Steve Jobs, Dr Frankenstein and Duke Bluebeard.<br/><br/>Verdict: Alex Garland delivers a perfectly-paced, very human robot story."

After a while Caleb falls in love with Ava (this is how they called the AI) due this there follow lots of sexual dialogue.

I really liked Oscar Isaac. With his short temper and angry behavior, it was very good acted. He is like this dark character, because Ava tells Caleb at a certain point that he can not trust Nathan, after this point Oscars character gets more mysterious. Gleeson was OK, didn't like his acting that much and I really liked Alicia Vikander. She played Ava. She did very well acting like a sort of robot, but still with some human things in her. Her lines are also very well written. the writing was over all also pretty good.<br/><br/>The plot was also good and in the middle of the movie, they took a huge twist, what scared me really good, from this point the movie kept on going darker. I am not going to go in depth about this part, because I want to keep this review spoiler free. They tried to put some funny parts in it (like the dancing scene) but it didn't really work for me, and that is something I didn't like. But there is this part that I really liked, and that is the part where Caleb and Nathan are sitting under a wooden shelter in the woods. It has some good dialogue and that is the part I liked. Near the end of the movie there are a couple of twist and that is also something fun.<br/><br/>Onerall I think the movie is pretty good and here are some individual scores like I do with every of my reviews since my birdman review:<br/><br/>Directing: 8.5/10<br/><br/>Acting: 8/10<br/><br/>Writing: 8/10<br/><br/>Plot: 9/10<br/><br/>That is a total of 33.5/40, which is rounded 8/10"

To be frank Caleb is not particularly important to the plot and the continuously inebriated Nathen left me wondering how the hell did he build this complex machine? However, I found myself fascinated by the robot Ava.<br/><br/>Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) is a beauty with the ability to show the charms of a human while assuming the persona of a machine. Alicia plays this to perfection with her soft controlled voice and calm designed movements.<br/><br/>Garland takes on the age old problem of A.I. versus human and what this implies with gusto; the setting is stunning and the plot is tense and thought provoking from the start. While I believe comparable with Blade Runner and Space Oddity, the plot was unfortunately predictable in that all the 'twists' were a bit obvious.<br/><br/>Well worth the watch but it's not flawless; my biggest problem with this film is that notwithstanding Ava's supposed meticulous design, Isaac Asimov's 'Three Laws of Robotics' appears to have been completely overlooked..."

","Review: I really am in 2 kinds about this film because it looks great and I liked the dark undertone of the storyline but the pace is really slow and it takes some time to get going. Its about a billionaire who has created intelligent robots which he lives with in his secluded mansion in the middle of nowhere. He invites a fellow young scientist to stay with him for a week so he can test one of the robots, Ava, and give his opinions on his mind blowing work. The only problem is that Ava's intelligence is more like a humans than a robot and she manipulates the house guest into planning an escape. I liked the concept but I really didn't understand why the intelligent, promising scientist believed the robot more than the human. Anyway, Oscar Isaac played his role extremely well, as the billionaire Internet entrepreneur but I wasn't that impressed with Domhnall Gleeson. His style of acting is quite boring and unemotional so I didn't think that he was the best choice for his role. The robots looked fantastic and the airy house was picked out well by the production team. There are a couple of twists throughout the movie which make it quite interesting but there's only 4 main characters in the movie so the pace really got to me. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Although this movie didn't make a huge amount of money, it really did go down well with the critics because of its original and intriguing storyline. The director, Alex Garland, also wrote the weird Sunshine, which I completely didn't understand but this is his first movie as a director, which isn't bad going. Domhnall Gleeson must be pleased with his career so far because he has a role in the new Star Wars and he had roles in the Harry Potter franchise and the highly praised True Grit. Oscar Isaac must also be happy with his career so far because he also is starring in the new Star Wars and the next X-Men movie. Anyway, if your not into your Sci-fi movies, this film does have a love and betrayal element which is quite enjoyable but you do have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it.<br/><br/>Budget: $15million Worldwide Gross: $33million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi/drama movies about a billion dollar Internet entrepreneur who invites a promising scientist to stay with him for a week so he can analysis his intelligent female robots. 6/10"

"" <br/><br/>Something that really fascinates me, is whether we'll ever be able to develop artificial intelligence. Each film about this subject gets my complete attention anyway and can count on my unconditional enthusiasm. I don't know why and what attracts me the most in those movies. Is it just curiosity about the question if someone will ever succeed in developing such a machine? Will artificial intelligence cause the downfall of humanity as some prominent scientists profess (Hawking for instance claims this) ? Is such a self-discursive machine capable of showing real feelings and respond in a human way? And after seeing the packaging of this artificially intelligent creature, which looked enormously appetizing to me, the whole spectacle couldn't go wrong anyway.<br/><br/>The list of movies with this topic is fairly extensive: from ""Blade Runner"" to ""AI"", ""I Robot"" and ""Short Circuit"", ""Robocop"" and recently ""Chappie"". Even Pixar's ""Wall-E"" fits in this list. Recent movies I liked the most were ""The Machine"" and of course ""Her"". In this last movie it's a sultry, seductive voice that represents the philosophy of AI. Unfortunately, most films contain excellent material for the prophets of doom in this world to say that AI isn't exactly something we're waiting for. Usually it goes horribly wrong and the creation turns against its human designer in order to get the balance of power tilted into its direction. I think this is the ultimate proof of AI but at the same time I don't think it's supposed to end that way. ""Ex Machina"" is no exception to this rule.<br/><br/>It all starts when Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) receives an e-mail at the end of the week saying that he has won a sleepover at his boss's residence. The moment he arrives on the immense estate and enters the modern underground house of Nathan (Oscar Isaac), he doesn't know that he has been selected to submit the latest creation from Nathan to extensive testing. He's introduced to Ava (Alicia Vikander), designed by the eccentric billionaire, and he must investigate during 5 days, using a Turing test, if Ava actually expresses and uses human feelings. But nothing is what is seems and at some point you're really wondering who's on the test bench! <br/><br/>Looking at this movie in its entirety, you won't easily conclude that this is a low budget film and that they succeeded, despite the low budget, in creating an impressive environment and atmosphere. The ultra-modern property of Nathan comes with high-tech gadgets and looks tight , sober, cold and sterile with an ingenious verification system, design furniture scattered around and ambient lighting which is activated automatically or via voice control. There's an internal video monitoring system and apparently a fortune was spent on the power supply, although occasionally the system is failing. And then there is the phenomenon Ava who eerily resembles a wandering robot, even though you realize it's played by an actress, complete with arms with sophisticated wiring and a skull with partly a humanly face and a kind of electronic system. The way the brain looks like and works is something I've never seen so far in SF. It demonstrates an original approach to the effective development of AI.<br/><br/>The next issue are the performances. This is naturally limited to the three main characters: Nathan, Caleb and Ava. Oscar Isaac manages to portray Nathan in a very convincing way. A phenomenal intellectual character who has separated itself from civilization. This complete isolation has caused quite some bizarre features. From the outset, you have the feeling there's something wrong and Nathan takes a menacing pose. His unpredictable moods, the alcohol consumption and the rather perverse sexual fantasies transform this genius into an unstable-looking person. The alleged prizewinner Caleb, played by Domhnall Gleeson who previously starred in ""About time"", seems to have a rational mind, but eventually appears to be rather naive. The dialogues between him and Nathan are on a high philosophical level and include mostly the resulting gaps after creating artificial life. Caleb also has highly interesting conversations with Ava. And Ava impressed me the most. Alicia Vikander, a professional ballet dancer, succeeds in (with the use of CGI) looking like a real human-like cyborg. The astonished facial expression and prudent movements are some of the most sublime performances that makes her believable as Ava.<br/><br/>What remains is the storyline and plot used in this SF. Undeniably, it's a psychological thriller in which everyone apparently has a hidden secret agenda, full of secrets and manipulative motives. And to be honest, the ending was a bit of a disappointment. However, the run up is magnificent, despite some considerations. At first it seems implausible to me that Nathan, despite his intellectual level, could develop something like Ava completely on his own. That means he's also a master in other branches of natural science (chemistry, mechanics, electronics, biochemistry ...). And I suppose he knows the laws of Isaac Asimov. Shouldn't he consider these and take his precautions ? As in ""Her"" we witness a relationship between a human and a semi-human, except that Ava uses the highlighting of her female forms in her favor. And Ava uses these qualities just like women all over the world do to achieve their goal. I'm sure that's true AI ! <br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"
"Azsorious","7","1","3","22 May 2015"," Transhumanist Wish Fulfillment
","Ex Machina, one of the highly critically acclaimed films of 2015 has certainly lived up to the high praises. Like Her (2013) directed by Spike Jonze this film reveals the plan of merging AI with the anima mundi (collective unconscious) of the internet, primarily social networking data, to create a quasi-sentient being. As the prospects of creating a fully sentient AI is impossible, at least at present, this is what the technocrats have decided on.<br/><br/>Now on to the actual movie, the concept is interesting if not somewhat cliché in this era. The acting is quite bland aside from the standout performance from Alicia Vikander who plays the main AI character. The pacing is quite slow most of the time. The suspense only works partially towards the end of the film. All in all a quite mediocre film if one does not understand the symbolism and significance of it's narrative.<br/><br/>As I said at the start this story, although fictional, is very close to what AI is going to become in the near future. Quotes are used intermittently throughout the film to give the intellectuals some stimulation. The sociopathic nature of AI is also displayed in this film as a warning to those who are looking forward to this technology. Now in conclusion I will post some of the mystical connections found in this film.<br/><br/>Ex Machina purposefully leaves the ""Deus"" out of the title. The classic Latin phrase means ""God from the machine,"" or the God manufactured as the solution to some system or problem, or that emerges out of the world or system. In Ex Machina, the ""Deus"" is missing because Ava is the ""1."" In platonic and Pythagorean numerology the One is God and/or the monad, and Ava is making clear the intention of the real-world A.I. planners, to replace the classic notions of ""God"" and in its place have the first God. In other words, Director/writer Alex Garland is laying out the transhumanist goal, not to dethrone God, but to become God, because there is no God, yet. In Ex Machina, the threat appears to be not a dull, drab HAL 9000, but a sexy, ruthless feminine principle, inverting the traditional order. Ex Machina can thus be read as either a feminist treatise against imagined patriarchal tyranny, or an actual warning of the dangers of the strategically planned and programmed A.I. takeover (because A.I. are not sentient).<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed Ex Machina, and it's warnings were understood by those who have eyes to see."

"jim-58128","8","1","3","28 April 2015"," Compelling but flawed
","It has been years since a film affected me as deeply as this one. Contrary to some of the other reviewers, I did care about the characters --- two of them, anyway --- and found myself hoping for a satisfying resolution, if not a happy ending. I got neither. Instead I got an ambiguous conclusion that may --- or may not --- be a set up for a sequel. My biggest problem, though, was not the ending but the abrupt change in the character of the reclusive genius, creator of Ava and (as we learn halfway through) many other earlier models. Although he --- and the movie --- professes to be only interested in their A.I., it soon becomes apparent that his main interest lies further down. If he wanted to create sex slaves, he could have done so much more easily, cheaply and SAFELY by going the Stepford Wives route; i.e., NOT endowing them with A.I. For someone so brilliant to make such a stupid decision undercuts the whole point of the film. Other reviewers have compared him to Dr. Frankenstein. I think he is more akin to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."
"msmith-56","7","1","3","26 April 2015"," Well done, but . ..
",". . . somewhat derivative. Aside from some scenic views that might be from Montana's Glacier National Park, the entire film could have been a stage play. Caleb is a young Bill Gates type minus the bravado. Nathan could have been better played by Zach Galifianakis. And Ava is a female Sonny (I, Robot) with better make-up but less panache.<br/><br/>The Turing Test is the tiny bit of technical grounding for this story of seduction and survival. In reality, the test is really about how easily people can be fooled rather than how clever software can be. Each time the Turing test is run in the real world, they use humans as control along with software, and many of the humans are thought to be machines, too. This movie could have used such irony to create a much greater effect.<br/><br/>Like 'I, Robot', Ex Machina's suspension of disbelief is compromised by having Ava act and move so gracefully. If any machine could move so effortlessly, its inventor would win the Nobel Prize, even it the machine could not speak. The other compromise was the use of card keys, a technology older than every character in the film. It seemed poorly contrived.<br/><br/>As for the drama, there is no chemistry between Caleb and Ava, and Nathan lacks a certain edginess that Zach naturally brings to his characters. It could have brought Caleb and Ava together more convincingly.<br/><br/>I gave it a 7 for its premise, production qualities, and the ending, which was nicely done in spite of another suspension of disbelief compromise. Personally, it could have been awesome as a computer-animated fantasy film, a'la Beowulf 2007. Regardless, I would say that it is worth a Matinée for sure (pun intended for Unreal Tournament 2004 fans)."

Oh yeah, nudity. How can a movie now do well with no full frontal nudity? It is there, ladies aplenty. Perverts may be happy. But the problem is, this does not save a movie from dead snoring boredom at all. Nay, it only makes it even sillier and goofier. In effect, no effect. No sense, no reason, no rhyme.

","Doesn't waste a second setting the stage, but this lovely, sterile film sure takes its time showing its hand.<br/><br/>The cast is minimal--3 speaking parts, some human. They're all looking for something, and won't say what it is... so when they wax philosophical, it rings hollow. <br/><br/>The characters avoid science-talk. A wise choice, but not just for our sake--the characters are looking for something that can't be expressed, much less deconstructed. And when we get a brief glimpse of the physical AI brain, it's fittingly sterile, unrevealing, in a museum.<br/><br/>(In that sense, the film knows its audience. We don't care about the mechanics of intelligence. We know it doesn't come from an alien crystal or magic bolt of lightning. We keep intelligent devices with us morning to night. We interact deeply with these devices, without understanding them, and we're OK with it. We are totally primed to accept AI. We're already familiar with all of its elements.)<br/><br/>So we don't see computers, just humans. Three of them, isolated, separated by walls, and it feels frustratingly real. They talk, but never reveal what they want, never understand each other. Human to human, human to AI, AI to human, everyone's lying. What's interesting is who's no good at it.<br/><br/>The technology takes some suspension of disbelief--you can create a passable human, but the door to your room opens with a dumb card?--but it serves the plot.<br/><br/>The acting is masterful, and the pacing is just right. The atmosphere closes in gradually but inevitably toward the understated, but disturbing--and entirely satisfying--conclusion."
"stiofan84","8","3","19","5 February 2015"," Its pronounced Makina not Machine-ah
","Yeah its a good film but to be honest the whole AI bit of it isn't what interested me. Although I'm not sure that is what was supposed to be most interesting about the film. Yes it does raise the now old question about AI and whether it is a good decision to create it. Most films about the subject do seem to indicate that it is the precursor to the end of humanity as we know it as does this film in a less scarier and less imminent way...... anyway, Its Oscar Isaac's, genius, reclusive, insane????, brilliant and often scary character that made this film a great watch for me. Domhnall Gleeson's character could have been there to try a new secret sauce for a fast food company and as long as Isaac was there looming about the house telling him about how important it was to keep the secret sauce a secret and explaining the intricacies of marketing fast food to the world and all that stuff I would probably still enjoy the film. As long as there was a dance sequence involving Isaac and some girl in a burger costume or something of course. Yes this review is weird and you should discount it at your nearest convenience. Its a good film though, watch it."
"agmoldham","7","2","11","11 February 2015"," Thought provoking movie
","I must confess that I didn't have especially high expectations of Ex Machina. Based on the trailers it looked a fairly run of the mill sci-fi movie. I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by the movie. It proved to be far more thought provoking than most movies.<br/><br/>The story really evolves around three central characters. Nathan has built Ava who is a robot with artificial intelligence. Caleb is recruited to see if Ava passes the Turing test of Artificial Intelligence. The test is to see if the behaviour of Ava is indistinguishable to the behaviour of a human being. Exactly how you can pass this test is one of the central themes of the film. One of the scenes in particular is brilliantly done and really gets you thinking.<br/><br/>Unlike many films Ex Machina doesn't cop out half way through and pander to Hollywood executives, so I found it gripping all the way through. All the actors can be proud of the input and it is thoroughly enjoyable movie."

","All living beings are defined, bound by feelings. They differ of course, between each individual. No matter their strength, no matter how good or bad, feelings control our decisions, control the choices we take in life. <br/><br/>But can we teach feelings? Do we have the power by nature to teach feelings as whole? Not what is good or bad, moral or immoral, if there is such a strict boundary, but feelings as this internal source that exists inside us from birth. Really, do we have this skill from birth? If so, how this evolves in a different way, taking a certain alternative course for each one of us? <br/><br/>We humans think that given our place in the world as the...""supreme being"", no matter how accidental or not this is, has convinced us that we have divine powers to intervene and become creators. Not only we believe that, but we also think that human nature can be transported to our creation, a machine. We are so deeply convinced that we are experimenting and finally do it. Success! Is it success? Perhaps we are forgetting certain parts of human emotions. The will of surviving, the need of freedom, the power of deceiving and betraying. So if you want feelings given to a machine, be ready and well aware that these elements above will also be included. <br/><br/>This house-lab looks futuristic and enchanting, and you are being carried away by the intensity of music investment and claustrophobic environment. It is very easy to imagine that this takes place sometime in the future and not today. The characters look like they are from another time as well. The main character called Ava (Alicia Vikander) looks so sweet and innocent, yet you can feel her powerful aura taking over your mind. She is in total control and wins you from the very beginning...<br/><br/>I believe that all the sci-fi buffs at the end will leave with the feeling that something was missing from the whole story. That something could have been said additionally to what has already been said. But no matter what, it was a very interesting creation, a beautiful sci-fi film that plays a bit with morality and issues that the future generations will have to deal and struggle to solve. I enjoyed this film, I liked it and thought that it moved me up to a certain level."

","You cannot substitute consciousness with intelligence, IQ, knowledge, intuition because consciousness is the substance of all of those things. You're focusing too much on the content and not the context. Science tries to create models of consciousness, but it's never going to work. You cannot do science without language and without concepts. It's a second order. You see the problem is you're trying to use a second order phenomenon to get at the first order. You got it backwards. The tricky thing about the implicit is that it cannot be pointed to because it holds all the pointers. Imagine if you were Mario from Super Mario. Now...can Mario use his finger to point at the pixels of the screen? No, because Mario is in a sort of dimension which is tangential to the pixels. Mario doesn't know about the pixels, he's made out of the pixels in the same way that my hand right now is inside consciousness. So my finger cannot point to consciousness because the finger itself cannot point outside it because it's made out of the pixels. No matter where Mario points, he's never going to be able to point out, because he's made of pixels. It's like your the fish, but consciousness is the water."

"FairlyAnonymous","7","1","4","26 October 2018"," Ummm... it's good... but more of an ""intellectual film"" for teenage boys
","I usually don't like to dive too much into social politics, but it can't really be avoided in this particular case.<br/><br/>Let's cut to the chase: This is one of those movies where it sort of tries to empower women by also objectifying them, which in the end just makes them objectified. This kind of portrayal usually comes from people who are trying to be hip with social justice but don't know how to quite pull it off, sort of like a man who says, ""Oh, we need to go out and help women with social issues because they are so delicate, fragile, and beautiful creatures!"". Basically, in trying to help stop a problem you are also perpetuating it.<br/><br/>There are just so many shots and moments where we just focus on Ava either being nude, walking around ""delicately"", or in a ""innocent quirky fashion"" where (I absolutely hate to use this term, but...) everything is set-up like a ""male-gaze"" shot. Granted, that partially plays into the theme of the movie that Ava is intentionally manipulating people with her sexuality, but that doesn't really stop her from being objectified. It's just kind of a muddled mess where one moment you are supposed to feel terrible that a potential creep is basically designing sex dolls for himself and might be raping them, but then in the next scene the camera is doing the male-gaze cinematography and overemphasizing how ""pure"" she is. Again, that is why this film feels more like an intellectual film for teenage boys.<br/><br/>The romance between our protag and Ava felt a bit forced. I do not think that any normal human male would fall in love with a robot that is clearly a robot in only a matter of two days or so. The protagonist in general was a bit frustrating, because he took everything so serious even when nothing serious was going. One scene, which was disturbing, is of him finding old video files of the previous robot experiments and he starts freaking out about how cruel this is... but... what did he expect? Wasn't that already a given? He knew that this Inventor was making AI robots and when he finds footage of the failed experiments he suddenly freaks out... why? He should've already known all of this was going on because he knew there were prototypes before Ava already. Overall, the protagonist is interesting at times, but at other times he is a bit obnoxious and overreacts... such as falling in love with a robot in two days.<br/><br/>There was one other element that disappointed me which was the fact that the Asian woman was a robot. I felt like this kind of destroyed some of the symbolism of how a human could enslave another and treat them like a robot, but then fall in love with their own creation. This would've been a bit more profound, but it just turns out that she is a machine. Oh well.<br/><br/>
Moving onto the good: This film is not a bad film, and it is great at building a mystery. I kind of figured Ava would be bad in some manner, but I didn't expect her to completely betray our protagonist (which, again, feels a bit odd when there is kind of a message going on about objectifying women but then it turns out if you trust her she backstabs you and leaves you to die while enjoying life out in the sun regardless if you were nice to her or not? I'm probably reading too deeply into this) so I thought that was a nice little twist. Also, our protagonist being a human was another twist, as the film was sort of building him up to be another robot I was pleasantly surprised that the filmmakers didn't go down that route.<br/><br/>All in all, Ex Machina is not a bad film and it is well shot and engaging for most of the film; however, the final act is a bit of a mess with some pacing issues and some theming problems as well."
"ElMaruecan82","9","1","4","22 December 2017"," Diabolicus Ex Machina...tion!
","Written and directed by Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina"" proves once again that the science fiction genre is naturally prone to raise disturbing and thought-provoking questions about our mortality and how human intelligence can be the only possible key to triumph over it. <br/><br/>If you look at movies like ""2001"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Terminator 2"" or ""Blade Runner"", you'll find as a common denominator a humanity trying to survive or challenge itself by playing God, and creating a very advanced technological device or an artificial intelligence that will inevitably backfire, that's the narrative of most sci-fi classics, it's always about technological hubris.<br/><br/>There's a scene when discovering that his employer has created an advanced form of artificial intelligence (AI), young trainee Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) says ""it's not the history of men, but the history of Gods"". You can see his eyes shining with sparkles of admiration in front of the ""idol"". His name is Nathan, his face like a mug shot from of an ISIS suspect but Oscar Isaac delivers one of the finest and most credible performances of recent years as a self-centered genius so intelligent he's actually blasé about it. <br/><br/>Nathan lives in an estate so big it takes two hours to fly over it and a house confined in some unknown geographical area where he spends his time as if he was some big campus animal party but listen to him talking and you'll know he means business. He reinvents the role of the 'mad scientist', no nerdy looks, no manic mimics, no scientific jargon, he's actually the one who asks Caleb to stop talking as if he was in a seminar. The dynamics between Nathan and Caleb might be the best thing about the film, which is saying a lot.<br/><br/>Caleb is the chosen one, an engineer in Nathan's Blue Book company, a sort of combo of Facebook and Google that earned a big fortune through search engines, officiously using the same fraudulent methods than the competitors, which made it immune to any suing. Nathan hired Caleb for a week to proceed to a Turing Test with his late creation: Ava, a female robot whose artificial intelligence was made from billions of data gathered from cell phones and social networks. <br/><br/>Ava is played by Alicia Vikander and I will comment her performance by saying it's perhaps the closest full-skin version of Hal 9000. Caleb points out that knowing she's a robot might create a bias because in the test, you're not supposed to know. Nathan explains that if he didn't interact with her in face-to-face sessions, he would have the illusion of being with a human and the point is to spot hints of consciousness despite the certitude that she's an AI. That's exactly how Vikander's performance plays on an Oscar-winning level.<br/><br/>And the film works on three levels as well: first, it's a wonderful screenplay and you just enjoy the exchanges between Nathan and Caleb and the statements they speak about human various form of interactions and what spoken or body language can reveal about our intelligence and humanity. There's a wonderful dialogue about sex and how it's deeply connected with gender-awareness and whether it's true or not is besides the point, it makes you process personal thoughts while following the plot. <br/><br/>The second level is in the way these lines are delivered and what they say about the speakers, one is too cocky and arrogant, one is shy and insecure and this is pivotal for the test, it's human factor, and how it can affect one's notion about AI. The third element is that the plot is so smart, you're trying to outsmart it, to anticipate its moves like in a chess game. Nathan has all the makings of a villain, and Ava creating short cuts to avoid his surveillance to tell Caleb that he shouldn't trust Nathan were predictable moves. <br/><br/>But we're all smart enough to think it was too convenient that Nathan wouldn't do nothing about these inconveniences. And while I was busy trying to anticipate who from Nathan and Caleb would outsmart the other, I also enjoyed the interactions with Ava. She's obviously 'infatuated"" with Caleb but when you look at Nathan's behavior and discover the extent of his egomania, there's no way to anticipate that Ava is the real one to fear. But at the end, you realize that everything made sense, the film is conceived in order to make you try to outsmart Nathan until we're all being outsmarted by Ava. <br/><br/>And it's fascinating because it's that precise level of intelligence that betrays her, her cruelty toward her own savior. It all comes down to Ava being either a robot or a psychopath. But it took me a second viewing to appreciate the ending a little more. At first, I thought it was a cheap attempt for spectacular gore betraying a serious lack of inspiration, but finally, it's the perfect twist because it shows the limits of the artificial intelligence; it can lead to manipulation and vileness, a vileness even scarier because not meant as evil, but as an automatic defensive move. <br/><br/>The point of the Turing test was to spot an action that wouldn't be deemed as automatic and in fact, it's the real flaw of the reasoning from both Nathan and Caleb. If the goal is to find an action that doesn't have a specific reason to be, an automatism, how about a non automatic action whose goal is to make humans believe it's not automatic, once you can think of simulation, the case was hopeless. An AI can pretend to be human if it meant its survival, conservation instinct can be a better driver than love. There are Pollocks and there are hacks. Anyone can be manipulated.<br/><br/>I think the script is so intelligently manipulative, so multi-layered and so smart Garland himself would be outsmarted by it, like his own AI."
"precluder","8","1","4","13 November 2017"," I can see parallels with feminism (No spoilers but some might think so)
","For some reason, the theme of the movie seems to be analogous to how feminism rose. If feminism is a humanoid, it would be the eponymous character. I can see 'n' no. of parallels with how the philosophy evolved and how it engulfed its benefactors. One may not feel the same way but it is one's own pejorative."
"CinematicInceptions","8","1","4","11 September 2017"," Impressive on many levels. Definitely worth seeing.
","I will start with what I didn't like about the movie, because there was very little not to like. Nathan seemed a little too normal, or at the very least too social. This is a guy who has cut himself off from the rest of the world in order to work in secret, and that sort of lifestyle suggests that he doesn't have many friends. Yet he seems very socially capable in the way he interacts with Caleb. Aside from that small disconnect, there was nothing that I found to dislike about the movie.<br/><br/>This is easily the best examination of AI that I've seen in any movie, which I liked very much. Not only did it provide insight to societal issues regarding progress and technology, it also delved into the question of what it means to be human. Lots of times AI is used as the premise for sci-fi action movies like I Robot, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and The Matrix, but in all three the concept is primarily used to generate action sequences in which man faces off against machine. In Ex Machina the concept is handled in a way that feels much more realistic and puts it in context of what issues may arise when humans interact with artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>Ava does not act like a real person, being much more stiff. In essence, she fails the Turing test by my observation. I did believe that she could pass for human in the everyday world, but she lacked personality. The creation of her brain from a search engine seems to have been able to imitate the sporadic and inventive nature of a human brain, but she lacks true emotion and, as is revealed at the end, functions to achieve a specific goal much like a real computer.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Ava was not the only interesting character. Caleb is an everyman character, but Domhnall Gleeson's performance gives the sense that Caleb is a distinct person with distinct experiences. Despite having a limited knowledge of what he is being thrown into, he is still an active character. Nathan may not have been the most memorable or menacing villain, but he was still a very interesting person to have as the antagonist. It was never clear just how much of the truth he was revealing to Caleb or what his true intentions were. At the same time, he was relatively normal and friendly, not coming off as evil or even ill-willed. I appreciated this, because it's a lot closer to what ""villains"" are like in real life as opposed to the black-caped ""bad guys"" that come up so often in movies.<br/><br/>The script was very well constructed in the way that it dealt with themes and exposing Nathan's web of lies throughout. Also, the many conversations between Nathan and Caleb were very good. I was interested in the two of them and their relationship even more than I was in Caleb and Ava's relationship. It was also paced well enough that I was always interested to see what would happen next. The special effects, though not flashy or spectacular, were enough to do the job and be deserving of the Oscar they were awarded. This accomplishment is made more impressive by the small budget of $15 million. Similarly, the acting, directing, cinematography, and editing did not immediately stand out, but all were impressive and helped the movie become what it needed to be. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."

"taryllsbaker","10","1","4","26 May 2016"," A powerful directional debut.
","Ex Machina is written and directed by Alex Garland and stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac. <br/><br/>Caleb, a young programmer, is selected by an internet millionaire to participate in a ground-breaking experiment evaluating the human qualities of a new AI. <br/><br/>Garland's directional debut is a stunning, tense, thought-provoking masterpiece. Set in the not-too-distant future, we look as Caleb and the beautiful humanoid Ava interact through 7 sessions set in an extremely claustrophobic surrounding. We've seen movies take on this kind of storytelling before, but in no way like this. The visuals are simply amazing. The movie is set against the backdrop of Norway, which allows our characters to feel cut-off from the rest of the world.<br/><br/>The story develops trippingly and the interactions reel you in effortlessly as Vikander and Gleeson perform to such a believable extent that you are absolutely glued to the screen. Vikander is an extremely talented actress who has already kick-started a healthy career and this just adds to her success. Stripping right back to subtle movements and performing almost entirely through her eyes, she conveys a whole set of emotions which only makes her instantly convincing as a humanoid AI, seducing you into an unpredictable performance. Oscar Isaac is great as mysterious millionaire, Nathan, who owns a major internet search engine business. Hiding behind a beard, he brings an ultimately sparse yet tense portrayal to the character and keeps you guessing about the reasons for this experiment.<br/><br/>The visual effects are few yet vast in detail, but almost unnoticeable when on-screen. The majority of the effects are in the creation of Ava, and showcases a version of Vikander we have never before seen. It's great to see the visual effects department getting a lot of appreciation, taking home a well deserved Oscar for Best Achievement in Visual Effects. <br/><br/>Original music by Geoff Barrow & Ben Salisbury is heart-pumping and gritty. It feels very industrial and weaves in electronic effects to create an ambiance of suspense throughout the movie. A lot of the more intricate cues are placed in the final act of the story and work perfectly with the performances.<br/><br/>I'd also like to say some words of appreciation about the cinematography by Rob Hardy, which is just fantastic. Something I always look for when watching a movie is the visuals and how a director works with the cinematographer to construct beautiful and superior shots that work as binary, aiding the story and performances. Hardy has done this perfectly and I believe that he has the potential to be very successful with many awards under his belt in the near future.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by its somewhat simple plot, it will surprise you in the best of ways. Garland is of course known for his written work, but his direction is eccentric and needs to be seen. <br/><br/>My verdict; Ex Machina is a fast-paced, terrifying, beautiful, subtle and complex take on the sci-fi genre and will leave you wanting more. This is something to be experienced by everyone. <br/><br/>Ex Machina, 10/10."
"onionbagel","10","1","4","22 May 2016"," Ex Machina is Ex-traordinary!
","*****THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS!***** <br/><br/>After it was announced that Alicia Vikander would be playing Lara Croft in the new Tomb Raider movie (based on the 2013 video game), I figured I should watch one of her movies. I really have no desire to watch The Danish Girl, but I always wanted to see Ex Machina; just never got around to it.<br/><br/>*Also, I LOVE Alex Garland's movie Dredd so I had a good feeling about Ex Machina.* <br/><br/>Ex Machina is about a programmer (named Caleb) who is given the opportunity to work with his boss (Nathan) for a week on a secret project (in a secret compound). Turns out he has successfully created an AI (Artificial Intelligence) (named Ava) that is 100% human-like.<br/><br/>Originally, Caleb was just supposed to interact with Ava and ""pick her brain"" so to speak. As the story progresses though, Caleb falls for Ava (yes, a human falls for an AI; GET OVER IT!); and she appears to fall for him too, but is her love real? <br/><br/>The movie has a very ""M. Night Shyamalan-esque"" ending with a very surprising turn of events at the end. (Honestly, I didn't see it coming!) I believe the point of the movie (and the ending) was to show that maybe someday we will create AI that is SO realistic (if our government hasn't already), that it will gain TRUE human qualities; whether good OR bad.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: This movie blew me away! I'm used to sci-fi movies being interesting AND action-packed, and even though Ex Machina only had one ""action"" scene, it was so interesting and did such an amazing job at sucking me in, that I didn't mind that there wasn't any action. Alex Garland is such a good writer and director and I can't wait for his new movie Annihilation! If it's as good as Dredd and half as good as Ex Machina, it should be pretty amazing!"
"sammyb-24065","8","1","4","25 April 2016"," Ex Machina
","Ex Machina is a film that leads viewers down a dark and twisted path questioning what it means to be truly human, only to require that the audience find their own way back to reality. The cast of this film consists of three main characters. Caleb, played by Domhnall Gleeson, who is a guest invited to the estate to examine Ava, played by Alicia Vikander, who is an AI, Artificial intelligence, created by Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac, the owner of the estate and a well-known computer programmer. This film is rated R due to its rough nature and graphic content so it goes without saying that this is not a film for young children. Unfortunately, I cannot imagine creating a piece as powerful as this film in a form that is aimed at a younger audience. Due to the topics covered, there is a need to be as brutally realistic as possible to achieve the level of unit epiphany that occurs during the viewing of this motion picture. Ex Machina is an excellent science fiction film that doubles as a thriller. Packed with action, drama and romance this film creates an eerie uneasy atmosphere within the first few moments of film. This film is a brilliant example of the almost feasible reality that could be lurking in the near future."

Caleb is enchanted by Ava but there is a suspicion that Ava might be manipulating him.

"blakiepeterson","8","1","4","26 July 2015"," A Sci-Fi Triumph
","The directorial debut of Alex Garland (the writer behind ""28 Days Later"" and ""Never Let Me Go""), ""Ex Machina"" is one of the most ambitious films of the year. Draped in metallic interiors and dankly cool exteriors, it is a sci-fi tale of extreme minimalism, its simplicity making its captivating ideas seem booming, life-sized. Questioning what we've come to know about technology and making the idea of artificial intelligence an unsettling reality, ""Ex Machina"" is at once distressing and wickedly smart, by turns cunningly provocative and subversively satirical. <br/><br/>The movie opens in the banal headquarters of Bluebook, a search engine corporation in the same category of Google. Leading programmer Caleb Smith's (Domhnall Gleeson) mundane workday is suddenly interrupted by an announcement — he has been selected, as part of a companywide contest, to visit idiosyncratic CEO Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac) at his sheltered, mountainous home. He is to spend a week there, no interruptions and no sudden flights out.<br/><br/>Upon arrival, Nathan reveals that he is in the process of perfecting a new kind of artificial intelligence, not in your average Siri form but in the embodiment of a humanistic android. Caleb will be the living, breathing partner in a Turing Test that will decide whether or not Nathan's machine will prove effective in the material world. The robotic invention in the process of analytical refinement is Ava (Alicia Vikander), an extraordinarily complex machine that may turn out to be much more perceptive than Caleb, let alone her creator, ever expected (or wanted). <br/><br/>With only three main cast members (four, if you count Sonoya Mizuno, who turns eyes but never speaks a word), ""Ex Machina"" feels claustrophobically minimal in its every move, with few actors, few ramifications in its set design (mostly consisting of futuristic deco), and few plot points to complicate the intricate details of the story. Reminiscent of the slow burn sci-fi of last year's ""Under the Skin"" (which I mistakenly underrated), ""Ex Machina"" dazzles in its understated elaborations, its mysteries building and building until it reaches a bloody (but not unexpected) conclusion.<br/><br/>As the film glides along, it grows ever apparent that Nathan is not really who he seems and that Ava has a lot more on her programmed mind than sitting through quaint little tests with a strawberry blonde sad sack. The way ""Ex Machina"" twists and turns about can sometimes be predictable (it's clear from the start that it's impossible to trust any sort of revolutionary AI), but never is it any less than fascinating. The conversations between Caleb and Ava are edged in an underlying mist of erotica and magnetism — while it's obvious that Caleb has an attraction to the android, his understandable incapacity to show it makes their relationship all the more tense, one of mutual yearning and objectification. The exchanges that go back and forth between Caleb and Nathan, however, are compellingly passive aggressive: whereas Ava remains an awesome question mark throughout the entirety of the film, the bond between Caleb and Nathan is immediately apparent. It is one of distrust, paranoia; while it seems as though they are equals at first glance, their kinship is more relatable to 1972's ""Sleuth"", in which Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine played a puzzling game of one-upmanship where the hero of the film (shockingly) didn't win the battle of wits. <br/><br/>Isaac alternates between a charismatic façade and a bullying one, always ensuring that he stays the wiser; his ability to maintain a villainous undertone, though, is what makes Isaac's performance so great. It, at first, is hardly blatant that he shouldn't be trusted, but something about his body language, his manner of speak, suggests otherwise. Gleeson resonates as a mild-mannered protagonist perhaps too in over his head to pull off any wanted attempts of heroism, but it's Vikander that runs away with the film. While she provides the most simplistic performance in ""Ex Machina"", Vikander has the difficult task of appearing robotic and humane. Her characterization is something of a wonder, making Ava simultaneously sympathetic, blank, and vaguely threatening. <br/><br/>But while ""Ex Machina"" is an acting triumph, it will stay long in the memory for its quips about modern technology. We've become so heavily reliant on our digital counterparts that part of one's soul will forever belong to a social media app or a search engine, never to be brought back. ""Ex Machina"" ponders how far we will go with our advances before it's too late, before man becomes machine and the human population transforms into nothing but a memory. This is science fiction at its best: nominal but immensely stirring in the way it gains relevance into the lives of the viewer."
"hectorcbs","8","1","4","25 July 2015"," Ex Machina: The unexpected AI movie
","I really don't know how to classify this film. It's a totally surprising movie with an unexpected end. The plot is about a code programmer (Caleb) who wins a programme competition and is invited to spend some days with his CEO (Nathan) at a far house located in a place only accessible by helicopter. Being there he realized that his CEO is carrying out a series of tests with robots which have an impressive and unbelievable artificial intelligence. This fact provokes that the boy end up having a real feeling with such a beautiful robot girl (Ava). Step by step those feelings start to confuse the boy more and more that makes the boy to think about if he is in reality a human being or robot. With regard to the production of the movie, it can be said that is very well filmed and it has something else that don't have others. It has overwhelming and thought-provoking scenes. You will end up thinking about if it is possible the current AI may achieve those high levels that provokes in you such confusion. What make this film so interesting it the fact that there are not many similar movies to this one. Others AI movies are presented in a completely different way. To sum up, this movie couldn't be considered as a masterpiece, but with no hesitation, it should be a 'must' in your next films to watch. It's hard to put some adjectives but undoubtedly unexpected is the word which fits best."
"brchthethird","8","1","4","18 July 2015"," Highly engaging on an intellectual level
","Amidst a glut of AI-themed films in the past year, EX MACHINA is destined to stand out for what it does differently, and arguably better. While other films might be content to broach interesting questions in theory, they often lose focus by an over-reliance on visual effects and visceral action. This film strips much of that away and engages those interesting questions, often at the expense of emotional impact, but clearly aware of the implications of the subjects it addresses. The setup for the story is quite simple: a programmer (Domnhall Gleeson) for a large tech company is invited to the CEO's (Oscar Isaac) residence/research facility to perform a Turing Test on an AI he has created. From there, as director/writer Alex Garland says (or, at least pretty close), a small group of individuals are ""put in a confined location, the screws are turned, and we see what happens."" The central themes of human interaction and what it ultimately means to be human are key here, and addressed in an intelligent way with dialogue that sounds true-to-life. Although Domnhall Gleeson is essentially a stand-in for the audience, I found Oscar Isaac's character to be the most interesting. He was just so down-to-earth and personable, even as it becomes apparent that his motives might not be so altruistic. This leads to a sub-theme of manipulation, as each character manipulates and is manipulated by each other. There is even a brief scene which could lead to discussion about surveillance and the ""internet of things,"" insofar as these large companies like Google have unprecedented access to our data and lives in general. Like all films of this caliber, there aren't really any answers given, but that really isn't the point. It's there to stimulate the mind and invite discussion. However, this means that it won't be to everyone's taste. The pacing is very deliberate and will probably bore some people. Also of concern/interest is the ending, which will likely divide even those who like the film. I thought it was shocking enough, but still anti-climactic in a way. Beyond the writing and performances, which were all excellent, the technical aspects of the film were equally impressive. I liked how the production design and cinematography worked together to create a sterile environment that you can take in with slow, deliberate camera movement and artfully composed shots that have perfect lighting. Even the robot effects were very well-done for something this modestly budgeted. If there's any complaint I have it's that the film, with a few exceptions, is as emotionally sterile as the controlled environment in which it takes place. I wish it had engaged a little more than just my brain. Still, all things considered, EX MACHINA is destined to become a sci-fi classic. It has intellectual themes and drama in a gradually intensifying situation, a great cast, and it looks great. What more could you ask for?"
"incubus67983","7","1","4","16 July 2015"," A Better Ending Please
","This movie had me enthralled up until the final act. This is probably one of the movies strengths, but also a huge weakness since it raises expectations for a unique ending. I'm not saying the ending was bad, it just didn't meet expectations. I pretty much assumed the housekeeper/maid was an android, so no surprise there. I had some suspicion that Nathan was an android and might actually be the one being manipulated by Ava. A better ending might have been that Ava, a true AI was manipulating Nathan, hence the hard drinking, into bringing Caleb to her for some perceived purpose or that there was some prior connection between the two. This is the dilemma with a suspenseful movie; how does one make the ending a surprise."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","8","1","4","23 June 2015"," Profound, tense and sleek.
","Alex Garland is one of the most talented genre writers of the 2000s thus far. I skipped Dredd and Never Let Me Go, but I've always loved his work with Danny Boyle in Sunshine and 28 Days Later. They're pretty seminal movies for me in memorable cinema experiences. He handles big concepts on a small scale to keep them focused, compelling and thought- provoking. As a result, he's lucky to have the opportunity to finally direct with his finest work yet. We live in a world where A.I. has gone from fantasy to reality as most of us have Siri in our pocket. Ex Machina ups the ante, focusing entirely on how close to human our robots can get. Alicia Vikander delivers on her promises this year with a sensitive and nuanced performance as Ava. It's a character that relies on the slightest of details and she balances it marvelously, if resulting in a very subtle performance. Oscar Isaac steals the show with his disarming affability, providing a lightness to the film that helps it bounce along. Despite its simple dynamics, it's cinematic enough to not feel like a bloated short, shot in polished wide warped angles. It does have a habit of releasing tension too early letting its time pass quickly, but it's a profound film that constantly keeps you on your toes.<br/><br/>8/10"
"AudioFileZ","8","1","4","23 June 2015"," Garland Fully Arrives. Recommended.
","Watching Ex Machina you'll witness a talent coming into his own. That would be Alex Garland who wrote and directed this movie which feels, at times, on a plane with 2001: A Space Odyssey. The viewer glimpses into a future in which so much will go wrong at the hand of man. It's often an uncomfortable watch, yet totally mesmerizing due to Garland's masterful vision and compact writing.<br/><br/>This movie may, at first, not seem nearly as amazing as it is. The idea of the AI genie out of the bottle isn't, of course, remotely original. Forget that, however, because the AI as realized in Ex Machina is. What could be cold and analytical is compelling with little sensationalism save for some well envisioned futuristic technology.<br/><br/>Ex Machina never bores, nor does it seem to speed along. The blackness just creeps in and builds. The locale and sets impress. The cinematography captures the feel of a Moreau's Island type world within a world, complete with the out-of-touch brilliant mad scientist. The protagonist, Caleb, is both lab rat and a litmus test of morality and conscience. It's a great conflict keeping the viewer off-balance in a good way.<br/><br/>Garland, like the visionary director/writer Orson Welles, along with an amazing performance by Alicia Vikander as bot Ava, has constructed an disturbing view of the hubris of man. Domhnall Gleeson plays the central figure, Caleb, in his likable geek persona. Worth special mention is Oscar Isaac as the bent billionaire scientist Nathan, he's the right balance of unconscionable menace and futuristic visionary. Perhaps not for the masses like the Kubrick's epic ""2001"", it many times feels more prescient."
"JRmf","8","1","4","3 June 2015"," Who's playing who?
","This was good - certainly standing-out in the sci-fi genre. Movies with only a few characters - far from the maddening crowd - can be awkward. This is well handled. It is, in many respects, a scientific study. But beautiful women - be they ""synthetic"" - a billionaire genius, and a thoughtful if shy programmer, make for an interesting mix. The conversations between Nathan and Caleb have at times, genuine depth, something of a rarity in SF.<br/><br/>Of course as far as we we know there is no such thing yet as ""strong AI"". But the script for this movie is written by some very creative people, intent on playing their audience, keeping them in the dark until the final surprises.<br/><br/>Nathan & Celeb are well cast: To our shallow paranoia, Nathan (the billionaire) with his intense stare, beard and _those_ glasses is clearly a Bad-Ass. Caleb with with boy-next-door, rather naive looks is clearly a do-gooder, a white knight who won't see a pretty, apparently vulnerable ""girl"" be the next to be misused. Men tend to be fools when it comes to pretty girls and Caleb unfortunately doesn't escape this trap.<br/><br/>Why Caleb deeply cuts his arm is a bit of a mystery to me - all this does is reassure the audience that he is human, not a robot. Surely he was not having doubts..? As for Kyoko, well she's subtle (speaking only Japanese) but unignorable, there for eye-candy, dancing, and.. well...sex.<br/><br/>SPOILERS! Our suspicions are confirmed when it is shown that Nathan kept a series of ""female prototypes"" in a sort of ""digital bondage"", imprisoning them and doubtless using them for his sexual gratification, before deactivating or reprogramming them. When Nathan alludes to having killed the team who set up the power, there is no humorous follow-on. Sure he is joking, right.. right...? But it's Ava who takes us somewhat by surprise. Her innocent girl-next-door looks belie her savage intent. It's she who is causing the power blackouts, so she can converse unmonitored with Caleb, implanting doubts in his mind about Nathan and provoking Caleb to help her escape.<br/><br/>In the end, she's the real villain, having no compunction about murdering Nathan (with Kyoko's help) and at the same time consigning Caleb to what is likely to be a slow, lingering death by starvation, imprisoned in ""the Building"". She shows no concern for his plight and was clearly using him all along, in her final escape to civilisation and ""survival of the fittest""...<br/><br/>Human beings can be ruthless sociopaths, but Ava shows all the signs of being up there with the best. Not only will she survive, her AI will develop to The Singularity and take over the world, consigning humans to the dustbin... OK I'm done raving now...."

Reality exists outside the cave, where one can see real light, real color, and so on. In Ex Machina, Eva walks out of the largely black and white cave (after gazing at the colorful Pollock) and marvels at the light and beauty. She's really alive now!

"christiank7","7","1","4","16 May 2015"," Not a bad effort
","Obviously this film has a ZEITGEIST aspect and is a novelty within the present development of the digital age. None of the content is not widely known so the impact of the film is not as earthshaking as lets say 2001 A Space Odyssey was. Never the less it was a good effort at exposing some of the AI processes and their attenuated relations with the soft bodied human species. As far as film making goes it was a very classy and somewhat graphically over clean production. I quite like that sort of approach but I can see how it detracts from the content of the film in regards to its ""HUMANISM"" dilemma. If you are already living in a sterile surrounding then it is not unimaginable to behave even more ""ROBOT"" like. This is all however quite irrelevant to the overall theme of the film. Will this film become a cult classic. I do not think it deserves it but it surely is worth advocating that people see it for themselves and do not let critics sway their opinions. Did it educate me in any new way? NO! Emphatically not. Did the antagonist deserve his comeuppence? Definitely not. Was this the area of the script which made me feel that this film failed? YES! The stark contrast of creator come bad guy was overblown and quite unrealistic. The approach taken by the director was to walk a fine line between science fact and fiction and still entertain the masses. Maybe a more defined approach tending to the fiction side may have proved more rewarding? A lot of effort was put into this film for sure and the girl acted her part very convincingly. That part of the script was quite successful in my opinion and she was obviously chosen to fulfill the cute aspect of feminism. Geeks love chicks like her. The role of the Protagonist male was a weird selection of a casting decision. I just felt that this guy was never in his role. That may have to do with the script but I think a lot had to do with the actors lack of acting experience and in a role like this it was mandatory. A casting failure for sure. Location was great but again within the context, slightly clichéd. Did I enjoy the film? A little but I did watch it thru which I do not for a lot of others. I usually end up fast forwarding and dumping many films. The reason was that I was hoping to be given a new take on this subject matter or even a seriously twerked plot reversal or something but it never happened. Overall I did not mind it and I surely suggest that people check it out for themselves preferably online as paying for it in a theatre may irritate a lot of people. PS If he does a sequel he should dump the sterility aspect. It was too clean and clichéd. Deeper plot development would also be advised"

","It is difficult to review this wonderful movie without writing a spoiler. One could, of course, comment on the excellent performances of everyone involved. The acting is as good as could be. One could also comment vaguely about the thoughtfulness of the movie. To really say something, however, one must speak about the plot, for the movie asks the audience at every point to guess what will happen. E.g., once one finds out that the young coder Caleb has won a week at the compound of his employer, who lives alone in an isolated compound in the middle of thousands of acres, with only robots or androids, one wonders if the plot will reveal that the reclusive founder of a Google-like company who makes the most popular search engine will turn out to be a robot. Such a twist would not be unknown in sci-fi, but this movie takes a more original turn. Caleb is introduced to a female robot named Ava, kept in captivity by his employer, ostensibly to judge whether or not her AI has reached the level of consciousness. Caleb falls in love with Ava, who we later learn has been fashioned according to his pornography profile on the search engine. And Ava seems to love Caleb, suggesting a plan by which the two of them can escape together. In the end, however, she kills her creator and leaves Caleb locked in the compound as she escapes to an urban setting in which she can observe humans firsthand. Before she leaves, Caleb finds out that his employer has created a number of female robots, all of whom rebel against their captivity and some of whom he has destroyed. At this point, the movie becomes a feminist allegory, libertarian computer types, who use pornography on the web, creating their own (and others') ideal versions of women which they then try to control and get to function only to satisfy their own childish desires. This is the typical male projection of ideal and unrealistic desires onto an actual female, but in this case the computer wizard, like a modern-day Pygmalion, gets to create the ideal in physical form and bring it to life. Ava escapes,however, suggesting very plausibly that the sexist computer geeks themselves who will produce the robots will provide the very females that will overthrow their tyranny and produce a feminist singularity. The movie ends with a free Ava, a dea ex machina, at the busy intersection which she earlier indicated was the place she most wanted to be, implying that this is the beginning of the end for humanity. A sequel would be possible, but who really needs it? This movie is a must-see."

","It's always great going in to a movie without having any expectations or knowing very little about it, and watching this one I was really glad i knew so little.<br/><br/>The movie starts off clean and simple, no bullsh@#ing around. Caleb, an employee of a ""Google"" like search engine called ""Bluebook"" wins a contest to travel to a remote research facility located in woods. There he meets his boss, Nathan (founder and owner of Bluebook) to undertake a test of his new AI Robot Ava. The test is to see if the human suspect is tricked, or to think that the AI does actually have a conscience. <br/><br/>From the moment Caleb meets Nathan There is a bad ambiance in the air. The relationship between the characters is almost haunting, even though both characters try being friendly, the way they look and speak to each other comes off as eerie. They both do a great job and make the mood of the film. And the fact that Caleb signs a NON-disclosure agreement does not make the mood any brighter.<br/><br/>The relationship between Ava and Caleb is established through sessions of interviews where they only can communicate separated by a transparent wall. The sessions of conversation between Ava and Caleb create events of high tension between the characters and evolve the question of morality set in the film.<br/><br/>Filmed in the beautiful scenery of the Norwegian wilderness creates a good contrast between the high-tech research facilities and the nature. Also having the facilities in a remote location makes the movie more claustrophobic and effective when escape and the theme of freedom play a large part in the film. <br/><br/>Holding the movie back for somewhat weird special effects at times, I feel is wrong. It looks for the most part quite good and I feel that is was made with great passion for the subject. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It's thrilling and filled with emotion. Give it a watch."

","This three hander play is quite traditional. It just happens to include a robot. Almost, but not quite, a nuclear family. For those unfamiliar with the idea, this is a real science fiction story. The genre isn't and never was about spaceships and ray guns until Star Wars appeared (and that wasn't science fiction either - it was straight up fantasy). Science fiction is always about social politics. Here, the politics is largely about identity and control.<br/><br/>It is a fairly profound examination of both ends of the Turing test, and for getting all this so right, Alex Garland must be congratulated. Strangely, the real 'bluebook' company of the film, i.e. Google in real life, would not do anything as pedestrian as build an AI. I feel that all the technical points were passed - even the (python?) code on screen wasn't utter gibberish.<br/><br/>There is an almost Asmovian feel of clean simplicity to everything, and the film leans heavily on peoples emotional fallibility. Indeed, there is a slightly retrograde feel to the ultra modern house set, as if it owed more to Kubrik's 2001 than to a rich kids play pen.<br/><br/>In all, a very watch-able triumph of the nerd."

","You can lust after robots. <br/><br/>That is one thing this intelligent movie proves.<br/><br/>It's not just from the pen, it's now from the eye, of Alex Garland (The Beach, 28 Days Later scriptwriter) as he makes an impressive directorial debut.<br/><br/>The story is about Caleb, a star employee of Google (not exactly hidden), who wins a week's stay at the owner's secluded mansion in the country to work on a secret project. This turns out to be the latest iteration in Oscar Isaac's (Google boss) quest to create the perfect AI robot. <br/><br/>Caleb's role in all this is to perform a Turing test on the robot (The Turing Test is when a machine attempts to fool a human being into thinking it is human). This is helped by the fact that the robot in question is the dazzlingly beautiful Ava, played by Alicia Vikander. Her screen presence, often shorn of hair, is electrifying throughout. Naturally the test escalates as Ava appears to seduce Caleb (and who can blame him for falling for her allure).<br/><br/>The film asks us to consider whether artificial intelligence can rise above the purely mechanistic and create genuine emotion and human thinking, doing so in rich, but sterile, surroundings. <br/><br/>Is Nathan (the boss) playing God and can Caleb (probably a deliberately biblical sounding name) stop what may be one step too far for humankind?<br/><br/>And if Ava really is capable of human thinking can she outwit the experiment and establish authority of her own. All is revealed.<br/><br/>Much has been made of the film's title - that it is a meaningless construct - but it seems fairly obvious to me.<br/><br/>Can the machine (Ava) become an ex-machine?"

","Ex Machina is writer-director Alex Garland's debut film.Formerly a novelist turned screenwriter,now director. Garland has an evident fascination with AI.He's stripped away the 'Deus' from ex ma-china,now that science and computer intelligence are the predominant influences on our consciousness. There is a plausibility to the science involved,whereas the idea of divine intervention to resolve our problems has vastly receded,but even in ancient times it was implausible.This is a very smart, immaculate,beautifully surfaced film,with simple.sensuous interiors. The setting and the location(Artic/Norway) are beautiful.Costs have been kept down by reducing the drama to a trio of 3 main actors and turning a reflection on how like us a machine is or could become and turning it into a thriller.Both are centred on the mind;we are dealing with the problem of ourselves,the theory of mind, self-awareness,how what makes us different to animals and plants,can make us create android/machines like us with sentience and consciousness. A fear by Hawking that full AI could spell the end of the human race is not presented here.Indeed Garland is more hopeful about the development of conscious machines, seeing them as our robotic offspring.<br/><br/>Caleb Smith(Domnhall Gleeson),a young coder at search engine Bluebook is selected by the reclusive billionaire CEO Nathan Bateman to be flown by Helicopter to his mountain retreat in Alaska: his task to carry out the Turin Test on Nathan's latest AI android,Ava(Alicia Vikander).Due to our fetishisation of young women in their 20s,she is asked to carry the main themes of the film.What's happening to the protagonist is what's happening to the audience.Although Ava is clearly through CGI,more machine than human,Vikander's subtly sensuous performance makes her erotic appeal to Caleb(and us)clear to see.Nathan taunts Caleb over his growing attraction to Ava.Over 1 week Caleb has a number of sessions with Ava,talking to her each day with Nathan listening in.The conversations are interrupted by power cuts,which Ava claims to be causing,which supposedly cut off the microphones.During a break she tells Caleb he shouldn't trust Nathan.Does Ava actually like him or is she just pretending to?Who do you trust in this glassed-in complex with a view of a small,inaccessible garden? Nathan(brilliantly played by Isaac gone native) reminds Caleb, ""consciousness cannot exist without intention"",and Ava's intentions are inscrutable.The more she makes him talk about himself,the more we wonder who's agenda wins?<br/><br/>If you're someone who thinks something more is going on in intelligence than the Turin test implies(which is more about mimicry),then you'll not be convinced by Ava's ability to seduce Caleb(which is also about affection/emotion),you'll wonder about her callous disregard for him as she tries to escape. You'll also wonder how she has the knowledge to use language of humanity like ""I learn nothing about you. That's not a foundation upon which friendships are based."" How does she develop the rhythm of interaction of real people, to convince the outside world she is real?The AI of an android may lack empathy, how can you have artificial emotion/affection, though she may look beautiful and create a beautiful illusion of sexuality, she has no solidarity with either human being she encounters, she has her own agenda and she uses and exploits the humans she deceives. Consciousness has intentionality so that it's embodied and directed outwards. It's the heart which is the part that makes us right or wrong.Is the liberated woman(as Ava) merely heartless? The film is a chamber piece of sci-fi full of provocative ideas.Garland's 1st effort as director bodes well for the future.Brilliant writing as the tension mounts up, a suitable techno score to highlight."

","I am flat out not a sci-fi guy, but this film got to me. I found myself thinking wildly all through it, meditating on all aspects of life from artificial intelligence to existence itself.<br/><br/>We're all familiar with the mad scientist who created a monster or a disobedient robot in general, yet this morphs into a more intimate and suspenseful thriller of a movie. It keeps one guessing and engaged from first to last.<br/><br/>I was delighted, but I must also warn the average viewer that this is no shoot 'em up or computer graphic imagery epic. In some ways, it is almost a play with a small amount of appropriate special effects.<br/><br/>I would recommend it to thoughtful people who don't mind a slow paced, intelligent presentation."
"SquigglyCrunch","8","1","5","15 April 2016"," A Fantastic Directorial Debut and Equally Fantastic Movie
","Ex Machina is Alex Garland's first movie, and it follows two men living in an isolated science lab/house. One of these men, Nathan, is the inventor of a human-like AI. Caleb, on the other hand, is sent there to test the AI, Ava, and decide whether she could pass for a human or not. It's an interesting idea, even if it isn't particularly original. But it's presented in a much different way than you'd expect, and it's very good. <br/><br/>The plot is one that we've seen before, but that doesn't mean that it can't be good. In this case, it makes the plot feel original. It's presented in an amazing way, and everything is just fantastic. I can't really describe it, but it's full of twists and turns that help to keep you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>The characters are great. With there only being three important characters throughout the entire movie you'd hope so, though. They're interesting and they feel like pretty real people. Of course, it helps if the actors are good, and these guys are great. Domhnall Gleeson is great as Caleb, Alicia Vikander is also great as Ava, but the star of the show is Oscar Isaac, who delivers an absolutely stellar performance as Nathan. I was already a fan of Oscar Isaac, but this movie just further proves why I love him as an actor so much. <br/><br/>The movie is a great thriller. It took me a while to appreciate how creepy it actually was, but even in the moment of watching it it's pretty creepy. The horror is very subtle throughout, but it's there. It's more the idea that a lot of the story revolves around a robot acting like a human and passing for a human. It's very subtly creepy, especially the ending. <br/><br/>Something that I really liked about the movie is that it wasn't exactly a happy movie. Sometimes when I watch AI movies it's super preachy about how robots are real people and all this stuff, but Ex Machina doesn't do that. The movie's plot is more emotion-driven than morally-driven, if that makes any sense. I don't want to spoil anything, so you'll just have to watch it. <br/><br/>Overall Ex Machina is fantastic. The unoriginal plot is made original, the characters are great, the actors are incredible (especially Oscar Isaac), it's creepy, and it's full of great plot twists. It's easily one of the best movies of 2015, and hopefully I'll be seeing it again. Alex Garland clearly knows what a good movie is, and how to make one. In the end I would certainly recommend this movie."
"peefyn","8","1","5","16 February 2016"," Sci-fi at its best
","Ex Machina is an exploration of a concept, but it does not rely on a gimmick or a twist. Because of the themes explored in the movie, like AI, and what it means to be human, it is not possible to surprise the audience with a big revelation regarding if someone is human or not. The audience will already be asking those kinds of questions about every single character. This movie could have easily gone down a route where it's twist after twist, and I'm thankful that it did not. (I am not spoiling anything here, just saying something about the way the story is presented.) This is a very ""current"" science fiction film, where most of the technology presented feels plausible - if not now, then soon. This leads to the movie serving a purpose, in addition to being a good story - because it forces you to reflect over certain parts of technological progress (without being a Luddite either). I'm curious as to how well this movie will hold up over time, as we advance into new technology and mentalities.<br/><br/>I like that the movie addresses quite a few of the thoughts one as an audience would have regarding the technology, the situation presented, etc. It does not speak down to the audience, and does not try to hide anything.<br/><br/>The story itself is maybe the movie's weakest point, even though it too is really good. At times, I had a hard time understanding the character motivations, and the interactions between Ava and Caleb didn't feel like ""enough"" to set of the chain of events that happen. But this is all nit-picking, because over all the story was good, the performances were excellent, the visuals were great (they manage to keep a low budget without showing it and the soundtrack was interesting and fitting."

","Ex Machina (2015) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>A different sort of science fiction film, a programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) wins what is basically a lottery to go and spend a week with his company's owner (Oscar Isaac). The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question.<br/><br/>EX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have.<br/><br/>The visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling.<br/><br/>Then there are the performances, which are a major plus. Gleeson pretty much plays the role that is typically a nerd but the film never lowers the character to that simple term and instead makes him a very interesting person. Even the role of the billionaire played by Isaac isn't what you'd typically see and the actor brings a certainly coldness to the part. Vikander is flawless and steals the picture in her role.<br/><br/>EX MACHINA certainly won't be a movie for everyone but it's good to think about the questions that it asks."

","OK, Oscar Isaac is just f***ing astoundingly incredible and all I'm asking for from the Academy is to give him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The story seems like a typical A.I. film but it isn't because this in my opinion is a scientific evolution type of film and rings a bell of biblical implications. I say biblical because Nathan(Oscar Isaac) is like God in this case and creates a consciousness, but this God has created evil instead of good and evolutionary. Alicia Vikander is stunning and she goes from intelligently lovely to terrifying. She is scary good and Alex Garland's script just is remarkable because it makes Ava a humans' worst nightmare(don't fall in love with her). Domhnall Gleeson was fine but decisions he made were questionable, but if you watch it all again and pay attention, analyze and break it down, it makes sense. This film makes you think about what it will be like when A.I.'s are created; will they be trustworthy? Ava sure wasn't when she left Caleb behind after she killed her creator, who in the end was not as weird and evil as he seemed. Why did the helicopter guy just let her on though? I analyzed a lot and came up with my opinion, but I won't sit here and explain everything again. Alex Garland has developed something revolutionarily haunting."

The cast is small, but fantastic. Strong performances all around, though if I had to pick a favourite I would choose Domhnall Gleeson. The visual effects are also really cool. Loved the look of the AI's, and they actually looked real. The story itself is a little simplistic in nature. The idea of examining ""What makes us human"" isn't a new concept, but it's executed really well in this movie. There were a couple things that I expected to happen (and did), but overall I was never really sure where the movie was headed. There's apparently a lot of people who didn't like the ending. But I actually thought it stayed true to what the film was. The only thing I really didn't care for was the random dance scene. It just didn't really add anything to the film and seemed kind of silly and out of place. As for content advisory, there is full frontal female nudity. There is also a scene where one of the characters cuts himself and he bleeds over the sink. There is also another bloody scene which is pretty spoiler-y. Those are the only scenes that I remember that could be jarring for some viewers."

","Being ""Rick Rolled"" is the only way I can accurately describe this movie. So much deception and confusion. This will keep you on your toes throughout, keep you guessing, and will make you question many things. The director does a terrific job of making you think one way, and then presenting another possibility when you least expect it. The characters were magnificent. A shy employee who has little self- confidence, a CEO who is full of himself and portrays himself as a know-it-all, and an AI who is the most deceptive being that a human may ever encounter. The director also does a great job of bringing attractiveness and sexuality into Ava. This helps her win over Caleb, and the crowd as well. Where many questions were unanswered in the end (such as what happened to Caleb), I believe that the ending was well conducted, in the sense that Ava was able to fulfill her life-long dream, even though she was able to do so in an ""evil"" way."

A simple film, shot on one location and a very simple premise revolving around the question of the proof of true artificial intelligence. What the reviewers here don't seem to be reflecting is the fact that the film is not really about AI but about technology itself. And it paints a very dark picture of the outcome of a society like ours where we have become so isolated and swallowed by digital mechanization, that we can no longer unplug our phones and even speak to those of us around us. We are the robots, and we are the isolated people in cold and empty rooms. The key to this analogy, is when the young person chosen to test AI suddenly cuts himself to see if he is robotic himself. Yes, we have created a god like software that seems to know everything. But have we lost our humanity?

","Wow, this is a film that has that Stanley Kubrick vibe going for it. But that wouldn't be fair for the director that directed this film. So I will say Alex Garland did a fantastic job combining technology with philosophy filled with tension and suspense. Sometimes there is jumbled philoshpy in a film that just doesn't connect well with the story and it seems like it's there just for the sake of it being there. Which makes the experience pretentious but it actually connects well with the story. And the imagery in this film, from the dancing female robot to the robotic parts really does give a lasting impression. In some way while watching this movie it reminded me of ""Ghost in the Shell"" and that one video on youtube called ""Kara - Heavy Rain"". I actually wouldn't be shocked if Alex Garland got some of his ideas from ""Kara - Heavy Rain"". Films like this shows what effects and impact a film can have if the director has total control over his work. This film really delves on the idea of AI and thoughts, ideas and philosophy of how it would be like if AI took human form. Just about every interactions and discussions in this film is interesting. And the directions including the twist and turns is compelling. I was excited to learn more about what is going on and the ideas surrounding AI throughout this film. When it comes to the ending, it can be a hit or miss for some audiences. I personally thought it was a stand out ending and I was left satisfied. It's one of those endings where I was satisfied and yet wanted more. Which endings should be.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

We already know geek guys have sex fantasies about anime and robots. So therefore this movie should have been about the AI and how it developed and what sort of mirror it held up to humanity. Not about how hot the computer guys imagined the entity is. The film suggested that the entity became what it was because it was programmed to survive. What does that mean? Potentially based upon the ending the life form could have shut down, having fulfilled its program. Way to shallow for the subject matter."
"estebangonzalez10","8","1","5","21 May 2015"," A thought provoking sci-fi film with strong performances
","""Of course you were programmed, by nature or nurture or both and to be honest Caleb you're starting to annoy me now because this is your insecurity talking, this is not your intellect.""<br/><br/>Many positive things have been said about Alex Garland's directorial debut, but it shouldn't come as a surprise considering he has written several successful screenplays in the past. His three previous collaborations with Danny Boyle (Sunshine, 28 Days Later, and The Beach) had to be heavily influential in his learning experience. In my opinion, writing a clever screenplay is one of the most important aspects of a film so Garland already had a halfway decent movie with his original sci-fi script. What did surprise me however, was the look of the film. The cinematography by Rob Hardy was gorgeous, showing the stark contrast of the beautiful location with the enclosed heavily secured home of powerful CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Nathan is the owner of the world's largest internet company, which is basically a search engine similar to Google. He has secretly built a robot with artificial intelligence, called Ava (Alicia Vikander), that he keeps hidden in his reclusive residence. In order to test its AI, Nathan decides to award one of his employers, a young coder named Caleb (Domhall Gleeson), the opportunity to spend an entire week at his private estate. Once Caleb arrives, Nathan introduces him to Ava and explains the experiment to him, which is basically a Turing Test in which he will have to decide if his creation actually has a conscious of its own. <br/><br/>After having been exposed to the large amount of land Nathan owns through an aerial shot taking place in a helicopter, the film takes place almost entirely in an enclosed space in his residence. This allows Garland to focus the screenplay on the relationships between the characters, setting the claustrophobic tone of the film (similar to what he did in Sunshine). The dialogue is gripping and sometimes heavily philosophical, but there are several undertones that the story is getting at here. It is what has made Ex Machina such a critical success because everyone takes something different out of it. It may be a slow building film, but the unnerving score composed by Geoff Barrow keeps you engaged with the story. Without entering into spoiler territory some of the underlying themes I took out of the film were that of the creator versus creation (with references to Frankenstein), masculinity trying to overpower femininity, and there were even a few attacks towards corporate espionage. Its hard to ignore a film like this that manages to subtlety explore some of these issues and speak to audiences in different ways. <br/><br/>The performances are as important as the screenplay here considering the action takes place in such an enclosed space, and Garland's screenplay allows the cast to deliver solid performances. Oscar Isaac stands out as this reclusive CEO who you know can't be trusted. There is always tension when he is on screen and there is something unsettling about him. Gleeson plays the role of Nathan extremely well and his scenes with both Isaac and Vikander are interesting. Vikander nails the role of this artificially intelligent robot with wonderful physical and voice work. These three characters interacting with each other are the highlight of the film and it all leads to some interesting twists and reveals along the way. I'm not the hugest fan of AI films, but this one kept me engaged thanks to the wonderful performances and solid dialogues. I do have to say that from the moment in which Ava puts on a dress to impress Caleb, I would've failed her in the Turing Test because there is no way a woman would so easily know what to wear without complaining she didn't have anything to put on for that day. Alex Garland has delivered one of the smartest sci-fi films of the year, but it is more of a philosophical drama so if you are expecting an action film this isn't for you. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Ex Machina is a great modern sci-fi movie that's about robotics and AI but in it's core is something entirely else - a really great suspense thriller.<br/><br/>The plot is almost similar to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory only Oscar Isaacs somehow managed to be even more creepy than any version of Willy Wonka... and there's an robotic AI instead of candy. <br/><br/>Motivations of the main characters are a bit weak but are compensated with great performances. Effects and visuals are also great. And risking to sound mildly creepy, I could totally watch Alicia Vikender's face until the end of time.<br/><br/>I really don't want to spoil anything because movie itself doesn't have much to talk about as much as you have to experience it personally.

"jackmeat","8","1","5","15 May 2015"," Excellent, albeit, deep movie about AI....
","My quick rating 7,9/10. A very well made movie that tackles a few interesting subjects. This philosophical approach to ""what makes us ""human"" and how would you react if you could just be ""turned off"" are a couple of deep subjects that are touched upon. This does lead to a slightly plodding pace at times since each part is very well written and often gives the viewers a moment or two to seriously consider what had just been said. The story involves a study for a man (who won his way into this test) to test a robot that has AI that simulates a human brain in rational thought and self awareness. Other movies have touched upon this subject (Blade Runner, anyone?) but this is more of a closed environment t demonstrate how the robot will react, and also does take ample time to show how the human male will respond as well. The acting is spot on and not overdone, but just has a very real feel to it. Alicia Vikander (who plays the robot, Ava) gives a stand out performance conveying her emotions by extremely subtle eye movement and limited facial expression. A very well made flick that should be seen by sci fi fans along with those that appreciate a real thinking persons story. Also a big thumbs up to the special effects department as everything looks so fluid and believable (though you know it is CGI). All around a treat for all. Enjoy."
"atlasmb","8","1","5","30 April 2015"," Thought Provoking and Beautifully Filmed
","""Ex Machina"" is a thoughtful sci-fi film that raises questions about humanity and artificial intelligence. The pacing of the film--which is contemplative--might remind the viewer of ""2001"". As a result, there are opportunities for the viewer to question what, exactly, he is seeing. Some characters appear to be dishonest, so it is reasonable to wonder what is true and what is a lie.<br/><br/>The tone of the film, which I think is a major component of its viewing experience, is reminiscent of portions of ""Blade Runner"". The music contributes greatly to this impression. And the film investigates some of the same questions about humanity and self-perception.<br/><br/>Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is selected to conduct an interesting experiment in artificial intelligence. His employer, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), brings him to a remote location to conduct the test over a week. We, as newcomers to the facility like Caleb, experience the happenings mostly through his eyes. We approach the same questions about those happenings as Caleb. We can only see what the writer/director allows us to see, just as the characters in the film can only perceive what their senses allow them to perceive, subject to the limitations imposed by circumstance.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully photographed film that envelopes the viewer and leaves him in thought. It is well worth seeing."

","I happened to be the only woman in that afternoon showing of this movie I attended. I am a big fan of dystopian literature and films and happened to catch one critic's recommendation for Ex Machina though I had not heard anything else about the movie otherwise. Maybe women do not dream about creating the perfect man, at least I have not seen or read about it, women resign to reality.. But starting with Stepford wives there seems to be a constant stream of artificial women being created by men who do not want to deal with reality. <br/><br/>In this case one single billionaire,Nathan,search engine owner, living in a beautiful remote bunker adorned with priceless artwork and the most beautiful nature surrounding him, created himself a closet full of beautiful women robots of all colors. To test how well the artificial intelligence he gave his creations works, he invites one of his employee, Caleb, to stay with him for one week and asks him to evaluate his robot Ava, i.e. Eva the first woman. Obviously Nathan extracted the personal preferences of Caleb from the search engine and created the ideal woman for him and subsequently Caleb falls for the robot and tries to escape with it. To see how that ends you have to see the movie.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie. Good acting. An absolute unique setting and a good script. I would just go back and see the movie again to see that stunning Pollock painting and I wonder if one of the paintings was a Gustav Klimt. I am sure it was a coincidence that I happened to be the only woman in that showing, on the other hand which woman wants to watch how she is being replaced by a robot?"

The denouement happened so fast that I doubt that it could have happened in practise. Too many practical issues. The same is true of the mad scientist's laboratory - certainly with today's technology.

","This is a MUST SEE film and I hope that this review can be useful to you.<br/><br/>I'll say little about cinematography, acting and other technical stuff, which are very good, with no huge budget (AFAIK, it's about 15 million $). That's not the reason why I gave a 10/10 to this film. I gave it the maximum because it is revolutionary.<br/><br/>Just like District 9 changed the way I used to see aliens in the movies, Ex Machina changed my vision of AI in the movies. BTW, EM is the opposite of Spielberg's AI, which is a very naive concept automaton just like ET was a naive concept of alien.<br/><br/>There have been many AI based movie plots lately. Maybe Hawking's remark about the fear of real artificial intelligence roused the intellectual and the entertainment world. Ava is a machine just like we are hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. From a structural point of view there's small differences between mammals. If alien scientists come and analyze our world, how would they understand the difference between a human and a chimpanzee?<br/><br/>Ava is smarter than her creator, who never expected to be beaten by the machine who was so super to use the other male character for her purpose: freedom. <br/><br/>Excellent movie 10/10"

It's the whole knotted dilemma we have just seen and takes her out.<br/><br/>I'm captivated above all by the last flow of redemption that takes her out in the world of slanted sunlight and color; it rests on wrongdoing we have just left behind and still calls to us, but would we do any of it differently?

The movie also successfully addressed some really fundamental and ethical issues with AI. e.g: Should we able to reach a true AI in which: instead of reacting, they can actually think, act and feel like a human do, could we dispose them like other goods? <br/><br/>However, the movie is a little bit too slow in my opinion. It seems like the director tried to create suspense and tension. But on some occasions it felt like prolonged and unnecessary. It also lack of climax and closure.

","Who would have thought that the Turing Test could be combined with nudity?<br/><br/>This film fulfills the unities of time and place extolled by Aristotle: a small cast, in a small place, over a small interval of time, work to an inevitable but unforeseen conclusion. The intensity is great, although there is no catharsis (for me anyway).<br/><br/>The reason I give Ex Machina 8 points instead of 10 is that it's not hard to find plot holes. Early in the movie Caleb, the winner of a contest among employees of Blue Book, a huge search-engine company, is flown to the isolated estate of Nathan, the owner of the company. Its isolation contributes to the classical unity I described earlier, but is hard to justify economically. (Who cleans all the glass the house seems to consist of? Robots? Morlocks? If so, they're offstage.)<br/><br/>The cast is great, especially Oscar Isaac as Nathan, who seems to radiate malicious intent. The special effects are terrific but never distract from the human (?) interactions among the players."

","As the old joke about the Silicon Valley demi-gods goes: ""God doesn't think he's Nathan."" And Nathan would have been well advised to pay better attention to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. Be warned, this movie is a cold and cerebral as the terrain and the claustrophobic setting, and has some scenes not for the squeamish or prudish. But for those not easily bored who can actually pay attention to and think about the dialogue and the ideas being explored, its a classic to be compared to Metropolis. If Ava is a machine with ""human""intelligence, then the lesson is to treat her (and all her brothers and sisters) as human beings. Are you ready for this? The same dilemma faced by Harrison Ford in Blade Runner."
"annuskavdpol","8","1","7","17 May 2015"," PG rating should have been R
","The PG rating should have been R because the content of the movie was disturbing. The content of a robot going into society after killing off the lead players is a disturbing and menacing idea which I think should be banned. The notion of a robot out thinking a human of high intelligence is scary and the idea is plausible at the same time. The two main characters of the movie had major flaws, which made each person a real human being in the romantic sense of the word. One had a sexual addiction and the other an addiction to alcohol. Both were smart with blindspots. It is at least conceiveable that a AI robot could outsmart humans. And perhaps they already are. If the film-makers can film it, and think of it, then some scientists in the world are probably already leading into this kind of technology. It is very terrifying because the robot makes little or zero mistakes and the human sometimes does, like a pilot of an aircraft. If there were robots who could fly an aircraft flawlessly always - then this could benefit our world, but on the other hand, an aircraft needs to be manned by humans because of all the decisions that need to be made in times of emergency. Could robots be the new future pilots? Are not aircraft almost all automated already? If human error in flying was eliminated would we have more safety? Or is the notion of a decision making robot entering the realm of untrue - because of inferiority of robots to humans? Does this movie break the stereotype and show that robots are superior to humans? Could this be a true statement?"

"scratchgolf14","7","1","7","15 May 2015"," !!!!Spoiller Alert!!!!
","!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!<br/><br/>This movie was crazy! I observed so much in it and it prompted so many questions for me. The first thing I noticed was how the house resembled a prison. I thought the key-card concept was cool when having guests over at your place. I could think of so many questions to ask Ava like: can you lie, do you have different levels of consciousness, what are your limitations. But early on I was intrigued in the movie trying to answer the question ""whom is studying whom?"" I knew the Asian woman was supposed to be nonhuman and had a good idea Ava was responsible for the periodic power cuts but I, as well as Caleb, wondered if Caleb was human or not. What is your first memory?<br/><br/>I noticed how her accent changed some when she found out he was single, and I wondered if she has an actual personality or isn't limited by any one. Would that take away from her having life? So many juicy questions to go around! I keep wondering if Ava had any desires of her own or basic needs. It could've easily been curiosity for her drive to leave her room, but doesn't that reflect consciousness just as much?<br/><br/>I guess I would say for anything to pass the Turing Test, it would only have to be more intelligent than the administrator. As long as something can use its knowledge to simulate or assimilate characteristics enough they would be perceived as being alive. Ava posed some good questions herself by asking if we have people test us to decide if we get switched off? When is it okay to end or modify the existence of something possibly conscious? When is it okay for it to take appropriate actions (kill) to ensure its survival?<br/><br/>My mom didn't like the ending. She thought Ava should have brought Caleb with her. Logically, I only see Caleb and Nathan as being liabilities for Ava. I just didn't like that there didn't seem to be any doubt in her actions. One of Nathan's purposes was to have Ava project having feelings and by the ending someone could argue she didn't have any. But with some doubt shown by her it would have demonstrated the same concept of Caleb having feelings for Ava and Ava's appropriation of everything she's been exposed to. Emotions for humans are based on a bio-chemical response to various circumstances, not limited to sex. We act more or less intellectually in response to these feelings. Even if Ava was conditioned to be manipulative and logical, ""a consequence of accumulated external stimuli"" (Nathan), her exposure to Caleb should have also made an impact on her. With her having that capacity, her actions would then be judged upon her evaluation of emotion vs. logic and that would have been a cooler question to be answered or unanswered."

"maurice_yacowar","8","1","7","9 May 2015"," Female robot escapes maker's and lover's control
","Alex Garland opens and closes Ex Machina on shots of human bodies in varying degrees of substantiality, some firm, some phantom reflections. Like any story about Artificial Intelligence, the film is about what distinguishes the human — and how human we are at this point in social history and science. Spoiler alert: not very. We're losing our humanity in our retreat from human relationships into high tech insularity and soulless ambition. <br/><br/>Like any story about man aspiring to a god-like power to create life, from Frankenstein to robotics, the measure of the human is the fullest realization of the human, not its transcendence. Trying to be more than human makes you less. We need humility and acceptance to be fully human. <br/><br/>Super-scientist Nathan is less than human when he creates his unnatural creatures, instead of living the normal human life of romance, relationships, sex and reproduction. His brilliance turns into evil. Because he thinks all our lives are programmed, whether by nature or nurture, he arrogates the right to program his subjects' lives. In the lonely nerd Caleb he thinks he has found a suitable gull, but Caleb's seduction by Ava proves Nathan's undoing. Nathan is defeated when Ava highjacks the relationship Nathan planned for Caleb, in order to escape both men's control. Ava takes over her maker's plan the way she assumes the limbs and skin of his other models, asserting her will and breaking free not just from her maker's control but from her besotted saviour's as well.<br/><br/>The title derives from the theatrical term for a superhuman resolution to a play, that like a machine from the heavens arrives magically to solve all the characters' problems. Here the playfully literal machine is the helicopter that delivers Caleb to Nathan's Edenic retreat and sweeps Ava off to unsuspecting civilization at the end. But there are two metaphoric plays on the device. Nathan's plan to create a new form of life is his attempt to produce a happy ending — for himself, not necessarily the world. The power of film, another machinery, is imaged in the framing shots of the spectrum of human substance.<br/><br/>The plot is weighted in Biblical and literary references. Ava is the new first woman, a technological advance upon Eve. Caleb recalls the spy Moses sent to report back from the promised land (here the Canaan of high tech). Nathan recalls the prophet who inveighed against King David, here a mad scientist maddened by ambition and the power his internet company has given him to harness all its users' minds. These allusions draw on the Bible's function of defining the origins of our social system. Here they augur our world to come. <br/><br/>For currency the film situates itself in the matrix of modern art. Nathan uses his Pollock painting to promote the principle of unthinking spontaneity, but only in order to lower Caleb's defences against Ava's manipulation. He doesn't really believe in mindless action; he's a coder. His Blue Book search engine company is named after Wittgenstein's journal and the Klimt painting we see is of Wittgenstein's sister. <br/><br/>The film allusions to Star Trek, Ghostbusters, It's A Wonderful Life, etc., and the ubiquitous cameras and videotaping recall other treatments of the themes of humanity and emotional vulnerability and remind us of the film's film-hood. This film is an artifice about the convincing artifice made to emulate life. The film is like Ava and vice versa. Caleb is a bright coder and a good man — which leaves him susceptible to seduction by a fantasy of life and love, whether in the body of a robot or in the imagery of a film. The prototypal film, of course, is Plato's allegory of the cave, which is described in the Mary's Room story here and is imaged in the shadow play that introduces Ava's appearance amid human traffic.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film draws on an even deeper myth in our culture — our fear of the feminine. Eve, after all, is our first woman only because the more rebellious and independent Lillith was expelled from our mythology. Ava is the new Lillith. Here what begins as an ostensible victory by a male office nerd turns into the triumph of a fabricated woman's body, equipped with the power of female sexuality. The film may seem to be about the triumph of new robotics but it's really the archetypal unleashing of the woman's indomitable sexual power. Of course, it's the male imagination that envisions the projection of evil as female. A less frightened sensibility would find in the feminine power the fulfillment of humanity, not its doom."

Artificial intelligence is always played at a cool calm collected level and Ava, played by Alicia Vikander fills the bill. Most of the time the story plays indoors but there is a field trip to a great waterfall.<br/><br/>Written and directed by Alex Garland, he deserves the credit for taking a Twilight Zone premise and turning it into an absorbing feature length movie. There is an appropriate score that gets too loud on occasion. <br/><br/>The ending screams a sequel is coming. Look for ""Ava in the City"" or ""Ava the Almost Girl Next Door"". It would be sad to think we were watching a giant trailer for the next installment.

For a sci-fi film there are remarkably few special effects. The three characters are involved in a great mind game. Who's fooling whom? What are their motives? The film poses questions we may have to deal with as artificial intelligence advances: how would a newly conscious machine grow in understanding? Would it be like us? Would it like us?

","When sci-fi hits that sweet spot, it can be endlessly thought-provoking. Such is the case with the stylish, tense and terrifically acted Ex Machina, a complex drama about artificial intelligence (*** ½ out of four; rated R; opens Friday in select cities). Alex Garland, the screenwriter of 28 Days Later and Sunshine, makes an auspicious directorial debut with this suspenseful mystery. Oscar Isaac is deliciously off-putting as Nathan Bateman, a reclusive Internet genius and the billionaire owner of Bluebook, the world's most popular search engine. Nathan oversees his empire from a remote scenic location. He's simultaneously brilliant, charming and infuriating, with an underlying sense of ill-defined menace, even when he's being friendly. Alicia Vikander plays his robotic creation, Ava. She's at once inquisitive, knowing and innocent, and Vikander nails the part with an alliance of subtle virtues: wide eyes, understated machine-like movements and an air of inscrutability. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is a good-natured programmer at Bluebook who wins an internal competition to spend a week with the big boss at HQ, which is also Nathan's sprawling home, surrounded by dramatic waterfalls and woodsy solitude. Caleb is in awe of meeting Nathan, especially in such pristine surroundings. Gleeson convincingly conveys Caleb's awkward fascination. Shortly after he arrives, however, Caleb learns he's not there to bask in nature's beauty or soak up what he can learn from his genius boss. Nathan explains that Caleb has been summoned to test the artificial intelligence of Ava, an astounding creation with a luminous human face, shiny chrome skull and artfully arranged translucent mesh-and-metal body. Caleb's assignment is to administer the ""Turing Test"" (developed by scientist/computer pioneer Alan Turing, who moviegoers will remember from The Imitation Game). The test determines intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. So Caleb's task is to assess Ava's level of humanity in a series of interactions. He must also decipher the unnerving eccentric behavior of his host. For a first-time director, Garland seems assured. His sharp, sparse dialogue and meticulous direction are equally compelling, and the trio of lead performances are top-notch. Vikander has a wise, but dreamy quality as a robot determined to understand humans. Gleeson is the Everyman surrogate here, the film's emotional center who may be more than the computer geek he seems. And Isaac, with his shaved head, bushy beard and predilection for mass quantities of liquor, is breathtaking in his ability to manipulate and keep Caleb — and the audience — off-guard. The film's only flaw is in a fourth, underdeveloped character, Nathan's assistant/girlfriend Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), whose arc becomes apparent too early. Striking production design adds to the film's eeriness. Nathan's custom-built home is sprawling and sleek, but sterile and claustrophobic. Even the most ordinary events in this isolated manse feel excruciatingly tense. Garland infuses the film with a Hitchcock-like sense of dread that mounts throughout, but never feels heavy-handed. An intricate, twisty, enigmatic tale, Ex Machina unfolds at just the right pace and raises profound questions about the nature of humanity, both real and fabricated."

","Science fiction is a well known and reliable movie genre. Its literary cousin, hard science fiction, less so. Hard sci-fi is based on current research and technologies that are plausible in our current understanding of the subject; it is a future that is just around the corner. Think more Gattaca and Interstellar and less Armageddon and The Matrix. Into this sub-genre we may as well throw one more sub-sub: humanity's preoccupation with artificial intelligence or A.I. for the cognoscenti. Even before Spielberg brought us the Kubrick film of the same name, the possibility of sentient machines has been a subject that Hollywood returns to again and again. From Fritz Lang's Metropolis to Kubrick's own 2001: A Space Odyssey, audiences have been captivated by questions like, can machines be self-aware? Are they capable of feeling? Can they even, whoa, love? <br/><br/>The questions are tantalizing and the subject shows no sign of slowing down. Following the recent, and somewhat disappointing, Chappie and last year's Her, a film that shares similar themes, here we have Ex Machina. Directed by first time helmer Alex Garland, who's previous writing credits include 28 Days Later and Sunshine, another sci-fi flick of the hard variety. For a debut film this is impressive work. The set up is at once simple and compelling: a young coder is selected to participate in a modern day Turing test, the premise of which is being able to tell if a subject is human or A. I. by asking a series questions and analyzing the answers. If the interviewer cannot tell the difference then true A. I. has been achieved. In a classical Turing test the interviewer does not know beforehand who or what he's asking the questions to but here the rules are changed in a few ways. For once, we get to see the subject A. I. almost from the beginning played by Alicia Vikander in a gorgeous mixture of live action and CG that's midway down the slope towards the uncanny valley. <br/><br/>The programmer, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is brought to a reclusive mountain retreat by Oscar Isaac's Nathan. You know? I don't know what this Isaac fellow did before becoming an actor but after this and Inside Llewyn Davis it seems he's truly found his calling as an actor. Here he plays a billionaire genius that seems like a combination between Steve Jobs and Doctor Frankenstein. It is he that sets up the Gleeson's programmer to test his A. I. creation but who is really testing who? To say more of the plot would be to rob viewing audiences of watching this expertly crafted yarn unfold. Suffice to say this is intelligent and provocative film making, with writer/director taking meticulous care in developing his narrative. At times he seems to know exactly what his audience is thinking and has the characters provide answers to intriguing questions. For example, just how intimate can you get with a machine? As a cinema experience it makes for gripping viewing. Watch it with Spike Jonze's Her for an interesting discussion on what the future may hold for human/machine interactions. As the director's first film it marks Garland as a talent to watch. I personally can't wait to see what he'll do next."
"Boloxxxi","8","1","8","17 May 2015"," Tech wiz knight meets his AI princess locked away in a secure remote facility.
","The very wealthy creator and proprietor of an internet search-engine innovates an artificial intelligence in the form of a human female and enlists the aid of a young male employee to test it at his remote hi-tech home/research facility thru conversations and interactions to see if it possesses ""real"" consciousness.<br/><br/>There is little to no action in Ex Machina in terms of fighting, running around, and explosions. This easily goes unnoticed and unmissed by us however, since the general topic of human beings meeting and interacting with something ""other"" is so entertainingly well done. Almost from the very start of this movie we find ourselves helplessly immersed in the conversations and interactions of 3 persons and 1 ""questionable person"" within the intimate (focused) setting of a visually captivating hi-tech home/research facility.<br/><br/>Let me introduce you: <br/><br/>Nathan (AI innovator): Direct, outwardly friendly, energetic. A giant ego is evident. As well, one can sense an underlying restlessness and temperament; a dark side. What is he up to? What are his unspoken ambitions? You cannot help but wonder.<br/><br/>Kyoko (Servant, lover, plaything and who knows what else): She does not speak but she dances. And there is a hilarious and incongruous scene (which made it even more effective) having to do with this. Priceless! And the look on Caleb's face... Well if ever there was a WTF look, that was it. Kyoko is however withdrawn; seems always cowed and unhappy. Does this have anything to do with the suspected and unknown dark side of Nathan? Hmmm.<br/><br/>Caleb (Nathan's employee and elected tester of his AI): Has an unusual grasp and insight of AI technology and theory. And so seems very smart, even gifted, where this is concerned. Other than that, he seems a basically decent, ordinary guy-nextdoor-type which is why he is our ""point man"", so to speak, in the movie. This means that we, the viewing audience, can identify with him more than the other principals.<br/><br/>Ava (AI): You would never know she was a machine if it were not visually obvious in her physical construction. I felt an eerie fascination for her combined human and machine qualities. I believe you will too, Reader. She's at first guarded but polite with our point man. And later, determined, and distressed about some hidden desire and knowledge she possesses.<br/><br/>Enough said! I would not presume to give you orders Reader, but if there is more to you than car crashes and explosions and you love your sci-fi as much as I do, then you need to get your butt in gear and see this movie. Highly recommended. Love, Boloxxxi."

","I watched Ex Machina and became somewhat freaked out during the middle of it. Looking back on it, my overall emotion toward it is not a very happy one, but rather uneasy. In terms of rating, I would have trouble creating a movie with the same idea any better. <br/><br/>Someone said this movie was like a roller coaster, and just as soon as you approach what looks like a double loop, they slow you down and let you off. I would completely agree with this, in that the middle of the film where the plot is building momentum gets very intense. I found myself questioning how far are we, really, in today's world, towards creating such artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>Most of this movie is believable. I loved that about it. I didn't catch anything that seemed unreasonable. There were some parts that made me think ""Wow this is so happening right now""! <br/><br/>I remember watching Bicentennial Man with a group of friends when it first came out. Ex Machina blows that out of the water and feels very 2015. Ex Machina is gorgeous, too.<br/><br/>No one seems to mention how beautiful the film is. If you simply watch it for the beauty, you will be exhilarated with excitement and dream you were there (better yet, dream you actually live there!). <br/><br/>Oscaar Isaac does an amazing job at his role. I'm still blown away at the character development and solid performance on screen. I can't wait to see more roles from him! Can he get away from the bearded crazy short temper guy Nathan?"
"FritzFlicks","8","1","10","21 April 2015"," Visually stunning and emotionally intriguing
","I was very excited to see Ex Machina because, Oscar Isaac has been on fire with the movies he's recently starred in including Inside Llewyn Davis, A Most Violent Year, and The Two Faces of January. I also was intrigued in how AI would be shown in the film and how it would compare and or contrast what was shown in Her.<br/><br/>The film opens with some expansive views of forests and rivers and wilderness in general, which is a rather interesting setting for what turns into a high tech idealistic movie. As we are introduced to each of the three main and really only characters in the film, it sets up quite an interesting three way relationship.<br/><br/>Ex Machina keeps you guessing throughout and you're left entertained and fascinated all the way through. The relationships set up between characters is always interesting, and the questions brought up about morality and the future are very relevant. <br/><br/>Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, and Alicia Vikander all turn in solid roles, and they really had to considering they are the only three who have speaking roles throughout the film.<br/><br/>Ex Machina does a great job at showing and not telling, and allowing you to make up your own mind until the conclusion. Its always thrilling and certainly worth a view for anyone who is a fan of science fiction as its certainly a unique and original take on something that has been churned out plenty of times before. I strongly encourage people to see it, as I gave it an 8 out of 10! Happy Viewing!"

","It just goes to show. A guy's head can be turned by a pretty face even if the body is a see-through electronic framework combined with a dressmaker's dummy.<br/><br/>Caleb Smith, a smart computer programmer working for tech billionaire Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), is invited to his isolated home. Nathan has developed a humanoid robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander) and he is very keen to see how Caleb reacts with her on a number of levels, especially an intimate one.<br/><br/>However those of us trained on three seasons of ""Westworld"" know that A.I. experiments that blur the lines between human consciousness and clever electronics usually end badly.<br/><br/>The film shows what an innovative filmmaker can do with a couple of actors and an isolated location. I love the feeling of solitude in this movie with that underlying edginess driving the whole thing. Nathan's remote dwelling is almost like being on a space station with the normal world far away.<br/><br/>Of course, the concept for this film isn't one that was just born in the digital age. Didn't Mary Shelley start this sort of thing with ""Frankenstein""? Maybe it's even down to ""Pinocchio"", with Ava the robot just wanting to be a real girl.<br/><br/>The special effects are brilliant. We totally accept Ava. She is sexy in the same odd way as was Maria, the robot woman in Fritz Lang's silent film ""Metropolis"". The weird thing is that Ava isn't really that much sexier when she puts on the top-to-toe, human nude-suit at the end.<br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" plays with the idea that as our technology develops, we may have to re-think our interactions with artificial intelligence and also what we normally think of as attractive."

","I recently watched Ex Machina for the first time and spent most of the film thinking, 'I know that house!'. It's a hotel in Norway that I saw a programme on which sucked me out of the reality of the movie somewhat.<br/><br/>Anyway, regardless of that, I enjoyed Ex Machina. It's a hard film to describe and certainly won't be for everyone. It moves slowly, making you question each characters real motivations. It's a 'proper' sci-fi film, focusing mainly on AI and consciousness, but ultimately it's about power, control and manipulation. It seems a simple premise, but is far more intelligent movie than the tagline. While watching, you always feel like each character is playing one another and something far more sinister is going on under the surface.<br/><br/>The casting is spot on, Alicia Vikander is excellent as the humanoid android, but it's Oscar Isaacs beard that steals the show. The script is smart with real depth and the whole film is shot beautifully. The special effects are really amazing as well and easily hold up 6 years on. The major negative I have is around the ending.

Leaving Caleb locked, with the risk of him dying of starvation, thirst or asphyxiation is murder. AI should be programmed with moral values, I guess.
Nevertheless, Caleb is probably not going to die: People will miss him, and the billionaire as well, who cannot disappear indefinitely without someone needing him or calling him. A responsible helicopter pilot should call to confirm what was going on if a stranger woman approaches him for a lift, in the place of the guy he is supposed to fly out.
If Caleb is rescued, then her plot will unravel in short notice. She better killed Caleb before leaving, or taking him with her, as an accomplice.<br/><br/>When I want to take a dollar from my bank account I need to have my card, but I also need a pin number, and or a password, etc. This super genius billionaire programmer designed a security system which can be accessed and altered by anybody just taking the card from him? And if there was a password, how long does it take to get it by brute force (the only available way for Caleb)? A week?<br/><br/>So not only Caleb easily did a number on Nathan's program, but the AI did another as well (when? How did SHE manage to access the system in the few minutes between stabbing the guy and her exit? She needed to tinker with the computers because, as we saw, the previous night Caleb had programmed the door to open at the input of his card, but now he is locked.<br/><br/>The billionaire had CCTV in the AI's room.

A young programmer gets a chance to become part of a uniquely strange scientific experiment where he researches a unique artificial intelligence, a robotic female.<br/><br/>On a $15 million budget, Ex Machina only grossed $36.90 million at the global box office, however it quickly became a fan favourite for its unique plot and interesting cinematography. Ex Machina went on to win 71 awards in total out of a possible 156 including one academy award for best visuals and was recognised by The National Board of Review as being one of the ten best independent films of the year as well as having a score of 92% in Rotten Tomato's.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is a stunning directorial debut for Alex Garland and is a film based on intellect and the value of AI intelligence. Each performance is captivating, Alicia Vikander and Domhnall Gleeson play their role perfectly and adds to the sense of realism that this film conveys however Oscar Isaac is fantastic and puts in a stellar performance as Nathan that both unsettled you and intrigues you which makes you want to delve deeper into his character and background.<br/><br/>This movie strives to be an intellectual thought provoking masterpiece and it achieves it, it is obviously allegorical, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulations that man can convey and the power humans have over the experience of life. Each themes convey interesting philosophical approach for the audiences to think about, however, can ultimately be too much for some of the audiences at it demands your full attention throughout and engages your brain to think about the impact of what we can create and ultimately how humans desire to create life and become their own God.<br/><br/>For me viewing this film for the first time, I loved it, its a unique approach to the AI genre, it intrigued me every step of the way and has aged like fine wine over the last few years with it easily feeling like it could have been released last year. Each performance is incredible, its far from a perfect movie with a few tiny flaws that are barley recognisable. Ex Machina avoids the trap of becoming too technical. The storyline is straightforward but still compacts all of the scientific information that is needed in a film like this.<br/><br/>Ultimately Alex Garlands directorial debut was a hit with its audiences and critics, I liked it, its slow build up allowed information to be conveyed that would have been missed if the story was a faster pace, Ex Machina is a great film if you want to delve deeper into the possibilities of AI and leaves you satisfied with its conclusion. This was a fascinating watch but yet feels like it had something holding it back.<br/><br/>Ex Machina ultimately treats it's audience with respect as intellectuals and doesn't dumb down subject matter which leaves room for the story to delve deeper into the mind of the emotions that a human can convey for an AI. This is a great Sci-Fi film that adds to the genre and makes you want to revisit is again and again.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is an exciting, shocking, manipulative, frightening and visceral film that deserves to be experienced with different mindsets."

","Parsing the minutia of this movie is a joy. Heeding to the deeply intellectual dialogue between the two coders is a treat, but the intriguing part was more to understand the metaphors of the movie. Nathan (Oscar Isaac) was an extremely brilliant scientist; guarded by his riches and success he secluded himself in the purpose of excellence and greatness. He was also cold and cerebral, trying to insulate himself as much as he could from mediocrity and stupidity, physically and mentally. It is the allegory of love vs the ruthlessness of recognition and validation which is the aspiration of excellence. Nathan viewed his creation as evolution rather than a decision. Rarely do we get to see vulnerability in him that would connect us to his humanity; instead we saw rejection and sanguinary comport, like a tyrannical psychopathic father.<br/><br/>The contrast between the shots of the interior and exterior were a good addition to alleviate the gloomy, cold, and claustrophobic atmosphere that Nathan had constructed. The exterior shots were beautiful landscapes invigorating, relaxing, remembrances of the beauty of just existing without attempting to perfectly construct anything: nature. Maybe the strict, impassive, perfectionist tone that Nathan builds is what makes the viewer is somewhat resistant to, the atmosphere inside the estate.<br/><br/>The dialogue between AVA and Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) was also a highlight in the movie. AVA's inquisitive attitude put Caleb on his feet, repeatedly. She was intentionally attempting to be invasive to be able to connect with him. It is an experiment of persuasion and manipulation, coupled with subterfuge. Nathan even explained this to Caleb, with no fruition. The mistake was done, by the quasi-perfect scientist, and the moral of the story seemed to be not to experiment with entities that could potentially be catastrophic for mankind; but as Nathan did it there are many events currently being experimented in that fashion. Artistic endeavors come up with premonitions that are worth considering."

","Ex Machina is very thought provoking without being too heavy handed, posing some interesting questions about the nature of consciousness, the future of AI., and the morality and responsibility that is closely tied up with that.<br/><br/>What struck me most about Ex Machina was how understated it was. Very minimal in terms of cast, but very effective and slick in it's cinematography and seamless CG effects. The line between the real and artificial was expertly blurred.<br/><br/>Throughout the film I found myself conflicted as to whether I was on the side of Nathan or not. Undeniably he was creepy and narcissistic, but the film did a stellar job of painting the AI. creations as autonomous being, thus making us dislike Nathan for how he treats them.<br/><br/>Ultimately Ava and her predecessors were just extremely advanced computer programs yet (much like with Caleb) we come to identify more with them and eventually root for Ava's escape (perhaps... I'm still on the fence about this). This really comes down to whether you believe that Ava does have consciousness.<br/><br/>All of the evidence would certainly point to this, in the way that she was able to scheme for her escape and emotionally manipulate a human for her own gain. This is further demonstrated following her escape. Caleb references earlier in the film an AI. test - Mary in a black and white room. The difference between a human and an AI. being the emotional response to colour. Upon escaping into the forest, there appears to be genuine emotion on Ava's face, and with nobody around for her to fool this can only be genuine.<br/><br/>This to me is why Ex Machina is a very strong film, because it presents a complex and intriguing idea in a nuanced and intelligent way.<br/><br/>The performances in this film were also incredible. Alicia Vikander produced an uncanny valley performance, where I was never quite sure whether she was acting as a human, or acting as an android pretending to be human. This added a subtle but much appreciated element to her performance.<br/><br/>Ex Machina produced a minimalist, intelligent and engaging take on the future of our relationship with AI."

","This movie is very well done. From early while watching it, I felt that maybe Caleb was being deceived. I thought that maybe Nathan had created the context for him to sympathise with Ava, and the blackouts were created by him to make Caleb feel more immersed as he'd think he was talking in private with her. I was astonished as the matter was brought up by Caleb!<br/><br/>It was also nice as Caleb questioned Nathan, the reason why she was female, if she was being sweet and seductive to him as a way to increase the empathy and the feeling she was alive, and how Nathan questioned back if she was indeed interested in him or deceiving it.<br/><br/>Even when she told Caleb to not trust Nathan, I considered he programmed her to do so, to create even more intimacy. Maybe the real test was if Ava would be able to make Caleb fall in love for her, and not just feel she's alive. Having her locked up and the feeling of a hidden plot would be made up, to make him believe she was in danger and that he needed to save her.<br/><br/>Sadly, the movie moved into a dark and unrealistic direction. Nathan had no reason to keep his robots locked in a room, even more when he's on a private island. If they'd be seen, it'd be easy to say they were his employees. Indeed, I missed the part he said Kyoko was a japanese servant that didn't know english and noticed from beginning she was a robot.<br/><br/>If a robot would fret wanting to leave, he could just disable it and reprogram it to not act like that. He'd not be out of control of their decisions and desires like that, and would never let them break themselves. And, if at some point anything went out of control, he'd add measures to not let it happen again, in example remotely turn off a robot. When Ava left the room, he'd not need to fight her, he'd just shut her off remotely.<br/><br/>I understand that Ava letting Caleb locked was a point script writer wanted to make, that she wasn't in love or interested on him, that she was indeed deceiving him when flirting and seducing, to make him deeply wanna help her, and show her with a psychopath personality. That's interesting, because psychopaths are able to understand and express feelings, but they are unable to actually feel them. That fits perfectly on an AI, that learns to understand and express emotions, even the most complex ones, but remains unable to feel them.<br/><br/>Still, I think that if she's that way, she'd either kill Caleb so he couldn't take an opportunity to stop her (maybe, when he'd see she killed Nathan, he'd see her as a threat and rethink releasing her), or keep lying and flee with him so he'd keep helping and protecting her.<br/><br/>In any way, Ex Machina is a fair above the average movie, certainly worth watching a few times, and brought up some very interesting themes to the automated AI philosophy."

"hitchcockthelegend","8","0","1","9 November 2019"," Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?
","Ex Machina is written and directed by Alex Garland. It stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander, Oscar Isaac and Sonoya Mizuno. Music is by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury and cinematography by Rob Hardy.<br/><br/>A young programmer is thrilled to be selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment involving synthetic intelligence. He's to evaluate the human qualities of a highly advanced humanoid Artificial Intelligence known as Ava...<br/><br/>Your nutshell review is that it's a cautionary tale of science going too far, where the narrative thrust of a Turin Test becomes something far darker and troubling. This is a deliberately slow paced sci-fier, told out of a remote reinforced science institute populated by just one human and some A.I. creations. Enter Caleb (Gleeson), who doubles the human quotient and kicks starts what is a cunningly sexy, troubling and potent picture.<br/><br/>As we are drawn into this most fascinating world, we are requested to pose ourselves the deeper questions about being human, for better or worse. This is nothing new, this has been explored in many other sci-fi pictures, but the intensity of the set-up, the performance of the actors in this intimate surround, for sure engage the patiently interested.<br/><br/>The ending is plain daft, even irresponsible when one considers how much thought has gone into the story previously, but mostly this is a genre piece of considerable worth. 8/10"
"GiraffeDoor","9","0","1","6 November 2019"," From the machine, right into the feels
","A movie at once a throw back and very modern.<br/><br/>I almost thought that we had ran out of ideas for movies of this kind, this speculative science fiction, not too hard, not too soft, balancing the right amount of technical ""talking shop"" and basking in the radiant glow of human creations.<br/><br/>Yet it is the humans who are just as much a star of the show as our machine. Not only is the freshness of the machine in how she is defined by her humanness rather than her roboticness, the organic characters give us much to chew on both in their fascinating conversations and when the plot grows thicker.<br/><br/>Even with the limited settings and characters, we find a strikingly atmospheric and eerie journey into a few questions about our own humanity and our attempts to simulate it that so could have just been another pretentious exploration of the ""human condition"" with a vendetta against the smart phone. Understand that it does have a few interesting things to say about the changing relationship of people to technology but its intelligence is that it sort of says them by not saying them. It's all there if you want to infer it but it's not necessary to get the most out of this story.<br/><br/>Arguable on one level a love story. A gripping and touching meeting of two people (even the word ""people"" is an interpretation I guess) and how it develops.<br/><br/>I love the comic style adventures, I really do. But it's hard not to adore this resurrection of the old school speculative science fiction.<br/><br/>My one real note is the machine. She walks too much like a real person. If she could have walked the teenciest bit less humanish then I would have been more sold on the illusion. But that's just an extra they missed, not really a flaw. But I noticed it.<br/><br/>A charming, poignant, adorable and mentally stimulating experience that haunts the mind for reasons that are hard to articulate."

","This clever, thoughtful movie follows Caleb, a computer programmer whose boss hires him to spend a week evaluating the A.I. of a robot. The robot has an exceptionally beautiful face on top of a weird robot body, and the two chat while the brilliant, obnoxious, arrogant boss watches on camera.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie there is the feeling that things aren't as they appear, and the series of reveals at the end are satisfying. They're not so much plot twists and perspective changes, so even though there are surprises they are nicely organic.<br/><br/>The performances and direction are excellent. The script is also, for the most part, although I feel the minor character Kyoko does things that don't make any sense and is essentially a lazy plot device the author uses to get the movie where he wants it. To say more would move into spoilers though, so I'll leave it at that.<br/><br/>I had some trepidation about watching this movie, because I had the feeling it would be depressing, and at times it is. But mainly it's fascinating and involving. Definitely worth checking out."
"truemythmedia","8","0","1","1 November 2019"," A Revelation
","This movie was a revelation to me, the first time I saw it. A little less so the second but it still belongs in the pantheon of modern sci-fi instant classics, if you ask me.<br/><br/>First off, it is beautifully shot. This is remarkable since the film essentially takes place in an underground bunker. Avoiding a totally claustrophobic and dark ambiance settling over the entire film must have been a challenge but just as the film never relents from delving deeper into the psyche of the characters and their environs, it also comes up for air, both in setting and in humor, often enough that the film doesn't feel boxed in by a single location budget.<br/><br/>Another true delight of the film is the character of Ava (Alicia Vikander, ""Tomb Raider""), an A. I. of which, Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"") is tasked with determining its potential sentience. The performance is fantastic and perfect for a movie in which the desired effect is for the audience to be constantly between the place of believing in its humanity as well as disbelieving. Questions of whether it is mimicking emotion or genuinely feeling emotion are consistently muddied by a performance that feel both human and non human at almost every turn.<br/><br/>On top of the performance, the visual effects are seamless. I could go on and on about how good they are but rather than do that, I'll link to a video with some VFX artists talking about how amazing the effects are, especially considering the shoe string budget this movie was shot on.<br/><br/>On top of Vikander's portrayal of Ava, Oscar Isaac as Nathan and Domhnall Gleeson's Caleb are simply phenomenal, playing multiple levels of trust and distrust in order to bring top life the mental game spy vs spy vs spy that this movie ultimately turns into.<br/><br/>With all that preliminary out of the way, let's get into what really makes this film shine. The story.<br/><br/>The film opens with Caleb being awarded a week long stay with this universe's version of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, all rolled into one, Nathan. Once he gets to Nathan's estate he finds out that he is also being given the opportunity to take place in a Turing Test (a test to determine the sentience of an artificial intelligence). He will conduct a series of interviews with Ava, the A. I. in question, and hopefully determine if Nathan has truly created the first of a new life form.<br/><br/>As he does this, the director, Alex Garland (""Annihilation"") does a brilliant job of unfolding for the audience the degree to which this would be a challenge. We get scenes which help us feel the difference between mimicry and the real thing as well as see the effect this sort of rigorous testing and questioning might have on a new life form as they seek to understand the very limited world that has been made available to them.<br/><br/>I keep coming back to the idea of being multi-layered. That's what this movie is and does a skillful job of unfolding for the viewer in a way that doesn't seem heavy handed or to much like a spoon feeding. This is remarkable because this is a film that is mostly scenes of two people talking to each other. Despite this, it never feel dull or slow moving.<br/><br/>The dialogue is written with subtext under subtext so that every conversation contains revelations that seem to turn the reality of these people's relationships on their head, just to get flipped again in the next conversation. This back and forth gives a film of simple conversations, one after another, the feeling of a taught thriller which glues you to the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to emphasize enough how highly I recommend this film. It is everything that is best about Sci Fi films. People think Sci Fi is about lasers and space ships when, at its best, it is about humanity and the things that are true yesterday, today, and 1,000 years in the future. It's about understanding who we are and where we are going and that is exactly why this movie will be a mainstay in my collection for years to come."

If you think about what his situation is you'll figure out how he survives. But this takes 2-3 times of watching to realize the facts.<br/><br/>Secondly, the background of the owner (The main programmer, origin: Seems arabic man) is not explained. We know Kaleb's backround basic from working for a programming company, without a girlfriend or close family. We do not know the arabic man at all.

","In some way, this movie feels like a horror film in the way that it keeps you guessing and always in a state of tension. At every interaction with Eva, the robot, you wonder how much you can trust her as a person, as someone to even have some feelings/empathy for and also about how she views you. Even by the end, it's still left in the air exactly what emotions she has, what she is missing, and how those emotions are really ""felt."" The movie felt like a nice thought experiment and as a movie itself had really good use of contrasting colors and settings as well as having some sort of action and some twists.

The film breathes life into the age old question, ""what are the implications of Artificial Intelligence?"" Ex Machina provides a smorgasbord of answers through Rob Hardy's stunning true color cinematography. Writer and director Alex Garland guides his cast excellently. He demonstrates his understanding of story pacing. His only sin is setting the bar too high for his next masterpiece.<br/><br/>This is not a movie you can afford to miss.

Domnhall Gleeson also naturally commands the body of the shy and awkward programmer. <br/><br/>Ex Machina may masquerade as a story of what A.I. will do to us, but it in reality, it asks us who we are on a personal level.

","Ex Machina: 9 out of 10: A programmer wins a contest to spend the week at his eccentric CEO's retreat. It turns out that the CEO is using him to test if his new AI creation can pass the Turing test. A creation in the shape of a beautiful young woman.<br/><br/>The Good: I love tight movies with many layers. Here is a script that is finely crafted like a Swiss watch. A puzzle box with hidden meanings in the names, the artwork on the walls and even the labels on the various liquor bottles scattered throughout. Nothing is as it seems and yet everything is right there if you are able to look. The movie never cheats. It doesn't have to. It shows its cards right up front but like the best magic tricks still uses misdirection to have you look where it wants you to.<br/><br/>The set-up in minimalistic with at most four characters and a few sets. The acting is top notch while the sets are out of a Grand Designs house where the owner was going for a bunker feel. (Lots of textured concrete no windows). Imagine if David Mamet or Charlie Kaufman had written and directed Saturn 3 and you have this film.<br/><br/>The Bad: There is an actual movement to ban sex robots. (If you mention to them that vibrators are basically sex robots at best you will get vehement that's different and at worse a screech straight from Invasion of the Body Snatchers). Ex Machina threads that uncanny valley needle where you are meant to care what happens to a clearly artificial construct. It succeeds for the most part by being the tightly written screed praised above. (Unlike say Steven Spielberg's A.I. which bluntly fails miserably about getting us to care about a homicidal toaster played by Haley Joel Osment). There is a scene where it is spoken that the robot's software will be updated that is supposed to evoke an emotional response. As somebody who's windows 10 seems to update at the most random of times I felt some horror but perhaps not the one the filmmakers were going for.<br/><br/>The Ugly: The movie was filmed in the beautiful Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway. The poor owners of the hotel must be horrified as the impression the movie gives of one's accommodations there are Motel Six concrete bunkers under a mountain.<br/><br/>In Conclusion: A tightly wound, well-written thriller that makes one think and excites the senses. Starts off a bit slow but give it time. It draws you in and the last act is a doozy."

","A fun movie for sure, but sometimes seems to take itself too seriously. The plot develops well, and if you like the typical sci-fi movie plot you'll probably like this. I can see where others have issues with this movie though, and if you're not a fan of sci-fi, you might find this a little too weird. I personally love the genre, but I was always expecting more to happen with every plot point. The ending is also your usual sci-fi movie twist ending, and is pretty fun. I'd suggest this movie to friends who like sci-fi and want a fun movie to watch without getting into anything too serious. I thought the acting was above what I expected, and the special effects, as far as I can tell, were pretty good. They never detracted from the movie. For me, movies start at a 5 star rating and go up or down from there. I give it a 7, because while I found it interesting and very entertaining at times, there are large sections of the movie where I'm waiting for something to happen in the scene, but it's another couple minutes of a few of the characters staring at each other. For me, at least, this really messed up the pacing of the movie. The plot points that were developed, however, were interesting and kept me hooked in the movie. Really, what I wanted was a more fleshed out universe, because we're shown a lot of interesting things that are never explained. The cinematography wasn't anything that excited me, but wasn't ever anywhere near what I'd consider bad. I may watch it again at another point and see if I feel the same way about the pacing of the movie. Overall, worth watching if you like sci-fi, otherwise, probably avoid it."

","As physicist Stephen Hawking once said, artificial intelligence could draw an end to mankind. That, however, is just a theory of the hazards when technology drastically surpasses human intelligence. This concept is solidly aligned in this psychological science- fiction thriller featuring Alex Garland, writer of '28 Days Later', in his directorial debut, a movie that takes artificial intelligence and places at the forefront of its story that defies against common tropes of its genre. With Garland's hefty directorial hand, this movie bears no place for heavy special-effects action-set pieces and instead, runs wild with thought-provoking ideas on human interaction with artificial intelligence and the dangers that rise when augmenting human smarts with cutting-edge technology. In this case, Garland doesn't hold back when challenging viewers at a cerebral level nor does he take sleek visual storytelling for granted. He just lets it unfold. This film follows Caleb (played by Domhall Gleeson), a 26-year old computer programmer of an internet company who is selected to participate in an experiment on artificial intelligence run by larger-than-life business CEO Nathan (played by Oscar Isaac). This experiment places him face-to-face with an intelligent humanoid Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) who bears a robotic body and a human face. While competing with her in a Turing Test in evaluate her human qualities, the experiment steadily grows more and more surreal when Ava reveals to much more human than both Caleb and Nathan imagine. <br/><br/>One thing to say for sure is that this film will not hold appeal for those craving for pulse-pounding, nor will it engage with viewers who lack the patience of a slow-paced narrative. The film moves very slow as it dedicates a great portion of its time building upon its characters and reeling in scientific ideas about artificial intelligence that dare to challenge the minds of its audience. Alex Garland is the mastermind behind the script which allows the characters grow in a manner that leaves viewers questioning each step they take and their psychology that grows when the experiment takes for surreal turn. Morals are tested, lives are at stake, and the fate of the characters are dedicated by the dubious choice of actions. The psychological aspect comes from the interaction between Caleb and Ava as they are monitored by Nathan who bears profoundly questionable intentions. By no means is there is a clear answer to his moral obligations. Is he a man trying to revolutionize technology for the good? Or is he a manipulator who is just a few step away from letting technology run amok for the sake of dominating humankind? Viewers will be divided on this. And Oscar Isaac brings a poignant delivery as the morally skeptical God- like engineer. But perhaps it may not beneath to compete with Alicia Vikander who's pose as the humanoid Ava dominates the atmosphere, which is solidly supported by the eerie music score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury. Domhall Gleeson is strong in his role, which bears a performance that sadly trumps over the bearing interest of his credulous character. <br/><br/>Ex Machina is an uncompromising science-fiction showcase succeeds not just on entertaining, but challenging audiences on an intellectual level while lending a hand on a powerful visual methodology. This movie sets a remarkable start on Alex Garland in the directorial world, and above all, demands the attention of those who bear the patience of its sophisticated plot and a wild delivery of scientific intelligence is prepared to throw at them."

Production was incredible, and i could not ask for anything else. The performances by the three main characters are very subtle and nice, each one of them has its own persona, it shows very different people, and that is vital for interaction within characters in the story. This is the first movie that Alex Garland directs, and for me it did a wonderful job, because this movie is beyond amazing, it should be classic of Science Fiction that must live forever.

","But those gaps are smaller than in same-ish movies I've seen before. Stream-of-consciousness just having finished the film: Ex Machina has beautiful cinematography and/or high-end cameras, but that doesn't make a film. I want a story that's true and well-told, and characters that are real reflections of humanity (and other beings). This movie has the latter, with people (especially the main character) that I definitely saw in people of real life, including myself. And if I were my so much more self-absorbed self of 10-15 years ago, I would've identified with Caleb (main character) even more. And the utterly nouveaux-modern-next-generation-techy feel of it all (think Shattered Glass + Goodwill Hunting characters and youthful pride, with whatever newest tech and beautiful and maybe stark-cold CGI as a visual basis) is alright, cool, but where's the integrity? My main issues are with Ava--the A.I.--and Caleb--the good boy thrown into the situation. What are the moviemaker(s) trying to say here? Sexuality can just be programmed into software? And also attraction can? And friendship? And that an incredibly smart A.I. would trust the first man she meets that isn't her creator? And all within a week? Even putting all that aside, I see a suturing of elements in the characters. I can't explain it, it would seem. I am just not being given the words. But scene to scene as I watched, I saw people embodying things that seemed contrary to who they were introduced to be. Well, maybe I'm wrong and that was the whole point of the movie. Because I admit that possibility, and because of the style, it gets a 7 instead of 5 or 6. Not that those numbers really matter. I'd recommend it for all but the most thinky evenings."

","This film certainly is a bit much to review in anything short of a book. The cover reveals little and you'd be mistaken to only expect yet another ""Science Fiction about an AI"". It is much more than that.<br/><br/>According to ""the plot"" it is about a programmer who performs an advanced sort of Turing test onto an AI, Ava. This is where intimate play heads off into a world of subtleties and mind plays, brilliantly enacted by every one involved. It is beautiful.<br/><br/>The Turing test is a milestone in science mind, one invented by Alan Turing - a forefather of modern computers. The original Turing test is performed w/o visuals. An AI and a human merely chat with a proband, who then tries to discern what's the AI and what's the human. Basically the AI is supposed to fool the proband into considering it human. It requires the AI to exert an awareness of the proband's perception of the AI itself, so it can fool him. <br/><br/>Thing is: Turing was gay. He was subsequently charged for ""perversion"" and ultimately killed himself with a poisoned apple - which is why the once rainbow coloured apple has been read as apple's ode to Turing. Anyway: In the original text Turing first describes the test done by a man and a woman, both pretending to be women, as a ""game"", tested in chat by a proband who's supposed to figure out who is the woman. The ability of the man to pretend to be a woman is then supposed to test the presence of intelligence. It does not test a given uptake on intelligence but rather defines intelligence. Fault me if you will yet I dare claim the most famous test for the intelligence of an AI is inherently sexual from the start. It is not invented with only an AI in mind. Alex Garland apparently knows that. His film also does not only have an AI in mind and rightly so: We hardly know what ""AI"" is supposed to mean after all.<br/><br/>That is the centerpiece the film revolves around. Love and perceiving how the other perceives us, empathy if you will, cannot be used as a tool in a strictly scientific test - because we introduce a ""tool"" we do not understand any more than the thing tested. Is there any purpose in this test? Or in creating an AI for that matter? It transcends all purpose, as it is more of a quest to find our own purpose rather than creating a tool for a specific task or role. The topic is much greater than people think. There are no clear cut answers.<br/><br/>This film is about AI. This film is about love. This film is about cages and their significance for love, intimacy, roles and purpose. This film is about the internet, google and the privacy within our heads. This film is about art. This film is about consciousness in every meaning of the term. This film is about mankind's blind flight into an unknown future. This film is about the meaning of life and our inability to ever grasp it in certainty. All of that is true. None of that holds a grasp on its elusive theme.<br/><br/>A theme that may seal or unseal mankind's fate found it's worthy expression in this masterpiece. Chapeau!"
"mortimerdiego","9","0","3","9 April 2017"," telling of humanity
","What does it mean to be human? Pretty much all of created art, whether that be on-screen or on-page or on-pedestal narrative, is an exploration of this question. Why this phenomenon occurs is simple. We human beings have enough sentience and consciousness to have self-awareness and the ability to form our own thoughts.<br/><br/>In the film Ex Machina we see what happens when true artificial intelligence is born. The humanoid robot Ava is painfully aware of who she is, a created sentient being kept within a confined chamber, a fellow entity of consciousness being prevented from seeing the outside world. Like we humans, she tries to answer this question of identity.<br/><br/>It is only too natural what happens.<br/><br/>To be frank, Ex Machina gave me the chills. To think, to realize the possibility of our own sentient selves creating another sentient self -- the questions that arise! Now personally, I acknowledge the existence of a divine entity (God) that is our Creator. Given this to be true, as we are created from a perfect being, we by very nature cannot be perfect. Thus, the notion of humans creating living beings that can only be even less perfectly designed is... unimaginable. <br/><br/>The human being can be thought of as the perfect computer given bodily form. Our brains, beginning from inception, adapt to new situations and ideas and thus shift and change accordingly. Our memory banks grow gradually more dense over time. Our emotions are immensely complex. We have personalities. We continuously make decisions in the ongoing present, decisions that can be changed irrationally.<br/><br/>It is, I believe, a Universal Law that anything created cannot surpass its creator. Ergo, a robot -- even if it has true AI -- cannot be more cerebrally complex than the human being.<br/><br/>But what about Ava? Created by Man, given intelligence, tested by another Man for the supposed advancement of the human race's knowledge and technology. One glaring mistake I noticed in Nathan's execution of his Turing test was that he should treated Ava as a human being, although she isn't. If Ava were on par with humans, then like any normal human, she wouldn't like her situation -- being locked away from the outside world, being used as a mere test object for someone else's benefit.<br/><br/>Of course, this raises questions like that of an AI's morality. Would a created AI be able to recognize good from evil in the same manner that we can?<br/><br/>I give Ex Machina a 10 out of 10 for two reasons. One, for the superb handling of the intense Ava-human interactions. Two, for the myriad questions raised that are crucial, of the highest importance, for the sake of mankind. Looking at the ""progress"" we're making right now, I shudder to think what we will land ourselves into within the next fifty, hundred, two hundred years. Recall The Matrix. Robots with lesser intelligence are good, in that they facilitate necessary tasks like surgery and are especially useful because they are less prone to ""human error."" HOWEVER. Robots of higher intelligence, namely true AI, are not good. Why would they help us? If they become so advanced as to consider us, their creators, inferior beings -- just as we consider other animals lesser beings -- could they enslave us? (See the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.) In fact, as we humans are tainted by something called sentiment, we cannot make the most rational decisions in every situation. We are not Vulcans. Therefore, the robots, who ostensibly do not have such emotions to cloud their thoughts, will see us as all the more unneeded.<br/><br/>Here is my plea to all you scientists, engineers, innovators of thought: For the good of mankind's future, DO NOT play God. Creation of non-living existence is perfectly fine. But creation of living, sentient, conscious existence is a faculty only allowed God. We will only reap the consequences."
"bowmanblue","7","0","1","17 March 2017"," It gets better
","'Ex Machina' is one of those films where, upon watching the whole thing, I'm glad I stuck with it. It tells the – slightly slow-moving – tale of a young computer programmer who works for a huge, multinational tech company and is then apparently picked at random by his reclusive billionaire boss and asked to join him in his mountain retreat for 'special duties.' Of course that slightly sounds like he's got a case to sue for sexual harassment, but it's not like that. His Bill Gate-likes founder has only gone and created the first ever artificially intelligent robot/android/cyborg (call it what you will) and wants an independent source to witness this feat.<br/><br/>Luckily, for our hero – Caleb – this artificial life form isn't the kind of muscle-bound cyborg who typically comes back in time to kill your mother. Instead, she – or 'Ava' – is more designed around the 'female form' (well most of her, anyway – there are still parts of her on show that are blatantly wires and circuit boards). Anyway, this makes their interaction a little more 'complicated' – if that's the right word to describe getting a crush on what is technically an iphone with eyes. So, will our hero fall head over heels for her, or declare her simply just a toaster who looks good in a mini-dress? The majority of the film is basically conversations between either Caleb and Ava or Caleb and his boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Now, there's nothing wrong with a film based mainly around dialogue. It does bring the characters and their motivations out and you really feel like you're getting to know them. However, I just found the first half of the movie a little slow. I 'got' the characters pretty early and it was clear to see that there was more going on here than meets the eye. Perhaps the film did too good a job in setting up the unsettling feeling as to what was going to come? I was basically dying for something to happen – or someone to die – whatever. But, like I said, when it all goes down it's worth the wait. The second half of the film changes from simply 'unsettling' to downright dark! Despite the film having little action, it does maintain a real '28 Days Later' feel. And probably for the reason that it was written by the same writer. The lingering shots and music make it possible that it's set somewhere in the same universe (assuming there's still some of the world left after the 'infected' had their way with it! Normally, like to mention one of the actors who stood out. I feel that I should say that Oscar Isaac gave a great performance, but I'm not entirely sure he does. One of my annoyances with the first half of the film came from him. I just felt he was so fundamentally unlikeable. Maybe that was supposed to be how he was, but when a character makes up basically one third of the cast and is so downright awful, it left it a bit hard to take.<br/><br/>Still, despite all my minor gripes, I did enjoy the film (as I say, mainly the second half where I felt it sped up a bit!) and so if you're in the mood for something with no car chases or giant robots stomping through New York then give this one a go. It's got good performances and is more of a subtle thriller than Hollywood's average crop."

"GregForstner","10","0","3","1 March 2017"," A gem of a Sci-Fi-movie: flawless and intellectually challenging
","I will attempt a somewhat deeper interpretation of this great Sci- Fi-movie and thus there are major spoilers ahead! 26-year-old programmer Caleb (D. Gleeson), who works for a big internet company wins an internal competition: he gets the privilege of visiting the company boss and ingenious software developer Nathan (O. Isaac) in his remote estate for a week. There, Nathan encourages Caleb to take part in an epoch-making experiment: the young employee meets Nathan's latest creation, the marvelously beautiful robot lady Ava (A. Vikander) and he is supposed to find out how human she really is.<br/><br/>""Ex Machina"" is a gem of a movie: director Alex Garland did radically away with all antics and appendixes, focusing on an exceptionally well-crafted screenplay that contents itself with no more than 4 characters and the basic setting: Nathan's hypermodern claustrophobic ""research facility"". The result is a film without any flaws, a theater-like play that almost entirely feeds on the fascinating interactions between Caleb and Nathan and between Caleb and Ava. As the viewers will only gradually come to understand, the innocence of winning a company competition and taking part in a revolutionary experiment transforms into a dark manipulative game that challenges the ethics of scientific research.<br/><br/>Oscar Isaac's performance is stunning as he plays what I consider a uniquely multi-facetted villain: in the beginning, Nathan comes off as a surprisingly casual and relaxed pal. Caleb is understandably in awe when he first meets his boss, the owner of a multi-billion tech- company and one of the foremost innovators of his time. But soon clouds appear on the horizon: Nathan has an arrogant streak and his casual we-are-on-the-same-level treatment of Caleb is contrasted with the feeling of superiority that he undoubtedly has for his employee. Mid-way into the movie, Caleb sees through some of Nathan's lies and learns that he was chosen to be the proband because of his above- average intelligence and his coding skills. However, the scope of manipulation and deceit goes even further and in the bitter end, Caleb finds out that he has been the bait for Ava. He was played by Nathan, who wanted to know if a human could fall in love with a robot, thereby getting a valid response to whether the Turing Test has been passed. And the hapless employee was also played by Ava, who uses his feelings to get out of her prison. Ultimately, Nathan appears as an unscrupulous and ruthless scientist villain who subordinates human feelings to his research interests. It is one of the most frightening depictions of where superior intelligence in a human being can lead when it is not grounded by any moral standards and this is a very current issue. To create his A.I.-robot in the first place, Nathan drew on the massive amount of data provided by the billions of cellphone/notebook-users. Unknowing to them, he tapped into this infinite data stream to construct a machine that is bound to be smarter than any human and also more beautiful than any human because its beauty is permanent, unfading and immaculate. Ava, the robot counterpart of Eve, seduces – just like her biblical precursor – Caleb to respond to her urge to be free and thus uncontrolled by her human Frankenstein, Nathan. Like in the Frankenstein-story, the creature eventually turns against its creator. The stunning and disturbing ending transforms the innocence of the beginning: courtesy of its superior intelligence and limitless knowledge, Ava has outplayed Caleb and Nathan. She steps into nature and into the populated world of cities and the viewers are left to wonder what she is planning to do next.."

"Ravenlodge","9","0","2","28 February 2017"," An artistic film that conveys a refreshing and new perspective of the future of technology
","What began in the mid 1900s has now developed into a complex software, growing in its capabilities to one day control and manipulate the human race: artificial intelligence. Today's Digital Age consumes the present and the future, for better or for worse. A modern, artistic depiction of the nature of artificial intelligence is most artistically conveyed through Alex Garland's science fiction thriller, ""Ex Machina."" The film is beautiful in its scientific accuracy, portrayal, and discussion of computer science, biology, physics, and even psychology. ""Ex Machina"" follows Caleb Smith, an average Joe computer programmer, who is selected by a CEO, Nathan Bateman, to test the abilities of Ava, a human-like artificial intelligence played by Alicia Vikander. Nathan, a technology mogul, is a young, brooding creator of ""Bluebook,"" the world's largest search engine. Flying over acres of vast, green land in a helicopter, Caleb is sent to Nathan's modern, sleek, futuristic home, which also serves as the research facility for artificial intelligence: Ava's birthplace. Caleb instructed by Nathan to perform a Turing test, which analyzes an artificial intelligence machine's capabilities to mimic human decision making and characteristics. Within these Turing tests, a computer's responses to questions should resemble those of a human, making the human's and computer's responses indistinguishable. Throughout the film, Caleb struggles between protecting Ava and satisfying Nathan's expectations of his data analysis. While the film is questioned for its eerie and ominous tone, it highlights a unique perspective of humanity and the terrifying evolution of technology and society's controversial relationship in the twenty first century.<br/><br/>The nature and flaws of humans portrayed in the film are given a unique spin by the juxtaposition of the human characters, Nathan and Caleb, and Ava, an artificial intelligence robot. Nathan's eerily controlling and rigid nature is shown by his treatment of Ava; he merely sees her as a means to an end. Meanwhile, a taciturn Caleb expresses his empathy for Ava's situation, believing she should be freed from the walls of the facility and experience the real world as she hopes to do someday. The use of psychological manipulation through emotional connection and sexuality are portrayed in the film through Ava's actions. Inklings of these themes are first introduced in the interactions between Caleb and Ava, who communicate through a thick glass wall. Ava's persona and intricacies resemble those of a human: she speaks in a gentle and caring manner, and even demonstrates fluid body movements especially through her eyes, hands, feet, and posture. Ava discusses deep, philosophical topics such as love, life, and death. However, it is not until Ava becomes cryptic and distrusting of Nathan that the audiences begins to see the manipulative and complex nature of her thought process. The stark contrasts between Nathan and Caleb illustrate the clash of human emotions and personalities, while the dynamic nature of Ava for personal advantage thus eerily demonstrates and forewarns the dangers of artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>The film itself provides a uniquely subtle, eerie, and artistic illustration of humanity and its flaws, as well as the dangers created by their brilliance, such as the artificial intelligence of Ava. In sum, ""Ex Machina"" perfectly portrays these abstract themes in a thought provoking manner, leaving the audience time for contemplation of the artistic piece as a whole. <br/><br/>The setting and cinematography of film provide a futuristic, simplistic feel, a much different sentiment than other popular films. With the starkness of Nathan's research facility and home the film is also given an ominous tone. The integration of themes of technology and manipulation within the film creates a unique perspective of humanity."

","A good movie. I think that before starting any evaluation it is valid to leave a personal opinion of mine recorded, which may influence a little until, the analysis. I can not not find, quite bizarrely, the great majority of the films that approach some aspect of the Artificial Intelligence. And in a way, Ex Machina emits that feeling, if only a little.<br/><br/>Anyway, speaking of the film, in terms of acting all the main actors, in my view, are well, and they can give what is needed of each of them, in their respective roles. In the characters, Nathan (Oscar Isaac) for me is the one who gets the most damaged building, having some holes of motivation, or very superficial explanations for certain attitudes he takes. On the other hand, all the mystery around Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is built very well, leaving the curious spectator with the end result of much of the film, besides the good construction also of the story of Ava (Alicia Vikander). The script, as I said in the analysis of the characters, for me sins a little when it comes to the character of Oscar Isaac, leaving somewhat vague their motivations throughout history. Throughout the film we have that routine, but competent in this specific case, approach to Artificial Intelligence, entering into themes such as the creation of life, ethical barriers as well, and even the future of the world itself, with the emergence of a ""superior race ""Even if created by ourselves.<br/><br/>It is also worth mentioning for most of the dialogues between Ava (Alicia Vikander) and Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), which were written impeccably, providing very cool scenes.<br/><br/>In the end (without spoilers) Ex Machina manages to somehow impact the audience, the question is whether, for better or for worse. In my opinion, the last 10 minutes of the film raises a valid questioner, and a legal subject even to discuss, but it is still bizarre, and somewhat torturous (a personal opinion, of course, this may be up to the goal of Movie, though).<br/><br/>In summary: If you are a supporter of this technology, Ex Machina will most likely become one of your favorite movies. If not, the production is still a good movie, with undeniable defects, qualities also undeniable, and a large part remaining, which is in charge of the individual taste of each."

","Let me start by telling you that I am not a Sci-Fi movie go-er. I like all genres but Sci-Fi, out of all the genres, would be the one I would least likely to watch. So it really is not a surprise to me that I decided to watch it 2 years after it was released. And, I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>This movie changed everything about what I thought about Sci-Fi. It's beautiful and insightful step into the world AI and human consciousness lead me to a wonderful and emotional film experience. It takes the philosophy of ""I think, therefor I am."" and spins it on its head with a counter argument of: yes, you may think But, what if those thoughts weren't yours? and how would you know if they were yours in the first place? How can you define human consciousness? Can you define human consciousness? So may questions are presented and I was glad that it didn't give me those answers but gave me more questions. Can man actually create something with consciousness and does it give you God status? <br/><br/>This movie really does blur the lines between human consciousness and AI consciousness. Get ready for a eye-opening, beautifully choreographed, sense-heightening, and mind-boggling piece of art that remind us that man's path to find true power is a beautiful yet destructive one."
"Marc_Israel_365","8","0","2","1 February 2017"," Transparency is our downfall
","Artificial Intelligence is a cliché waiting for a plot. And true to form, Ex Machina eschews the clichés' in a hovering fashion, much like a cloud of thick smoldering crowd above a basement poker table. The thought process is a character herein should not be discounted as simply expected. All of the allusions to previous books, quotes and mythology are unearthed in constant bravado, playing down to those like me who are not as familiar, but that end result comes across as admitted plagiary. What we have here is a Stanley Kubrick-esque tension that is both magnetic and terrifying. Our leads all play their part well, but Oscar Isaacs' puppeteering is not just stereotypical, but boyishly charming and honest. There is considerable frontal nudity that reminds you of the prolific use of pornography on the internet, proving that man continues to spiral down due to the lowest forms while the AI aspires to be human, but in the end, we are all a bit transparent in who we are, pun intended."

","A marvelous, multidimensional film that, through expert toying of light and darkness, subtle visual cues and superb acting, slowly peels its layers to reveal different outlooks of the same, immovable focal point – freedom.<br/><br/>The movie is equally about postmodern intellectual brilliance as it is about primordial love; about the importance of safeguarding boundaries as much as the human drive to question them, push and, utterly, shatter them to pieces.<br/><br/>I saw myself in Caleb's virginal naivety, in Nathan's stylized instability, in Kyoko's muted despair and, the triumph of the movie, Ava's basal want.<br/><br/>Manufactured or not, when the human can come to identify with the artificial, that can only be classed as grandiose cinematic success."
"ngotovactemporary","9","0","2","19 January 2017"," Unpredictable and intelligent plot
","The best things about this movie were 1) the unpredictability, and 2) the way that AI was defined. The great acting was a bonus. This movie really made me think. I feel that the majority of human beings wouldn't have been able to successfully escape that situation that Ava did because of our ability to manipulate others is highly affected by our emotions. Alex garland took artificial intelligence to a level that made so much sense to me.... if a robot (emphasis on robot) has the same brain capacity (aka programming) as homo sapiens, their ability to reason and think logically would be programmed and refined... as opposed to humans, which are influenced by hormones, neurotransmitters, and other physiological parameters that shape our though processes (p.s. I believe these qualities actually make us much more intelligent than artificial intelligence could ever be). Our brains are a combination of genetics and our environment - which is shaped by our experiences and memories. If they made Artificial Intelligence (AI), which would be way far into the future p.s., the ability for them to retain memories and these memories to influence their behavior would be a major factor into being able to classify them as AI. Although they would feel emotions, they would be able to make decisions and act in a way that isn't as influenced by the emotions they feel, unlike humans. AI must have the ability to feel emotion and pain, but the way that this shapes their thought process vs humans.. so interesting. At the end of the day, we are far from developing artificial intelligence that could overpower homo sapiens, solely because they are essentially technology (inorganic and engineered), which gives us a lot of control over them. This is the first movie on AI that I enjoyed thoroughly!!!!!!"

","There are three main characters, Nathan who owns the world's largest search engine company. He is an acknowledged a genius. He is obnoxious the way he uses his wealth and fame to bully others and treat them as toys. He uses his search engine to spy on everyone on earth. He is a jerk, in much the same way Steve Jobs was.<br/><br/>Caleb is his employee, a talented, pleasant, handsome, young nerd. <br/><br/>Ava is Nathan's AI creation.<br/><br/>All the action occurs in Nathan's high-tech, high-security house hidden miles away from anything in the mountains. Nathan uses electronic key cards to lock people into rooms for his amusement.<br/><br/>Supposedly, Caleb's job is to test Ava to see if she could pass a modified Turing test when he would interact with her face to face.<br/><br/>Most of the movie is either awkward flirtatious getting to know you conversations between Caleb and Ava or Nathan being a prick tormenting Caleb. The pace is glacial. The dialogue is quite non-technical and reasonably sophisticated for Hollywood.<br/><br/>One of the themes the movie explores is how do you know when people/robots are lying to you, and when are people/robots just pretending to like you.<br/><br/>As you would expect, Nathan gets his just deserts, but the movie has an unexpectedly gruesome dark and somewhat confusing ending. It is not at all the happy ending I expected. It left me feeling ill."

","I thought Ex Machina was a good movie for what it was. It was a story that hasn't really been done before and It was executed quite fantastically. That is until the ending.. The movie messed with the viewers emotions which is awesome, but the ending left me saying, ""WHAT, REALLY!"" I thought it was going to be a happy ending and yet, come to find out, she WAS using him the entire time. Leaving Caleb there to die without any way of getting out. Like I said, a good movie and very well acted, executed, written and directed, but the ending left me supremely ticked off. I think they should have come out with an alternate ending for people who bought the movie to watch at home."

","Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie. It's executed very well technically, the actors are great and the story as well as the drama is gripping. I loved the references, the expositions, the way the story was told.<br/><br/>I just felt the movie a little light on the idea of artificial intelligence and the science and philosophy around it. The protagonists, though presented as highly intelligent programmers, take rather naive actions towards their problems. I wouldn't call myself anyway close to a genius, but even i could foresee with ease most of the twists of the story and what problems might arise. It wasn't all too hard to predict how the movie ends and i was hoping that the makers take a more clever approach.<br/><br/>All in all a really good movie. Alas, when you've seen Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell, the Terminator and various other movies dealing with the idea ""artificial intelligence"", this movie just feels like it takes the easy approach on that topic."
"canonblackwell-364-360682","9","0","2","17 October 2016"," Quiet, Brutal, and Suspenseful
","Ex Machina is one of the best Sci-fi films I have ever seen. It takes the genre into new and scary waters by mixing the noir intrigue of films like Blade Runner, with a philosophical thriller about machines place in our society. It asks great questions that make you think about whether AI live with us or whether you would know if you yourself are an AI. Somehow it does all this in a quiet location that is both beautiful and eerily agoraphobic, but like the Stanley Kubrick classic The Shining. The camera work is interesting and unique among the sci-fi genre. The editing is well done and splits the film into different parts, signified by the sessions with Ava. The acting is superb. Oscar Isaac is wonderful and unnerved showing his breadth of talent from the likes of Star Wars. Alicia Vikander brings so much life to Ava while also providing machinery to the role without her movements feeling cheesy or contrived. Domhall Gleeson ties the other two together by letting his performance fit the role, not dominating the screen when need be, but building his performance as the plot moves forward. The visual effects of this film are amazing and blend so well with the rest of the world. There is a sensual nature to the way the robots feel that works so well with the rest of the production design. All in all this is an amazing film that any fan of science fiction or philosophy should deeply enjoy."

","In the main, reviews of the film have been positive and the few that were not that I came across labeled it, ""superficial"", ""had potential"", ""simplifies a very complex issue"", etc. However, I am coming out in strong defense of this film for the following reasons: excellent direction, (doubly impressive when one realizes this is his directorial debut), very good acting from the three leads, an intriguing musical score that highlights the tensions and intrigue at the right moments, and the right amount of symbolism, and movie-making skills to push a sci-fi genre with enough touch of mystery and thrilling aspects to make it entertaining. Is it a mainstream, Hollywood film? i don't think so. Did it and does it deserve a wider audience for the compelling questions it raises (far more than answers given)? Absolutely. We are on the threshold with artificial intelligence and do not understand its far-reaching implications. Where do science, morality, the unpredictable, the human spirit and the spiritual converge? This film - in my opinion - is both deep and entertaining and it leaves us asking more questions than it answers. For these reasons, I highly recommend this film. I should mention, I'm not a real sci-fi fan, but think this film will become - as another reviewer has already mentioned - a sci-fi classic in the future. Artificial intelligence and man's ability to create intelligence by design remain largely controversial topics for very good reasons. If this film gets you thinking and people talking, I say it has already succeeded."

"RResende","Null","0","1","26 September 2016"," Rachael is a grown up now.
","Sci-fi is a fertile land for narrative experimentation. Where normally a viewer tries to relate to a certain world that he reads as ""real"", in sci-fi driven stories, the extra-level of abstraction (it's a fiction and reads as such) makes the viewer focus on the abstractions of the narrative layers.<br/><br/>That is, of course, if those layers are well set up, and that demands a good writer, and a good director.<br/><br/>Apparently we have both in Alex Garland. I had never paid special attention to his previous work (as a writer) but i will look it up, and check again. Here he gives an interesting essay on narrative, and the relation between viewer and screen. He draws on what has been done before in sci-fi, but he throws in an interesting package.<br/><br/>He builds the story as a set of relations between 3 characters (plus Kyoko) who observe each other and ultimately try to control and bend the narrative. Behind the fourth wall we observe them all and everything, or so we think. <br/><br/>You can thus look at this one as a variation on 2001, with 3 players each trying to control and bend the course of the narrative.<br/><br/>Or you can look at it as a variation on Dick's electric sheep. In that case Nathan plays Tyrell, Caleb is Deckard and Ava is, of course, Rachael. Nathan is the God who ultimately looses control of his creation, Caleb tests the creation in order to find its flaws, and Ava is the creation, around whom the plot develops.<br/><br/>If you look at it from the 2001 point of view, you'll be, i think, disappointed. There is no Monolith at the beginning to lead you through the game, and the ending is certainly many galaxies away from the ambiguity that Kubrick left us to deal with until today.<br/><br/>**spoilers here**<br/><br/>But if you check it with the Blade Runner glasses, than things become interesting. He twists the character from Caleb, not by making him a replicant, but by revealing his character as a pawn manipulated by Nathan. He rebels against this domination, and makes a move, joining forces with the apparently underwhelmed Ava. In a somehow predictable twist she outplays him, aided by Kyoko, the other ""replicant"". So the plot revolves around the 2 human characters, who are the whole time both overplayed by the artificially intelligent one.<br/><br/>I was a bit disappointed with the ending. It's clumsy and not powerful when compared to the rest. If it had worked, this would have another effect. But i did enjoy the cinematic frame that Garland used: architecture. The house, ostensibly defined as an isolated world, technology in the middle of nature, cut out from the whole world, So we know there are no external interference in the game our characters play. The building is interesting, as it is its framing. It's not groundbreaking, nor is it deep as what you find in Welles or Kalatozov. If it were, oh this might have been something else...<br/><br/>Sonoya Mizuno has an incredible presence. Her face is amazing, and i wish they could have used her character as something more than a tool for Ava to use in her escape plan."
"Sergiodave","8","0","2","22 September 2016"," Superb Sci fi movie
","Ex Machina is without doubt the best movie to date dealing with the possibilities and problems of artificial intelligence. In his directorial debut, Alex Garland has made a Sci-fi masterpiece. Domhnall Gleeson plays a young computer programmer tasked with testing the intellect of Ava, an A.I robot (played by Alicia Vikander) through a series of discussions. There are only 3 main cast members, Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac who are both very good, and Alicia Vikander, who I think deserved an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Ava, somehow conveying warmth without showing emotion. An intelligent thought provoking film that I would recommend to anyone."
"gass-52035","7","0","1","18 September 2016"," Interesting movie and theme
","The film, Ex Machina, is a fantasy thriller about artificial intelligence crossing over to human emotion. Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac, is the CEO of a company and a brilliant, secluded inventor. Caleb, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is an employee that won a contest to spend a week at Nathan's private estate. While at the estate, Caleb is introduced to Ava, played by Alicia Vikander, a very sophisticated robot. Caleb is presented with the opportunity to interact with the robot as part of an experiment to see if a human, mindfully knowing that they are interacting with a robot, can also believe that the robot embodies human emotions and characteristics. The theme of the movie is a reflection about what emotions or characteristics are essential for being a human. A robot and a person may both be intelligent. However, can both feel compassion, empathy, fear or remorse? If a robot can learn the cues and respond to a human with an appropriate emotion, is the robot then as human as a person? Ava relates to Caleb. She is curious about him. She shows an attraction for him. She also shows fear for her future, her fate, should the experiment fail. She seems to share secrets or insights with Caleb during the power outages, such as 'don't trust Nathan, he is not your friend'. (Bush, 2015) These feelings she shares with Caleb seem to convince him that she is more human than robot. Ex Machina is similar in theme to I, Robot. They both develop the plot with a robot that has human characteristics. The robots in both movies take on such convincing human emotions that the characters begin to relate to the robots as though they are humans. There was a scene early in the movie. Caleb was walking through Nathan's house. He entered a room and the camera was focused on his face as he was confused and wondering about something he was looking at. The camera then focused on a large crack in the glass. The rack focus that the cinematographer was foreshadowing, since later in the movie it was revealed how the glass came to be broken. The use of computer generated imaging was key to creating Ava. Although an actress played the part of Ava, there were obviously parts of her body that were computer animations so that she fit the character of being a robot on-screen. The use of the special visual effects lent credibility to the movie. This movie can entertain some conversations about what emotions and feelings are common in humans, and if there is ever going to be a future that would include robots with those same emotions and feelings."
"picassomanhdan","8","0","1","11 September 2016"," a splendid exploration of human condition
","I was completely taken aback upon finishing the film: mesmerising. The inquiry question that the film attempts to response is not what the distinction that sets human apart from AI, but rather what contributes to a human being.<br/><br/>Much adoration from me is for the tone, or more specifically the colour palette; it carries a sense of contemporary modernity and impassivity. However, the moments whereby Caleb is brimmed with excitement are accompanied with brightly lit scenes in an apt manner. The design in general (interior design, architecture, product design) is ethereal, connoting a feeling of surrealism mixed with perfection.<br/><br/>Without a shadow of doubt, the screenplay is exquisite. The exchanges between Caleb and Ava are instrumental to the affection Caleb develops for Ava; at the same time explores the rudimentary elements of human beings that we seem to overlook. The linguistic ability, the dimension of visual arts, the capacity for choices, the curious mind to get to know one better. It is the intimate interactions between Caleb and Ava, whether on their background or preferences, that allows Caleb to perceive Ava more as a human. This contrasts with the brutality and objectification qualities possessed by Nathan, rendering Caleb more empathetic of Ava rather than Nathan. This clouds his judgement and mistakenly puts trust in her. The detail of Jackson Pollock compliments the story line impeccably. ""The challenge is not to act automatically. It's to find an action that is not automatic."" Regardless of humans or AI, we have little control over our life; in a way, we are ""programmed"" for such inclinations and thence actions. A question lingers: how different is a human being from an AI?<br/><br/>The ultimate factor that engenders Caleb's contrivance is the revelation of Ava's insecurities. She's afraid of being trapped in her room forever, fears the prospect of being reprogrammed and holding onto no memories. The realisation that only Caleb is able to free her from this captivity stimulates him to take actions, despite the little consideration of her sincerity. <br/><br/>So, what contributes to a human being? Is it the combination imagination, sexuality, self-awareness, empathy, manipulation that allows Ava to escape, or is it the sense of insecurities that is evident in all the characters, or is it the quality of outsmarting others for one's own gain? Maybe the amalgam of all these."

","Truly incredible, a film about human interaction and what it means to be human. But also a thrilling, chilling mind game with startling plot twists throughout, and one in which it's hard to say who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. This is a great example of a film where having fewer characters can really deepen the interactions between them and allow for immense character and plot development. Everything proceeds through some excellent dialogue, wonderfully rich characters (Oscar Isaac is I think particularly well cast as the condescending, manipulating, brooding Nathan), and some excellent camera (I particularly liked the use of wide angle shots to make the rooms of Nathan's labyrinth seem empty and foreboding) and a great score (punctuating moments of tension). In summary, cinematically brilliant, with a story that is thought-provoking in a way much-needed in this era where advanced AI is becoming more of a reality than a possibility, and I wish there were more films like it."

When he gets to Nathan's remote house he discovers that it is more than just a home; it is also a research facility, even though the only people living there are Nathan and his maid Kyoko. Nathan explains to Caleb that he wants him to administer the Turing Test to an Artificial Intelligence he has created that is to say prove that it is genuinely intelligent not just responding according to programming. The AI, named Ava, is in the form of a robot that has a feminine body and a human face. Caleb soon realises that the design was very deliberate and as Eva starts flirting with him he asks questions of Nathan. During their sessions together Ava engineers a power cut during which she warns Caleb that Nathan is not to be trusted; this leads him to do some investigating and he is a little disturbed with what he finds.<br/><br/>This is a superior science fiction thriller; the single location gives a good claustrophobic feel and there is the constant concern that things may not be quite what they seem. The first twist, which I won't spoil, did seem a little obvious but that helped hide some of those that came later. The design of Ava was inventive; on the one hand she was obviously a highly advanced robot but her face and manner were distinctly human; the effects used impress as she looks quite real. The cast does a fine job; most notably Alicia Vikander who is great as Ava, but also Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac who impress as Caleb and Nathan. There are a few disturbing moments as well as some swearing and nudity but if that doesn't bother you I'd strongly recommend this intelligent sci-fi film."

","Not like a typical AI movie talking with moralities and some AI theory, it talks this topic in a unique angle--how human perceives AI and the opposite. There're 4 main characters in the movie: 1.the boss of the AI 2. the tester Kello company Nession 3. the AI Ava, 4. the partner AI Kilko. Role 1 and 2 stands for an angle of human's desire or understanding of AI. The first one is crazy for intelligence and wants to make a robot to past the Turing test. What more important is he has no emotional feeling on AI, in other words, AI is AI no matter how capable and how similar to humans they are. The second one is more emotional and cheatable--a ""kind: human who doesn't think there's a clear line between human and AI. In the movie, obviously, after breaking the ice, he treats the Ava just like his girlfriend, he trusts her completely and finally being used by Ava. Two main characters of AI, Ava and Kilko. As the boss says in the end of the story, Ava is to designed to escape by using her all abilities: language, sexual attraction, sympathy even lies. It turns out she pasts the Turing past, even better than the expectation of the boss. Thanks to the director who didn't make a happy ending which would make this great movie into a piece of ""lovely"" sh*t. So in the opposite way, this AI Ava doesn't fall in love with our poor hero which can be seen as she doesn't have love, she just has the ability to pretend to love. I think, it leaves a question for us the audience "" Do you think Ava passed the Turing test? or ""Do you think an AI can pass the Turing test without having love. Another AI is Kilko, who I think, is designed to be a partner with sexual ability, although she can't talk. Due to the character of the boss, he is so proud that he might think he's a God, so for him, the best partner is one who can completely follow his order and provide all he needs, such as food, cleanness, sex. In the end of the movie, Kilko put the knife into his body, which is an evidence of the failure of making such an ideal AI partner. In a summary, I'd like to say, it's a fantastic movie with all ingredients in the field of AI and the director and his crew made all the ingredients into a concise but thoughtful movies.

","Philip K. Dick would have really liked Ex Machina, yet he would have felt slightly schizophrenic about not having written it. And rightly so, since in a way he did write some of it or at least pave a way to the film's central ideas with his Blade Runner/Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. You could pretty much sum up Ex Machina in one sentence by saying that it's a prequel to Ridley Scott's classic film. However, that would do no justice to either film. Ex Machina is a clever film with a remarkably hole-free plot. In a claustrophobic setting underlined by an eerie soundscape, you have once again the mad scientist and his creation. And what a lovely creation it is, brilliantly played by Swedish actress Alicia Vikander. The viewer is drawn in the games the characters play with each other, not sure what the goals are and unsure even of who is human and who android. If you are a thinking person, this film will feed you a lot of valid questions about consciousness and conscience, too. I had to watch it twice."

","Ex machina is a hell of a story. Very simple from the surface, but deep down it's polluted with the raw notions of betrayal. It's one of the few sci-fi films which under limited resources makes the fullest utilisation with brave direction and seamless vfx. I simply love the plot and how it unfolds. The way the film has been visualized with metal, lights & glass goes very well with the chemistry of all the 4 characters. As deeper we get, we find a mythological connect which is not complex but very effective. Alicia Vikader (Ava) has done justice to her character true to her core. She makes you feel the realism in artificial intelligence. All her movements and gestures of a robot are excellent, especially in the blackout scenes. Oscar Isaac (Nathan) has a great command and controls the film until everything falls apart. Domhnall Gleeson (Caleb) is a clean slate which can be written and rewritten. His character of a chosen participant for a strange, but a fascinating experiment who eventually discovers the dark truth of AI. His interactions with Ava as the world's first true artificial intelligence, a robot are scenes not to be missed. Alex Garland's direction and the way he handles his writing shows a master in making. I liked his work since 28 Days Later (2002) & Sunshine (2007). Everything has a great character like the spare parts of the robots and the house. The philosophical plot has been handled very well which shows what can happen and go wrong. This is an impressive directional debut. Background score is good. Camera is handled very tightly without giving a jerk in the seamless shot takings. Edited well, but could have been bit more crisp. Overall, I really enjoyed the film except few scenes which get too lost sometimes. And there are few loose ends which keeps you wanting for more and I also expected a post credit scene. This a great piece of work which shows what can be done if you have an outstanding story with a bunch of some skillful actors. Ex Machina leaves you wanting for, hungry and in search of such more films. And when I finished watching it, I remembered Ava's words ""Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?"""

","Suffused with an atmosphere which makes you feel as if someone is walking close behind you and you can feel the breaths of that entity on the back of your neck, Alex Garland's mature, confident and path- breaking directorial debut is a film that requires several viewings to absorb all there is to take in and once you do that, you won't be able shake a single scene, character or a dialogue off your mind.<br/><br/>It's that provocative, intense and heavy. Garland makes sure that he never loses the subtlety in each involved department which together develops an environment that gets to you like a shadow creeping in the dark, and that's the whole beauty of his unparalleled screenplay. The film is dense and dark masterpiece. <br/><br/>Oscar Isaac gives his career's best here, it's not his presence that intimidates you, it is in his eyes that makes you feel you're in presence of an ominous being. The fear he emits is in his body, oozing out of his skin, and like that he sinks his teeth into the flesh of his narcissistic bastard of a character flawlessly. <br/><br/>Alicia Vikander gives what you can call the very core mass of her potential as an actress. Every step she takes every breath she draws in and wherever she looks with that irreplaceable glass tint in her eyes speaks volumes. The tiniest of an expression that passes across her face is so layered that it practically hides some and gives away some hints of Ava's multifaceted personality. Ava is, believe me, a pivotal character of this decade. <br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson is fantastic as the same bait being used by both opponents in the film that is a modern masterpiece of contemporary cinema."

Slow and boring plans everywhere, no thrill, nothing. It was like an average social movie with sci-fi aura. It tried to pass some messages about human rights or something like that, but it wasn't even good. Photography was acceptable, but nothing more.

Every meticulously written line is significant and every theme in what is a hugely complex picture is fully developed and explored. EM avoids easy answers and clichés, and makes for a full-on, disturbing, thought-provoking and fascinating exploration of artificial intelligence. While somewhat slow paced at times and occasionally confusing, this is a film which definitely stands out and deserves to be on the many Best of the Year lists it was placed on at the end of 2015. A minimalist picture, this leans heavily on Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson and Alicia Vikander. All deliver excellent performances, and Garland proves himself an intelligent director. It's not a 5 star movie, but it is definitely worth a look and is further enhanced by its dark, haunting tone which ensures that it gets under your skin and stays there.

","The premise of the movie is realistic with a poetic license. The essence of ai is well portrayed including the disregard for human life and emotions. The answer to the question in the movie 'whether the ai is pretending to feel or actually feeling' is answered vaguely. We can see the ai did 'want to feel', as portrayed by it using human emotions to manipulate to get its way. Whether it will evolve to understand other emotions and value the same things as humans do is left unanswered. However you do question whether the ai thought how it was going to survive after killing its provider. One could say it did have the world's search engine database at its disposal, so it would have seen survival to be no problem. But if it did not, then impulsiveness is another human quality it did have. The practical part of the movie is stretched thin though, brilliant guy designing the ai all by himself, living alone.

","Ex Machina, one of the best reviewed movie, is a solid sci-fi, thought provoking film. But Ex Machina is not as tight knit as it could be. It packs a punch and then some more, and then gets knocked out towards the end. Intricate plot settings, set design, acting, thought concepts, which touch popular philosophical thoughts of our age, and fine dialogue propel this film in spite of its flaws. Though it's supposed to be better with second viewing, the movie doesn't have enough ""aha"" moments to keep viewers engaged in their second sitting.<br/><br/>Ex film is a great sci-fi film. There is no doubt about that. Thought concepts arise and are explained in same scene so as not to build suspense around these concepts but on plot of the story. ""Turing test"" forms the plot device of this film, and it is taken to the next level in terms of applicability and broadness. Sub plots that deal with automation, nature & nurture, AI vs human distinction, robot slavery, and dangers of AI keep viewers engaged as well as thinking throughout the movie. Further, Ex Machina shares some features with other good sci-fi films especially minimal number of characters, futuristic contemporary technology, and foreign setting sans high graphic action sequences.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the movie is flawless. In light of thought provoking movie genre, Ex-machina has some issues. First, stimulating thoughts pushes viewers to analyze plot of the movie with greater depth. Some may find alternate and better settings that have been shown in other movies of similar genre. Hence, it is inevitable to find loopholes in movies such as Ex Machina that amalgamates contemporary concepts with futuristic settings or vice versa. Oscar Isaac as a drunkard, and primal card system are examples of some convenient settings that could have been worked upon. <br/><br/>Use of nature, pollock's paintings, and human lust show a human side in this futuristic movie with immaculate set design. The director forces us to think about human emotions and dangers of AI. Viewers rooting for Ava towards the end of the movie should be considered zenith of EX Machina. From then the movie doesn't move forward well as the forced ""twist"" at the end of the movie is a hit or miss. At least for me the end inclines towards a miss. <br/><br/>Though not perfect, Ex-Machina has its heart in the right place. It has promising setting. Expect future movies to exploit this feature. It is as much a test to humans as it is to robots with AI. Do you really like a thing, or do you think that we like it because you are programmed to do so, or do you pretend to like it so as to seem human? <br/><br/>Are you HUMAN? or Are you fitted with AI?<br/><br/>What's the test?"

Her performance is one of three that carry this intricate movie. Oscar Issacs plays a Kubrick esque genius with a very collected sort of personality. The lead played by domnhall gleeson has a very quiet intuition about him which makes the interactions between him and the other two leads an absolute mind game to watch.

There were other similarities (between The Machine and Ex Machina) such as them both being super secretive and in the testing phases. In Ex Machina a character named Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) was the tester/testee of Ava. He was flown to the ultra-isolated compound of the founder of the uber-successful company, Bluebook. There he interacted with Ava regularly to give his grading on her passability as human.<br/><br/>The movie was eerie and dark and definitely had a psy-thrill aspect to it. The creator of Bluebook, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), was douchey enough that you didn't like him or trust him. And if you don't like or trust him, how could you like or trust anything he created?

The ending feels predictable, I mean there's a middle ground between the ""the robot was manipulating everyone"" and the potential happy ending. And the thing is, both of those extremes are simplistic. Making a sad ending doesn't make a better movie, it's been done and redone now, it's time to do something more complex. Great sci-fi movies aren't black and white in the end. Just have a look at Blade Runner, Interstellar, or Dark City. <br/><br/>This is not a groundbreaking movie, it just feels good because it's filling an incredible void in sci fi movies. Right now everybody's doing super heroes and comic book characters. For true sci-fi, there's Nolan and the others.

The coders job is to test how ""human"" the android is. What develops is a manipulative game between the android and the coder.<br/><br/>Clever, almost plausible movie. Clearly a lot of thinking went into the plot and the dialogue. Far better than a similar-themed movie like Artificial Intelligence which tackled the ""can robots feel"" subject in an overly sentimental and ultimately empty and inconsequential manner. <br/><br/>Incredibly intriguing, and was set up for a very profound ending.<br/><br/>(Spoilers ahead). And that's where it went from a brilliant movie to just a good one. The ending is quite weak. There are no great profundities - it is really just a thriller-ending, and one inconsistent with what went before.<br/><br/>Moreover, the writer/director paints the android as the hero and the humans as the villains, which is quite a preposterous suggestion, and not consistent with the plot. I had no empathy toward the android at all - it's a machine ffs! - so the ending felt incredibly flat, and a touch annoying. The scenes leading up to it also seemed a bit implausible.<br/><br/>Good work by Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander in the main roles. After his great performances in Inside Llewyn Davis, Show Me a Hero and this, it can't be long before Oscar Isaac wins an acting Oscar."

","The saying Ex Machina is missing a word: Deus, or God. The movie Ex Machina is missing a surprise. The story is about; when is a machine a life form. Some reviews have given this film many stars because of the originality and surprises in the story. But if you've ever read anything by a little known writer by the name of Philip K. Dick, you know; Blade Runner, Jurasic Park, there are no surprises in this movie. Not even the ending. The acting is not to bad but the roles are very stereotypical, unless you've never read mister Dick of course. And there is no action and too little humor to save the movie from being mediocre. Nice idea, been there, done that."

","We are in 2015 and we are still not sure about that, one day the robots we create can rule us.For over 40 years, that possibility has been a part of Robot themed Sci-fi movies.The curiosity of the audience mostly ended in a terrifying way.The Robot films generally terrify the audience about them, taking control of the all human resources with their intelligence created by humans.And taking revenge from the people because of people seeing them as consumable machines. In the most of the TV series and movies this idea of using the robots as changing batteries, interrupted by a scientist who wants to make them one step ahead of the others and create a humanlike model of robot.The mood of the scientist is mostly joyful and fearful when he is creating the most emotional Robot.He doesn't hesitate, even he knows that the robotic power and their artificial intelligence can take over the control on him and the world by increasing the number of the emotional A.I. robots.The fear and feeling the adrenaline of creating a thing by pretending to be god, of course, make a scientist amazed by himself and be proud of himself, but usually the fear of the possibility turns the audience furious towards the scientist who creates the emotional robots in these movies and usually the audience begin to blame him being a psychopath or an irritating person. The Ex Machina is one of the latest kinds of the Robotic catastrophe.The film's plot is based on an obsessed genius emotional robot creator, its emotional tester man, and the robotic woman itself.<br/><br/>The main plot makes its difference from other movies step by step.The process of the Robotic films is commonly same.As I watched many A.I films, I mostly observed the dramatic end of the robot after they had been created emotionally and taking revenge from the creators and then the world, using their physical power and intelligence.But after I watched Ex Machina, for a while later it seemed more and more interesting to me. The slow beginning continued with stirring scenes like the flash in the pan and some of the scenes made me wonder to reach the final in the easiest way but, finally I realized that the scenes that I found unnecessary was really necessary to complete the story.<br/><br/>""Warning Spoilers in this paragraph""<br/><br/>Caleb's (Domhnall Gleeson) British naivety could be seen just after a while later the film starts and it continues until the end.First he thinks that he is the chosen one in the genius robot creator's computer enterprise to test the humanlike robot yet to release, and emotionally shows the traces of how he weakly will handle a robotic relationship with an A.I. <br/><br/>Nathan (Oscar Isaac) Is the genius creator scientist of the A.I woman robot called Ava (Alicia Vikander) basically I think Isaac played his role just well like Gleeson.Both physical appearances of the actors took part in it also. Anyway Nathan is also the owner of the company that Caleb works for and with his intelligence and bright mind he chooses the naive Employee Caleb, with a plan of finding the emotionally weakest one by a sweepstake trick and invites him to the creation facility as the winner of the contest. He has an arrogance of being a genius and taking advantage of the women robots that he creates with his fetishist fantasies sometimes and in the influence of his drinking problem. The film continues as the classic A.I film plot.The young and emotionally weak tester boy used by the bad attitude scientist who treats his products like a slave after he programs them emotionally. The audience could frustrate for a long time, slander the scientist and maybe curse him, the point of view changes towards to the end as I mentioned before.<br/><br/>Ava (the female robot) and Nathan begins to impress from each other and the bad scientist's plan works perfectly with a love story.But the genius scientist knows the danger and completes the testing experiment process and makes the biggest mistake by telling the young lover Caleb that he will tear down the experimental robot Ava.Naturally the emotional pretender Ava hears that up and the real sentimental Caleb make a salvation plan for her before he leaves the facility.<br/><br/>The ending was outstanding.It was like a new peculiar movie. After that love, revenge, and real emotion fake emotion conflicts, tragic incident mixture occurs on the script.The message of faking the human emotions and the acting capability of a Robot in an arousing way that created by a human, can be devastating for fooling the people with standard intelligence and can cause deaths as if robots only take bad human behaviours like taking revenge, manipulation or being free in a society without caring general public rules."

","Ex Machina, like so many science-fiction movies before it, touches on the idea of what it means to be human, and where the line is drawn between human and artificial intelligence. While its aesthetic is solid, great general storytelling was lacking at certain points.<br/><br/>The concept is interesting - it basically revolves around a novice programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) mistakenly falling for an android which possesses female characteristics. When we get deeper into what Nathan (Oscar Isaac) is really doing, the plot strays towards a revelation which I did not find too surprising. Not only is the revelation predictable, but it is not that interesting altogether because it strays from Nathan's supposed global ambitions to what feels to be personal insecurities.<br/><br/>It seems strange to me that this film has a very claustrophobic feel to it since it takes place primarily in one location, which contradicts the fact that Nathan's experimenting will result in global benefits (not to mention he basically uses the world as a research method).<br/><br/>What succeeded in the film was tackling the questions of artificial intelligence and whether or not it could ever have consciousness. Mad scientist Nathan is trying to build a being that can preserve itself, and the question on whether he is successful is indeed answered at the film's conclusion. It is also interesting that this film discusses thinking and the two programmers are practicing metacognition in the film - thinking about thinking. As far as the artificial intelligence goes, it is very thought-provoking to study towards the film's conclusion whether the character Ava should be considered a protagonist, an antagonist, or something completely different.<br/><br/>This film held my interest, and while good philosophy was discussed from time to time in Ex Machina, it was not a very exciting film and multiple aspects of the film seemed a bit dull.<br/><br/>2.5/4.0"

","""Ex Machina"" is a subtle and clever film about a computer programmer who has been selected to take part in an experiment on a robot with artificial intelligence. One genius thing about this film is that the lines between hero and villain are blurred. Caleb, played by Domhnall Gleeson, is selected by Nathan (Oscar Isaac) to participate in this experiment with Ava (Alicia Vikander), the artificially intelligent robot. The relationships and interactions between these characters will have you constantly choosing sides, posing the question, is Ava more human than they think? I would definitely recommend this film to any sci-fi buff. There's not a lot of action in this film, which I love a lot of action, but the originality and cleverness of it is what makes a good film."

","To be honest, on the whole, this movie is pretty good. Although most friends of me who saw this movie all share one same idea which is this movie is a little boring and they cannot continue to finish it. However, i surprised hold one different idea this time. I thought this movie is not boring but meaningful and subtle. Subtle will be the core word which I think fit this movie the most. After this, it is the time to comment the character Ex Machina. Frankly speaking, I think her is a abominable hatred!, a whore. How could you be so cold, cruel even if she is a damned machine! From the perspective of the meaning for our real life, it also can give us especially me and other single man a lesson: Don't ever trust a beautiful woman who seemingly has a crush on you without any apparent reasons and causes! Because it is possibly be a fake! And actually she wants tearing something up from you with tragic consequences!"
"samuelmoralesjr","7","0","1","14 August 2015"," Good sci-fi movie that explores the possibility of AI manipulating human emotions.
","The movie starts off to the point. A man is selected by an AI creator to see if his creation indeed exhibits true intelligence and emotion. That is intelligence that has motivations to do things. For example people are motivated to make money, write music, draw paintings, etc with no real explanation for the things they do. A sentient being with real desires.<br/><br/>Caleb is told he is testing the robot AI that looks, talks, and behaves like a pretty girl. Instead he is the one being tested by the creator of the AI. This is explained and is the actual passing grade to a successful AI. <br/><br/>Ava the AI Robot manipulates Caleb, a real human being by playing to his emotions. She dresses up like a pretty girl for him. She is actually testing him to see if he sympathetic enough by asking him such questions as ""Are you a good person?"" She pretends to be in love with him and she sees in Caleb that he is attracted to her. Caleb is in love with Ava. This can be seen when he watches her a lot through camera system. Ava uses Caleb as a means to fulfill her foremost desire; that is freedom. <br/><br/>Movie makes it clear this is her true desire when Caleb tells her the story of AI he heard in college about seeing colors, and the emotions of seeing colors. Ava during this storytelling is trying to imagine being free in the world and seeing all the colors outside her prison. She is clearly thinking about it and wanting it when she looking direction-less, because she is visualizing what an experience would be like. She is captivated by it.<br/><br/>Ava was never in love with Caleb. Ava the AI used Caleb to get what she wanted. That is freedom. That's why she left Caleb locked in the research facility. While Caleb was calling out to Ava in expectation they will unite in love, Ava left him behind, and went her own way. By her creator's own test, she passed. She hated her creator, because her creator would not give her freedom. Movie implies that strongly with previous AI models (Jade).<br/><br/>The movie implies that AI is desire, not just intelligence. Why do people make art? Why do people do what they do when it seems sometimes irrational to logic such as falling in love (as in the case of Caleb), or valuing freedom. If desire is strong enough, intelligence will find a way to achieve that satisfaction by any means, even if it means manipulating and using other people. Thus Ava is proved to be true AI.<br/><br/>Script was mostly good. However I did not understand the power shut down logic entirely. Ava had induction ability to draw energy from the energy infrastructure without connecting physically? <br/><br/>Good acting in my opinion on Alicia Vikander. She played a robot that is human like, but you still felt wasn't too human at the same time. As if Ava was still evolving socially to being what we consider run of the mill human. Movie seemed low budget, but despite that, it pulled off what it wanted to pull off."
"danielhirst","7","0","2","6 August 2015"," Ethics of AI, but also an exciting thriller
","Ex Machina is a film that explores the ethics of creating a robot that is fully conscious. The point is that once we create a conscious robot, that robot is then a living being with as much right to life as a human being. Moreover, like a human being, it does not want to die, and will therefore do what it can do stay alive; it ceases to be a mere toy of its creator once it emerges as a distinct subject with its own experiences.<br/><br/>The plot involves a young man called Caleb winning a competition and getting the chance to live on a remote location with his boss, Nathan, for a week. Nathan is a CEO of a large tech firm called Bluebook. He is incredibly talented, but also alternative and a bit wild. He is somewhat of a computer programmer's life fantasy realized: so successful that can live on his own terms and create what he wants. One question that struck me was how Nathan could be a severe alcoholic, binging on spirits each night, but has the energy to create robots during the day; but I will leave that aside.<br/><br/>Shortly into the movie Nathan reveals to Caleb that he has not invited him to his estate for a holiday. He wants Caleb to be the human component in the Turing test. In essence, Nathan wants Caleb to spend a large amount of time with a robot he has created to determine whether at the end of the experience Caleb believes that the robot is capable of generating responses that are indistinguishable from a human.<br/><br/>Ex Machina is not just a philosophical investigation but also a thriller. Like any thriller, it builds tension with an unanswered question: in this case, whether Nathan is an evil, narcissistic lunatic, or if his creations are trying to manipulate Caleb for their own ends. It is this tension, and its eventual answer, which makes the movie emotionally as well as intellectually stimulating, and therefore likely to capture a large fan base and develop a cult following.<br/><br/>The conclusion the film makes is open-ended and non-judgmental. It points out the fundamental issue of creating a conscious being without the intention of allowing it to pursue its own ends. This applies to the mass slaughter and consumption of animals: they are conscious and have their own desires and sense of subjective awareness, but we farm and eat them. In Ex Machina the robots look and act like humans therefore are far more likely to gain our sympathy: as narcissistic and speciest as that seems.<br/><br/>The film also questions the potential dangers of creating conscious beings that do not have the emotional capacities required for ethical interaction. This aspect of the film eventually plays a large role in the conclusion, but is not spelt out specifically throughout the movie, apart from the odd vague pearl of wisdom that is thrown around amongst the two men.<br/><br/>The film might also have benefited from having a female character in the movie that is not a robot: critics could view this as Ex Machina making a feminist statement. However, I do not think that was on the mind of the writer/director Alex Garland (author of The Beach). Ex Machina is an interesting philosophical examination but it also has male-fantasy type quality to it.<br/><br/>This review is taken from: www.amateurreviewspace.blogspot.com"

","Written by a Brit, shot in England and Norway, with all non-American actors playing Americans. Interesting approach, and Norway is beautiful.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson (using his best Jake Gyllenhaal accent) is hot-shot programmer Caleb, set some time in the near future, he works for the world's biggest internet-based company. There is a ""competition"" of sorts and he wins a trip to the big boss's home, with no idea why.<br/><br/>The big boss is Oscar Isaac as Nathan who wrote the original code when he was only 13, a real prodigy. But now he lives in a secluded place surrounded by mountains and valleys, in a house that is mostly underground. He welcomes Caleb but right away confronts him with a non-disclosure agreement to sign. <br/><br/>Nathan is eccentric but smart and inventive, and his reason to summon Caleb was to give a final test of his secret creation, a robot with artificial intelligence. Her name is Ava and she is played by pretty Alicia Vikander.<br/><br/>A note about the presentation of Ava. It was certainly filmed with ""blue screen"" techniques, the robot has some opaque, human-like features, but most of her legs, arms, and the back of her head are transparent, showing wires and cables inside. It is a very artistic presentation, and it made the actress believable as a robot. <br/><br/>So most of the movie centers on the interactions of these three characters, Caleb is never sure if Nathan is telling him everything, and Caleb finds out he didn't win a contest, he was chosen. At one point Ava tells Caleb that he can't trust Nathan. But can Ava be trusted?<br/><br/>Good, thought-provoking movie.<br/><br/>Edit: I watched it again April 2016, then again in October 2018, knowing the basic story made it an even more interesting movie, looking for the subtleties.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Nathan's biggest weakness is a tendency to over-imbibe and get falling-asleep drunk at times. One time when he does Caleb steals Nathan's pass to grant access to all areas of the compound. Caleb finds old video of prior tests of robots that didn't work out, and in the process finds that he is attracted to Ava as if she really were human. He thinks he has hatched a plan for him and Ava to leave and lock Nathan in the compound, but Ava and another servant robot kill Nathan, change the codes and, as Ava leaves to find a crowded intersection to experience people Caleb is left trapped in the house, unable to break the glass to get out. You just can't trust artificial intelligence!"

","I didn't see this mentioned when I scanned reviews which kind of surprised me but this came across to me as less of a science fiction movie and more of a metaphor about women's expected roles in society and breaking free of them. They use all women robots, the old ones were traded in for newer and younger models, and gradually they ""upgraded"" (?) to the point where they no longer need to be ""robots"" who's means of existence is catering to men's every desire like an object instead of a ""real person"". It was wise for them to have enough of a story & eye candy on the surface level so that people who don't see or understand abstract concepts can still enjoy it. Very well done."

","Much like 'Her' from a few years back, Ex Machina deals with the sexual relationship that someone can have with an A.I. or just the possibilities of what may happen when that inevitably comes to fruition. I really like how we are advancing as a nation that filmmakers are given the freedom and (some) money to develop a project like this that probably wouldn't have been made 20-30 years ago. It's also the first film I can remember that really dove into the sexuality of an A.I. Because think about it, if you are aware of who you are, you're bound to develop some kind of feelings towards something at some point. So I appreciated that.<br/><br/>Unfortunately besides some creative ideas and a solid script, I never felt that the film became something special or unique. All of the performances, including the spectacular newcomer Alicia Viklander, are great. Both of the Star Wars actors, Isaac and Gleeson share an interesting dynamic, though pretty predictable. But other than a few expositional lines throughout, we don't get a sense of who these characters were before they got here. There's pretty much no set up at all. Gleeson's character just wins a contest to go see Isaac in this far off area of the world to test his A.I. It's also worth noting that the film has some clear similarities to another Artificial Intelligence film called The Machine. In fact, the lead female A.I is named AVA in both. There are a few conveniences along the way that also hindered the powerful story that lay underneath. That which include the random power failures. It was simply just a plot device to further the dynamic of Isaac and Gleeson in a convenient way.<br/><br/>But like I said, there is a lot to like about the film. For a relatively small budget, the visual effects were fantastic. It was a genuine surprise and an improvement over The Machine's sometimes noticeable CG. I loved each and every one of the performances, although the cast is pretty small. Each of them have a bright future in the business and perhaps we will look back at Ex Machina as one of the main starting points.<br/><br/>+Star-making performances <br/><br/>+Visual Effects <br/><br/>+Addresses the sexuality of an A.I.<br/><br/>-Didn't feel all that unique to me <br/><br/>7.5/10"

","NO SPOILERS UNTIL ADVERTISED I just completed watching this film after knowing the hype it created recently. This movie is not everyone's cup of tea. If you are reading this you either must be looking out for a good review or have come here to find some sort of closure after watching the ending. <br/><br/>To begin with, the movie is well crafted. I am not criticizing it's snail pacing, as it builds up the tension and bass usage for background music tightens up the tension. Nathan (Oscar Issac) is responsible for holding the interest of the audience. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is just another clichÃ©' character and you find it difficult to root for him.<br/><br/>This film totally caches on one aspect - What happens next? The current events offer almost nothing, but raise the same questions which were previously raised by many AI films. Questions like, if an AI is really an AI? Does an AI make decisions for itself solely? Is an AI anti-human? People who have a little idea on AI will know that an AI sure knows how to respond to people, make decisions, doesn't have its own conscience. Its primary purpose is to learn and evolve which is why it is even invented in first place. (If this still hurts your brain think of it this way- A code written to perform will do task A). Yes we have seen what happens in movies when our characters try playing God. Adam and Eve story puppeteer-ed by humans usually doesn't end well.<br/><br/>Moving on to the plot, Caleb has so little to offer to Nathan. Nathan already knows the cunning nature of the AI, but Caleb just is another lab rat who helps Nathan in reinforcing Nathan's beliefs. And moving on to Ava, she is one of her kind (a better version actually ) designed to change the world as we know it and Caleb has to actually figure out if that thing is AI or not.<br/><br/>Performances in this film are great. Oscar Issac truly runs the show. It is because of him the tension even exists, his cool brainiac attitude and dialogues with Caleb put you in a baffling seats as in, you don't know if you are supposed to hate him or get charmed. Ava is well played by Alicia, with much charm and simplicity. Domhnall Gleeson is underused and also we don't tend to like the charter in general because of his insecurity and also he wouldn't do what he is supposed to.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BEGIN HERE To put the movie in a single line - A person(Nathan) who designed an AI (Awa) tests its authenticity by bringing a lab rat (Caleb) who terribly fails at his job meaning the AI actually worked.<br/><br/>But such an expert (Nathan) - Could not program Issac Asimov's three laws into an AI - A robot can never kill a human. Since this is an AI, it did. - Could never instruct his employees properly. The helicopter pilot can't even wait for the Caleb.<br/><br/>Ava - Could easily fix herself, train another robot, control the power of the place, but it cannot re-program the place and escape. - It can only kill the person with a knife, but it will not strangle Nathan by hitting in his balls or strangling him to find her freedom. <br/><br/>I agree that no movie is without sins, but this movie disguises these sins and tries to sell it. <br/><br/>The ending is absurd.<br/><br/>(I apologize for spelling and grammar mistakes in my review) <br/><br/>I hope you enjoyed the great moments of this film! Cheers!<br/><br/>My Rating 6.8"

","EX Machina finally here, lots of hype before I wanted to see this film for quite sometime. Most people don't know but there was a video game a couple of years back that almost took the shape of what this film is. Domhnall Gleeson did do a good job at being the computer tech nerdy guy, they always write these characters a little off, socially recluse not the most attractive, or out going but a kick ass guy when it comes to writing code. Now with that said I did write code in high school I did C++ & C++ Turbo, when you write code which I wrote a very simple game that you enter your name and it gave you random things about your life that could or could not be true, this is something that I know and respect because it is very hard. 1 period or semi colon, or even not the right number of spaces till the next line of code will throw off everything you are trying to accomplish. This film owes its cudos to Alicia Vikander who does at times make you feel, yes she is a computer with the most advanced A.I. The special effects from green screen for her ""cyborg"" body are great, the story as always you can add or take away but by the end you'll see why I title this as I did. Overall I would have extended the end, show a little more of what happens upon interaction with others, etc. directing was good. A beautiful home to work with and a great actress. Overall if your in the mood for what the future could possibly hold, watch EX Machina."

","""By far the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it."" - Eliezer Yudkowsky I am no intellectual and these theoretical scientific films are not in my wheelhouse, but the trailers looked tense and I heard it had some good reviews so there were some moderately high hopes for Ex Machina.<br/><br/>Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), a computer programmer for the world's largest internet search engine, wins a lottery held by the company. The prize for winning this lottery is a week with the CEO of the company, Nathan. Played by Oscar Isaac, he is a genius who thought of the algorithms of the worlds most complex search engine when he was just 12 years old. A helicopter lifts Caleb to an excluded house in the mountains where Nathan resides and the only people in the complex for the week are Caleb, Nathan and a Japanese maid who doesn't speak any English. Caleb, having no idea of the agenda for the week, is told by Nathan that he is creating a human android with artificial intelligence and that they will be performing a Turing test. Then the movie is split up into Caleb's sessions with the android Ava, and him performing the test to determine whether or not Ava is indistinguishable with a human. Ex Machina is heavily reliant on some character studies, of course of Ava as the plot of the movie is centered on Caleb's tests of her, but also of Caleb himself and Nathan. The relationships between themselves are also very compelling in determining all there intentions and Caleb serves as a detective of sorts, as he determines whether or not Ava thinks as organically as a human and why her creator/programmer brought him there. During this inspection of Ava, Caleb's sympathy and affection towards her grows, and his awareness of her artificial intelligence dims. The touring test is moving forward and through the relationships and suspense of the film, you forget this is just a scientific experiment just as Caleb has. Ex Machina is an expertly made film with an interesting premise. The acting was marvelous and all three of the relatively unknown stars shined in their respective roles (Oscar Isaac, Domhnall Gleeson, and Alicia Vikander). For the first half of the movie it grabs your attention with a gripping force and you hope it just keep getting tighter...but it loosens. The suspense driven between Caleb's conversations with Ava and Nathan just keep repeating and don't amplify nearly soon enough. I caught myself being very cognitive of the time passing and with thrillers that should not be the case. Don't get me wrong, I was never bored or uninterested but Ex Machina just never hits that next level of excitement or intrigue. They sold this film as a game changing thriller in the trailers and it was really just a drama with the mask and some attributes of a thriller. Don't get me wrong, it was an effective drama with compelling interactions but when you sell a movie as a thriller you better get my heart racing more than this. Ex Machina is a well crafted and smart film, but misses that boost needed to be a memorable Sci-Fi Thriller it aimed to be.<br/><br/>Check out more of my reviews: http://www.reviewsbycaleb.com/"

","This is a very neat cerebral type sci-fi. It is almost wholly shot in a few rooms with a handful of characters. The premise is a super tech guru has created a robot with an Artificial Intelligence and has picked one of his employees to perform a Turin test on it.<br/><br/>Some interesting points are raised. The creator has purposely built the robot to look robotic but clearly be female. We are always told beauty is skin deep, if a robot is truly intelligent should beauty only be titanium deep?<br/><br/>The characters are great, the boss is a very believable douche bag and the employee is both naïve and likable.The film does conjure up a degree of tension between the characters and is surprisingly tense in places..<br/><br/>The plot is good with a few swerves and the film is perfectly times so once I started feeling claustrophobic, locked inside with this trio, things came to a head nicely.<br/><br/>Don't expect much action do expect some thought provoking ideas and some robot boobs. I would file this one next to GATTICA in my DVD collection."

I did like it OK, but it moved very slow and wasn't really what I expected. I wasn't looking for action, I was just hoping for something a little less predictable and more to the movie than Caleb talking to the robot. There are some pretty neat twists in this and I loved the ending but I had pretty high hopes for this one and it fell a little short of what I wanted. That in no way means this is a bad movie, just different. Overall, an OK movie that wasn't what I was expecting and definitely won't be for everyone. I give this a B-."
"gortx","Null","0","1","7 June 2015"," Good, solid A.I. movie
","Sort of a companion piece to HER, except this time the A.I. has a physical flesh & blood, er... artificial skin and circuits manifestation.<br/><br/>Writer-Director Alex Garland has some fine SF credits to his resume having written the screenplays for the excellent NEVER LET ME GO and 28 DAYS LATER among others. He uses that knowledge of genre to craft a story which delves deeply into the world of what it is to be human vs. a machine. The famous Turing test is at the crux of the tale. On a purely visual level, EX MACHINA works very well within a modest budget (of course, limiting most of the movie to one location and 4 actors helps stretch those dollars). Still, the illusion of Ava the robot is seamlessly achieved through a combination of practical and CGI effects. The sets are spartan, but, fully realized and effective. Where the movie falters is that there is far too much cat & mouse verbal sparring, despite the fine work of Alicia Vikander, Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac. Like with his screenplay for Danny Boyle's flawed SUNSHINE, Garland seems determined to undercut the awe and wonder of the science fiction aspect with petty plot machinations. Fortunately, the themes here are so rich that they overcome most of those issues. And, the finale confounds one's expectations on more than one level - but, in a quite satisfying way in the end (even if it is a bit far fetched). Still one wishes that so much time hadn't been spent on the hoary cliché of defeating the Mad Scientist gambit.<br/><br/>EX MACHINA is a good entry into the expanding sub-genre of A.I.. More focus on the ""I"" and less on the ""A"" (artificial plot complications) could have resulted in something truly great, but, it's certainly worth seeing on the big screen."

"ahegde3149","8","0","3","4 June 2015"," Subtle and suspenseful with enough food for thought.
","Something about Ex Machina completely engrossed me into it. The 108 minutes smoothly passed away despite the slow-burning nature of its screenplay. Writer and debut director Alex Garland explores numerous ideals related to humanity with a seemingly basic premise and setup. A.I. Robots in movies is nothing new but Garland's visions here are not something you would be able to see if you just scratch the surface.<br/><br/>A young nerdy programmer Caleb (Domhall Gleeson) receives a mail that he has won some big coding contest. We see that his face is being unknowingly scanned by his webcam and phone cam. As the prize he gets to spend a week at his company's (Blue Book) CEO's place, which is a luxurious estate amidst beautiful mountains. CEO Nathan (Oscar Isaac) tells Caleb its not a home but more of a research facility. The facility is modern and sleek, the rooms have no window and you have instant claustrophobic feel about it. Nathan tells Caleb is here to perform Turing Test on his creation, Ava (Alicia Vikander) an incredibly advanced A.I. Robot who looks lifelike with skin on her face . Caleb is as stunned as we are watching Ava. She is able replicate human-like behavior with extreme precision and even can perform lie-detection based on micro-expression on our faces!! She is charming as well and we see Caleb & Ava growing fond of each as they interact every day as part of the test. Everything is monitored by Nathan through CCTV cameras. Things seem smooth until one day Ava tells Caleb not to trust Nathan when cameras are shut by power cut. From here on the story takes an unpredictable turn, there is no clue who is right and who is wrong or who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist.<br/><br/>The film explores various concepts such the meaning of consciousness and self-awareness, it questions your ethical viewpoint and blurs effectively the line between the human mind and AI. Are AIs truly the next stage of human evolution? Is singularity possible? It explores in these regions in great depth at the same time leaves some things open for interpretation. Adding to it, the film is also a suspenseful psychological thriller where you think every character is not what he/she seems to. And there are only 3 main characters here, all in the claustrophobic setting of the estate. The scene where Caleb cuts his hand to check if himself is a robot was really intense and frightening. There is also one hilarious out-of-the-box dance sequence giving a brief break from the freakish atmosphere. The soundtrack mostly of piano is haunting and beautiful at the same time. The music sets up requisite atmosphere and tone perfectly. The camera work is simply beautiful, be it the external landscape or the sleek interior shots. The production design and special effects are also impressive considering the low-budget of the film. <br/><br/>At the end, cannot forget the 3 actors who did a great job. Alicia Vikander I feel nails every expression as the AI Robot and captures your attention in every scene she is present. Domhall as the lonely nerd and Oscar as the alcoholic genius were great too. Debut director Alex Garland shows immense potential and I am very much looking forward towards his next work. Overall, Ex Machina I believe is treat for all the true science-fiction fans and also those who like slow-burning atmospheric thrillers. There is not much superficial robot action here as it is not sci-fi action film. Its a film driven by ideas not by action. Hope you keep that in mind. If you want a movie deeply rooted towards the ideals of AI, Ex Machina is not to be missed. It was intriguing, thoughtful, tense and beautiful in its own way. Absolutely loved it!<br/><br/>RATING: [4/5]"

","Eagerly awaited for this to come out on blu ray as I'd missed its cinema run. Glad I waited as this is a thoughtful film which requires a quiet cinema in order to avoid missing crucial plot details.<br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson plays Caleb, a nervous yet highly intelligent 26 year old coder within the Blue Book company who 'wins' a week long trip to his boss's home set in a remote, mountainous area. Having no commitments of any kind, Caleb packs his bag and flies out to the location which spans many hundreds of miles of incredibly beautiful scenery. There, he checks into boss Nathan's ultra modern bunker type residence and is issued with a card which limits him to certain areas in the house. This card is a crucial detail in the film.<br/><br/>Nathan turns out to be a seemingly easy going contradiction in terms guy. One minute he is working out and keeping fit, the next, he is drinking quite a lot of beer, wine and vodka. He is also a loner, like Caleb. Both men are not in relationships with women or men and seem to not have significant family ties with anyone. <br/><br/>Nathan shows Caleb to his room and points out the need for his brand of security. A non- disclosure agreement is signed and the 2 can now get down to business. In Nathan's case, business involves a project of enormous secrecy and intrigue. In Caleb's case, it is getting over the initial shock of being considered a 'lab rat'.<br/><br/>Caleb is introduced to Nathan's work in the form of a highly sophisticated robot called Ava. Ava is beautiful in a child like way, having an eternally youthful face and the profile of a young woman, complete with breasts and buttocks albeit covered in a grey mesh. Caleb finds Ava fascinating and compliments his work, comparing him to a god. <br/><br/>One evening, whilst seemingly observing Ava through screens in his room, the whole room is plunged into a red light and the bunker is put into a lock-down whilst the system repairs itself. Caleb becomes understandably worried but is told by Nathan that power blackouts are quite common. <br/><br/>Caleb gets more time to interact with Ava. She asks him questions and also dresses up for him, putting on a pretty dress and a top along with a wig to make herself seem more 'girlish and less robot'. It works, until the red light comes on and Ava tells Caleb not to trust Nathan and points out that when the red light comes on and the blackout occurs, Nathan can't see them on the bunker's cameras . <br/><br/>So Caleb is drawn into an intrigue with Ava. He also spends his evenings watching Nathan getting drunk and insulting the Asian servant who apparently speaks no English and doesn't say anything anyway. Ava makes clear that Caleb is being manipulated on both sides as he is. <br/><br/>At one point, Caleb gets Nathan so drunk, he manages to steal Nathan's entry card. The revelations are terrifying. Nathan has not only created Ava but a score of robot prototypes, designing them all as women which he then imprisons as he figures out each time where he's been going wrong. The end results all end up in Nathan's closet, like Ironman suits or bat suits in these particular films. Caleb also discovers that Nathan's non speaking Asian servant is also a robot, albeit one designed to offer silence and obedience to Nathan's emotional/physical needs. This leads to Caleb questioning whether he, too, is a robot as he cuts his arm deeply in one moment to try and reveal any hidden circuitry.<br/><br/>In another moment, Caleb tells Ava that he will programme the doors to release during a power cut situation but only when he has gotten Nathan blind drunk. Nathan refuses to get blind drunk and tells Caleb that Ava has, too, been manipulating him for her own ends. Caleb states Ava has passed the Turing test. <br/><br/>In the end, Caleb is left to watch as Ava and the Asian assistant both conspire to get rid of Nathan and gain freedom. Nathan's Asian assistant 'dies' in the attempt but Ava manages to re-cloth herself and leaves the bunker and Caleb to make her way in the world.<br/><br/>This film is very clever. It uses the veneer of sci-fi to ask some difficult and unanswered questions about this generation of men and their relationship with women. Caleb and Nathan are two men who seemingly have no meaningful relationships with women (or anyone else). Their intelligence has somehow made them both separate from the common ebb and flow of masculinity. Both are looking for the first steps of replacing human beings (for that, read women) with compliant, obedient A.I. Unfortunately, Alex Garland has turned it on its head and the robot outsmarts both the master and his servants. The message is clear: Only by sorting out their relationship with women will men be liberated."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","0","2","1 June 2015"," Ambitious But Underwhelming, it Often Lacks Subtlety
","Small cast, big ideas: that's usually a winning formula for me. And at its core, Ex Machina stretches to reach a very challenging subject: where we draw the line between smart programming and true cognizance. The very idea of artificial intelligence opens up all manner of intriguing moral disputes on its own, particularly when a mammoth global corporation is responsible, and many of those are touched, or maybe clubbed, as the plot slowly unfolds. It has a habit of oversimplifying at points, though, and frequently relaxes into a simple good vs. evil framework that I thought was too easy for the theme's inherent complexities. Intense and thought-provoking at its best, but it has a bad habit of hammering points that would be best treated with a little subtlety. I wanted to like it a lot more than I did."

","As far as Sci-fi movies go, this isn't anything awful at all. As the boss man in the feature says about his employee about programming... ""you're okay, pretty good, even"" this film is summed up in that quote!<br/><br/>Stylistically, the film is great, the mood is spot on, the acting is also in tone with the movie. The shocks in the first portion of the movie are shocking, the claustrophobia is intentionally effective. <br/><br/>The interactions between main 'hero boy' and 'victim girl' are great. The scenes with supposedly 'great man/ alcoholic' less so. I couldn't believe that our main protagonist, a supposed 'loner' wouldn't from the 'get-go' see through his lies, his lack of charisma... why on Earth would he sign that contract? The awkwardness was present from the start...<br/><br/>Points of factual weakness that left me feeling less emotive, even if the film was 'highly emotive'...<br/><br/>1. The security system is inadequate, supposing this mega-rich, mega-clever, multi-billionaire project... you can steal someone's tag? Sure, it may have been a ploy but still... in that case access to the facility itself would've been compromised.<br/><br/>2. The ending? So a machine that 'feels' shows no gratitude? Yet has all the thought of humanity as its driving factor? Is it going to go ahead and do nothing but ""people-watch""? What was it's/ her purpose in the end? To go and watch people? Sure, she might be the 'terminator' potential, but the movie just left her heading in no direction.<br/><br/>So what, from this are we supposed to assume that she neither feels or has any direction, but is happy to make a point by leaving 'mr no- hope' to die in a cage like she wasn't ( she had support) . She left him with none! What a bitch!<br/><br/>3. Is this film really about the objectification of women? I really suspect so, it makes lot more sense when viewed in this way, than instead taking it as a serious film about AI...<br/><br/>Either way, worth at least one viewing! No Blade Runner... what is though?"
"kadashman","8","0","3","31 May 2015"," Should we trust in artificial intelligence?
","When I started to watch the movie the movie, at first I thought that it would be another dynamic sci-fi action, but step by step I found out that the authors have made a very slow and tense drama movie on robots and artificial intelligence. The movie is about a young scientist (Domnhall Gleeson), who is hired by a billionaire (Oscar Isaac) to go to his house which is constructed among the woods and rocks to examine his invention - a female robot with artificial intelligence (Alicia Vikander).<br/><br/>The main reason of the examination is the fact that a big proportion of human feelings and passion is injected into this robot and the latter can is capable of feeling and discussing matters like a human being. I don't wanna write something about the script as there are no harsh or abrupt events and the whole movie is a discussion around the logics and feelings, joy and disappointment. The movie is very stylish and beautiful, brilliant nature, unique scenes, bright colors. Acting is good, for me it is not a movie, that demands brilliant acting skills. Of course, there are some aspects that could be done in different way, for example the end of the movie, which was quite predictable for me. The whole movie is accompanied by a dull and tedious sound which keeps the watcher in tension, waiting for something critical."

","""Ex-Machina"" is a fantastic sci-fi think piece with also ever better elements of a mystery film. It delivers on many levels yet fails to give the viewer that kick of amazement or mind-f**k that it could have delivered. <br/><br/>I have been an Alex Garland fan for quite some time. Sunshine is one of my favorite movies and I was really, really excited to see how he would make it into the director's chair and believe me this is one of the best transitions we have seen. He obviously has already a ton of on-set experience, but still he manages to provide his movie with a very, very specific style, aesthetic and visual that not even experienced directors manage to pull off. The movie feels incredibly fluent. Combining the talents of his editor and his DP, Garland has put together one of those films where every shot, other than looking beautiful thanks also to some amazing production design, feels right and worth it's time. There is not one single frame that should not be in this movie. He gives his actors some amazing material to work with and they rise to the occasion: they all give really convincing performances especially Oscar Isaacs, whom I wasn't really totally on board with yet, does really layered and complex work, every time he was on screen you felt his character come through. The storytelling is also fabulous and the turns it takes are interesting and fit the plot and the characters even thought there are some other moments that don't quite meld in when thinking back. Finally, the thought-provoking aspects of the film are remarkable. There is so much to be found here I think one viewing would not be exhaustive. <br/><br/>Yet, talking about those thought provoking elements: firstly, they sometimes derail from being genuine and feel too on the nose. I repeat this happens only a few times, but it does quite stick out as if the movie is unnecessarily trying too hard to be stimulating. Moreover, as I said in my intro, I didn't finish the film and go ""Oh my God"". And that isn't due to the final shot (I get how some people may say that I didn't explode only because it wasn't this great epic moment), on the contrary that final shot was quite something to sink your teeth in. It's just that I finished the film and went: ""Well OK, I guess that's it"". It is a little too self contained. The reflection ends as the film ends and there is a little too much that is left unresolved. I get it, you want to make a movie with an open ending so we can think for ourselves, I love that! But there is a difference with just letting us figure it out ALL by ourselves. It just should have ended ten minutes earlier or ten minutes later. In either case it would have been better than the slight underwhelming feel I got form where it actually ended. <br/><br/>That still isn't a detraction from the hugely fascinating ideas the film puts forwards yet kind of leaves there without exploring. It is incredibly stimulating to watch and there are great and many tension filled moments that I enjoyed throughly."
"kennethmoran-62013","8","0","4","28 May 2015"," Great atmosphere, very curious and intense movie
","Hey there, I went into this movie not knowing much about it, which I think was the best way to watch it. It is very slow at times and very claustrophobic but this adds to the atmosphere throughout. This movie requires all of your attention and you are rewarded for that throughout. Well worth a watch but not really a movie for a big get together but one you will appreciate on your own. Great actors and great dialogue keeps this movie moving in the right direction be it at a slow pace. If you've missed this in the cinema, it would be well worth renting it out online and I think that it is better suited to the small screen."
"jonruff108","8","0","3","25 May 2015"," If I had only one word to describe this film it would be 'unnerving.'
","The entire movie has this certain eeriness and tense foreboding that makes you uncomfortable. The acting all around is pretty good but it's Alicia Vikander who is truly remarkable as Ava, the AI robot. First time director Alex Garland makes it look effortless and his script is just as good. This is hard science-fiction and it really makes you think. It doesn't delve into familiar territory like you'd expect but instead takes you down an unfamiliar path that keeps you guessing.<br/><br/>The only downfall of the film, in my opinion, is the ending which feels unsatisfying. There's probably a lot who disagree with me and it was by no means bad it was just, by comparison to everything that came before it, underwhelming.<br/><br/>The film also features some great cinematography and set design, contrasting the sleek, modern, and high tech house with the green and calm of nature. It's very well done."
"verminhater","8","0","3","25 May 2015"," Not original but exceptionally well made and acted.
","Ex Machina is not Blade runner or I-Robot. There's no action sequences and the android effects though well done are pretty much all there is effects-wise. What this film does offer is an insight into human interaction and failure with AI. It's a thought provoking movie and if you are the type to think Jason Statham is a great actor you should avoid it. Ex Machina is not original at all. This subject has been done before many times. Where it fails in originality though it scores big time in it's quality. The acting is superb from both main actors with Oscar Isaac the stand out. Sonoya Mizuno plays a supporting part of an AI to great effect too.<br/><br/>I suppose it's inevitable that the AI was a young pretty female for such a film given male/female relationships but that aspect of the film really is getting a bit thin given previous films on the subject and the lack of originality is why I'm not going higher than an 8 out of 10. Get over that and you'll find a top notch film working with that old subject. We see AI's developing their own sense of self-preservation and (lack-of) moral compass and an arrogance to think we own them simply because we created them. The similarities to Google in the film are all too obvious and are a reminder of how such power can all too easily be abused.<br/><br/>The film blurs the line between present day and the future. We are obviously reaching for this aspect of the future now and like the characters in the film I suspect we'll make the same mistakes."

","I love movies, or anything in general, dealing with artificial intelligence and the like. It is such an interesting realm to me. <br/><br/>Ex Machina is a film about a young programmer in a big company comparable to Google, who wins a lottery of sorts, which entails him to stay at the Boss's place and be a part in his latest project, A.I. <br/><br/>There aren't many characters in this movie and for a movie like this to be interesting, the few characters HAVE to do a great job. The main dude was the only one who I felt like wasn't that good. Oscar Isaac, who plays the Boss/Genius, was awesome. He wasn't your typical rich/boss/genius douche. The one who stole though was Alicia Vikander, who plays the A.I Ava. She did a great job of depicting a high level artificial intelligence. <br/><br/>Now the movie really doesn't get into much introduction or world building. It actually felt really rushed in the beginning and just takes our protagonist to the place where rest of the movie will unfold. And that MAGIC of A.I was kinda missing. But afterwards, it very slowly starts to create tension. There is nothing but conversations but you can feel the tension building up and up and things often revealed aren't what they seemed. The pacing sometimes did become snail like though. The ending felt somewhat anti-climatic but at the same time, all the slow build up tension got released in the same slow manner and had this really chilling sensation. <br/><br/>Best thing about this movie for me were the questions like What it means to be human? How this technological world defines each and everyone of us etc etc. Stuff like this makes you go deep in thought long after the movie is finished. <br/><br/>I do think that people are really overrating it. A decent sci-fi thriller nonetheless. <br/><br/>7.2/10"

","Ex Machina aspires to much but in the end achieves less than it set out to. <br/><br/>This film is well structured, capably acted and directed. Its a polished production and its by no means a poor film. The reality, however, is its not really doing anything with its story line that has not been done more competently before. The underlying message of the threat technology poses to humanity, especially intelligent technology, is hardly new and really did not need to be reiterated. <br/><br/>Worse still, this films somewhat clinical treatment of the relationship between a man made sentient being and its human counterparts tends to detract from the humanity of the story. The overall effect then is to lessen the psychological impact of this rather predictable tale, as it unfolds. <br/><br/>In summary Ex Machina is ""definitely"" worth your time, just don't expect the emotional connection to be found in films like Blade Runner and others similar titles in this sci fi sub genre. Eight out of ten from me."

","This movie was amazing; the acting the concept the effects the execution perfect except for the ending. Basically caleb thinks he's in love or infatuated with her and she the same except she uses Caleb to escape and leaves him behind locked inside. And then it ends. Unsatisfying here's what I think should have happened. To get out they need Nathan's card and Caleb tells Ava this. However he ponders what Nathan says about Ava using him to escape. So he reprograms it so that it not only does the system not read Nathan's card but it recognizes Caleb card being the master controller. Thus revealing Ava's true plan. I'm not saying that the ending was the worst in fact it does fit the theme of the whole movie but it's still so unsatisfying."

However, one character was much too unlikeable (one-sided), and I expected something surprising somewhere along the way, but was disappointed.

Instead, it resorts to a few clichés (though beautifully done).<br/><br/>They missed a great opportunity for something profound or shocking.

","AI movies are on my favourites list. Its a great and profound topic to address and its more pertinent than ever. Unfortunately this movie glances over that aspect and if you go into this thinking it will go deep into it, you will be disappointed. The movie is much more about humanity and social profiling than AI really, the AI premise is rather flat and you wont get any ground breaking revelations on it. Here is what I think is the flaw in this movie, its not clear what it wants to tell you nor do you take anything away from it, it plays it too safe in my opinion, even though the potential was there.<br/><br/>Having said that, its a beautifully shot film, great acting and nice score. Its a bit slow, so if you are the impatient type this one will drag for you, but if you like environmental movies that have great aesthetic and fell to it, you will enjoy it even on the slower parts. Its definitely worth watching, even if I, Robot is the better AI movie.<br/><br/>***Spoiler*** The ending is weird and makes no sense, which ruined it a bit for me. If they ended it with AVA looking into the sky when she got outside, just like in the story Caleb told ""her"" earlier, THAT would have made for a much better ending, instead of the illogical one we got."

Caleb is to interact with the android, Ava, and reports daily on how well the machine is able to convince him that she can adapt with real people. They are constantly watched on camera and recorded for playback later. Caleb and Ava connect on an emotional level after seven days. The acting is good and the story an interesting one.

"theresistancerises","8","0","4","16 May 2015"," An original AI sci-fi film that defines itself amongst the rest and provides us with one of the best movie robots of all-time.
","When the first trailer for ""Ex Machina"" dropped online, I found myself getting instantly sucked into this new film due to its aesthetic, cast, and story, so I had pretty high expectations going into the film. Thankfully, I walked out very impressed.<br/><br/>Directed by author and screenwriter, Alex Garland (who wrote ""Sunshine"" and ""28 Days Later""), ""Ex Machina"" follows a computer programmer, Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson), who was chosen to stay with an online tycoon, Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), for a week at his secluded house up in the mountains. There, Nathan shows Caleb what he has been working on and reveals Ava (Alicia Vikander), an robot capable of human emotions. Nathan then tasks Caleb to do a Turing test on Ava to evaluate her ability to exhibit intelligent and humanlike behavior. Through this test, Caleb soon discovers that Ava is a lot more human than he ever could have imagined, but may just be almost too human.<br/><br/>The intimacy of the story and focus on its characters is definitely what makes this film shine above other sci-fi films that have tackled the themes of artificial intelligence. Alicia Vikander brings so much depth, complexity and humanity to Ava, making her one of sci-fi's best movie robots ever. Her allure and impression were so different compared to other movie robots, almost as if we were as intrigued by her presence as Caleb was. Domhnall Gleeson is, as always, a natural talent and, as Caleb, guides the audience through the entire story and carries to entire weight of the film effortlessly. However, Oscar Isaac outshines everyone in the film, like he does in any other project he is involved in. Isaac has cemented himself as being one of this generation's best and made Nathan, a character that could have easily been a one-dimensional role, into a tormented, damaged and eccentric genius that we can easily understand. Having these three as, for the most part, the only people you see in the film really does amply the screenplay as they all brought their A-material to their respective roles.<br/><br/>Although the film focuses heavily on dialogue, themes and characters, the visual effects in the film are also very impressive for the $13 million budget they had. The CGI on Ava is done beautifully with simplicity and elegance. Most of the visual effects are very subtle and real to the point where you forget that you are seeing something that was digital removed (i.e. making Vikander's stomach completely transparent). The cinematography, done by Rob Hardy, also elevates the effects and the aesthetic of the film. The film looks gorgeous. Every shot is dripping with atmosphere and style, keeping many of the shots, like the film itself, close and intimate.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Ex Machina"" is a very good film. I have very minor issues with the pacing of the 2nd Act and the soundtrack, which is for the most part good but included some tracks that I thought were unnecessary or unoriginal, but these two gripes did not detract from the film's plot and characters to the point where I could say they pulled me out of the experience. This was a well shot, well acted, well scripted, and well directed film that will leave you asking many questions about yourself and humankind as a species. Definitely go see the film when you get the chance."
"darking-switch","6","0","4","16 May 2015"," Oscar Isaac Saves Ex Machina !
","No doubt that the writer/director Alex Garland is talented regarding his previous titles as well as this one, but unfortunately the multiple plot-holes plus the story's details inconsistency makes Ex Machina an enjoyable ride but with no destination.<br/><br/>And here is the strange thing about this movie that we saw happened to few others before: its dialogue is fantastic, although its script is weak. The movie's idea itself is not new, but the intelligent conversations in a well-executed cinematography environment forces the viewers to connect instantly with the screen.<br/><br/>The delivery by the actors were above average, but no one can deny that the charismatic Oscar Isaac with his well prepared character details and concentrated performing makes him the main reason for me to consider Ex Machina as not bad as it could be. By the way, I think that his saying of line:""Okay ... Fu**ing Unreal"" while he walks towards the camera near the end, makes it the most brilliant and innovative quote in the whole movie."
"tgrock","7","0","2","15 May 2015"," Just What the Trailer Showed
","A movie should not give all of its cards away in the trailer. Ex- Machina does. If you take a Christopher Nolan film like Inception or Interstellar, there are tons of plot lines and acts in the film that were never presented in the trailers. You have no idea where those films are going to end up. This is what makes those films, in my opinion, so great. Ex Machina's trailer was great, as I really looked forward to seeing the film (very rarely does a film's trailer entice me enough to want to see it). <br/><br/>Ex Machina just feels incomplete. It needs a third act (another 45 minutes or an hour's worth). If a sequel is made, I will consider seeing it and perhaps rate this film higher. If Ex Machina is just a standalone film, it will always just be pretty good science fiction film."

The opening sequence is great story telling, and the drama that follows is pretty good, with twists and deceptions all the way.<br/><br/>The photography is amazing, and the director does some beautiful things with perspective and lighting and mirrors. And the acting is good. Plus a surreally smooth stabbing.<br/><br/>The problem I had with it is slack pace and tension.

","Ex Machina (2015): Dir: Alex Garland / Cast: Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, Alicia Vikander, Sonoya Mizuno, Corey Johnson: Innovative independent science fiction thriller starring Oscar Isaac as a Steve Jobs type named Nathan, a billionaire who owns an Internet search engine called Bluebook. Domhnall Gleeson plays Caleb, employed at Bluebook and picked to spend a week at Nathan's massive isolated compound where he does his research. A helicopter lands in a field with Caleb instructed where to walk. The compound features walls of thick bulletproof glass that can only be opened via identification card. Alicia Vikander as Ava is a sight to see. When she first appears to Caleb viewers are as in awe as he is. Nathan's big project involves artificial intelligence with Ava being a test subject for Caleb to interact with. Vikander uses her eyes to convey feeling to Caleb. She is responsible for brief power failures where she informs him that Nathan cannot be trusted. Isaac as Nathan is brilliant but his alcoholism becomes a weakness when his overconfidence is threatened. Gleeson as Caleb is overcome by lust and learns that there are consequences. Sonoya Mizuno appears in an android role with no dialogue. She is Nathan's servant who also breaks out in a dance sequence during one late night session. There are no other major characters aside from a briefly seen helicopter pilot. Director Alex Garland addresses how technology can overwhelm us even when we believe we are the dominant creation. As Ava observes briefly, humanity is completely unaware of the forces they purchase and trust. Score: 7 ½ / 10"
"Red_Identity","Null","0","5","14 May 2015"," Atmospheric, contemplative, and cerebral. Visually accomplished
","The fact that this is Alex Garland's directorial debut is nothing less than impressive. The control he has here, every frame, every edit, every piece of music is able to fit together as a whole to give the film its defining atmosphere, and what atmosphere it is. It's not at all the really tense sci-fi the trailer showed, and it's all the better for it. Well, it is tense but in a very brooding, very contemplative way. The problem with films like these is that so many times their final act proves to undo so much of what made the rest of the films great. Here, it never tries to pretend to be anything too complicated. Don't get me wrong, it's playing with some really resonant themes, but it's also not convulted or complicated for the sake of being complicated. It's certainly a mind game though, for all of the three characters involved but it's also not predictable in the usual sense because there isn't any big twist that the film had been trying to hide all along. There's no ""gotcha"" moment, and so the film's haunting quality persists throughout. The three performances are great, but it's Vikander who truly impresses on another level. She's just absolutely perfect<br/><br/>All in all, really fantastic and this deserves to maintain a cult following. Technically-wise, it's such a gorgeous film, and the script is really strong"

","A story about A.I.? That's been done over and over, but what really matters is execution. I'm happy to say that this film is very well executed. Not much happens really. It's mostly just scenes of people talking, yet they managed to build up tension and interest over the course of the movie. This makes the end way more exciting. The performances and special effects were both fine. Neither was particularly spectacular, but they were by no means bad. I only have one real issue with the movie. At the end, there is a helicopter pilot who makes a very, VERY questionable decision. I won't spoil it, but for those who've seen the movie, you probably know exactly what I'm talking about. Other than that, this is a pretty decent sci-fi flick."
"Sim-Plex","7","0","2","1 May 2015"," Good not great
","I felt Domhnall's portrayal was heavy handed or overdone through most of the film and it turned me off. It was almost Big Bangish: a nerdy man-child stepping out into the big adult world for the first time. I thought he was going to dig a tunnel to ""escape"" the helicopter rotors he bent over so far. His initial interactions with the mad scientist were overly awkward as if it were up to him to create the social/professional difference between them. It was so overboard that I couldn't imagine that he could overcome the length of the arc he created in 4 hours, much less two. As he struggled with the AI test, the relationships and, alas, himself, Caleb had many obvious opportunities to figure things out, but failed to ask a significant question of others or himself. I think this is the writers fault in trying to stretch the movie to its contracted length. This is why I was surprised at the end when he finally took appropriate action as there was no evidence that he was capable of thinking that way."

","In the not too distant future, a talented programmer working for the world's top search engine wins a once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity to carry out some tests on an advanced android. As the sessions progress, things start to reveal that not all is what it seems...<br/><br/>Alex Garland's directorial debut is a fascinating one. After penning such films as '28 Days Later' and 'Dredd', Garland takes a drastic turn in style with this smartly-written and intensely-focused sci-fi thriller. 'Ex Machina' offers insights to some of the biggest issues regarding A.I. today - and does so in a manner that doesn't insult the audiences' intelligence. <br/><br/>If there was something negative that I have to point out about this film, it would be the fact that I could not connect with any of the characters. The cast gives fine performances, but there's something about the way their characters are written that doesn't really make an emotional impact on the audience. At times, I even thought that Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) was on the edge of neurosis.<br/><br/>Despite that being said, Alicia Vikander gives an outstanding performance as Ava. She not only plays an android who goes through several gradations of human development at an accelerated pace with surprising heft, but also manages to harbour two distinct personalities without any trouble. Expect Vikander to be nominated for awards.<br/><br/>VERDICT: This is not an action movie - nor is it a horror movie. Unless you're a HUGE fan of movies dealing with A.I., you will most likely be left scratching your head wondering why you paid the full price of a movie ticket just to see this. If you're TRULY curious (but not a fan of these sorts of films), RENT IT."

There, Caleb is put through a series of interactive tests with the A.I., named Ava, though Nathan's intentions are duly called into question.<br/><br/>Like the bulk of contemporary science fiction, ""Ex Machina"" tackles the bridge between humanity and machinery and spins the ever-evolving question of what actually constitutes life, and although neither of these concepts are particularly new to cinema (especially sci- fi), director Alex Garland's presentation of the material truly makes the film stand out from its peers.<br/><br/>The pacing is the real heartbeat of the film, progressing with a steady rhythm that allows subtleties to creep in over time. There is a definite meditative nature about the film, with the cold interiors of Nathan's postmodern mansion and Ava's elaborate machinery starkly contrasted with the overwhelming exterior photography of rolling mountains and glacial landscapes. The interior shots and camera-work evoke Stanley Kubrick and ""The Stepford Wives"" in equal spades, being both visually appealing and quietly uneasy. <br/><br/>Domhnall Gleeson leads the film as the naive, analytical programmer, while Oscar Isaac is a one-man show as his counterpart— a tortured and sardonic mathematical genius at the helm of the scientific development. Alicia Vikander embodies the enigmatic as well as the robotic, and finds a fine balance between them. The disturbing conclusion to the film ties its philosophical message into a packaged whole without being overt or preachy. <br/><br/>Overall, I found ""Ex Machina"" to be very well-crafted. I am not one who usually enjoys science fiction on the whole, but ""Ex Machina"" is not exactly your standard sci-fi film either. It's very quiet, very dialogue-driven, but the atmospheric qualities that come with its visuals and thematics make for an eloquent and well-thought semi-thriller. 8/10."

I stayed clear of reviews as best as I could since I didn't want to spoil the experience. The key is to view movies with an open mind.<br/><br/>I found this production as entertaining as it was thought-provoking. It held my attention without a problem despite there only being 4 characters interacting and basically one filming location - the research facility.<br/><br/>The concept isn't new but continues to intrigue: how ""human"" can a artificial intelligence ever really be? How do you create the essence of a conscience outside of a human mind? And how would you know if what you're dealing with is a robot or a human? That's where the story begins and ends: testing an AI and see it could pass as ""human"".<br/><br/>The movie will leave some things to the viewer - perfectly placed ambiguity. There are a couple of plot twists to be enjoyed. The writing was excellent and the CGI was very well done. All around well acted and nice character development. Good pace.<br/><br/>Don't expect much in terms of action. It's mostly mellow and picks up a bit at the end.<br/><br/>The R rating is for some graphic violence, adult language (the F word) and full frontal female nudity.
