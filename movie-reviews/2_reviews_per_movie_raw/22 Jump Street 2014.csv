"EddyOne","7","202","291","5 June 2014"," On par with the first one!
","It's pretty easy to review this one. If you liked the first one, you're in for a treat. It holds up to the expectations and plays cleverly with 'being aware' of making basically the same movie again. The good thing about this flick is, that it doesn't take itself too seriously while at the same time delivering a good and fast paced story with quite some surprises and good action. I basically laughed from the first minute up to the (awesome!) end credits! If you like that type of comedy, this one is for you, as it delivers on point and, without a doubt, is the funniest flick this year so far! Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and you can see and feel, how they enjoyed doing this movie. Like the first one, 22 Jump Street does a great job observing the different aspects of college life, students and teachers (or professors for that matter). Everyone who's been to college can relate to those stereotypes (e.g. the pseudo intellectuals, the sport jocks, the art students etc.) and directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""The Lego Movie"") do a great job spoofing those clichés while at same time debunk the downsides and shallowness of those groups or college life in general. <br/><br/>Verdict: Go see it, if you liked the first one. I can't say if it's better, but it certainly holds up. And I liked the first one pretty much. So there you go..."

","My initial expectations were that '22 Jump Street' would be an over-the- top and cheesy sequel created solely to make money... I was wrong. '22 Jump Street' truly builds on the basis of the first film, further expanding upon the bromantic chemistry between Tatum and Hill creating an even more solid sequel full of good-natured humour and relentless action that made its predecessor such a great film. With Ice Cube having more of an impact this time round, the trio pursue their leads to ensure the villains are brought to justice. The direction duo have pulled off another amazing film to add to their filmography, a truly impressive and hilariously funny film."
"gregtoolson","7","57","88","8 September 2014"," Good and Properly Stupid
","All these reviews are bashing the crap out of this movie. 'It's aimless drivel and only for mindless idiots'. Well....Yeah. When I watch a comedy like this that's what I hope for. Sometime you just want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half and watch two familiar ""actors"" play out ridiculous but easy enough to grasp scenarios while they foolishly react. A post-viewing critique is pointless because the directors have no intention of it being able to hold up on creative or any kind of artistic merit. If you want to think about what you're watching, or enjoy good story development, or simply see some great acting then there are plenty of movies like Rashomon, Eraserhead, The Man from Earth, Memories of Murder, Hitchcock films, Miyszaki films, or something like Life Is Beautiful or It's A Wonderful Life(I forget which is which, both great). And there's nothing wrong with a good documentary know and then either. But something good and properly stupid can be just the right thing when you need to take a respite. Not all comedies are going to be a quipping Woody Allen flicks. It's really about getting a good balance in your movies types and picking the right one for your current mood. In other words this movie is just what it intends to be and just what wanted it to be. Pure and easy entertainment.<br/><br/>...Now I'm going to get my Audrey Hepburn on and watch My Fair Lady."

","11 June 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - 22 Jump Street. This film was a hoot!!! I only watched 21 Jump Street at the weekend in preparation for the sequel and although I enjoyed it I have to say the sequel was much better. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are a great double act and the film provides just the right amount of slapstick humour combined with witty banter and the serious side of undercover police work. Imagine if you will two undercover cops, not the brightest pair, sent back to college to infiltrate the latest drug ring. Whatever you are imagining.....it's in this sequel. Hill and Tatum are tight.....they have each other's backs and are best buds but going back to college shows each of them a new direction and their friendship is severely tested in this world of frat parties, pledging and that oh so American Institution.......Spring Break. A giggle from start to finish and Channing Tatum's not bad to look at either. Stay for the credits!!!!"
"vistheindian","8","79","135","7 June 2014"," Bromantic comedy of the year
","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>After a successful undercover drug bust operation in high school, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) get their next big assignment. Now in the sequel 22 Jump Street, as Ice Cube so eloquently put it, these ""two sons of b***hes are going to college."" As the cop duo take on yet another drug ring, they go through multitude of ridiculous yet hilarious situations. In doing so, there are some formulaic traps that the movie does fall into. Despite that, it is just an incredible ride with non-stop laughter and great comedic chemistry between the lead actors. This is a must-see for fans of 21 Jump Street and people who generally like to laugh.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>The original movie, 21 Jump Street, was a surprise hit back in 2012. It was a movie filled with many belly aching moments of laughter. For that reason, of all the comedies of 2014 this sequel may be the most anticipated, at least it was for me. So the question is: does it deliver on the high expectations? And the answer is: oh hell yes it does.<br/><br/>There is one absolute in this franchise that no one will dispute, the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is incredible. As soon as their on screen you immediately start smiling, just because you feel the need to prepare yourself for something amusing. Then when they do go about their shenanigans, numerous twists and turns occur that are fun to watch unfold, to hilarious effect. The jokes are fast paced and relentless, without it being tiresome. More importantly the comedy is actually clever, even during some of the scenarios the are more stupid due to some absurdity. The combination of the comedic duo and the intelligent humor work flawlessly, making the flick all the more entertaining. As great as the two leads are with their comedic timing, I need to especially mention Ice Cube. I won't spoil anything of course, but there are points in this movie where Ice Cube actually steals the scenes he is in. I'd pay the full movie ticket price just to see that dynamic between Ice Cube and the two leads. It is that good.<br/><br/>I do recognize there are some faults with 22 Jump Street. It did stick with the philosophy of ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" In that sense, the general story plot is pretty much the same as the original movie. 22 Jump Street is self-aware of what it is, and pokes fun of itself for being a sequel that follows the formula. However, addressing this fault in that comedic way will not be enough for everyone to forgive it. Still, I think this is something that you can easily look past because of how enjoyable the movie is.<br/><br/>The one purpose of a comedy is to make you laugh, and 22 Jump Street fulfills that requirement consistently throughout the movie. By throughout the movie, I mean even during the credits. Your cheeks will have a good exercise, because mine were in pain with all the laughing. It is well worth your time and money, so don't miss out on this one. If they keep this up I will be there even at 1022 Jump Street."
"joey-ziemniak","7","19","29","14 June 2014"," Hits all the right notes, thanks to Hill and Tatum's excellent chemistry
","If there's one criticism I have about 22 Jump Street, it's that the movie feels too similar to 21 Jump Street. But is that really a complaint? With 22 Jump Street, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (The LEGO Movie) have created a massively entertaining ride, with more antics from the characters we love, and better performances all around.<br/><br/>This time around, they're going to college. Yeah, yeah, we've heard it before. As Ice Cube says at the end of the first film, in which the two went undercover at a high school, the tables have been turned and they're going to college now. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) must once again go undercover at MC State to bust another drug operation, this time called WHYPHY (work hard? yes. play hard? yes.)<br/><br/>What worked with 21 Jump Street works again in 22 Jump Street. The excellent characters of Schmidt and Jenko are once again paired to make a hilarious and charismatic duo. Their personalities clash once more, but in a different way than the first film, and they get into even more crazy shenanigans than before. This includes having a shootout in the university library and busting a Spring Break beach party. 22 Jump Street always keeps you on edge, wondering what will happen next. While the plot is pretty standard and similar to the first film, you'll want to stick around because you love these characters so much. New characters such as Zook (Wyatt Russell) and Mercedes (Jillian Bell) feel right at home within the crazy cast. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) is also in rare form, delivering some of the film's best moments.<br/><br/>This is a testament to Hill and Tatum, who put so much work into creating these characters. Jenko settles into the football team, and makes friends at a fraternity, while Schmidt performs slam poetry and does many walks of shame. Hill and Tatum are in top form. Their chemistry is better than ever, making 22 Jump Street a hilarious buddy comedy. Try not to laugh when Schmidt does slam poetry to impress a girl, I dare you.<br/><br/>What makes 22 Jump Street feel special is its self-referential attitude and countless meta jokes. Police chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) essentially explains why this movie was made within the first 10 minutes, saying ""no one cared about the Jump Street reboot, but you guys got lucky."" It's a funny way to be self-deprecating and hilarious at the same time. It plays to the audience's intelligence, rather than making them feel stupid. Other references are more subtle, like when Schmidt keeps asking about the film's budget. It all plays into a very interesting and unique humor style. While there are plenty of raunchy jokes (right in the crack), the film's best come from its self-referencing.<br/><br/>So, now for the all-important question: is 22 Jump Street better than the original? With its meta jokes and its excellent characterization, 22 Jump Street is a rousing success, and matches the original in sheer humor. But the plot feels too similar to the original. While this may be a fault in the film's format, a few more twists would have been appreciated. Still, 22 Jump Street is a hilarious ride, one definitely worth taking."
"RustySpiderr","1","179","349","26 June 2014"," Total garbage
","How on Earth is this film rated so highly? There's no true wit or intelligence within the script, it's just stupid, lame jokes & a lot of unnecessary swearing which the movie seems to think is funny. I'm not saying swearing doesn't have a place in film, but overusing them to this extent is extremely noticeable & came across as childish.<br/><br/>The story is about as boring and formulaic as they come. First act; they enter college, second act; their relationship is tested, third act; everything works out, happy ending. It's like they didn't even try to be different or original.<br/><br/>Every single character is a one-dimensional stereotype. They never exhibit traits that show any form of depth; they were all so formulaic it felt like all their actions were generated from a computer.<br/><br/>Overall, absolute piece of garbage. If you're American and enjoy flat-out idiotic humor devoid of any wit or intelligence, I recommend it, but otherwise stay away."
"matic-boh1","7","34","58","12 June 2014"," A worthy sequel
","Hilarious, often outrageous, but above all thoroughly entertaining, 22 Jump Street manages to recapture all the humor and audacity its successful predecessor had to offer, while also offering some new thrills and unpredictability along the way. The film strikes a unique and clever balance between exploring new comedic ideas and continuing the themes from the first installment, as it maintains its core story but also offers enough twists to create new excitement. Although the storyline is very much similar to the first film, it does seem fresh and original at the same time, which creates a sequel that can be differentiated from others, as the plot is not merely redesigned in an awkward and uninteresting way. But perhaps the film's dominant feature continues to be the strong chemistry between the two leading men, who again combine their talents to create the ultimate comedy team. Overall this comedy sequel stands out due to its ability to embrace the success of the its predecessor, as 22 Jump Street uses the power of repetition to recreate the unique comedic atmosphere, which allows the film to establish a very distinct comedy series."
"callum-low","8","86","165","6 June 2014"," Funniest film of the year (so far!)
","Keeping this brief, this is no doubt the funniest film I've seen since the turn of the year. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill make a great bromance couple, and although appearing in the disappointing ""Ride Along"", Ice Cube too is brilliant in this film.<br/><br/>Expect non-stop entertainment as excellent humour is mixed with an interesting yet simple plot, heartfelt moments and exciting action. My only complaint would be that at times it felt a little recycled from the first film. Though having enjoyed that I wasn't too fussed. <br/><br/>More than worth your moneys worth. If you enjoyed 21 Jump Street, then you'd be mad not to see this."
"heatherderringer","1","119","234","2 July 2014"," Only Watch if You Are Brainwashed Into Paying For Garbage Like This as Actual Entertainment
","I have never seen such a bad movie like this one. The script is a huge load of illogical and absurd events which in the end collapse together into am anti-climax ending. And the acting even manages to out-worsen the completely trashy plot. Every actors and actresses in this film seem to worry that the audiences might not be able to hear them clearly so they just yelled at a maximum volume and it was not pleasant at all! The the slap-tick humor could have been able to save this film from becoming a total disaster but frankly it didn't work at all.<br/><br/>Trust me, there's literally nothing good about this cheap piece of B-rated half-ass movie. Save your money and never give it a go!"
"aharmas","10","23","39","14 June 2014"," Chemistry of the Best Kind!!!
","When I was about to give up on modern comedies, here comes a sequel that outdoes the original ten times or more. Tatum is excellent as the slowest of the pair, proving he's a very good comedian, both physically and delivering some of the funniest lines in the movie, and his partner, Hill, redeems himself from the depths of ""Wolf"" with a turn that shows how talented he can be. His multidimensional geek fully forms a perfect whole with the physical and sweet jock turn by Tatum.<br/><br/>Before we can catch our breaths, the leads are back in school, this time in college trying to stop the viral distribution of a new drug. We all know how it will turn out, but the set up is to put these two in an environment where they will not fit because of the obvious. Hill, well spins his character in a different dimension and takes on a romantic and bromantic persona. His romance and break up scenes rank way up there with the zaniness of ""Some Like it Hot"", and we are not prepared even in the more open times for some of the exchanges between the two actors when every other lines has a double meaning. This is classic comedy. In particular, the scene in the psychologist office had the audience laugh out loud because absolutely no one on screen was tuned to the same channel, and it kept getting funnier and funnier. For a moment, I thought I was watching ""Tootsie"" and some of its best bits when the main character was having a nightmarish experience. This time, Hill and Tatum do an amazing job by taking their bromance into new levels.<br/><br/>Tatum is definitely having the time of his life, as he finds his soul mate in school and apparently his destiny in life. Here he is living his dream, succeeding at every possible endeavor, being popular, sharing every moment with his newly found friend. This is serious competition for his undercover buddy, and the writers take flight with it when we see the reactions in Hill's face and their further exchanges.<br/><br/>The silly action scenes and the vulgarity that peppers and ruins much of what they call comedy nowadays take a second seat to the development of characters here. We're not sitting listening to boring expositions or innumerable descriptions of bathroom humor. Yes, those elements are carefully placed, and what comes out is the silliness, the naivete and stupidity of how the characters deal with their relationships with each other. What might have been vulgar in another film, here ranks with some of the best comedy in the movies. There are many tributes and references to those films throughout ""22"". Be ready to acknowledge the talents of Allen, Benny H., and a few others as winks are given to the audience. This might not be highbrow comedy, but it is beautifully delivered. Much of the credit once again goes to the incredible work by Tatum and the fine support Hill gives him. You will be laughing out loud over and over.<br/><br/>There is one scene that has the explosion of a parent in a visitation day, and Ice Cub's outburst is one of the funniest ever on film. His rantings and reactions to a sudden realization about something one of his undercover agents has done was a moment to treasure because of his excellent timing and the rest of the cast's facial reactions. Whoever wrote the screenplay did his homework and made sure that the skeleton didn't go in without every other element to make a fantastic comedy. So many times we have been given trash, full of unnecessary and stupid jokes that are more shocking than funny. The recent ""Neighbors"" being a prime example of everything that can go wrong with miscasting, misfired lines, and lazy direction.<br/><br/>To close, there is beauty in all kinds of art. We have incredible harmonies in rock and heavy metal anthems. Class and perfection doesn't only occur in historical and pretentious comedies. Those are bound to be disappointments because they appeal to people who think only a particular type of productions should be considered fine entertainment. Some of the classics surprised us because we didn't expect much at first, but we felt pleased, entertained, and we were moved with the depth of what lied behind the the facade. ""22"" is a whole piece to be savored and enjoyed, and to laugh out loud, too.<br/><br/>HAVE FUN!!!!"

"cultfilmfreaksdotcom","1","104","209","15 June 2014"," Emperor's New Backpack
","Loaded with potential, 22 JUMP STREET is the sequel to the comedic buddy teamup (based on the 1980's Johnny Depp TV show) where Christopher Tatum and Jonah Hill posed as high schoolers to bust a drug dealer Not only did it score at the box office, 21 JUMP STREET was actually really funny and involving, and the duo made a fantastic polar opposite team.<br/><br/>The first of many inside-jokes is when Ice Cube's grouchy Captain of the 22 Jump Street's new abandoned church location comments on how no one thought the first ""reboot"" (referring to the church within the movie, but not really) would actually work like it did... And now they're piling more money into this new one (again quasi-referring to the church) Something sequels actually have to do to win over audiences, a second time.<br/><br/>The intentionally mirrored storyline of Hill's Schmidt and Tatum's Jenko in college lacks the suspenseful undercover element of keeping their identities secret: Not only do they constantly shrug off the mission at hand finding the drug dealer that sold to a girl who fatally overdosed but the students they're involved with are equally pointless and unmotivated.<br/><br/>Jenko bonds with a fellow football jock while Schmidt scores (much too easily) with a girl way out of his league. The twist on who that girl's related to provides some laughter but the joke gets old after a while. As do the bromantic metrosexual comparisons about the bickering cop-partners being in and out of a close relationship... You're straight but seem otherwise: We get it already! <br/><br/>The best scenes take place after the weary college story peters out Not like it had any real juice in the first place Hell, even their current psychedelic overdose is lame and contrived. So when the boys infiltrate Spring Break/Mexico there's a neat burst of overboard sequel-action to make us forget two things: 22 isn't as good as the first venture, and the first 3/4ths of this movie isn't very good at all."
"rcolgan","7","14","23","23 June 2014"," Doing Everything The Same. Only Better.
","Usually remakes aren't very good, with many bombing and being outshone by the original version. But to everyone's surprise 21 Jump Street was a hit, earning 200 million and giving the careers of both Hill and Tatum a big boost to two already big names. Then just like any action, the producers decided to throw more money at the same people hoping for the same result. Usually all this leads to is everything being the same but with more explosions and a bigger pay-check to get the same people back.. Well, that's exactly what 22 Jump Street also does, with as much as possible remaining just the same. The difference being that it's honest about it, with the entire film mocking the regular clichés.<br/><br/>Even the outline of the plot mocks the regular concept of every sequel. Hill and Tatum are constantly reminded to do everything the exact same as last time at every chance they get to say it. The logic being since it worked last time, it'll work again. Only this time they'll throw more money at it to better ensure success. Because increasing the budget is certain to increase the profit. This is one of the many self aware jokes that the film keeps throwing at us. Usually staying fixed on joking that it's a sequel would get repetitive after a while, but the film just keeps handling it in different ways to keep the laughs coming. <br/><br/>It works because of the clever writing which parodies every detail of an action sequel, keeping the jokes fresh and original. They'll make a joke out of everything from the fact that things getting destroyed in car chases costs a lot in the budget to even John Woo's doves being randomly thrown in. At times some of the jokes don't work quite as well, but there's enough hilarious moments packed in to make sure the laughs keep coming and mocks every possible detail of the action sequel. <br/><br/>On top of this, the actors know how to make the jokes work with all the actors having the same charm as last time. Ice Cube gets his angry boss role down to the note, mastering the angry stare and yelling almost every line of dialogue he gets. The cameos from the villains be as over the top as you can get. And just like before, both Hill and Tatum bring their A game in their ultimate bromance together. It was one of the key elements of the first film and the actors chemistry remains just as funny and enjoyable here. If anything more so here, with their conversations growing more like a married couple and a lot more opportunities to be hilariously over the top. <br/><br/>Which is the main reason that 22 Jump Street is one of the few sequels that's better than the original. It's everything that 21 Jump Street was, just bigger and better. With the likes of this, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and the Lego Movie it's clear that Lord and Miller are quickly becoming 2 of the biggest and best names in comedy using both slapstick and mocking clichés to keep the laughs coming strong. I don't know whether they intend to do any more sequels, but as long as they maintain the consistently funny films that they have so far I can only hope that they make as many jump streets as they can."
"GamingPlays","2","108","237","30 June 2014"," An insult to IMDb for this to be rated any higher than 7
","I mean seriously. This used to be a respected site that gave people who didn't know much films insight into the greatest films and audience ratings for every film they've ever watched. 8.0. Dammit IMDb users.<br/><br/>This film is categorized as comedy, so I pessimistically expected a few laughs. I got 4. Two were for slapstick comedy, one was at Ice Cube's death stare, and the final laugh I had was at the end credits (Not because they were funny, but because the entire audience was utterly silent at the forced humour). I wasn't alone, in the theatre it was mostly silent, as we googled the bloody IMDb page to check if it was a comedy. Small British audience I'll give you that, and pretty strange considering how 'everyone' (Americans) laughed their ass of at this movie. The opening sequence chase had me in awe of how bad it was.<br/><br/>Before you type an angry reply saying ""You just don't get the humour"" or ""It doesn't suit everybody"". I understand. This is just my view, it may not be right, I may get proved wrong, but here is my case and the overwhelming evidence to prove why. The repetitive cinematography, the forced homoerotic jokes (as if the movie sends out a strong message on the subject), the pop-culture based soundtrack choices and the 'making fun of ourselves' tries so hard to be clever it ruins the movie. Although these factors ruin the movie like a crooked candle ruins a pound-land birthday cake.<br/><br/>I feel like I can envisage Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall (One of the screenplay writers) sitting down and saying stupid ideas and Jonah going ""Hah! That would be so funny!"" after every one. I like Jonah, he is a good actor, and Channing is trying so hard to impress I can't fault him for what his character is tasked to do.<br/><br/>But here it comes, the problem that made me cringe, the audience look at each other and say ""Oh god"", the one person in my theatre walk out (probably the reason), The Dialogue.<br/><br/>Oh my goodness. How did this film make it past the producing companies with this damn dialogue. The film tries to make itself clever, it does little references that try and make it a film that is funny, but still smart. Like that budget gag, or the ""Gringo Pendejos"". The prodigious awkwardness between Jonah (I'm not going to say the character names due to the fact I lost 8 quid on this movie) and the bland bland bland spouse of his (we get it, Jonah's character isn't as good with girls as Channing, but due to his doughy lovable personality, he gets the girl! Wow!), had me contemplating walking out. The other girl, Jillain Bell brought a lot more, but not enough to make any noticeable difference. Channing Tatum's 'bro' language with his 'buddy', was just horrific. It was a train wreck. Something I imagine Americans found funny. Like the whole ""American college is a non-stop drug fuelled orgy"" theme that it embraced shamelessly. Oh, and the token drug trip that had such potential, but it was just terrific...ly painful to watch.<br/><br/>This movie says in full view, ""It's the same as before! Oh wait, it isn't! Hah!"", and I wouldn't mind. That's right. I would not care. It's another film of the Project X genre, of America high-fiving itself. But it's just another right? Well that's what I thought, but then I see so many people saying how damn amazing it is, I saw a thread (highly sophisticated reviewing and analysing may I add) that went like this,<br/><br/>""They (*Probably the two main characters who are liked so much people can't see them do wrong) were awesome! *spoiler* when I saw seth rogen I DIED! and when Jonah Hill was acting like nothing changed! lol! ""<br/><br/>Seeing Seth Rogen isn't funny. I like his movies, but he didn't do anything funny. It's immature humour that is carelessly littered and licked up by Americans (sorry for repeating myself, but who else could like this so much to give it an 8.0?)<br/><br/>If someone thinks differently, please give me your best shot. Because it is an insult to rate this film so highly if I am really seeing it as it is. Did I miss the humour? Was Jonah Hill doing a Mexican accent funny? Was Channing Tatum dancing to a song of ""ass and titties"" funny? It wasn't. I see why it appeals to a certain 'type' of audience member, but I thought that's why IMDb is here? To direct us away from these peoples opinions.<br/><br/>Enlighten me, because my oh my am I reviewing using IMDb at all if this piece of garbage is rated 0.3 off '2001 A Space Odyssey"". Some people will find this funny, some will not, but I hope I have persuaded you that it is not a great film."

"TheSeaLion","1","50","111","24 June 2014"," Better than the first though that isn't saying much
","I swear, sometimes I'm too optimistic. Even though ""21 Jump Street"" is one of my least favorite movies and one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I felt obligated to see ""22 Jump Street"" and went through with it because I thought this time around they may of had something. While ""22 Jump Street"" is better than ""21 Jump Street"", though that isn't hard for any movie to do, it still suffers from the same problems as the first and has some elements to it that even surpasses ""21 Jump Street"" in awfulness.<br/><br/>Starting off with Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) once again screwing up a police mission, they somehow get to keep their jobs and are just put back onto Jump Street, now moved across the street in a different abandoned church. Schmidt and Jenko are given the relatively same assignment as they had in the last film except this time they're going to college because they look too old for high school, which raises the question why they're working for a police group that goes undercover as students when everyone can see that they aren't students.<br/><br/>""22 Jump Street"" does a lot of the same stuff that its predecessor did, especially the use of self-awareness as a mode of self-preservation. Just because a movie is unneeded and pointless but is aware of it does not make it any less unneeded and pointless. A movie like ""Scream"" is self-aware, but it uses that self-awareness to try and make it stand out while ""22 Jump Street"" makes light of the fact that they're doing the whole thing over again without adding anything new to it. It's fine if a movie is self-aware, but ""22 Jump Street"" does not use it to its full advantage and just uses it as a tool so people can't criticize the movie because it's self-aware.<br/><br/>Once again, Schmidt and Jenko share zero chemistry together, despite the fact they helped each other through the police academy, went through the high school mission together and supposedly came out stronger, and now have been partners for a while. Not only do these two not show any chemistry, their relationship is easily showed up by Jenko's friendship with Zook (Wyatt Russell). I do not remember a single memorable moment between Schmidt and Jenko alone. <br/><br/>This time around, Jenko is the one having fun and getting caught up in the whole school experience while Schmidt is the outcast who we're supposed to feel sorry for. Unfortunately, this backfires as Jenko makes attempts to keep their duo together and Schmidt just can't keep up while at the same time Jenko is trying to move on and Schmidt is holding him back. Why am I supposed to want these two to be partners when it's so evident one is holding the other back and they share zero chemistry?<br/><br/>To the movie's credit, there were three mildly amusing parts to it. One of which involves Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) finding out that Schmidt and his daughter (Amber Stevens) hooked up, Jenko finding out and then running around telling everyone at Jump Street what happened, and the first part of the ending credits with Schmidt and Jenko in med school. Aside from those three parts, the movie is made up of the same desperate attempts at comedy that the first film had.<br/><br/>With the same problems as the first film but with three mildly amusing comedy scenes, ""22 Jump Street"" is better than ""21 Jump Street"" in the most superficial terms, but better nonetheless. Though, when you're a sequel to ""21 Jump Street"", expectations are on the ground so there is no way to go but up."

","This film packs just a few good jokes in a full 112 minutes of bad, naive, trivial, vulgar and infantile ones. You will experience moments of real embarrassment for being supposed to laugh at such a crap. Believe me, if you're not a teen still struggling your way out through high school (or maybe even younger), this movie is definitely not for you. I think even a college freshman would find it simplistic and not so funny. The two cops relation development is so obvious, so trivial, it can't really make up for the entire film, as it is supposed to do instead. While their investigation (and action scenes) is relegated to the background. On top of that those action scenes seem to be taken directly from a 90s teen B-movie, not even near to be realistic or engaging. Both Hill and Tatung are capable of much better performances (as they already showed), they should begin to choose better script. Not worth watching, really."
"khalidabusamra","9","15","30","5 June 2014"," A wildly entertaining feel-good movie that not only rates as one of the best mainstream comedies of the year but also one of the finest sequels you are likely to see.
","There are only a few occasions where some of the jokes feel over-worked and the pace sags but even then Lord and Miller always seem to have something up their sleeve to put the film back on track. It's a wildly entertaining feel-good movie that not only rates as one of the best mainstream comedies of the year but also one of the finest sequels you're ever likely to see.<br/><br/>The only truly negative thing I have to say about ""22 Jump Street"" is that Chris Miller and Phil Lord are setting themselves up to eventually become a media punching bag. That's the inevitable ending when someone's on a winning streak, and right now, Miller and Lord are looking like the guys you call when you have a terrible idea but want to make a great film anyway. That's an amazing skill set, and I find myself deeply impressed by each new thing they release.<br/><br/>What made ""21 Jump Street"" so much fun was that it was completely self- aware. The movie openly made fun of what a terrible idea it is to turn old TV shows into new movies, and it also managed to run some very smart and fun riffs on high school movies and buddy cop films, constantly subverting expectations in a way that I think added up to something that felt very fresh.<br/><br/>That, of course, is the challenge when you then set out to make a sequel to something, because by its very nature, a sequel is going to be less fresh. Miller and Lord did not make the sequel to their animated hit ""Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs,"" and it appears that the sequel to their monster success ""The LEGO Movie"" will be directed by Chris McKay. So why would they risk making something that feels like a rehash by returning to direct ""22 Jump Street""?<br/><br/>So they can make fun of sequels, obviously.<br/><br/>From the second it begins, ""22 Jump Street"" roasts the idea of sequels. There are so many targets within that larger target that I was sort of impressed at how well they managed to cover all of it. More expensive than the original? Check. Same story only slightly disguised? Check. Artificial tension created to undo whatever character growth there was in the original? Check.<br/><br/>As with the first film, they have more on their mind than just making the sequel joke. This time, they take on the conventions of the college movie, and it feels like both Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are given room to play to their strengths here. They have a great chemistry as a team, but what I find really amazing watching these films is just how much Tatum has embraced this side of himself. I would have never guessed that there was such a big goofy clown heart driving this guy from the first few years of work he did on screen, but there are at least ten places in the sequel where I missed whatever came after one of Tatum's punchlines. He's got a way of approaching a joke that hits me out of left field almost every time. Jonah Hill is a very precise comic performer, and there are a ton of tiny grace notes to his performance here, small choices that punch the jokes up to another level. Miller and Lord know that these films work best when it's just these two guys pinballing off of each other, and there's plenty of that.<br/><br/>There's also an interesting take on sexual politics running throughout the film, and I honestly thought they were headed somewhere daring with Tatum's character. In the end, they don't quite commit to the idea, but it still feels like the script, written by Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, and Rodney Rothman, is determined to push the characters into some surprising places. I loved the use of Ice Cube this time as Captain Dickson, and there is one long dinner sequence with Cube that left me sore from laughing. Amber Stevens and Wyatt Russell have to do a fair amount of heavy lifting as new characters who befriend Schmidt and Jenko at college, and that's always tough in a comedy like this. Stevens is a very appealing performer, but she's not given much to do. On the other hand, Jillian Bell (best known from the Comedy Central show ""Workaholics"") hits the ground running in this one, and she steals scene after scene after scene.<br/><br/>I'd hate to give away any of the ways the story builds here, because there are some very conscious decisions made to not only mirror the structure of the first film, but to also play against that first movie in ways that screw with expectations. Suffice it to say that it is a cannily-constructed film, and it does have a bigger ""movie"" feel than the first film. There are places where they swing for some big jokes that don't quite work, but the ambition is dizzying all the way through.<br/><br/>You need to stay through the closing credits, which are funnier than many full-length feature films, because there is even more at the very, very end of the film. Miller and Lord make it feel like they value every second you spend watching one of their films, and they do their best to pack the film so that you get something out of every minute you give them. I'm sure at some point, these guys will make a movie that doesn't quite work. It happens to everyone. But for now, it honestly feels like there is no more reliable filmmaking team right now if you want to go above and beyond with any idea."
"smohit","10","12","23","18 August 2014"," Plain review
","22 Jump Street, sequel of the amazing 21 jump street is an utterly entertaining comedy which is guaranteed to elicit rounds of laughter just like its predecessor. Directed by Phil Lord, this movie subsumes both solid content and good screenplay. The lead pair of Schmidt(J. Hill) and Jenko (C. Tatum) does an excellent job with their chemistry serving as an icing on the cake to a fabulously written script. The two men who are disguised as cops go to a local college to bust a drug distribution network following the orders of 'The Captain'. The story builds on their interactions with the college students, possible suspects and the investigations they carry out. Hill wins the hearts of the audience with the timing of his hilarious dialogs while the mysterious setup of the movie keeps the viewer engaged. An impressive aspect of the movie is that it does an excellent job observing the different aspects of college life which everyone who has attended college can relate to. I would give the movie a perfect rating of 10 on 10 as it is a must see for people who like to laugh !"

This one is dependent on the audience being puerile. Jonah Hill is a very good actor. He should find grown up parts in grown up movies. There were good elements though like the throw away lines of the girl engaged in a gun fight and the young adult-speak in humorous situations. But really? This seemed to entertain those around me in the audience more than I thought was warranted; so there you go it must be me not everybody else. I notice it got a lot of rave reviews on this site so don't let my menopausal negativity get to you. Take no notice of me because you might like it. I am probably wrong and the other reviewers who thought it was good perhaps were right. If you are over 40 don't bother. If you are over 50 definitely don't bother.

It wasn't really funny to begin with, and then it just dragged on and on. A lot of the jokes were just slapstick crap. I remember 21 jump street felt quite fresh, and I can't tell whether this film has lost that charm or perhaps I've grown up a bit and I wouldn't find the original as funny any more as well.

The jokes were really weak, along with the storyline which wasn't that great either. I liked the chemistry between the two characters but I found it silly and a bit over the top. Basically, these two misfits have to find out who is selling this new drug called WhyPhy, in a college. Tatum's character becomes best friends with a fellow college student who he plays football with, which jeopardises his relationship with Jonah's character. It isn't the greatest storyline and I did lose interest after a while, but the acting from these two accomplished actors keeps the movie going. Personally, I was quite disappointed after all of the hype surrounding the film.Â <br/><br/>Round-Up: I really wasn't that impressed with Channing Tatum's acting when he first came on the scene, but he really has become an household name, especially after starring in Magic Mike and G.I. Joe. I particularly didn't like his dancing movies but now that he has starred in comedy and action roles, he has really become an versatile actor who doesn't take himself as seriously as he did in his earlier years. I've always been a fan of Jonah Hill's work and he really did impress me in the Wolf Of Wall Street. Personally I think that he done a better job than DiCaprio especially knowing that those ridiculous teeth were his idea. Anyway, this film has really gone down well with audiences worldwide but it just wasn't my cup of tea.<br/><br/>Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $331million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there silly comedies about a couple of officers who enrol into a college to find out who is selling drugs to the students. 4/10"

","I could not stand watching this film. It took four hours of my life to get through it as I was so bored, I would pause it to do other things. There was not one laugh. The acting was one bad joke after another. The good reviews for this trash are beyond sane. Do not waste a minute of your life on this garbage. I thought the first version was OK and got through it, even though this kind of film is not my taste at all. It really bothers me when filmmakers, and I do include the actors in this, assume we will indulge them in their silly inside jokes and amateurish bits that get recycled over and over. <br/><br/>I don't think that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have much to offer, but sadly this may be them at their bestÂ…..one bad sight gag after another.

","Without spoiling anything about this awful childish movie, I'll try to tell you folks what to expect when you watch this waste of a movie: Expect a lot of penis jokes. A LOT. Way more than in the first one. Expect a lot of gay jokes. Literally gay. They aren't even jokes, they are more like making fun of gay relationships. Through all the movie, the protagonists seem to fight and use arguments that gay couples use. They are usually thought of as a gay couple, which is supposed to be funny, RIGHT GUISE??? xDDD. I don't get all the good reviews, this movie was made for 8th graders. ""Penis, vagina, gay couple that is not gay, penis, fart xDDDDDD"""

","22 Jump Street had few funny moments and a similar storyline to its prequel, but that's about it. With subpar acting, weak plot and somewhat bland comedy, the second instalment has much to improve upon.<br/><br/>This film recasts familiar faces with Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as costars. As their bromance is tenuous in the new world of college, they begin to undergo changes. Watching this movie was exciting at times and a bore at others. With good scenes scattered seldom among the rest, I did not enjoy this movie as much as I had hoped. The jokes were common and action was numbing. <br/><br/>Although this movie has been featured throughout the summer as a hit, it is a miss. Hopefully future instalments will try to be more original."

","How can I be disappointed with it when I knew it was going to stink...? Had to give it at least 5 stars because there were laugh out loud moments sprinkled throughout the movie, but I didn't find myself uncontrollably laughing like I was in 21JS.<br/><br/>The movie parodied sequels as a whole and itself MULTIPLE times, but it was far too ""on the nose"" for my taste. I'm usually not that good at finding the subtext in movies, but 22 Jump beats you over the head with it and it hits you like a tire iron. Examples include ""23 Jump Street Coming Soon"" (Next to the old Korean church), the over the top ""sequel bashing"" scene with the deputy chief, and of course...the end credits.<br/><br/>The plot is unabashedly 100% recycled except this time, Jenko is popular and Schmidt is a loser again. Oh, and they are in college.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum literally carries this movie on his back. Jonah Hill really isn't as funny in this movie which is disappointing.<br/><br/>There's too much Ice Cube. Really. He was funny in 21JS, but just because he fit the limited role so well. He does too much here and it gets old fast although the twist involving him and his daughter is pretty darn hilarious I have to admit.<br/><br/>Villain wasn't nearly as funny as Ron Riggle or Giggle or w/e his name is. The jokes about Jonah Hill being old were stupid because he doesn't look that old, just looks like he needs a few extra hours of sleep.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street thought it could get a pass by being blasÃ© about sequels and making fun of itself, but it's just an attempt to disguise a lazy attempt at topping box office magic, and it definitely failed.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street is a stinker...Keep in mind, this is coming from a guy who thought 21 Jump Street was one of the better comedies of the last decade."

","It doesn't happen often, that I think a sequel is at least as good as the original movie. But this kind of even topped the original. It's really great, because it is so self aware. Not only of itself, but in general (talking sequels or its stars, especially Channing Tatum makes fun of himself a lot). You'll either cherish and are delighted by this fact or you don't really care.<br/><br/>If you do care and have seen the original (Ice Cube also returning), you will love where this is going. Sometimes it's borderline mental (story-wise), but in the end it all makes ""sense"". Well as much sense as this can make. Obviously this was very successful and another sequel might be on its way (curious to see who's going to cameo in that then) soon. Ideas where this might go?

"anthonymora2","8","9","20","22 September 2014"," 22 Jump Street Review
","You ever watch a sequel to a movie, and the sequel was pretty much the same thing as the original with nothing new to give our money's worth? Well , 22 Jump Street both is and spoofs the idea of that last sentence... and it kills! So we pick up again with Schmidt and Jenko (Hill and Tatum) in the middle of a drug bust. The two blow it, and after being told that maybe they should ""just do what you did last time"" are thrown right back into the same exact situation that they were put into in the original movie 2 years ago. The situation, of course, to go undercover and find who's selling a new drug to the local student body. Only NOW, instead of high school misshaps, we get some college chaos! The thing that I liked most about 22 JS is that it's a fun movie and doesn't take itself seriously, AT ALL! People will say, ""waah but it's the SAME movie!"" and the movie will spit back in your face ""we know stupid"", almost literally in some scenes. Like I said guys, it's more than less the same movie we got back in 2012, so the story gets 0 points for any originality. But the comedy makes this movie feel fresh and always coming at you. That's props to the group of writers behind the script. You get a lot of good gut hurting moments where you're laughing hard, but their are maybe two scenes that had me like ""okay this joke is stale"". The roommate who kept calling Jonah Hill old needed to delete from my sight. Another strong point that makes this a great comedy is the chemistry between the star duo. You just wanna hang out with these two dudes, their both hilarious in their roles. Jonah Hill is funny as always, Channing Tatum is someone I'm getting to like more and more but it's Ice Cube ladies and gentlemen that steals #themothafuckinshow. The dinner buffet scene is GOLD! Or should I say ICE COLD ðŸ˜‰. Again there were a few jokes that got boring after too many blows and the villains in this movie were't as enjoyable as the ones in the first, but this is a really funny comedy action buddy flick. Stay tuned for an awesome end credits that makes the movie! I recommend you definitely buy it on Blu- ray!"

","Half the time, I'm the kind of person that thinks the original is always the best, but on very rare occasions, the sequel can surpass its predecessor. This review may contain spoilers! 22 Jump Street had bigger action and some better jokes than '21' It's a sequel that's self-aware that it's spoofing the sequel genre and talk about 're-hashing the same old stuff' It distances itself from the television series, almost like the original and brings a fresh take to the buddy cop genre. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum return as Schmidt and Jenko. 21 Jump Street has been bought back by the Koreans, so they move across the street to 22 Jump Street. This time, the duo go undercover as college students to track down the supplier of a drug called ""WHYPHY"" (WiFi) that killed a student on campus. Schmidt meets up with a girl named Maya (forget about Molly from the previous movie) while Jenko hangs out with a cool football jock named Zook, who might be involved with the drug. There are some great cameos and the ending credits are AMAZING! (Be sure to stay and watch all thru the credits) I loved this sequel, it has tons of laughs, and great exploding action! I highly recommend 22 JUMP STREET!!!"
"ScottGentry","8","8","18","10 June 2014"," Quite possibly the funniest film of the year so far; Lord and Miller's sequel is pure delight.
","""22 Jump Street"" (15) Directed by: Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. Starring: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Peter Stormare, Ice Cube, Amber Stevens and Nick Offerman. <br/><br/>After cracking the case of a lifetime, officers Scmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are back on the streets to investigate a villainous drug smuggler, known only as Ghost (Stormare). The investigation however, proves to be unsuccessful and as their Deputy Chief Hardy (Offerman) puts it ever so bluntly, ""just go back and do the same s**t you did last time. Then everyone's happy"", the pair soon act upon the chief's stern warning, and return to undercover assignments. This time the pair are placed amongst a university, in order to stop a new drug named ""WhyPhy"" (it's pronounced like Wi-Fi), from going viral. <br/><br/>It's worth remembering that ""21 Jump Street"" was a film that wasn't expected to perform well in terms of critical and commercial success, however the film exceeded all expectations, proving to become a sure- fire hit, with a relatively small budget of $42 million. Sequels are normally bigger in terms of budget, cast and plot and this is no exception with ""22 Jump Street"", which had a budget of $70 million, proving that with every sequel, the budget increases dramatically, which is also evident in James Bobin's ""Muppets Most Wanted"", released earlier this year. <br/><br/>In spite of budget increases, sequels can become however too ambitious for their own good. But thankfully, this isn't the case with ""22 Jump Street"". Instead this is a sequel which continues to deliver quirky and off-beat sensibilities like its predecessor, which is mainly due to the inspired writing of Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman, a trio of screenwriters, who are ambitious in their comedic style. The film's style and script is often reminiscent of ""Scott Pilgrim V.s The World"", (a film which Bacall also helped write, alongside Edgar Wright), which proves the comedic style is one that works extremely well on screen. <br/><br/>The direction is also well organised by the duo Lord and Miller, a pair of directors who met in Dartmouth College and proceeded to direct films such as 2009's ""Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs"", ""21 Jump Street"" and ""The Lego Movie, all of which opened to critical acclaim. Having shown their ability for mixing comedy and riotous action, the two use their creative input to once again create a bizarre comedy, which is as zany as the first. <br/><br/>If not the funniest script this year, ""22 Jump Street"" is completed in its excellence by the pairing of Hill and Tatum. The two actors, possibly providing the most homo erotic bromance ever seen on screen, undeniably contributing exceptional comic performances, confirming their ability to act in an all manner of roles; Hill was electrifying in ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" and Tatum has reportedly provided a career best performance, in Bennett Miller's ""Foxcatcher"". <br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>Quite possibly the funniest film of the year so far; Lord and Miller's sequel is pure delight, with whip-smart comedy and a bone-achingly funny end credits sequence. ""23 Jump Street""? Yes please. <br/><br/>8 Stars out of 10<br/><br/>Written by Scott Gentry."

","I'm afraid I have to trash this movie. I hated it. I'm angry at myself for sitting through the whole thing even though I realised after two minutes that I hated it.<br/><br/>The only scene I truly enjoyed was the fight scene between Jillian Bell and Jonah Hill. In my books, Bell was the only truly funny person in this movie.<br/><br/>I found the bromance relationships between Schmidt and Jenko, and then between Jenko and Zook, to be forced and unrealistic. In the end the making fun of homoeroticism made me uncomfortable. Look, it's like they're gay! Why is that so funny? It's not. The bantering between them was ridiculous.<br/><br/>The relationship between Maya and Schmidt was absurd. The Captain Dickson character didn't work for me at all. I wanted him to stop. I couldn't figure out what that police complex was about. Why was Jenko like some Terminator Spiderman guy? I don't know. So many questions.<br/><br/>This is yet another American movie to portray college life like some orgiastic drink-and-drug fest. It's not like that. <br/><br/>The students in this movie were too old to be playing their parts. The jokes about Schmidt and Jenko being too old fell flat because of it.<br/><br/>It's derisory that this movie currently gets 8 on IMDb.com. It's worth about a 4. I'd bump it up to 5 to acknowledge the scenes with Bell, but then when I think about wasting two hours watching this movie it makes me angry, so I'm lowering that back down to 4. Maybe you have to see the first movie to get this one, but I definitely won't see it now."

","Schmidt and Jenko are back on undercover. After a failed bust on Ghost, this time they're in college after a new drug WHYPHY claims one girl Cynthia. Jenko soon makes friends with Zook and Rooster the jocks, Rooster has the same tattoo as a man in an intel photo. Schmidt gets close to Maya, an art student, to a point that they have sex. It turns out that Maya is Cpt. Dickson's daughter. Jenko gets play football and turns out to be good at it, up to a point that he tells Schmidt that he thinks of quitting being a policeman and continue football with Zook, all while in a car chase after Ghost, which ended in a failure. <br/><br/>They separate for a while but reunites again and finds that Mercedes, Maya's roommate, is actually Ghost's daughter and WHYPHY dealer. In a bust, with Dickson's men, Ghst run off after Mercedes shoots and kidnaps Dickson. Schmidt eventually catches her and joins Jenko in chasing Ghost. They both jump and hang on Ghost's helicopter. Schmidt grabs Jenko's hand as he slips and then Jenko throws a grenade on the helicopter, finishing their job for this movie. Dickson then tells the pair about their next job in medical school, which is a sneak peek at 23 Jump Street, the next sequel.<br/><br/>The story is 'just the same' as the original, if you catch my drift, LOL. Anyways, yeah the story is essentially the same as the prequel, as the narc pair navigate their way within the world of college. The twists are quite nice, especially about Maya and Mercedes, although quite predictable.<br/><br/>But the real fun factor and magnet for viewers are the jokes, which are quite original. The 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' fight scene is just a hilarious spoof of the Pitt-Jolie movie. The thing with Schmidt wanting to take a bullet for Jenko is also stupidly hilarious although only shown for some short time. The thing with Mr. Walters and Eric is also a nice and crazy comedy.<br/><br/>The acting is quite surprisingly a bit of lower quality than of the original 21 Jump Street (2012). Channing Tatum loses a bit of his facial expression in comparison to the prequel. But Jonah Hill gets more hilarious. Ice Cube gets a more cheerful mood for his character now, despite the thing for the scene before the taser scene.<br/><br/>The verdict is a definite 7 out of 10 score from me for this movie. A recommendation is a yes because this movie is not a waste of your time and money, definitely a good laugh."

","They are back with a sequel and contrary to every law in cinema there is... The sequel was actually funny! I have seen many movie franchises destroyed by rushed god awful sequels that left you wondering: ""why didn't they stop while they were ahead?"" But this movie is something different. Most of the bad reviews it received were due to people riding their high horses picturing comedy antics of gods themselves and comparing it to this movie. People need to face the facts. Comedy is hard, and you cant be closed minded if you go to watch a comedy. But if you can let yourself enjoy the moment and not try to be sarcastic all the time this movie is for you. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have great chemistry together. The contrast in their looks and personalities provides a good base for the movie and the plot can easily branch out from it.<br/><br/>Now there is one problem id like to point out... It might be awkward to watch it in the cinema. The humor of it is specific and the tens jam packed cinema setting is a place where comedy goes to die. So my recommendation is to watch it at home with some friends and a beer/chips combination. Because a relaxed atmosphere is where this type of movie can thrive."
"MacTheMovieguy","10","7","16","23 July 2014"," This film is perfection.
","This film is perfection. I haven't laughed this hard in a movie in a long time. Last year, my favorite comedy was This Is The End. I honestly believe this film is funnier than that. I know that's a bold statement, but there are just so many perfect moments in this film. Some spoilers lie ahead.<br/><br/>First of all, Jonah Hill has to have been laughing inside the past couple weeks over this situation about his using a gay slur at a paparazzi. There's a running gag in this film that Tatum's character just found out that using gay slurs isn't cool, and it comes to a head at the worst time, when he decides to educate a villain in how to not use gay slurswhich is more important than keeping his cover. It's even funnier watching Jonah Hill in the scene, knowing what he's been dealing with the past couple weeks.<br/><br/>Secondly, the credits. OMG. Jump Street goes meta, and becomes fully self aware. I don't know if there will ever be a 23 Jump Street (even though the film references this twice), because the ending seems to say ""how many times could we possibly do this?"" and to hilarious results.<br/><br/>Tatum and Hill are such a great team, and if they can do another film with Phil Lord and Chris Miller, I wouldn't mind a 23 Jump Street. Even if it was 23 Jump Street: Culinary School. Those four people together can do anything they want.<br/><br/>This film isn't just a ""you should see it"", it's a ""you MUST see it"". There's absolutely no chance you won't laugh at least a few times. There's a huge gag between Hill and Cube, and when you see it just I almost peed myself laughing. It's one of the best setups and payoffs, and it's followed up later by Tatum, in the second best payoff in the film. I also enjoyed seeing Jimmy Tatro getting some screen love. I'm a fan of his Vines.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you shouldn't even be reading this last paragraph. You should have already left your house to go see this film. I can write whatever I want here. Blah blah blah. Words. More words. Oh, you're still here? GO SEE 22 JUMP STREET."
"TheMovieSnob247","7","7","16","29 June 2014"," This is outrageously funny!
","This was a laugh out loud, outrageously funny movie from start to finish and a great time at the movies. The odd couple pairing of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum continues to work really well. I haven't enjoyed a tandem like this since Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker from the Rush Hour movies. Tatum continues to surprise as he clearly has a funny side (it's not all Jonah Hill here); comedy and action movies might just be his wheelhouse. Ice Cube and Jillian Bell (Dixie from Eastbound & Down) also provide their share of really funny moments (especially Jillian who has a few gut busting scenes with Jonah near the end).<br/><br/>I was worried the shtick would feel stale after 21 Jump Street but I was surprised that it was just as funny as the original (if not better). While it does drag a bit down the stretch, it wasn't unbearable. It's a buddy comedy that does what it's supposed to: make you laugh and *laugh a lot*. If you enjoyed the first one, make sure you catch this hilarious sequel. <br/><br/>Was my review not horrible? Great!

"billygoat1071","8","7","16","19 June 2014"," Same Business Mockery
","More than once, the characters keep stating that they're doing the same thing all over again. 22 Jump Street as a movie itself is basically an uninspired clone of the first one, except it's bigger and has higher production, but lazily follows the same storyline and delivers the jokes with an only occasional energy (well, at the first act at least). While it's still funny, it only appears as an entertaining yet forgettable sequel. But there is a punchline and a wise sprinkle of self-awareness behind this. Everything you've first thought about it turns out to be the other way around, therefore it's a smart surprising trick that you will end up smiling.<br/><br/>The plot is absolutely no different from the first: the heroes as actual cops messes with a drug business, decides to better off undercover as students to another case, explore around the culture of the generation, friendship gets a loyalty issue, their targets at the first act turns out to be connected with their current mission, goes to a party, finally faced fears, etc. This is not a spoiler, we've already seen this coming. With these same elements coming through, we are immediately assuming ourselves that this won't live up with the quality of its predecessor. It's not only because it's exactly the same, but it also gets a less clever treatment. Example is portraying today's college life doesn't get any much enough clever gags to poke fun of, which is a total contrary to the absurd shift of tolerance in the high school world of the first film. Also their relationship with the students aren't as appealing as the last one, too. The mission however improves with its turns.<br/><br/>But eventually, this is definitely in purpose. It satirizes cash-in movie franchises that throws the same knockout repetitively. Hollywood's bribery to people is the budget and celebrities, the end credits sums that up, and the police station's description with the Jump Street program is an obvious allegory of what's going on. While the million dollar compromise is taken as a joke, the comedic value outside the idea never lacks and indeed they are everywhere. But the genuine value that kept things a lot alive is the chemistry between the lead stars, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. The two continue to shine in their buddy comedy figure and it has become the unbreakable core of these movies.<br/><br/>The main point of 22 Jump Street is to be a large and mediocre sequel like many others out there, except of course with a strong sense of self-awareness. It's not noticeable if it takes its clichés too seriously, but later then you would start to notice that it is all part of the joke. It's not the most smartest thing you'll ever see in the genre, but it sure is a slick thing to pull off. You will still get some great loud laughs within the story and the growth of the best friend relationship between the main characters remains brilliant as usual. If you think that 22 Jump Street is an inferior redux of the first then you are right, but for some reason you could be also wrong."

","So this movie could have been a lot better. I did appreciate the recap of the first movie, but for some reason this second one didn't really have me entertained. The movie was kinda cliché and showed how karma happens with Jonah not being the cool kid and Channing being the cool kid as oppose to the first one. This movie needed better jokes and a lot less puns. For example the ""giant cube of ice"" kinda made me cringe a little bit. As I continued to watch the movie I thought things were going to be a lot better, but in my opinion the movie got worse and worse. I really tried to see the comedy in the whole thing, but it wasn't really getting to me. As much, as the movie had the silly parts and the bad jokes it could have used some work.

","I've always seen IMDb as the holy grail of reviews; with the exception of the Horror genre, the rating of a movie is usually spot-on. At the time of writing, 22 Jump Street has 7.3 and I don't understand how. <br/><br/>21 Jump Street was bearable and had its moments. However, 22 shows no real refinement of the first; in fact all I considered when watching it was the half-baked movies before pioneering comedy originals such as 40 year old virgin and Superbad.<br/><br/>The humour was bromidic, overused and almost as silly as some of the dreadful spoofs nowadays. Like most sequels, it seems the script writers have jumped on the success of the first movie; the same gags, plot and situational embarrassment, which begs the question, why make another!?<br/><br/>As a side note, Jonah Hill is a rising star with amazing potential, acting in supporting roles such as Wolf of Wall Street which he rightly deserved an Oscar nomination. I get it that comedies are his thing. However, this is not just an all-time-low for Hill in regards to comedies, but an insult to his talent for more auspicious roles."

There were many scenes in this movie where no one was laughing except a few 13ish year old girls... that's bad. To have an entire theater not laughing during parts that are supposed to be funny is not a good sign. A few people actually walked out of the movie and never came back...

","It's a squeal kinda spoofing sequels. ""22 Jump Street"" is the sequel to the 2012 film ""21 Jump Street"" where Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play undercover cops trying to investigate a drug dealer at a high school. The trailer looked absolutely hilarious, but ended for a huge disappointment. The film had a hilarious opening and ending, but a flat middle. Now in ""22 Jump Street"" undercover cops Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) investigate another drug in college. Except this time, we never have anything hilarious. We get a clever opening that was funnier in the trailer, one very uncomfortable and funny scene from Jonah Hill, an outrageous coincidence with Ice Cube and... that's about it. There's too many forced jokes that are some flat and weak and have been told millions of times. This one is structured almost identically to ""21 Jump Street"" which deprives us of refreshing laughs. There are long action sequences with fast humor that is just painful to watch and hardly any material for these talented comedians to work with. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller didn't work with their co-writers on making a final draft, instead the first things they wrote are what they used. We can tell! The comedy is so plane and simple and we don't even get dumb and pointless humor, which is the best! After seeing replayed jokes and extended action scenes similar o the first one, we get very tired of seeing this film try and stick it out. I will say that the spoof on the ending credits of making different Jump Street films was clever. We keep hearing Ice Cube say ""You two sons of bitches are going to-"" and then a various establishment where they must fight crime. There were probably 50 different Jump Streets mentioned in the credits, which I hope never get made."

Ridiculously childish humour which I think Jonah Hill could do a lot better, having paid his dues through comedy movies, I am not entirely surprised to have thought of this as a good script/movie choice. <br/><br/>I (generously) gave this film a 4 because I am not a believer that just because you don't like a movie, it makes it a 1 star which many seem to do. for what this film is though it could quite possibly be a 1 or a 2."

"ironhorse_iv","7","5","11","25 June 2014"," Time to jump into Jump Street again. It was a pretty good movie.
","I think the character, Captain Hardy (Nick Offerman) sum this movie up within the first 10 minutes of the film. 'Nobody cared about the Jump Street reboot. But 21 Jump Street got lucky. So now this department has invested a lot of money to make sure Jump Street keeps going.' Indeed, nobody really care about 2012's 21 Jump Street being made. After surprising, folks when it was release, due to its humor. The studio indeed put more money into the sequel. It really does show. Directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, once again, the movie hit all the bad sequel clichés, while make it work due to its being self-aware. It wasn't as annoying as 2011's Hangover 2 type remake. Indeed, the movie pretty much follows the same plot as the last movie, but this time, the duo cops, Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) & Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are going undercover as college students, looking to locate a mysterious drug dealer that deals with a drug called Why Phy (Work Hard Yes, Play Hard Yes, and pronounced ""Wi-Fi""). I guess, people loves same old same old concepts. For me, I was all for another round of laughs from this movie, but I felt that, it was a bit cheesy at parts like the whole using a woman body as a weapon at the beach seem so out of place, the whole Mexican accent by Jonah Hill or the killer octopus attack slapstick. Then, there are the same old gags made for laughs that was a bit bitter taste such as I'm dating somebody you know, so get angry gag. Honestly, I like 2012's 21 Jump Street. It's like the taste of your first drink, but having more of the same old, same old, isn't going to be that great. Nothing can beats the original. After all, 2012's 21 Jump Street really did surprise me. This movie felt a little water down. What made this movie work over other recent comedies sequel such as 2013's Grown Up 2, and Scary Movie 5, is how it's mastered the meta approach towards sequels with clever inside genre movie tropes jokes, the movie is based on and for. It never sink so low, to add a lot of gross out humor. The movie is Rated R for crude language, sexual content, drug material, and violence. For a college term movie, it's pretty tame. I'm glad, it really want too raunchy like other movies. The acting is alright. Jonah Hill was a bit annoying at the beginning, but toward the end, he kinda was alright to watch. Channing Tatum was great as the clueless jock. I think the movie works due to the chemistry shared by the two leads. You can really see it as bromantic comedy. The supporting cast was a mostly a miss for me. Ice Cube as Captain Dickson wasn't that funny, after all, his shtick as the angry yelling black man is way old. The whole sub-plot of him getting mad over somebody dating a family member is just too cliché for me. I saw it, better use in his other movie, 2014's Ride Along. If anything, Jillian Bell as Mercedes was just wicked fun. She really didn't get that funny, until toward the end. The whole comedy exchange between her and Jonah Hill's character was just brilliant to watch. Without spoiling too much of it; one of the funniest things of the movie is during the credits gag. It lampshades a lot of 'maybe' sequels to this movie with a lot of celebrity cameos. The credits show possible concepts for future movies, from 23 Jump Street (med school) to 2121 Jump Street (undercover in space!). Who knows, maybe one of those movies will be made one day!? There are a number of memorable actions scenes in this film. My favorite, had to be the helmet cart car chase. Yes, some people might hates these movies because they are a mockery to the original material, 1987- 1991's dramatic show, 21 Jump Street, but it's hard to take the original show, seriously. After all, one of the original cast returns in a cameo in this film, to once again to give his blessing to the newer films. Overall: The movie is a masterpiece of both smart and dumb comedies. Yes, it use cheap laughs to get people through the plot, but the fact that most of it, is a retread of the first film and people don't care, really shows, how funny, people are willing to take it as it is."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","5","11","17 June 2014"," Gives sequels a bad name . . . and number
","If you fell in love with 21 Jump Street, it might interest you to know that the 22 Jump Street is the exact same movie. The bad news is that this time no one appears to have had any interest in making the sequel funny. Here is a movie in which the cleverest element is that the filmmakers have figured out a way to engineer their lack of creativity and imagination into a central joke in which the characters acknowledge that they're in a bad movie. Fine, but we're still stuck with a BAD MOVIE!! 22 Jump Street is a lazy, boring, low-flying comedy that goes no place fast. If we complain that the state of American films is declining at the hands of an industry that hitches its wagon to safe franchises and brand names, then movies like 22 Jump Street may someday serve as an example of the kind of movie that caused it to sink into oblivion. It's a void, a dead zone, an unhappy place where creative ideas go to die. Yeah, it's that bad.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a pretty clever joke. Undercover cops Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum respectively) are told by the laconic Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman from ""Parks and Recreation"") that they are going back into the Jump Street program. The Korean church has been reclaimed by the Koreans, so the program has been moved across the street to 22 Jump Street – The Vietnamese church. Even still, the boys can't help noticing that 23 Jump Street is under construction down the way. Jenko speculates that they'll be there in two years. Schmidt reasons: ""Let's not get ahead of ourselves."" That's clever in a 30 second ad sort of way.<br/><br/>That's also the only funny moment in the movie. Chief Hardy admits that the boys got lucky the first time. That's true because the first film, despite it's formula premise, was clever and funny. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum had a lot of bromantic chemistry. They don't get lucky the second time – not even close. Here, the committee thinking seems to have convinced everyone involved that what worked in the original would work here.<br/><br/>This time the boys attend M.C. State to stop the sale of a drug called ""WhyPhy"", a mixture of Adderall and Esctasy. The point is to find the crooks who are about to dump this drug onto campuses all across the country. In other words, you could find this plot on a TV cop show for free any night of the week. It doesn't work as a cop buddy movie, nor as a college campus comedy. Compare this with a much better campus comedy from last year Monsters University. That film had characters and energy and a story. This one has a running joke about a drunk jock trying to knock over the goal post. Ho-hum.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street is just a case of cynical thinking. Director Phil Lord – just off his triumph after directing The LEGO Movie – turns in a comedy that flops over and dies. What's wrong with this movie? Everything. The jokes are tired. The action scenes are boring. The production looks lazy. The actors don't care. The supporting characters are generic. Everyone involved in this movie gave up on day one. This is the kind of movie that puts you in a bad mood."

In several parts of the movie the ""bad guys"" and ""good guys"" can easily kill each other, but of course there is some cheesy action sequence where everyone manages to somehow live. One of many examples would be the time where they non-nonchalantly blow their cover and try to get into a fist fight with armed men, which seems horribly stupid and unrealistic since they are supposed to be trained undercover cops.<br/><br/>This is an over-hyped cookie cutter comedy with a few interesting twists, but sadly falls short and ends up being more of the typically forgettable formulaic Hollywood bullshit."

","This is a cop comedy movie in which two cops, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) assigned to go undercover and bust a drug ring at a high school. The relationship of these two cops is the highlight of the movie and creates several comical and entertaining situations with events constantly testing their relationship.<br/><br/>Although the whole movie is entertaining but there are some scenes which I like the most. The scene in which Jenko finds out Maya is Captain's daughter and his friend slept with her is one of the most entertaining scenes of the film. Jenko goes hysterical when he figures that and this happens when he's sitting right opposite to the captain. Also the communication between Schmidt and Mayas's roommate during their fist fighting is hilarious. The way of their case solving is what makes this movie awesome.<br/><br/>Also there are some emotional scenes in this movie, like when Jenko decides to quit the police force and want to be a football player, then they both realizes that how important they are in each others life.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are great here, and the jokes are very well thought out and it is a movie that is entertaining from start to finish."
"starry42","8","5","12","21 July 2014"," Now THIS is how you do a comedy sequel!
","When it comes to making a sequel to a smash hit comedy, it's never an easy task. Most of the time, a sequel will follow the exact same outline as its predecessor in hopes that it will bring forth as many laughs. Examples of such carbon copy sequels are ""Home Alone 2"" and ""The Hangover Part 2"". Such sequels very seldom succeed, as jokes are usually only funny the first time around. Phil Lord and Chris Miller knew this, and made ""22 Jump Street"" a complete satire of itself. Most of the gags are the same as the first movie, but the characters are aware and they emphasize it in a way that makes it hysterical. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum bring the same level of comedic energy to Schmidt and Jenko respectively as they did in the first movie, and Ice Cube is equally as scene stealing. Despite many recycled gags, there are also plenty of fresh new ones. The best part is during the end credits, when it jokes about the ridiculous amount of sequels which could make up the franchise.<br/><br/>Bottom line, ""22 Jump Street"" may not be as hilarious as the first one, but it is clever enough in its own right that it is worth recommending. It falls into the same category as other sequels like ""Gremlins 2"" and ""Anchorman 2"", where it satirizes itself for being a sequel. There are also some clever plot twists which even M. Night Shyamalan never would have seen coming. Check it out!"

","Good comedy movies are, nowadays, hard to find. Comedy shows? Yes that's easy. From Family Guy to How I Met Your Mother, that's easy. But good comedy movies? Rare! Much easier to find bad, unfunny s*** like Jack and Jill or Tammy. But 22 Jump Street is pretty good! When 21 Jump Street came out two years ago, the world was surprised, because it was actually really funny and good! And if you liked the first movie, then I'm sure you'll like this one, because they are very similar.<br/><br/>Maybe too similar. The plot is almost the same, with a drug problem and the two agents have to do undercover jobs, but now in college. And some people will say that the directors decided to play safe and just do the same thing, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, because the movie actually acknowledges it and that creates some funny moments.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are awesome. Their chemistry is impressive and they are fabulous partners. Like they could be in a movie with a totally unfunny script and still be hilarious. Ice Cube is also amazing. He is so good and funny that it actually feels like he steals scenes sometimes. He's freaking hilarious.<br/><br/>I think it's a really good movie. I understand if people like the first one better, because this one kinda repeats it, but I think 22 Jump Street is better.<br/><br/>Watch this movie and you'll have some laughs.

"Troy_Campbell","8","5","12","19 June 2014"," Constantly hilarious.
","The rebooted 21 Jump Street was an unforeseen smash hit in 2012, cleaning up at the box office as well as garnering universal critical acclaim. Its success was helped considerably by the fact that no one gave it much chance of actually being any good. This sequel on the other hand, has high expectations, and it surprisingly lives up to them. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are back as undercover agents Schmidt and Jenko – this time attempting to infiltrate a college drug ring – and they have lost none of the odd couple bromantic chemistry that has become the lynchpin of this series. Speaking of bromance, directing duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller return to call the shots, adding a zippiness and stylistic flair to the proceedings and further proving – after the original, Cloudy 1 and The Lego Movie – that they are the masters of fun. All 112 minutes of the runtime are packed with jokes: some fall flat, like the drug- tripping sequence, but most hit the mark. The self-referential humour (""We're throwing double the money at this follow-up, as if it's actually going to make it twice as good"") is utterly hilarious, especially as it comes in the most part from Nick 'Ron Swanson' Offerman, and a running gag revolving around a revelation about Captain Dickson's (Ice Cube) daughter, culminating in Tatum's hysterical office crack-up, is fantastic. Even the end credits are a hoot, previewing upcoming franchise outings such as 29 Jump Street: Nurse School and 37 Jump Street: Culinary School, and featuring a string of winking cameos no less. A riotous, tongue- in-cheek comedy that offers nearly two hours of constant amusement and a bunch of belly laughs, all but cementing a third undercover operation in the process."

","Never change the winning formula perhaps the best choice to continue this sequel. ""22 Jump Street"" is pretty much the same movie as it's predecessor. The storyline itself has some similarity from previous installment, if in ""21 Jump Street"" two police officer, Jenko and Schmidt undercover at high school to find drug dealer, while this time they go undercover as college student. Fortunately repetition doesn't always mean bad thing, the film seems taking positive side from ""21 Jump Street"" and gets more upgrade in action sequences, the relationship between Jenko and Schmidt as partner and especially some smart jokes. Couple of jokes are really that funny with added bizarre moment which audiences could never predicted.<br/><br/>There are two dynamic duo whose role can't be separated from ""22 Jump Street"". The rising director, Phil Lord-Christopher Miller who was known as the creator of ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatball"", ""The Lego Movie"" and of course ""21 Jump Street"" seems comfortable to exploit some material from the first installment they've built also the way they inserted additional scene at end credit is brilliant, while Channing Tatum-Jonah Hill's chemistry keep audiences entertained at the entire scenes in it. Overall ""22 Jump Street"" is a film that despite following the formula from it's predecessor, feels even more fresh and solid. It levels the standard of ""21 Jumps Street"" and watching it, could be a cure to wipe out some stressful feelings."
"jan_kalina","10","6","16","20 August 2014"," ""Do the same thing as last time. Everyone's happy""
","I don't why this film works but it does. It takes the almost exact premise from the first movie but it also keeps the self-awareness and the same creative duo of directors who are nowadays the biggest stars in comedy business. To me 21 jump street is a modern classic and so I was afraid that the sequel won't be as funny and will be repetitive. But with Phil Lord an Chris Miller on board you can bet that it will be hilarious. They are trying to convince the whole film that this is exactly the same as the first and that you should not expect any surprises but that is their plan all along. The film is filled with surprises and twists and turns. Its range of pop culture references goes from Annie Hall to Benny Hill and some of the jokes are so fast you might miss them at the first viewing. Since the first one was making fun of the Hollywood trend to remake and reboot old films and TV shows, the sequel makes of the necessity of starting a franchise when a film is successful. The end credits make fun of the studio system of franchising anything and they are possibly the best end credits of all time and surely are the funniest. Contrary to all this they are the great ending to the franchise.<br/><br/>The bromance between Hill and Tatum is even more prominent than in the first film and you can see that these guys are big friends in real life and are having a good time. Ice Cube get much more screen time as Captain Dickson and once again he is part of the film's funniest scenes. Wyatt Russell as Jenko's doofus friend is amazing and I am looking forward to seeing this guy once again.<br/><br/>Phil Lord and Chris Miller stated that their biggest influence was Bad Boys II and that's exactly what this film is. The Bad Boys II of comedy. Bigger budget, bigger action and mu cm more self aware than the first film. But I'm afraid that they milked the idea to the fullest and that the creators know it. 22 Jump Street is'n as fresh as the first one but it is as much innovative and fun as the first. So go watch it now, you will be laughing about some scenes long after you have left the cinema."
"Anurag-Shetty","10","6","16","3 August 2014"," '22' is infinite notches better than '21'. A sequel that's not just a rehash of the original.
","22 Jump Street, continues with the story of police officers, Schmidt(Jonah Hill) & Jenko(Channing Tatum). After the events of the first film, and a major screw-up by the two buddy cops, Deputy Chief Hardy(Nick Offerman), sends Schmidt & Jenko back to the Jump Street division. They've now moved across the street. Hence, the name. Here, Captain Dickson(Ice Cube) orders the two partners to infiltrate a local college drug ring. This synthetic drug is even more lethal & addictive than the previous drug. The drug is called WhyPhy. Now, it is up to Schmidt & Jenko to infiltrate the dealer, find the supplier & stop the manufacturing of WhyPhy. <br/><br/>22 Jump Street is hysterical! There are a number of scenes in the movie that will leave the viewer in splits. Although it's an adult comedy, the jokes are not entirely crude & sexual, which is refreshing. There are many sequences that pay tribute to 21 Jump Street(2012). However, it's not a carbon copy of the 2012 smash hit. The action sequences have been choreographed beautifully & look extremely believable. The highlight of the movie, is the bromance between Jonah Hill & Channing Tatum. Hill & Tatum share a natural chemistry that oozes all over the screen. The fact that they're friends in real life also helps, I guess. I would like to tip my hat to directors Phil Lord & Christopher Miller. The directing duo can effortlessly switch from an animated movie about figurines & blocks to an action comedy. Hats off to Lord & Miller for pulling that off. Jonah Hill is spectacular as Schmidt. Hill's character oozes confidence and seems to be in control of what's happening, this time around. Channing Tatum is outstanding as Jenko. Tatum's character has matured, and this aspect has been portrayed by Tatum, effortlessly. Peter Stormare is good as The Ghost. Wyatt Russell is impressive as Zook. Amber Stevens is awesome as Maya. Jillian Bell is effective as Mercedes. Nick Offerman is sarcastically funny as Deputy Chief Hardy. Ice Cube is hysterical & unforgettable as Captain Dickson. Stick around for the opening credits to watch Hollywood being ripped apart in a comical fashion. Preferably watch '21' before you go to see this movie. 22 Jump Street is a must watch. Watch it with that one best friend who'll never let you down, no matter what."

I can't wait to find out if there is going to be a third! This film is rated-R so if you have young children, don't let them come along. This film does contain some adult content just as a forewarning. <br/><br/>From beginning to end, I was interested in finding out what was going to happen next. I laughed the entire time until I was watery-eyed. If you love a good raunchy comedy, or just want to have a laugh, this is the movie to see.

","21 Jump Street is Right up there as one on my three or four favuorite comedies of all time, it had a perfect mix of humor, emotion and themes close to me and ever since I saw it for the first time I have come to love it more and more. Naturally when they announced a sequel with all the creative talent behind and in front of the camera returning I was beyond excited. Did they deliver again? Yes they really did. I am not yet ready to talk about this movie in comparison with its predecessor because I will have to see it a couple more times for that (yet it is so good I already want to go back to the theater and watch it again right now). I will get the one main negative out of the way immediately: it does not have the best cohesive story you could expect; its predecessor was so good because amongst all the ridiculousness and fun there was a very solid, thought-out story up-holding it. Here there is not a very solid story, I mean it is perfectly passable, but it felt kind of rushed in certain parts and it took away from the overall experience. One other very little negative was the green screen at the end: very, very bad, really unacceptable. Now as to the positive the list never ends. Phil Lord and Chris Miller are comedy gold, other than being extremely in control of their direction they add so many brilliant easter eggs and references for fans I'm sure I didn't catch all of them at first viewing. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are amazing in this one too, not yet sure if they're better or not from their previous performance. Obviously the highlight from the supporting cast is Ice Cube who is for sure funnier in this one. Now as to the movie itself I cannot speak highly enough of its witty brilliance: it mixes pop culture references, to hilarious self humor, adds even funnier dialogues and physical comedy, has top-notch-entertainment action scenes juxtaposed to college life scenes, even the music choices are perfect and ultimately it is so self aware it manages to feed the fans every single thing they wanted without being repetitive or too pretentious. This sequel is practically everything I wanted it to be and more and I really can't wait to see it again and again and open up with myself the debate on whether 21 or 22 is better. A quick shout out too to the credits: probably the funniest part of the movie with one of the most brilliant cameos I have ever seen."

","After a job interview interview, I've was quite stressed, I figured that 22 Jump street, a comedy would help relieve some tension. I WAS RIGHT! The movie is about 2 losers that are tremendously effective when put together. When one gets a 100 for its physical test and the other a 100 for some brainy test(I don't know) you'll know what's up. <br/><br/>I really liked it. It's simple and straightforward. The jokes where all over the place, the humor was as good as the first movie, maybe even better. Action-wise, first explosion is in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Crime-wise, it's not a film you can take seriously but there is still a solid story in it.<br/><br/>So let's talk about the Actors. I think Jonah and Channing, the lead actors are good, but side by side, the synergy, what these guys have is masterful. Jonah plays the awkward brainy sack of potatoes while Channing plays the brainless powerhouse chick-magnet. In all honesty I sometimes did feel Jonah should be 90 percent awkward instead of the 100, He'll always react in the same way, but hey, that's just me. Channing did feel more authentic in its role. He was Funny, cool and cute at sometimes.<br/><br/>funniness aside, I also learned something about friendship, that you can't get everything done by yourself and that you should appreciate your friends, that have there own supporting skills ready for you. The b-romance is strong on this side boys. Without friction there is no fire."

It's starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, back from the first movie 21 Jump Street. This film makes fun of comedies and action movies; and it does a great job at doing it. 21 Jump Street was a huge surprise, if I'm being honest I thought it would be terrible but instead it was hilarious and very clever. This time they've being able to surprising again with this film and even better. The chemistry between Tatum and Hill is once again excellent, and they handled action sequences better than in the first one. Plus, there are extra scenes to stick around for at the end; and let me tell you that the end credits are actually the funniest thing ever. This film is really effective, totally aware of itself and enjoyable. I laughed. I liked what they did with the character and where their relationship goes. What else could we ask for in a comedy? At the same time it's the exact same film as 21 Jump Street but the fact that they're joking about that and in the know of it makes it more O-K to watch. it's a tie as it feels on the one hand like a proper sequel and on the other hand like a reboot. <br/><br/>Overall 22 Jump Street for the most part is better than 21 Jump Street, I loved the chemistry between the stars and there are a lot of great jokes."

It's they chemistry between the two that makes this and they satirise that to the hilt.<br/><br/>Lot of bawdy humour and childish humour, but it's thankfully no silly costume party.

"TheFilmGuy1","7","4","10","24 June 2014"," Not Quite As Good As The First, But Funny Its Own Right
","This film constantly acknowledges the fact that it's a sequel to a movie that was kind of an unexpected success, and it uses that to essentially make the same film again. But that's the joke. The plot is essentially the same as the first one. A lot of the same things occur, but just slightly different. It does work, but I think the only problem is that the first movie does it better. This one works, but I just felt like I enjoyed the first movie better overall, but perhaps that's a matter of opinion. <br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have really good chemistry here. Both are very funny and the film is quite aware of their chemistry. There's a gag throughout the whole film that is essentially that it treats their relationship as police officers and partners as a real relationship. There's scenes that you would see in a romance film but are played for laughs because they are between Tatum and Hill. These work well because of the chemistry and it's quite funny. As mentioned before, the movie is quite self aware about how it's just a rehash of the first movie, and they make it work. Also an end credits sequence essentially seals the deal with this whole running joke.<br/><br/>If I had to give a complaint, it would be that perhaps the very middle part of the film was a little lacking in jokes. Not the entire middle of the movie, but some of it. It opens strong and ends pretty strong, but that middle area just kinda goes along without a whole lot. There's jokes here and there but they are gut bustlingly funny as the rest of the movie. But I would say that specific middle area of the film is only like 15% of the movie, so if that's the amount of the movie that isn't that funny, it's doing pretty good.<br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend going to see this if you want some laughs. There's a lot of self aware humour and it made me laugh quite a bit. Though it wasn't quite as good as some critics have been saying. I heard really high praise about this movie and some super high scores, which I don't 100% agree with. It's good, but not completely amazing. It has its flaws. I will say it's super funny and if you want a good comedy movie, you should watch it."
"lifesajourney0","7","4","10","23 June 2014"," Surprisingly Enjoyable
","If you are a fan of dumb humor in the vein of Talladega Nights or Dumb and Dumber, (whose sequel was featured in the pre-movie trailers), then this movie will deliver a decent amount of laughs for your movie-going dollar. If not for a few scenes, this movie could have even clawed its way to a weak 8 rating as a comedy for me. The movie looked good, with nice beauty shots and composition of scenes throughout, including car chases and crowd shots. The acting was also competent, especially when Hill plays the straight man facing a barrage of jokes about his age. The movie also includes a few references to other movies which helps to add a little depth to the humor. The movie loses points in scenes where they depend on a stream of out-of-place profanity in place of wit. The ending of the movie is also a problem as the plot loses some of its focus there which was previously easy to follow for the majority of the film. This also added length to the film that was not needed overall. The ending credits are also some of the funniest I've seen. <br/><br/>Weak 7 is my vote. This is probably a 6 or less (Rental/Netflix) if you aren't a fan of dumb humor.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT Unfortunately, Seth Rogen makes a cameo in the closing credits; however, this brief exposure to his comedy kryptonite did not ruin the movie for me as I stuck my fingers in my ears and averted my eyes until the crisis passed."

","I was looking forward to seeing 22 Jump Street because of the fact that the other comedies of the summer I was looking forward to.... sucked. (Neighbors and Million Ways). This was by far in my opinion not better than the first one. In my opinion I believe that a good comedy movie is a great plot with a lot of laughs and doesn't over do it. 22 Jump Street had a weird plot and was definitely rusty from the start. Ice Cube played a much larger role in this one and I enjoyed it because he adds a lot of humor to the story as well. Jonah and Channing are great as always and provided a lot of laughs on screen. It wasn't outstanding, but so far the best comedy of the summer. I think they should stop after this one though. There was a sign of foreshadowing in the beginning but hopefully that is only a teaser because I think it will ruin what they have going if they make a third one. Know where to draw the line!

","""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" That seems to be the underlying philosophy of '22 Jump Street', a sequel that embraces sticking to the formula to the point of almost becoming meta. Several times throughout the film, characters slyly reference the idea of not over thinking things and just doing what they did last time. That serves '22 Jump Street' well, as it gives people what they want, while still managing to slip in enough new threads to keep things fresh.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have a fantastic chemistry together, complementing one another perfectly while creating one of the best bromances in recent screen history. Along with an expanded role from Ice Cube—who nearly steals the show—the cast lift the material to another level.<br/><br/>'22 Jump Street' is a little more uneven than its predecessor, but at its best it surpasses it. With its deft blend of comedy, action and a surprising amount of heart, it's a text book summer popcorn film."
"RforFilm","6","4","10","16 June 2014"," 22 Jump Street is a funny bromance/meta comedy...but it becomes old quick
","Creating a sequel to a fantasy like How to Train Your Dragon has to be easier then a comedy. I know that a lot of work already goes into an animated movie, but there is one reason why How to Train Your Dragon has the simpler job then something like 21 Jump Street; the element of surprise. A lot of writers assigned to these movies could spend hours on story and character development, which is fine, but their sequel can only work if they bring in something new and unpredictable. Continuing to stay unpredictable in a comedy is tough. <br/><br/>Take something like Monty Python's Flying Circus. It's one of the most famous sketch comedies shows of all time, emphasizing heavily on taking scenarios and taking it into a crazy direction. It threw off peoplefor a while. The final season proved that even the randomness can become predictable as we now know that going from point A to point B is not going to happen; it's going to be just as nutty as the early seasons were. Yet while the earlier shows were new, the later seasons resulted in sketches that simply were not as funny as we have picked up on the shows attitude, making it harder to give us something that were not expecting. So let's see if 22 Jump Street found us something new. <br/><br/>If you saw the first movie, then you know that it ends with our heroes Morton Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) being told their going to college. And that exactly what they do. Their sent to a college where they go undercover as undergraduates to find a new drug that's hitting the scene called WHYPHY (pronounced the same as WiFi) that already caused the death of another student. <br/><br/>Just as in the first movie, they assume the same identities and ask other students for clues and possible drug dealer suspects. The switch up here is that Jenko becomes the big man on campus when he makes friends with a frat house jock named Zook (played by Wyatt Russell) that becomes a prime suspect. Schmidt on the other hand makes friendly with an art major, Maya while dealing with having to work on his own. The boys police captain Dickson (played by Ice Cube) occasionally comes in to help and even help fight in the final battle that takes place in Spring Break in Mexico. <br/><br/>As I said, this is basically the same movie all over again, so this must be a really bad film right? Not exactly. The joke of the previous movie was that 21 Jump Street ripped off of 1980's cop movies, so 22 Jump Street instead makes fun of itself and movie sequels in general. This may be the most self-referential movie comedy, even more so then satires that know their movies. For the most part, they are really funny, though unlike Blazing Saddles and Scary Movie that seem to be in a better mind frame to keep calling out that it's only a movie, 22 Jump Street is still keen on keeping it in a real world. This causes the meta references to get old really fast and even a touch out of place. <br/><br/>So along the meta material, does the movie have the same wit as the first film? I expected 22 Jump Street to be a lot wilder and a lot funnier. A lot of the wit is still there, but I wasn't laughing as much. When I was trying to figure out why, I think it maybe that I realized that neither leads have really learned anything from the first movie except to stay friends. How to Train Your Dragon 2 was not afraid to mature their characters and still keep them funny, so I was hoping Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum would have at least matured a little bit.<br/><br/>I'll give this six football helmets out of five. It delivers what it promises, but like our heroes, I wish it had more ambition to go crazier with it's scenario. Let's see them in classes or clubs or something. 22 Jump Street is a passable comedy, but it makes me want to reexamine the first film."

","With a premise surrounding the reoccurring, self-aware joke, ""do the same thing as last time and people will be happy"", ""22 Jump Street"" takes the attractive yet dumb cop (Channing Tatum) and comically weird looking but smart cop (Jonah Hill) and moves them from 21 Jump St. across the street to 22 Jump St.; a new building which is acknowledged (in a very tongue-in-cheek manner) as having a much more expensive look for absolutely no reason. This time their assignment takes them undercover, masquerading as college students, in order to discover the distributor of a new synthetic drug. Basically and purposefully the same premise as the last movie (only this time in college). Sounds hilarious, right? <br/><br/>With expectations high, partly because of the creative minds behind it (directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller) partly because of the early critical response (some calling it, ""The funniest sequel ever"") and partly because 2012's ""21 Jump Street"" was a box-office success, I admittedly went into my screening ready to laugh. And though the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum still worked, the satirical nature throughout was still pretty smart and well written (as the film pokes fun at big-budget Hollywood sequels, the college experience and split screens) and Ice Cube is given more to do (which is always good) there are a few glaring problems which caused this comedy to be far more flawed than it should have been: 1. Most of the funny parts are in trailers. Even though this is the fault of the marketing team and not the film itself, nobody enjoys paying exorbitant ticket prices to sit through a movie containing jokes they could see for free on TV.<br/><br/>2. It's not as funny as ""21 Jump Street"". In the case of movies that are either sequels or hold strong resemblances to other (usually more infamous) films, I try my hardest not to let comparisons influence my final rating. It is my intent to review each film on its own individual merits. But here's the thing: In the case of ""22 Jump Street"", the filmmakers have purposefully designed the jokes in such a way as to almost demand that audiences compare this movie to its predecessor as often as possible. It is in this rare case that my rating must reflect as such. Therefore, ""22 Jump Street"", while funny at times, wasn't nearly funny enough to meet (let alone, exceed) expectations set by ""21 Jump Street"".<br/><br/>Side Note: And I didn't even mention the unfortunate Maya Angelou and Tracy Morgan jokes, which instantly silenced a crowd that was intent on laughing over every other punch-line.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Yes, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (The Lego Movie, Cloudy with a Change of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street) deserve the title as two of the hottest comedy directors working, but this is a bit of a misstep in their assent to the top of the genre, simple because it isn't as funny or clever as what we've come to expect from the duo. Luckily, Jonah Hill does save the day more than a few times, as his performance may be the only true standout of this entire film (which is hardly a surprise). He seemed to lead by example, taking firm control of nearly every funny bit with his unique style of physical, self-deprecating and quick witted comedy. Plus, unlike Kevin Hart, Hill can play the same comedic character over and over again and it has yet to become played out or obnoxious. Sothere's that."

The plot was great as Jenko and Schmidt go on yet another covert mission to find some cleverly named drug (WHYPHY). This had another good cast with actors like Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and Ice Cube headlining it. I also loved the Lucas Brothers characters as Keith and Kenny who have funny moments of twin telepathy. I was certainly not disappointed.

","Right from the first scene, the chemistry between Tatum and Hill is palpable. I wouldn't be surprised if many of their scenes contained a large amount of improvisation, based on how well they work together. The movie makes it no secret that the plan is to follow the same story as the first movie, since they make frequent mention to it in the set up of the plot. Aside from the two co-leads, Ice cube plays a much more prominent role and is great in his larger role. I feel that the movie is about 20 minutes too long, and drags towards the end. As well, some of the age jokes by the roommate across the hall and the bromance jokes do fall a little flat. Although not as good as the original, it is still very funny and is a great comedy."

The whole movie is taken to an abstract surrealistic level. The bromance thing is carried to extremes. There so many scenes in which you only can feel vicarious embarrassment. Many inventive gags.

"kyleonfilm","8","4","11","21 July 2014"," Embracing the sequel whilst poking fun at it, the team from 21 Jump Street return for more undercover shenanigans in this highly enjoyable, meta-stuffed follow-up.
","It doesn't take a genius to work out that 22 Jump Street is a sequel to 21 Jump Street. It's numerically one larger after all and everybody knows it; you know it, the cast know it, the directors know it - everybody. As an audience we should be most thankful that the screenwriters are acutely aware of this and have chosen to create a film that dares to grind on the line between shameless repetition and sharp originality.<br/><br/>If you're struggling to remember what happened in the first film, have no fear, a 'previously on' segment is the first thing you'll see and besides, the plot of this one is uncannily similar to the first outing. The duo of Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are back for some more undercover snooping to find the world's most obvious drug. Seriously, the drugs in this film look like bright stickers and I'm pretty sure they have skulls on them. Not exactly covert. As far as changes, high school is upgraded to college and then we're ready for the action to commence.<br/><br/>One of the biggest selling points of this film is the chance to see Hill and Tatum reunite to continue their bromance as an unlikely couple, their partnership itself providing some of the more generic laughs, but laughs nonetheless. What is surprising is that Tatum turns out to be a better comedic performer than Hill. As a double act they're great but the films weaker moments are definitely when they split and we have to follow the latter. Ice Cube makes a welcome return as the angriest of police captains and he gets enough lines so that his snarling act isn't overused. The story does revolve around Hill and Tatum but it's well written enough so that supporting players get their chance to deliver laughs.<br/><br/>The humour consists primarily of a spirited nudge in the ribs of sequels in general, and by extension the film itself, resulting in a truck-load of meta gags. The script plunges head-first into references and self-awareness and Nick Offerman's briefing speech as Deputy Chief Hardy is just the beginning of this vein as he spells out the reason why you're watching another edition of Jump Street. It's a hilarious moment that oddly enough went completely over the heads of most of the audience I saw it with which made it all the funnier! There are so many fantastic moments of meta-humour; a nod to White House Down (Tatum starred in it), Benny Hill, and a chase where 'the budget' is the main concern. For all their enthusiasm, at times I wondered if the writers had pushed the references too much (The heroes are continually being told to 'do the same as before'), but 22 Jump Street manages to set up enough jokes conventionally and then deliver punchlines in unexpected fashion that it kept me laughing. The end credits scene might just be the funniest I've seen in ages - do not leave your seat so quickly.<br/><br/>Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have honed their energetic directorial style to perfection with the first Jump Street, as well as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and the runaway hit The Lego Movie and again it makes for a very enjoyable movie here - if one joke doesn't land there'll be another very soon after it. I really get a sense of fun in the production whenever I see one of their films.<br/><br/>As with many sequels 22 Jump Street falls only slightly short of its predecessor, but by gunning for the we-know-its-a-sequel winks, it retains the freshness of the original outing. If you enjoyed 21, 22 will be right up your (jump) street."
"alindsay-al","8","4","11","15 July 2014"," a really funny bromance comedy
","Now for starters I have not seen the 21 jump street with the same cast but that does not matter for this film to be funny. I went into this film with a fresh look and hoping for something funny which is what I got. This film sees Jonah hills character and channing Tatum's character reunited to go infiltrate college and take down a drug dealing cartel. Now before this film I was not impressed with Tatum in anything but he is fantastic in this film and I really believe comedy should be where he stays for now. Jonah hill is an established comedic actor and he is also fantastic and the chemistry between the two is just electric and one of the best combinations I have seen. Another great character is ice cube and he was hilarious throughout and actually my favourite scene in this film is one where he flips out. Jonah hills girlfriend, channing Tatums football buddy and the villain are all solid and funny at times as well. the story is alright I liked how it depicted American college and how the film has a lot of heart to it. However, it even points out that the plot is similar to the first and this does bring the story down a bit. The script is pretty good with the comedy and the heartfelt moments well balanced. Also this film knows what it is and references it but maybe a few too many times. Now the style of the film is quite cool but it also is a bit similar to other films in the genre which doesn't make it that unique. I had a really fun time watching 22 jump street and it makes me want to go back to watch the original."

","Directed by Phil Lord and Chril Miller<br/><br/>Starring Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ice Cube<br/><br/>​ Plot Overview: Soon after they stopped the craze of HFS, Schmidt(Jonah Hill) and Jenko(Channing Tatum) go back under cover in College to stop a new drug from killing people.<br/><br/>General:<br/><br/>Overall: This movie is, first and foremost, hilarious. My main flaw with its predecessor is that the comedy got stale after multiple watches. That is different here. I've watched this movie more than '21 Jump Street' and still laugh continuously throughout. The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is great, even if it follows a similar plot thread to the original. The story is, yet again, very similar to the original but the movie embraces that and uses the fact its a sequel as a gag. I appreciate that but it doesn't excuse the fact its still a copy and paste with some uses of 'Find and Replace' for certain characters. Despite this, it's still just as enjoyable(I personally think more) as '21 Jump Street' and fans will most likely still enjoy it.<br/><br/>The type of people who will like it will be fans of the more aware comedy and definitely fans of '21 Jump Street'. <br/><br/>Would Recommend.<br/><br/>Detailed:<br/><br/>Both Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum were good as Schmitd and Jenko respectively and the chemistry they shared didn't feel forced and felt natural. Ice Cube was great as Captain Dickson and gave on of the funniest scenes in the entire film. Peter Stromrae was fine as The Ghost but he was still just a typical mob boss and didn't impress me much. Both Amber Stevens and Jilian Bell were great as Maya and Mercedes respectively, with Mercedes being one of the funnier characters in the film. Wyatt Russel was pretty weak as Zook and, along with Maya, was not a very compelling nor even that humorous character.<br/><br/>I adore the entire premise of these movies but I do admit they've exhausted all possible ideas and to continue this franchise but be insulting the previous two films. Again, it was a full rehash of the original which was annoying but it still hits similar notes and retains the charm the original had on its initial watch but continues this throughout.<br/><br/>The cinematography was decent for the most part but the editing could be quite choppy at point and it feels like some entire portions of scenes were just cut out. <br/><br/>The effects were awful and the green screen was terrible. The actual costume and set design was actually pretty good and distinguished itself from the original. <br/><br/>This movie is first and foremost a comedy and in that respect it succeeds. There is also some interesting action, even if it comes of as cheesy and can be a little stupid.<br/><br/>The end credits are brilliant and the satire provided with them is absolutely genius and hilarious. The music was fine.<br/><br/>Personally, I really enjoy this movie and feel like its more enjoyable than the original.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Would Recommend."

"ivko","9","0","0","5 November 2019"," These two b**ches went to college!
","I LOVED this movie. As good or better than the original, which is so rare I can't remember the last time someone achieved that. Obviously, this is silly escapism humor so I think you have to view it in that light, but the movie never aims to be more than goofy laughs with some bromance mixed in.<br/><br/>22 successfully sets up a plot that engages while taking every opportunity to poke fun at itself and multiple movie genres, much like the first one did. It might help if you are familiar with some pop culture, as the movie is filled to bursting with quick little Easter eggs and references that are 'blink and miss it' types.<br/><br/>It also revels in taking movie cliches and flipping them on their head for yuks, like a ""fight"" scene where Jonah Hill's character Schmidt is intensely uncomfortable when one of the villains repeatedly believes the fight is about to degenerate into a sexy Mr. and Mrs. Smith battle-to-bedroom make out session or when Channing Tatum's Jenko drops his Q-Tip into another guy's meat sandwich and they gleefully declare that they are sharing a ""meat-qute,"" a term for the scene in romantic comedies when the couple to be first meet each other in a cute and humorous way.<br/><br/>The movie never takes itself seriously, constantly making fun of itself, the previous movie, or other works the cast have been in; the last ten minutes of run time are devoted to absurd ideas for the next few hundred incarnations of the series, all but slamming the door on the idea of making any more while still managing to be suspiciously reminiscent of other series that didn't know when to quit.<br/><br/>I was never a fan of the original show, so I watched '21 Jump Street' reluctantly only to be pleasantly surprised at how fresh they managed to make the idea feel. '22' admirably carried on the tradition, building a light hour and a half around the two charismatic leads that didn't overstay its welcome and left me in a good mood."

","I saw this film without seeing the prequel, so I am just here to say that you don't really need to have seen the first film in order to watch this one. I understood more references having seen the first one now but it was not that much of an issue. I felt that the second movie was better than the first, which is going against most people's opinions but that is probably because I saw the first film second. I liked the references back to the old film and thought that the storyline wasn't too drastic or over the top. The acting was brilliant and the jokes were hilarious. The actions scenes were full of surprises as well and overall I thoroughly enjoyed the film."
"Kicino","7","3","8","16 September 2014"," Great chemistry between duet in entertaining comic script
","I liked it so much that I looked for 21 Jump Street when I finished seeing this. <br/><br/>The poster looks like a stupid comedy but I like Jonah Hill after Moneyball and The Wolf of Wall Street. And Channing Tatum looks so cute in Magic Mike that so I went to see this. <br/><br/>Well, all I can say is it exceeds my expectation of a Hollywood comedy. After watching three movies featuring Jonah Hill, I can confirm that he is an excellent actor. His acting can probably carry him to a level more than just comedy. In 22 Jump Street, Hill is unbelievable in playing the role of Schmidt, an insecure, jealous, hardworking and loyal teammate. His body movement and voice impersonation is impressive. Even his blinks and murmurs are effective.<br/><br/>The story can be calculative, crafted and is tailored-made for Tatum, who plays a curious cop Jenko, factoring in his model physique, Kungfu skills and football expertise. But boy is he hot and surely he makes me wow. Simply dazzling. The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is quite strong and they really sparkle when they are together – even though Tatum needs more work on his acting. <br/><br/>What distinguishes it from other American comedies is the interesting script which has many layers in addition to the undercover cop duo going to college. There are lots of twists to the script, in addition to the action scenes and comical moments, making the watching experience enjoyable throughout. Even the end credits are interesting to watch. Never a dull moment in this fast-paced action-packed crime comedy touching on homosexuality and brotherhood. Quite a relaxing movie to watch.<br/><br/>While I look forward to 23 Jump Street, I am kind of hoping they will change the selling points a little and move away from football and half naked Tatum, etc."
"KineticSeoul","6","3","8","28 June 2014"," Let's just say it's not that bad for a comedic sequel...
","This is the typical buddy cop comedy sequel with a bigger budget and more stuff going on including the expansion when it comes to the bromance. But it just isn't as good as the original and things just seemed to forced a lot of times. I could tell they were trying very hard to make it a hilarious comedy. I just didn't find this movie all that funny or in tune as the first one. Actually it comes across more as a rehash than a actual sequel with the duo looking for the head of the drug dealings. Except it takes place in college and it's Greg Jenko that is having fun this time while Morton Schmidt is just not having that good of a time...Besides banging a college girl. So the roles this time are sort of reversed. The movie does make fun of itself sometimes and parodies sequels a LOT. They do self-referential jokes, but I don't think that gives it a pass to be just a mediocre comedy compared to the first one. And it seemed like they were constantly using that to hide the fact that this just isn't better than the first one and that they ran out of good creative ideas. I thought since they are poking fun of sequels so much, maybe it will do things that deviate from that. Despite the ""do the same thing as last time and people will be happy"" quote. But it basically goes the same exact direction. The chemistry between the duo is actually pretty good though. But it just wasn't hysterical or exciting when it blends action/comedy elements. Some of the jokes even started to drag after a while. The villains this time is very forgettable and doesn't stand out at all with Peter Stormare doing the same thing he always does when playing a villain. I thought the first one did a great job with the build up and development, but this one just falls short. If it wasn't for the first installment, I am not sure I would have even found this sequel to be enjoyable. The audiences expression at the theaters was just ""eh"" and that was it. As far as comedy sequels go, this one is actually alright. Lets say it's way better than the 2 ""The Hangover"" sequels. I found the comedy elements in ""Neighbors"" to be more funny than this one. Maybe my expectations were too high since I liked the first installment in this franchise. It's worth a matinée price maybe or a rental.<br/><br/>6.2/10"

"matthewssilverhammer","8","3","8","20 June 2014"," Self-Awareness and Funny Chemistry Propel This Sequel
","What an awful idea for a movie. Take a subpar 80's teen soap opera, reboot it as a comedy movie, and then give it a SEQUEL?! But with directors Lord and Miller (""Lego Movie"") and writers Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall, 22JS becomes a self-aware meta-comment on the overstuffed sequel. It's not quite as funny or smooth as the outstanding first film, but the trope send ups, engaging mystery, and good-natured humor propel this to its own heights. 22JS picks up right where the first ends, Ice Cube giving the guys their new undercover assignment, infiltrating a new drug ring, this time at college. There are plenty of jabs at this being exactly the same as the first film, which is where the best parts of the humor reside, in the satire of Hollywood money-making. We have send-ups of college comedies, buddy cop comedies, big-budget franchises, and even rom-coms (with plenty of the gay undertones we often see unintentionally in many buddy action movies). Plus, Lord and Miller are in the Edgar Wright (Hot Fuzz, Scott Pilgrim) camp of direction, truly using the tools of cinema to create laughs instead of just making the performers do all the work. The fantastic chemistry of Tatum and Hill is enough to see anything they're in, but when given the kind of subversive, smart, and hilarious material they are here, it's a perfect storm. If you haven't seen the first one, see it. Then rush out to see 22JS. And make sure to stay for what may be the greatest end credits of all time."

","As published by the Morrisons Cove Herald on June 19, 2014.<br/><br/>BY RYAN C. SHOWERS<br/><br/>""21 Jump Street,"" the satirical reboot of the '80s detective show by the same name, hit theaters in 2012 and gathered a vast profit of $138 million at the Domestic Box Office. Columbia Film Studios have since called upon the original film's key ingredients, Channing Tatum's swooning looks and Jonah Hill's inherently comedic presence, to replicate the success with a sequel. Unfortunately, the newly released film does little beyond the borders of plain stupidity. ""22"" Jump Street"" is the product of redundant slapstick comedy, unearned laughs, and vacuously written dialogue.<br/><br/>Morton Schmidt (Hill) and Greg Jenko (Tatum) return as undercover cops, but instead of chasing culprits around the halls of high school, the partners are transferred to college. Their assignment is to locate the student supplying the drug ""WHYPHY"" to other enrolled scholars. WHYPHY (pronounced like Wifi) is responsible for the death of a student, so Schmidt and Jenko rise to the task of unmasking the drug-selling miscreant. But Jenko becomes the star football player on campus and Schmidt begins a relationship with an attractive art student, so their investigation wilts due to lacking focus. Will their friendship and detective mission surmount Jenko and Schmidt's halted bromance?<br/><br/>As part of their introduction to college, Jenko and Schmidt attend a stand-up, impromptu poetry reading. During one student's performance, the main characters stare, unimpressed with the entertainment before them. I could not help but identify with the characters, for this is how I felt while watching ""22 Jump Street."" The fans that this sequel was made for will roar laughing, but film analysts may levitate out of their seats while watching this from feelings of superiority.<br/><br/>For a movie that documents the experience of going to college so extensively, ""22 Jump Street"" is not smart enough of a movie to attend any higher education. People investing ten dollars to be entertained will just laugh along with all vapid race humor, homosexual jokes, and feminist mockery, but for those using their brains during the 112 minutes of ""22 Jump Street"" will find the overabundance of offensive dialogue to be insipid.<br/><br/>""22 Jump Street"" has no reservations in embracing its self-aware tone and meta jokes. The film is informed of its status in the motion picture hierarchy and quite literally discusses the deigning risks and filmmaking process of constructing a sequel to a comedy reboot. Conversations the studio heads probably had with the creative team behind ""22"" Jump Street"" exist in the screenplay and are acted out on screen – for example: tightening the budget, reinstating the repetitious plot, etc.<br/><br/>For all the low-bar tricks they try to pull, the writers generously illustrate the characters in a semi-realistic way. Since ""Moneyball"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" Jonah Hill can now label himself as a ""Two-Time Academy Award Nominee"" and his performance reflects that newfound confidence. Hill is one of the finest, most mature assets of ""22 Jump Street."" On the contrary, Tatum, who has received rave reviews out of the Cannes Film Festival for his serious turn in the unreleased ""Foxcatcher,"" humiliates himself here. He has a blast in his role, but unfortunately does not convince in moments of gushing farce.<br/><br/>""22 Jump Street"" makes indelible, evident mistakes, yet most will find it to be imbecilic fun and slimy entertainment. A two-minute sequence of brilliance occurs directly before the credits roll, a scene that cleverly answers the question of possible future sequels. The nifty, comical conclusion earns a few slivers of true respect for the overall product.<br/><br/>Rating: 4/10<br/><br/>* 1/2 / ****"
"3xHCCH","8","3","8","19 June 2014"," Isn't It Bromantic?
","""21 Jump Street"" was a pleasant surprise when it was released two years ago. Instead of the lame comedy rip-off of a classic 80s TV series that it was expected to be, it turned out to be a rip-roaring action comedy delight. The comedic chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was sizzling and carried the film through its absurd premise of adult cops undercover as high school students.<br/><br/>In this sequel ""22 Jump Street"", Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) were sent undercover to college this time with the mission of uncovering the truth about the death of a coed involved with a new party drug called ""Whyphy"". <br/><br/>As the investigation of the case got underway, Jenko meets a kindred spirit in Zook (Wyatt Russell), a frat boy and football jock, who thought and acted exactly like Jenko did. Schmidt hooks up with a pretty art major named Maya (Amber Stevens), but he is majorly distressed that Jenko is getting more and more into fraternity life and football and was steadily drifting away from their partnership. <br/><br/>Action peaks in a wild spring break party on the beach where ""Whyphy"" gang threatens to spread the drug big time to more college students. Schimdt and Jenko have to get their acts together in time to prevent that from happening.<br/><br/>Again, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum throw all shame to the wind and go all out in going for the laughs. Their chemistry together works as well now as it worked back then. The squirmy scene where Schmidt and Jenko are in session with a shrink is particularly hilarious.<br/><br/>Hill acts as he usually acts as the dorky misfit. He really can't go wrong with that face of his. He really has a natural talent for physical comedy. But it was Tatum who steps up more in this sequel as he fearlessly makes fun of his him-bo image. Tatum's athletic skills are also highlighted in many exciting scenes. Ice Cube steals his scenes as their ill-tempered foul- mouthed boss, Captain Dickon. He would figure in what I thought was the most jaw-droppingly awkward and outright LOL scene of the film.<br/><br/>The humor of this film is very shallow and can even offensive for some people, but truth to tell, it is really very funny. If you don't mind the mile-a-minute profanity-laden script with heavy sexual or drug- themes, you will be laughing from start to finish with the misfortunes and misadventures of Schmidt and Jenko. The laughs carry on all the way up to the closing credits where they mock their own possible future sequels in a montage that is a must-see in itself."

"FilmMuscle","8","3","8","18 June 2014"," A Roller-coaster Ride of Comedy
","21 Jump Street was a huge surprise of a hit back in 2012, and of course— in this day and age—that means a sequel is on its way. Thankfully, Phil Lord and Chris Miller have returned to the project because it could've otherwise been a total mess. The thing is that Lord and Miller are probably the most ingenuous filmmakers working in the comedy genre right now, always taking the ""meta"" approach to their films as can be seen by this year's earlier release, The Lego Movie, and now this—a rare example of an outstanding sequel. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong; if this was a sequel that simply continued Jonah Hill's and Channing Tatum's relationship in another elaborate but more exciting undercover operation, I would've had a hard time seeing how it'd succeed. However, in this case, everyone is fully aware of the ""cash-grab, unnecessary sequel"" status that's immediately imposed upon the film, and so what do they do? They ride with it. The most famous exemplar in the conversation is the Hangover series, which has been completely lambasted to the point of utter mortification for all those involved. I feel like those two sequels were the butt of the jokes here. <br/><br/>In addition, 22 Jump Street goes one step ahead, says ""why not?"" and continually parodies the numerous tropes that plague buddy-cop movies and any kind of genre. The dialogue is consistently witty, poking fun at the sheer superficiality of the college environment instead of adopting the douchiness of other college comedies. Obviously—I would say—the most important element of this film has to be the chemistry between Hill and Tatum, which is frankly organic at this point. Both characters feed off of each other, bringing their own vastly differential personalities and style to the table. That is exactly what makes the best of buddy comedies, and what makes the Jump Street series so charming is the sweet ""brolationship"" between the nerd and jock. Here, it's delivered to amazing comedic effect, sentimentally playing around with their relationship as if it was a romantic one (essentially, the joke is on the idea of ""bros for life""). <br/><br/>I've said it once and I'll say it again: I have been really impressed with Channing Tatum as of late. He could've come out be a generic and bland pretty boy who starred in the banal action flicks or simpleminded rom-com's—he has done a fair share of those in the past, yes, but his evolution as an actor is quite evident. Tatum's a very smart individual, choosing to display his absolute versatility and range by taking on various genres (proving his comedy chops in one film, giving dramatic weight in another, and then from time to time, taking the fun action movies). Speaking of, I'm really looking forward to seeing his talent shine again in Foxcatcher later this year. <br/><br/>With all that being said, there's one comment to make on this atrocious trend that's been persisting with showing way too much in trailers. This film is immensely guilty of that as well. I still can't believe they had the guts to reveal the true culprit behind the mysterious criminal scheme in the darn trailer. They show a 20-second clip from one of the last scenes in the movie! Whose idea was that, really? The narrative would've been far better if the viewer didn't—you know—expect the twist; I definitely have to discredit this film for that if anything. <br/><br/>On another note, even though the likability of Channing Tatum's more hapless and relatable character in the first one transforms into mere obnoxiousness as he joins the frat boys and accepts his persona as the muscular, good-looking jock, the goodhearted nature of the two's dynamic still survives at the end of the day. Once it's been evaluated, 22 Jump Street is certainly one of the most inventive and exceptional comedy sequels out there, continuing the story while making fun of it. Oh, and wait until you see the end credits sequence that fully trashes the whole idea of a (once-fresh) concept repeating itself exactly throughout an entire series."
"bbickley13-921-58664","8","3","8","15 June 2014"," Like it a lot!!!
","It was a pretty good sequel overall. <br/><br/>Like the first movie mocked the original TV series (which in itself never took itself too seriously) 22 Jump Street mocks 21 Jump Street and does the same thing with prequels in general, starting with the Title which is explained by the fact that their HQ was moved to the other side of the street. They even have an inside joke that the next sequel will be called 23 jump street (which is located right next to 21 jump Street and is under construction).<br/><br/>This is the second Sequel that I saw this year (the 1st being Muppets Most Wanted) that both made fun and warned you of the fact that you are watching a Bad sequel, but the difference is that 22 does it without breaking the forth wall with hilarious innuendos about the fact that the jump street boys, Jenko and Schmidt are going to be doing the same thing they did in the 1st film, and the fact that this was actually a good sequel. <br/><br/>Like the ending of 21 stated (which was cleverly cut into the beginning of this film by making the sequel feel like the next episode of a TV show). Tatum and Hill are being sent to college. Like with the high school adventure, the two Undercover Cops are on the look for a drug going around campus and attempt to pass their thirty-something butts off as college aged teenagers, but college is a different world than high school with Jenko getting back some of the coolness he lost being an Undercover teen in High School by getting on the football team, which caused a wedge between the partners when Jenko bonds with one of his teammates <br/><br/>Many of the film's big laughs come from Jonah and Channing (of course), as their partnership reads more like a marriage going through problems during this case. The surprising humorous twist was the additional screen time Ice Cube's character, captain Dickson got in the sequel. That was a good move.<br/><br/>A few more character roll overs from the first movie exist as well including catching up with the main-villains from 21. Plus a few high profile cameos including some of the old Jump Street gang from the 80's.<br/><br/>Overall this movie flourished by avoiding the cruse of Sequels by not taking the whole thing too seriously. Good decision"

","With wit and self-mockery, 22 Jump Street brings bromance, satirical action scene and a good dose of laughter. It succeeds in avoiding redundancy of a sequel, which the movie itself points out, and brings enjoyable foolhardy yet sufficiently clever humor. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is a great couple, half of the jokes are on their expenses. Plenty of romance analogy delivered in staggeringly serious way, while the rest of it is over-the-top comedy. Script is smart, bordering on improvised banter, and it neatly pokes on popular culture.<br/><br/>Commendably, the movie sneers at some of the clichés, even those that it uses. This opens up many opportunities as it practically makes jokes of, and on, itself. Plot follows Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) into a college for the search of another drug. While some scenes might be a bit inflated, it keeps the humor grounded without resorting to forced slapstick. Hill and Tatum have great chemistry together, with tons of relationship jokes, they boast their acting prowess by keeping straight faces on what must be pretty ungraceful scenes.<br/><br/>Screenplay feels fast and tight, scenes don't overstay their welcome as it keeps churning jest at consistent pace. Action sequences are watered down and cynical remarks of those used in stereotypical action flicks. While they may be slightly predictable, the movie keeps these anticipated scenes fresh. Some events are unbelievably cartoon-like, down to the use of visible effect, but it's forgivable considering the movie produces humor literally until the end credit.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street possesses a rich sense of humor that will appeal to mainstream audience while also maintaining the adequate level of sophistication. Despite what it quips in the spirit of self-awareness, this sequel is as good, or even better than its predecessor."

","I like TV shows especially now that there is professionalism in TV, as much as in movies (Lost, 24, Prison Break) but I find it interesting that Hollywood keeps going back to classic TV shows to make them into features. I'm not exactly thrilled by the idea, casus sometimes ""interesting"" films happen, A-team, but at the same time there are films like Mission Impossible or 21 Jump Street that were good goes. I don't really remember the TV show, I know Johnny Depp was in it, but the 1st film totally one me over. I loved it. It parodied the TV show and the action comedy genre and made them dirty and it was successful so here comes the sequel. Since the Chinese bought the house the move to 22 Jump Street is necessary. The studio new exactly what was needed for a successful sequel; they had to get the guys back. Despite the directing pairs major success with the Lego film the studio convinced them to take on the project. Then they needed a script, so they got the 1st''s script writer for story value and two guys to help with new jokes. This was done well too, I think this turned out to be the crux of it all, the film would fail or stand based on the script. But there was also the actors to think about. There was no question they had to convince the two stars to come back, it would not have worked without them. I don't really like Channing Tatum though I am waiting for Foxcatcher and I'm a girl so I liked Magic Mike mmm eyecandy anyway but I have to admit that he was paired well with Jonah Hill, who I think really does well in the film. And since getting a few serious roles he's been showing his talent. So everything was in place to make a good sequel. The story: After making their way through high school, big changes are in store for officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) when they go deep undercover at a local college. From that long ass plot summary you can tell that that's not the point of the film. It has a story, but its basically the same as the 1st one, but that didn't bother me. The point is the jokes, and there are even jokes in it that the trailer doesn't give away. The actors are good but the point is the script is good of course all that wouldn't mean much if the director pair didn't recreate the atmosphere of the 1st one. The film is again a perfect parody of action-comedies and their whole feel. There relationship between the two guys works well, they were both a good choice for these films. Its been a while since a film like this has placed the two on equal ground, it's not a side kick movie they are both stars. I like that in the 1st part I didn't get what I expected, I got more, I was more entertained mind you with different methods but the 2nd part surprised me too. It's still first and foremost a wild comedy but it has a few scenes that surprised me and I was entertained. All in all 22 Jump Street is a surprisingly good sequel that even goes above and beyond the 1st part sometimes. It's not for everyone, but if you liked the 1st part you probably won't be disappointed. I give it an 8/10 and wait for the end credits before leaving the theater. https://www.youtube.com/user/silverscreenreviews1"

","Following the critical and commercial success of the action comedy 21 Jump Street a sequel seem very likely and thanks to the direction of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and an intelligent screenplay they have made a film that is on par with the original. 22 Jump Street is a very self-aware film, much like the first, lampooning the idea of sequels repeating the same plots and plot points, making fun of the film's larger budget and the general filmmaking process. The humour and jokes are constant with some fun visual gags and jokes making fun of plot points. This is a film that appreciates the audience's intelligence and Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are still as a strong double act and the film focuses on the bromance between the pair. It is a fun smart film and the best R-rated comedy of 2014 so far."

"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","3","9","29 September 2014"," Funny when it's funny but not as good as the first.
","21 Jump Street was the surprise comedy hit of 2012, even though it was adapted from a show much of its audience hadn't heard of. However, its inevitable sequel 22 Jump Street does not quite recapture the magic. It's still quite solid, there's not much point going too far into the nitpicking, but even on a comedic and storytelling basis it doesn't quite match up to its predecessor. The initial buzz for the film prided itself on its meta self-referencing about the nature of sequels and the film frequently mentions how it's exactly like the first time (it also suffers from a dull late surprise antagonist) and how things are getting expensive. But this wink isn't as well executed as it thinks nor imaginative. Instead, the film is mostly about the bromance of the first film going sour in the obnoxious party background of college. But still, when the film is funny, it's really funny. Jonah Hill is always great and Channing Tatum is getting better but he's not very consistent here. However, coupled with this and the nearly engrossing The Lego Movie, I don't think Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are all they're snuffed up to be. Just yet anyway. Perhaps they should have only had one film on their plate. <br/><br/>6/10"

In short, it retains all the elements, which made its predecessor such a delight.

""22 Jump Street"" along with its predecessor will ultimately go down in the pantheon of action-comedy, buddy-cop films as a bonafide classic of the genre."

"Schnayblay","8","3","9","16 July 2014"," Definitely Not As Good As The First, But Still Holds Strong
","Comedies are a genre I'm scarcely impressed by. Unless the humour is highly quirky or the film is deliberately offbeat, I typically don't like them. So from someone like Jonah Hill, (who I had come to expect just mainly sex jokes from after ""Superbad""), I was really surprised to discover he wrote ""21 Jump Street"". Was I impressed that he basically took (what I guess was, at least) one of his favourite shows from when he was a kid and pointlessly slapping the name on a new undercover cop movie? No. But the fact he was smart enough to address that and that he was actually capable of writing clever humour and completely emotionally developed characters, in the end won me to over to end up loving 2011's ""21 Jump Street"" and accepting it as one of my favourite comedy film in the past few years. However the immediate set-up for a sequel really dismayed me because I was worried it would become a classic case of 'rinse and repeat' sequel syndrome. And in that, I was pretty much spot on.<br/><br/>So ""22 Jump Street"" takes place only a few months or so after its predecessor in that after being off Jump Street for a while, officers Jenko and Schmidt are re-assigned back to undercover work because they did it so well in their first case. So now they're sent off to college to do the exact same thing as the first film. And the thing that forgives most of the film for this is that the writers were clearly aware of this so they made full well the audience got the message that ""Yes, we know this is the same as the first movie. Don't bash us for it, its part of the joke. Go along with it"". But in that, at the same time, the movie also feels highly rehashed and you can't help but go ""This is the exact same"". I got sick of it towards the end, I just wanted something new. And a movie, especially a sequel should not make me do that.<br/><br/>The other thing I want to address in this movie is that surprisingly I still laughed at this movie just as hard, and definitely harder in one scene, as I did in ""21 Jump Street"". The comedy is still there, and it's still just as good. So don't think that because the movie feels rehashed that you're not going to laugh because yes you definitely are, regardless.<br/><br/>Now while the first ""Jump Street"" had some fairly recognizable supporting cast members like Dave Franco and Brie Larson, I have to say this movie's supporting cast was way more unknown. I thought I recognized Jonah Hill's new love interest but clearly she just looks like someone else because she has been no one with real screen time from anything I've seen on her filmography. So it seems like they had to use the budget they would have used on some bigger names, and instead used it to keep up with the cost for all the action scenes. It's just wasted potential, to me and that is a big disappointment.<br/><br/>The acting itself in the movie is very good. There's only three people to care about this time since there's no real supportive cast. Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, and surprisingly Ice Cube. I wasn't a huge fan of him in the first film (or any movie he's ever been in), so I'm surprised how much I enjoyed him this time around. But first off, I have to talk about our main duo. Tatum and Hill are a great duo because they have a chemistry locked down that so many films try to copy. It's funny to me because I would have never though that a G.I. Joe and that kid from ""Superbad"" would one day be hilarious as hell together in an action- comedy, yet here we are. They bounce off each other really well, and I'm certain there's plenty of times where their lines are improv and it's completely seamless. They're great together and I hope they do another series or something after the Jump Street movies because they are so brilliant as a duo.<br/><br/>Now Ice Cube was one of the biggest surprises to me in this film because I have never like him as an actor. He played up the angry black captain stereotype in the first film and it did alright for him. But what I realize now is that I didn't care because he just started off angry and never had motive. In this film they give him reason to be the angry black captain and that pushes into hilarity. Now I love his character and would watch a whole movie with him. It's just a good example how character development does add to an audience's enjoyment with a film.<br/><br/>The last thing I think I can say is that the action in this movie is bigger than the last one, and overall better. There are more jokes while the fights are happening and it's all actual realistic conversations I've imagined real people would have if they got into that sort of fight, for example. There's one which makes fun of a really old cliché really well and it was one of the funniest scenes of the whole movie, that's all I'm going to say.<br/><br/>So in the end, was ""22 Jump Street"" enjoyable? Yes. Was it better than the first? No. Was it a rehash? Definitely. But it did redeem itself a little bit by acknowledging that fact, even the joke got old quick. I'm still going to buy this movie, it's still super entertaining to me. It's best watched with a bunch of friends, like all comedies are. After this I think the inevitable 23 Jump Street could turn out at least good. Let's just hope it'll be more original."
"rmmatusek","9","3","9","10 July 2014"," 22 Jump Street, full of fun
","22 Jump Street was a very good comedy. I saw it with a few buddies and decided to pay the outrageous $12.50 price. Nevertheless, the movie actually delivered. The combination of Jonah hill and Channing Tatum worked very good together, and actually had me laughing for a good portion of the film. I was a bit hesitant about another comedy after watching that awful neighbors movie, but trust me 22 Jump Street is a great comedy, with some crushing one-liners as well as some built into the story line. I enjoyed the 21 Jump Street, but thought it had flaws that kept it from breaking that 8/10 barrier. All of those barriers were broken in the sequel.

"stephenlovelette","10","3","9","9 July 2014"," The Best Comedic Sequel Ever.
","In the cinematic vernacular, there isn't a term for a complete narrative comprised of two parts.<br/><br/>The best online suggestions include duology (my personal favorite), diptych and dyad.<br/><br/>An official word is necessary for the purposes of film discussion. There are a lot of Terminator spinoffs but the first two movies (directed by James Cameron) can be referenced as one entity.<br/><br/>The initial pair of Back to the Futures and Godfathers can also be discussed as duologies.<br/><br/>To provide a different and confounding example, Ace Ventura is one of the funniest comedies of all time. One couldn't possibly differentiate between Pet Detective and When Nature Calls because they're equally hilarious. But the plot threads of the two yarns don't interweave into one gilded narrative lanyard.<br/><br/>My long-winded point is: When we give 'duology' the communal stamp of approval, let's nail down the difference between a 'series' (the Ace Ventura's) and a 'collection' (the Godfather's).<br/><br/>In the history of the laugh genre, the top three follow-ups are Rush Hour 2, Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls.<br/><br/>But 22 Jump Street is the best comedic sequel of all time.<br/><br/>And it's all about balance.<br/><br/>No fooling. Yin, yang and all that.<br/><br/>Out of three big summer comedies, this buys the pie. ('Takes the cake' implies self-indulgent thievery.)<br/><br/>Since The Hangover franchise pumped out dastardly sequels, a fatigue has developed amongst the American audience. Most moviegoers (including yours truly) can't tolerate recycled narratives.<br/><br/>This movie does a twisted inversion of exactly that. So the self-referential jokes are palpable.<br/><br/>Two sets of twins make appearances and that just begins the list of '2' jokes.<br/><br/>There's quite a bit to admire here. The trailer doesn't spoil any of the actual plot. Sure, Jonah Hill gets a mouthful of squid-ink but it occurs early on.<br/><br/>Neighbors releases earlier this summer, and several hearty laughs (specifically 'the airbag scene') are spoiled because of the trailer. A Million Ways to Die in the West spoils most of the quality jokes via previews.<br/><br/>Other filmmakers could learn something from the marketing department's careful use of footage.<br/><br/>Call-backs are a basic comedic staple. So thorough is 22's self-awareness that cutaways, bits of scenery, metaphorical discussions of production difficulties and the early credits sequence are dedicated to calling-back.<br/><br/>A quick digression regarding the credits sequence. It's a montage combining original scenes, animation, cover art and comments on the state of brand endorsement and merchandising. It's both a critical jab at the film industry and a salute to modern cinema. There are multiple cameos from actors like Seth Rogen, who never appear in the movie until this lengthy sequence.<br/><br/>This is where the filmmakers go 'above and beyond.' Any form of credits sequence is a gift to the viewer, and although they're becoming more prevalent, there's a reason most movies lack an Easter Egg: Unnecessary work. Oftentimes they're merely add-ons and don't contribute much to the overall experience.<br/><br/>But this one's different. In a way, it signifies the filmmakers' understanding of the industry. And it puts a satisfying cap on the comedic series.<br/><br/>It calls attention to all future forms of potential revenue through Jump Street spin-offs, thereby implying an end to the franchise.<br/><br/>It's probably best the series remain a fantastic duology.<br/><br/>Each time the plot encounters a cinematic cliché; it's referenced by the characters mid-scene and oftentimes recapitulated through call-backs. For instance Nick Offerman returns as Deputy Chief Hardy and lectures the protagonists about repeating narratives.<br/><br/>Schmidt and Jenko ingest Rice Krispy treats lined with 'Wyfy,' the newest intoxicant amongst college students.<br/><br/>The use of split screen in this movie is amazing, and the side-by-side depiction of a 'good trip' versus a 'bad trip' is right on the money, and hilarious.<br/><br/>A similar scene takes place in A Million Ways to Die in the West, but is far inferior.<br/><br/>The creative editing alone is worthy of applause.<br/><br/>A couple notes on the acting.<br/><br/>Ice Cube's rock-solid. He plays Captain Dickson and delivers a hilarious performance as a supporting player.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill is a talented individual. He's credited as a contributor to the writing, stars as Schmidt and is a driving force behind the film's production. Hill appears earlier this year in The Lego Movie as the voice of Lego Green Lantern.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street comes from the guys who made The Lego Movie. So it's no surprise that Lego Superman, voiced by Channing Tatum, banters with Green Lantern.<br/><br/>This choice along with the credits sequence (and the reveal from The Lego Movie) exemplifies sharp writing. These creative ideas are wildly admirable. We can use more compassionate filmmaking like this.<br/><br/>Tatum co-leads alongside Hill as Jenko, the more physically capable of the duo. That Channing fellow is one of our finest movie stars working today. In the past year he cameos in Don Jon and This is the End, and plays a leading role in Side Effects. He campaigns for the role of Gambit in the X-Men franchise, and eventually lands it.<br/><br/>Now he's Gambit in the next feature, and starring in his own film. I can't wait for both.<br/><br/>There's action, hilarious car chase antics and plenty of satire to go around.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street proves to be more than just a satisfying sequel.<br/><br/>The only question remains:<br/><br/>Will Dumb & Dumber To be better?"

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum dress up as Mexican gangsters in an attempt to thwart drug dealers but get rumbled. It was teetering on cringe-worthy but luckily things improve rapidly and I was soon smiling, then laughing. Strangely, the plot centres on the duo's relationship as they are redeployed to a revitalised 22 Jump Street to investigate a drug-related death at a college. In their teenage guises, Tatum gets into the football team without really trying and buddies up with Wyatt Russell (a stoner jock, like a young Luke Wilson). Hill gets jealous, even though as a poetry major he's managed to get into bed with the adorable Amber Stevens. The writers never fail to nail a huge range of movie clichés. I particularly enjoyed a cross-campus car chase featuring a buggy in the shape of a football helmet. In short, Jump Street is a perfect summer comedy, even for people like me who had barely heard of the original series."

I went into the film thinking it would be as bad as the first film, yet I was surprised that they dialed down the useless comedy, and thus made a better overall film. This is my review of 22 Jump Street.<br/><br/>The story for these films are fairly basic. Two friends and co-workers Schmidt(Johan Hill) and Jenko(Channing Tatum) have to infiltrate a high school, in this film a college, to find the suppliers of dangerous drugs. So in this sequel nothing really changes in that regard. The jokes are also turned down a notch in this film, which is a plus in my book because the previous film went overboard on male genital jokes. The jokes in this film are mostly generic and not funny, but I did find myself laughing at times, and much more compared to the first film. The film mostly moves by fairly quickly at that. With a run-time of one hour and forty five minutes(without credits) I never found myself looking down at my watch.<br/><br/>The directing of the film wasn't anything special. The bigger action scenes are clearly CG, and aren't very good CG at that. However I can't really blame them as this is a comedy, and comedies tend to spend less than your average action film. The directors bring in a good core of actors, and while Tatum and Hill are generic with their jokes, they work very well together, and it plays well on the screen. Since the script wasn't anything to write home about I can't really blame the directors that much, but overall the film was generic all over, but thankfully they did fix a lot of the problems from the first film.<br/><br/>Overall, this frankly is just not my cup of tea when it comes to comedies. The jokes are mainly stale, but a lot of the viewers in my age group love these films for some reason and flock to the theater to see it. If you are like that then this is an instant watch for you. If you agree with my opinions in this review, then this is a rental watch at best."

"bowmanblue","6","2","5","18 December 2014"," The most 'self aware' sequel ever made
","The first film, '21 Jump Street,' was a surprise hit. How do we know? Because the cast of '22 Jump Street' tells us as much in the script. At first I wondered whether I was imagining it, but then I realised it was basically the 'running joke' of the movie that the film-makers were only too aware how lucky they were to get the chance to make a sequel.<br/><br/>In fact, the story is exactly the same as the first – two junior cops must infiltrate high school in order to catch the bad guys. This could be considered a 'weak point' in the plot, yet the film happily exploits its own 'failings' on order to draw laughs from the fact that it's basically the same as before.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have really good chemistry as the two leads and their dynamics is what saves the film. I didn't expect to like the first film and was as surprised at how good it was. However, I did think that – despite the good, self-aware gags – it was less funny than its predecessor. That's mainly the middle of the film when it does tend to drag a bit. The first and last third seem to play better when it comes to laughs.<br/><br/>If you liked the first film, I'd say you might as well see this one, too. It's not quite as sharp, but there is just enough laughs (apart from the 'self aware' stuff) to warrant your time, although I didn't think it was as good as some critics have been saying. I heard a lot of people saying how it surpassed the original. I wouldn't agree with that, but it is okay, just not great."

However, this movie is over the top and the worst culprit is that over rated ""rap artist/actor"" Ice cube. He is obnoxious, moronic and absolutely pathetic. Dumb movie with juvenile delinquent comedy. Luckily I used a red box promotion and would not have wasted a cent on this shitty lousy movie. It is so bad; I stopped the movie in 40 minutes.

","I got about 30 minutes into this and was all but throwing the remote at the TV in sheer exasperation at the ridiculous, but never funny, story line. OK, so we have the same two idiots in the same situation doing the same stupid stuff and ha ha ha. Seriously, if your idea of funny is watching two guys shouting 'I'M ON DRUGS!!!' then you're either a moron or you've never done drugs because that's really not how people behave. The bormance between the two of them is handled so poorly that it borders of homophobia too. This is an ugly film made by people with no sense of humour or subtlety. It might appeal to emotionally stunted 14 year olds, but if you want to see a buddy flick about a pair of screw-ups, go buy a Cheech and Chong movie.<br/><br/>I mentioned the dreadful Pineapple Express because this piece of crap uses the same 'It's not funny, but if we shout the lines then it becomes funny' trick and it fails and fails badly.<br/><br/>I sat through this purely because I try to be honest about any movie I've reviewed instead of giving up and assuming it's garbage on the strength of the first bit, but I was in pain by the end of this and I really, really hope that the threat of another movie in the shape of 23 Jump Street never materialises.<br/><br/>One of the very worst films I've ever watched."

","Yep I see what they did with the movie title there, clever I suppose but it isn't really anything to do with the original TV show now is it, its just a double team buddy cop comedy. The original flick was one of those movies I honesty don't really remember much about, I do recall it being surprisingly amusing and not a complete faceless load of sh*t but nothing monumentally amazing that stuck in my mind.<br/><br/>So with that we have the obligatory follow up which basically sees the same sh*t happening to the same guys twice, how can this happen? how unlucky can this duo be? aren't they too old for this sh*t? Instead of high school its now college in a highly original plot line (people got paid to think this up?) and guess what...there are some bad guys to nail on the college campus. Que everything we saw in the first movie...but on a college campus? really?<br/><br/>So by now you're probably thinking I'm about to destroy this movie...well maybe...OK just a bit. The fun takes time to get going, its a slow slow start and I was getting itchy feet. It plays out like any bog standard 80's action flick, they catch the bad guys at the start but there's a shoot out and they get away...only to pop up later in the movie. We see the two main characters entering college and trying to fit in pretty much as they did previously in high school. Naturally this means Hill has trouble being the fat not so good looking half of the duo, whilst Tatum being a jock fits the scene like a glove and hits it off with some football lugs.<br/><br/>For me the film only really starts to hit its stride when Hill ends up banging Ice Cube young student daughter which was a solid twist I genuinely didn't see coming. The sequences involving Hill, Cube, his daughter and Hill's parents are really very good and save the film from the boredom of the clichéd sequences where the undercover pair are in classes trying to be students. A later scene where Cube is debriefing the pair and Tatum only just clicks to what's being going on with Hill's bedroom antics is a particularly funny scene, cheesy but good. Things take an odd turn when Tatum's relationship with a football jock seems to get very close, I realise they are meant to be best buds but Jesus I was really expecting some real bromance toilet humour in some scenes. I was waiting for the homosexual gags yet amazingly it didn't happen! would have had money down on that here and there.<br/><br/>On from there you get the obligatory break up of the cop duo as they go their separate ways which I didn't get. Tatum decides to stay in college and play football...so did he quit being a cop? surely you can't do both? yet apparently he was able to keep his undercover role and do both after all. There are the odd small sequences where the pair perform as real cops with all the proper gear yet in a spoof type manner. Tatum being the more athletic fit cop where as Hill...well you can guess. Towards the end you are presented with more obligatory cop action bits and pieces like a car chase with a fancy car and the sort of sneaky twist for the main bad guy behind everything.<br/><br/>I think the words obligatory and rehashed cover this movie pretty conclusively really. Its not a terrible movie, its not a great hilariously funny movie, its a reasonable buddy cop comedy satire/spoof but wholly unoriginal. The best bit about the whole film was the end credits sequence where the franchise is mocked completely by showing us spoofed movie posters and little clips for future installments in the franchise. The actual problem for that being they have literately covered everything that could possibly be done for a third film. So when that next sequel does turn up its genuinely not gonna feel any good because they have spoofed the whole franchise sequels aspect so well at the end here. Mocking repetitive fast food cash grab sequels huh...but at what point does this franchise actually become just that?<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"estebangonzalez10","6","2","5","16 October 2014"," And that's how you recycle a film
","""Do the same thing as last time. Everyone's happy.""<br/><br/>After their early success this year with The Lego Movie, Phil Lord and Chris Miller are back in the director's chair for the sequel to their 2012 hit comedy, 21 Jump Street. It is a difficult feat to pull off a comedy sequel considering the fans are expecting the same formula from the original film but at the same time they also want something fresh and unique. There isn't really anything unique about this sequel considering it is basically the same movie as the original with a few exceptions. It continues to bank on the great chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum and that is basically what kept me engaged with this film because most of the jokes were kind of predictable and repetitive. The screenwriters are also having fun with the fact that they know sequels are usually unimaginative and they simply tend to get louder, so they included several self-referential jokes throughout the film. 22 Jump Street is basically a parody of most Hollywood sequels, but I wouldn't go as far as saying that it is better than the original because several of the jokes felt forced and repetitive. I'll give this film credit for the energy and the bromantic chemistry between the leads, but there isn't much more to this sequel. It is better than most comedies that have come out this year, but I don't think it lives up to the freshness of the original film. There are some sharp and witty jokes throughout the film, but there are also many awkward moments where the comedy really doesn't work. 22 Jump Street succeeds because it sticks with the same formula as the original, but I was hoping it would at least feel fresh and inventive. The self-mockery works for a while, but it isn't enough to give it a free pass for it.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are the reason why these comedies have worked so well, and it is hard to find a comedic duo with so much chemistry as these two. The story however is rather weak, and you really don't care much for the plot. The leads are basically the reason why you will have a good time with the comedy, but I wish they could've put a little more effort on the plot. Some of the secondary performances were weak and I really had a problem with Jillian Bell's performance as Mercedes. She brought the film down for me and every time she spoke I felt like the scene was forced on us. Ice Cube has a fantastic scene alongside Jonah Hill which had me rolling on the floor. That scene was hilarious along with the final credit sequences which were also fantastic. I understand why some critics consider this to be funnier than the original, but I still prefer the freshness of 21 Jump Street over this recycled sequel."
"ThomasDrufke","8","3","10","13 June 2014"," A Comedy That Knows It's Crazy
","I think movies are at their best when they don't try to be anything but what their suppose to be. The Fast and Furious franchise do this by realizing how incredibly crazy the plot is, and embracing it. I think so far the Jump Street franchise has done the same. Because of how much of a surprise 21 Jump Street was, I went into this movie hoping it would at least be entertaining. Comedies always have a tough time with sequels. Usually because of using the same plot over and over again, hence The Hangover franchise. But 22 Jump Street tells us out of the gate that it's the same mission, with the same guys, and likely with the same outcome. I think 22 is superior to the original and in many ways opens the door for future sequels to come.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum not only have tremendous chemistry but the comedic timing for both is unbelievable. Especially for Tatum, who's roots had nothing to do with comedy. They are the perfect buddy cop duo. Ice Cube is also back and this time it's more than just a heightened cameo. He plays a crucial role especially near the end. I have to say the scene at the restaurant and back at 22 Jump Street about mid way through the movie, are two of the funnies scenes in cinema history. I laughed so hard I didn't even hear Tatum when he was running around the building high fiving everybody. Because the movie is basically the same, I think it does run into a few problems.<br/><br/>First off it's very predictable, and the character development is taken directly from the first Jump Street. As much as I thought I knew what was coming, most of the funny scenes were not spoiled by trailers. Which is definitely refreshing to hear about a comedy, especially in this day n age.<br/><br/>I thought Amber Stevens and Jillian Bell were two great additions to the cast, as they were both funny and in Stevens case, brought the few scenes with real charm to the screen. Overall I think it's better than the first and it's a good example of a sequel that is the same plot as the first, but is able to actually execute. It also has a high re-watch-ability factor much thanks to the duo of Tatum and Hill.<br/><br/>+The movie knows it's crazy <br/><br/>+Tatum and Hill are a perfect comedic duo<br/><br/>+Two Ice Cube scenes <br/><br/>+Comedy sequel that's better than the first<br/><br/>-Predictable <br/><br/>-Not much character development <br/><br/>8.5/10"

","This summer hasn't really been the best for movies, but there have been one or two that have risen above the rest in terms of pure entertainment value. One of these such movies was 22 Jump Street, a movie that is a parody of itself, bad sequels and crappy action movies.<br/><br/>The plot itself is fairly generic, which is kind of the point of the movie, but the jokes are hilarious and the delivery of them is near on perfect. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are both on top form during this movie, perhaps even better than they were in 21 Jump Street. It was also great to see Ice Cube getting a lot more screen time here as well, time to prove he can still be as bad ass and as funny as ever, in fact, his character in this did remind me a lot of how he played Craig in the Friday sequels.<br/><br/>I will say they did re-use a lot of jokes and comedy ""bits"" from the first movie, and I do get that this was intentional and meant to be funny, but some of it just felt kind of crammed in there at times and didn't really match the rest of the movie, I won't say too much on this for fear of spoilers, but I'm sure if you watch the movie or have already seen it, you know what parts I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I also feel obliged to point out that some of the secondary characters/actors were not that great, both in writing and execution. To name one group of these characters, I would say the new ""Interns"" at Jump Street, but there are other examples, scattered throughout the film.<br/><br/>Aside from these two minor complaints though, I will say, if you are looking for a bit of light-hearted entertainment, and enjoyed the first movie, 21 Jump Street, then I'm sure you'll enjoy this one as much as I did. I Wouldn't really call it a ""multiple-watches"" movie, but I could see myself watching it again at some point in maybe like a year or so, if I'm bored and want a laugh.<br/><br/>So, in closing, I say give it a shot, you may be surprised by how much you enjoy it.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>Written By Kieron Behan"

","Worthy sequel to the 2012 blockbuster about Hill and Tatum taking their ""skills"" as narcs from high school to college. The chemistry definitely works better here, with the two leads bickering like a married couple instead having a bully/nerd team like in the first film. Quite predictable in the first half, but begins taking unexpected turns midway through and leaves you laughing to its unpredictable ending. Ice Cube really steps it in this one and makes an effort to move in as the third main character, and his subplot is perhaps the best part about this film.

"sunshinebeachcinema","6","2","6","16 July 2014"," It's a sequel, but it's an entertaining meta-comedy.
","How many sequels have been accused of basically repackaging the last film we saw and charging us the price of a cinema ticket once again? That's Hollywood, but at least Phil Lord & Christopher Miller, the directorial duo behind the first 21 Jump Street and the seminal The Lego Movie (which also came out this year – these guys have been busy), are acutely aware of this and unafraid of letting us know that they know.<br/><br/>The first 21 Jump Street (2012) took its name from the address of the old church in which the operation was headquartered. Right off the mark, the Ocean's Eleven-style sequel numbering lands us across the street at number 22 which, mocking the often inflated budget of Hollywood sequels, is an even bigger church, kitted out with a king's ransom in expensive looking surveillance equipment, and a chief's office that looks like a 'giant cube of ice' – cue the derisive Captain Dickson (Ice Cube).<br/><br/>Our 'heroes' Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are cops and buddies, as close as two straight guys can be, and their bromance is truly something to behold. Their relationship was solidified on screen in the first film and provides the central conflict of the sequel – all other characters in the film are sent to test it.<br/><br/>The whole thing's pretty consistently hilarious. Hill and Tatum are fine comedic actors who carry the film well. It's not perfect, but there are some great gags peppered throughout (from Jonah Hill's impersonation of a Latino gangster to Ice Cube losing his cool at a buffet), and a slew of more subtle shout-outs for the perceptive film-goer.<br/><br/>A lot of the humour is drawn from the general self-aware ribbing, and even when it's not directly commenting on the budget or the sequelitis, it's ripping apart the clichés of college movies, action movies, and buddy cop movies.<br/><br/>Much is made of the fact that the characters are going to have to do the same thing once again: infiltrate an educational establishment to root out drug dealers. They're looking a little old for high school now, so they're off to college in all its clichéd frat partying, football playing, hard drinking, spring breaking glory.<br/><br/>Their emotional strife pans out similarly to last time, but with some role reversal. Jenko's natural jock status was subverted in 21 Jump Street, when he found that the modern high school student is more receptive to the book smart sensitivity embodied by Schmidt. Here it's played straight, as he effortlessly slides into the frat boy dynamic and finds a new best bro, leaving Schmidt by the wayside.<br/><br/>The plot might be formulaic, but this film revels in it. It's a very easy film to watch and plays like a farcical lesson in making a comedy sequel. As the main goal of a comedy is to make you laugh; to this end, it delivers."
"abcvision","7","2","6","12 July 2014"," Going back to school
","Time moves on the boys from 21 Jumpstreet move to the bigger and better 22 Jumpstreet. This includes more adventure and heroic action as Schmidt and Jenko go under deep cover to see how the millennials work hard and play hard in college. The first half of the movie moves quickly with gags and lots of unexpected twist and turns, only to shift to the second half with a more serious dynamic between these buds. College life is a different world and it show case the care free attitude of these students that are ready to dominate their future. The team of Jonah Hill and Channing Tantum make for a fun pair as they play off their opposite traits. Ice Cube keeps a straight face as the Captain and there is brief appearance by Queen Latifah making an interesting mix to this zany crew."

","Sometimes it can become a hassle to trust a sequel and remake when it's promoted to be superior to the original first installment in a series. There's no doubt that this idea was coming soon from afar and avoiding it wouldn't be a doubtful choice to those skeptical if it would succeed or fail. After the surprising success of the first movie, it's come to the attention of all audiences that this sequel truly knows what it is, where it belongs, and why it's not afraid to go beyond all expectations even if it ironically addresses it.<br/><br/>But this is where things take a wrongful and distracting turn when it becomes too self-aware and allows itself to be exactly as its original counterpart without straying away too far. To some, this may seem as an intentional gag that can be left excused and acceptable due to the circumstances, but it also shows there's a lack of boldness it had the chance to take advantage of had it fooled us twice as the first time.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street did exactly what it wanted and perhaps thought it cleverly jumped the shark - but unfortunately, even if it was brutally honest, it jumped somewhat backwards for not taking its own advice more seriously than portrayed."

They had a bigger budget then the previous and it shows on the screen in the form of locations, stunts and extras. There are enough laughs and some action. If they took out the ""F"" bombs it would be a silent movie. <br/><br/>If you are a looking for a summer popcorn movie this is for you. It's a tad long.

","This movie is definitely fun I got the last full show in Ayala today which was at 2:30. Anything after that was Transformers 4, and I wanted to catch this movie before it got removed from the theater. From start to end, you just laugh at this movie. It's the same directors, same writers, and same actors with the same formula. I even loved the references, which felt kind of awkward to laugh at, because I was the only one in my row who understood them e.g. ""I like your new office, Captain. It looks like a cube of ice."" because the captain is played by Ice Cube! Right?? You get it?? It's funny, right?.... moving on... Though I did enjoy 22 Jumpstreet, I still think I love the first one more. The thing with the first one was, it was unexpectedly fresh and definitely memorable, kind of like The Hangover. With the second movie, you get the same story, with just a few elements changed in it (kind of like Hangover II), and it doesn't help that Ron Swanson's character keeps reminding us that this is the SAME movie. Also, one major gripe: The inside jokes comparing the police department to the actual movie were a bit worn out. They did it once in the first movie, and they did it again for this movie, only more times. The only time where I found it really distracting was during action scenes. Instead of worrying about what's happening to the characters, I just laugh at the references they were making about not spending so much on the movie's budget. The excitement is gone because, you get reminded that ""this is just a movie"". Also Schmidt and Jenko ""gay"" scenes were a bit too many in my opinion. I mean, they ARE funny... but they tend to get repetitive. The 2 guys had such great chemistry in the 1st movie. Now, Jonah Hill is the possessive girlfriend type? It just felt like the character was developing backwards. Channing Tatum should stick to comedy. I never cared for his dramatic roles, nor was I really impressed with his action roles in G.I. Joe... maybe because he doesn't really suit me as the smart/leader type. He has that ""jock"" type of look, and his portrayal of not-too-smart action hero cop Jenko was really likable and endearing. Also, Jillian from Workaholics is a terrific comedic actress. If you guys don't watch the show, you should check it out, and not just for Jillian. You people who love Pitch Perfect will recognize Adam Devine who is one of the co-creators of the show. It's good, I swear. Overall, I think that 21 Jumpstreet is better than 22, but 22 isn't far behind. It's a great movie, and you shouldn't miss it 21 Jumpstreet = 8.0/10 22 Jumpstreet = 7.9/10"

","I saw ""22 Jump Street"", starring Jonah Hill-Django Unchained, Grandma's Boy; Channing Tatum-White House Down, She's the Man; Ice Cube-Ride Along, Anaconda; Peter Stormare-Pain & Gain, Nacho Libre and Wyatt Russell-This is 40, Cowboys & Aliens, and he is also the son of Kurt Russell & Goldie Hawn and the half brother to Oliver & Kate Hudson.<br/><br/>This is a sequel to the 2012 movie, which is based on the 1987 t.v. series which starred Johnny Depp and, believe it or not, this installment is funnier than the first one. Jonah and Channing return as the two police officers that go undercover in schools because they happen to look young. In the first movie, they went to high school, but now, they are off to college. Ice returns as their foul-mouthed boss that runs the undercover operation and he has several funny scenes; one in particular is at a dinner get together where he looses his temper-for good reason. Wyatt plays a football player that is under suspicion at the college for being a drug dealer and Peter is the main bad guy that is trying to flood the college with his drugs. As far as the plot goes, there is not anything new here, but the actual funny comes from the execution of the material. For instance, there is a running joke about their ages involving several other students commenting on them being too old for college. There are several cameos-some from the original t,v, show-and during the end credits there are previews of the next ten to fifteen Jump Street movies-23 Jump, 24 Jump,etc. I-and most of the audience I was with-was laughing out loud, throughout the whole movie. It's rated ""R"" for language, sexual content, violence and drug material and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. This was a hilarious sequel and I would definitely buy it on Blu-Ray."

","Hapless cop partners Jenko and Schmidt are sent to college to root out drug suppliers. Shenanigans ensue.<br/><br/>I am still not a big fan of Jonah Hill (although I am gradually warming to him as a non-comedic actor), but I am getting to be quite impressed by Channing Tatum. Jump Street 2 confirms that he is very good at comedy. This movie is not going to hold many surprises for anyone who saw the first one. It is quite funny throughout, with a lot of in-jokes, daft dialogue, and movie reference gags sprinkled along the way. It is, of course, quite daft, overflowing with profanity, and it makes the most of the chemistry between Hill and Tatum by turning the bromance between them into one of the plot points. It's not going to win Oscars, but it is an entertaining comedy in the modern tradition.<br/><br/>I really liked the closing credits."
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","8","2","6","12 June 2014"," 22 Jump Street Review
","My Thoughts:<br/><br/>Going into this movie, I was worried that it was not going to be able to hold up to what, to me, was one of the funniest movies I had seen. I am happy to say that this movie is full of laughs and they do not show you all the funny parts in the commercials or trailers which is always a big worry for me with these types of movies.<br/><br/>Just like in the first movie, they are not afraid to poke fun at themselves or some of the movies the actors have starred in since the first movie. So you could say that they keep themselves grounded by using this humor to make fun of the first movie as well as the movie they are currently in. And just like the first one, we do get some cameos that provide us with a good laugh.<br/><br/>In this movie, at first, the running gag is that it is exactly the same movie as the first one except that they are going to be going to college instead of high school. They beat you over the head with how close it resembles the first movie, but don't worry, they quickly start finding out that things are not what they appear to be. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) go to college to find a new drug that is being sold on campus and things are just not going well for them because most of the students either believe they are cops or that they are just too damn old to be in college. Jenko is finding himself drawn into college football and wondering if he should pursue it full-time. Schmidt is still the same: he is the brains of the operation; but he also has the clingy/romantic story line in the movie which leads us to some of the funniest moments in the movie, if I do say so myself. So, we get the story line of them tracking down the drug and those supplying the drug to the school, but we also get to see Schmidt and Jenko come to realize what it is they really want out of life and each other. My Recommendation:<br/><br/>If you are looking for a great comedy, this is going to be the one for you. I would have to say that it is close to being as good as the first one."
"cousbrojs","8","2","6","12 June 2014"," It's still funny the second time around.
","What I liked about 22 Jump Street was that it was confident. The writers knew it was the same movie, and they address it as often as possible. So yes, it's the same movie, don't get all critique about it. But, the jokes are so much better, and they don't rely on dick jokes as much as they did in the first one. There's not a lot of build up to the gags also, what happens, happens, and that's awesome!<br/><br/>The chemistry between Jonah and Channing is brilliant. They bounce off each other perfectly and I just can't picture anyone else playing the dynamic duo. Ice Cube, who wasn't in much of the first film, has a lot more screen time here. And his scenes are mainly filled with absolute hilarity! There's one scene in the middle of the movie that involves him, will make you laugh so hard you might tear up a bit.<br/><br/>The action sequences were well done, a whole lot more exciting than the first movie, the scale was bigger and the locations were better. It's great movie with lots of laughs and a couple of hearty moments.<br/><br/>I would say this is the funniest movie of the year so far and the funniest R movie this year (I didn't enjoy Bad Neighbors as much as 22 Jump Street).<br/><br/>8.4/10"

"gavinp9","8","1","2","2 January 2018"," Great sequel with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and plenty of charisma to boot
","Is '22 Jump Street' as good as '21 Jump Street'? Quite possibly, which is a big achievement, seeing as the original was one of the better comedies of the last 10 years! This film has just as many laughs - if not more - and does a great job of poking fun at itself and the ludicrousness of most Hollywood sequels.<br/><br/>There's a few more car chases, but they're unconventional and quite amusing with the commentary the two leads provide. A fair bit of the humour comes from the fact that their undercover disguise as college-age students (i.e. they should be 18-21), which is totally unbelievable, seeing as Hill is 30 & Tatum is 34. Plenty of referencing the first film and stupidity of repetition in sequels (mostly by Offerman's Chief of Police - ""EVERYTHING is EXACTLY the SAME""!) and even casting the bad guy from 'Bad Boys II' - Peter Stormare - as the villain in this!<br/><br/>Pretty good support cast - the Yang Twins are great as the across-the-hall stoners, Stevens is good as the love interest and Ice Cube has more to do in this film, which is a good thing and leads to a few hilarious scenes.<br/><br/>Best bit of the film? Probably the many joke sequel posters/trailers they show! Highly entertaining and just plain funny to see how far they can stretch a premise. Quite reminiscent of 'Tropic Thunder', but definitely had the crowd in stitches! I do hope they make a third film, but if not, both 21 & 22 Jump Street will stand as some of the best action/police comedies ever made."
"Horror-yo","7","1","2","3 November 2017"," Very good at what it does
","Well you may think this here is pure Hollywood formulaic comedy onanism that barely holds up a framework to merely work a quick plot, a couple of processed jokes and mix it up in the right convenient format with regards to length/acting/politics etc...<br/><br/>And there's certainly a part of that, but this one here is actually well built and worth a watch. The management and resolution of suspense about who the bad guy really is for instance is really good, and it is as everything else in the flick: it doesn't take itself seriously, while still being well crafted.<br/><br/>A couple of gags are a bit overcooked, and it isn't laugh out loud funny the whole time, but some moments are well worth the time (""do you like weather ?""), the secondary characters are very good, the action scenes are original and fresh and don't have that feeling of instant boredom as they only start like most action movies over the last decade, it's got very good pace and doesn't feel stretched or stale at any moment. And of course there's a good little moral woven throughout and at the end, and all in all it may beat the first.<br/><br/>Good stuff. A deserved 7.5/10."
"Tweekums","8","1","2","25 October 2017"," Just like the last one
","This sequel makes no bones about the fact that it is trying to repeat the successful formula of '21 Jump Street' the Jump Street operation has moved to a new superior premises opposite the old one and Schmidt and Jenko are once again undercover in an educational establishment this time they are trying to find who is dealing a new designer drug in a college. Jenko quickly becomes friends with members of the football team, especially quarterback 'Zook'; this leads to our dynamic duo being invited to join a frat house Jenko fits right in but Schmidt realises it's not for him so goes and hangs out with the art student. While the athletic Jenko enjoys a night with the boys Schmidt spends the night in the bed of Maya, a beautiful arts student. Before the case is solved suspects emerge and an innocent man is arrested before Schmidt and Jenko finally face down the real culprits during Spring Break festivities.<br/><br/>If you watched '21 Jump Street' and weren't amused then don't bother watching this; however if you enjoyed it then you should enjoy this just as much. The plot is basically the same as the first but the college setting allows for some different gags. Many of the gags are very meta with talk of everything being just the same as before and the sight of an empty lot with a '23 Jump Street' hoarding just waiting for their next HQ. While much of what happens isn't surprising a few unexpected things did happen the best being when we learn who the Maya's father is; possibly the funniest moments in the film resulted from this. The identity of the dealer is also a little bit of a surprise. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a good chemistry as Schmidt and Jenko and Ice Cube is great as their boss. Of the non-recurring characters Amber Stevens West and Wyatt Russell impress as Maya and Zook. Overall I wouldn't say this is the greatest film but if you enjoyed the first and want more silly fun then this is well worth watching."

Need you more ? NO.<br/><br/>I would really like to see 23 jump street or whatever but the ending scenes clarified that it needs great originality to come up with another part, but let's just hope !<br/><br/>9/10 Definitely would watch again"
"Horst_In_Translation","4","1","2","28 June 2017"," The level has decreased
","""22 Jump Street"" is an American 110-minute movie from 2014, so two more years only and this one has its 5th anniversary already. It is of course the sequel to 21 Jump Street and Jonah Hill as well as Channing Tatum reprise their roles here. The number of writers and directors who worked on this one here, but eventually we have a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. I liked the first film more than this one here. This may also have to do with my general dislike for 2-time Oscar nominee (still hurts to say that) Jonah Hill, who is an incredibly untalented actor in my opinion. I like Channing Tatum more, but not to a level where I would say he is one of my favorites. Other than these, i was familiar with Offerman, Stormare and Ice Cube I believe. But they did not really have that much to work with anyway. Eventually, it is all about Hill (and Tatum). The plot occasionally reminded me of the first film when it is about the struggles in their friendship. But of course there were also major differences, for example in whom to consider the main antagonists. Unfortunately, I must admit that the ""villains"" if you may want to call them like that were not really that impressive or memorable in my opinion. And also there was not one performance at all where I would say this one really stood out. i am a bit baffled to see that most people really liked this sequel and enjoyed it as much as (or almost as much as) the first film. I mean the first film with Jonah hill of course. The Johnny Depp approach is once again something entirely different. Anyway, as a whole I would recommend this work really only to those who adore either of the two lead actors (and probably did not see Hill's acting here as really cringeworthy at times) or really really loved the first film (more than me who ""only"" liked it. I think there were too many lengths in here for me to recommend it and it may have been better at 90 minutes runtime with better focus. Watch something else instead."
"Morten_5","4","1","2","11 June 2017"," Too long, too little substance
","There are a lot of week spots here, sadly. It's clear that ""22 Jump Street"" doesn't take itself seriously, but that doesn't make it funny.<br/><br/>It's hard doing good a comedy. It takes good writing, timing and spot-on dialogue, none of which is present here. The film would have benefited from a shorter running time, and should perhaps have ended after the first arrestment. There's simply not enough material for the running time it has. Hill and Tatum have a few nice moments, but it's not enough and their chemistry is not very strong."
"The-Sarkologist","8","1","2","16 April 2017"," Hilarious
","The same friend who recommended that I watch 21 Jump Street also suggested that this one wasn't anywhere near as good. Unfortunately I am going to have to beg to differ because I discovered that the sequel was absolutely hilarious. In fact I was surprised that it was actually better than the original film (though it certainly wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well without the previous film). Where the first film had no qualms in laughing at itself, this film literally went overboard in poking fun not only at itself, but also the fact that it happens to be a sequel.<br/><br/>Well, our heroes from the first film have returned, and as was suggested at the end of the first film they were going on a new assignment in college. Mind you, these guys to have a tendency of messing things up, and that is what they definitely did in the latest bust. However they are given another opportunity, and in a way it is following the similar theme of the first film – drugs are appearing in a college and they have to bust the supplier before it gets out too far. However there is one major catch – don't expect everything to be the same. For instance, if we remember from the first film that Hill was the popular one and Tatum wasn't – well everything has switched back to the way it was supposed to be.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm not sure if there is all that much more to say about this film, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but rather it is just what it is – an amusing film that pokes fun at itself. Sure, it is also about college life, but the thing is that there are plenty of movies out there that are also about college life. In fact there are so many that promote the college life that people seem to want to go to college simply to experience the lifestyle. Hey, I can't comment because the only reason I went to the university I went to was because of the prestige, and also the fact that a heap of my friends were going there, so yes, it was basically the lifestyle.<br/><br/>However, the thing is that there are a couple of really interesting twists in the film, which I have to admit raises it beyond simply being another laugh out loud college flick. Okay, we also must remember that they are police officers, and they are on a case, so it sort of works both ways, but as with the previous film there is always the tendency of getting so caught up in the rolls that you are playing that you end up forgetting the reason that you happen to be there, which is basically why they ended up messing everything up. Still, since it is a comedy the major characters are of course going to have the propensity of messing everything up, and messing it up big time, which in part is where a lot of the laughs come from. It is certainly an enjoyable movie, and definitely a worthy sequel."
"policy134","4","1","2","22 May 2016"," Offers very little fresh material
","Though I liked the performances of Tatum and Hill (they have really great chemistry), it really feels like more of the same as in the first film. There is also a really tired bro-mance plot that really outstays its welcome in the first 30 minutes. It's like they recycled the plot for I Love You, Man but with more shooting.<br/><br/>Also, there are tons of actors who are wasted in cameos and small supporting parts only so we can recognize them and say: ""Oh, they got Richard Grieco to participate"" or ""Look! There's Nick Offerman again.""<br/><br/>There is one hilarious scene involving Tatum having a grand time about a twist involving Hill and the captain. It just seems like a little too much like sitcom style humor.<br/><br/>So, there is not much to recommend here, although I did like the end with all of the fake sequel titles."
"drqshadow-reviews","8","1","2","22 January 2015"," Big, Dumb and Beautiful, It's a True Formula-Drinker
","A return to the well for Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in every conceivable way, doggedly following the same formula that brought them success the first time around. Somehow, it's just as good. Maybe it's because there's nothing quite like this elsewhere on the scene, so we're just scratching that blatantly self-aware, cliché-seeking itch once every couple of years and it hasn't yet worn out its welcome. At least, not entirely - the constant winks and nods do begin to grate by the end of the third act - but a heavy dose of loud, fresh, full-body laughs do a fine job of smoothing it all over. Ice Cube, in an expanded role, is especially great, shamelessly stealing scenes like a serial kleptomaniac. Of course it's not to be taken remotely seriously, even in comparison to the original, which is a good thing because the plot is a totally vacant, paper-thin wash. Does mindless comedy still have a place in today's landscape? It does in my living room."
"sesht","Null","1","2","4 August 2014"," The best end-credits sequence, this side of a Marvel chain-flick
","This one didn't need the Depp cameo for it to be a load of fun. Sure, there are more jokes that miss than those that hit home, and sure, its got less Ron Swanson than I'd like, but it's an entertaining ride, and a rare sequel that maintains the tone and momentum of the one that came before, sacrificing less in terms of plot, et al.<br/><br/>Phil Lord and Chris Miller are having a really creative burst, esp. with 'The Lego movie', almost like the directorial duo who're helming the Community series as well as the Captain America movies, though they were thought of as someone lite who'd not be able to match up to what was needed to scale it up.<br/><br/>One scene in particular that's a whole lotta fun, while having to propensity to cause offense by the truckload, and that has Jonah Hill's character trying to knock out a 'lady' dealer. <br/><br/>Another thread that goes on for a bit is the part where Ice Cube's character is given more to do than he was given in the first one, and that 1 whole welcome change. Why couldn't we have more, esp. with Nick Offerman, or the supremely talented Peter Stormare? Why cast someone if you don't give them something substantial to do? More on my gripes later.<br/><br/>Most of the situations the leads find themselves in are contrived, and this is something that I feel plagues the entire series. There IS propensity for having a legitimate tale in this universe, and for the sake of laughs, I feel that two intelligent film-makers like these are squandering the opportunity away, and have ended up making a 'Starsky and Hutch' instead.<br/><br/>Having said all that, this is still entertaining, and Tatum has upped his game so much that he commands our attention even when Hill's acting his socks off in a role that fits him like a glove. <br/><br/>No point watching this one on the Indian big-screen though, since most of the risqué one-liners are ALL friggin' Muted. I'd actually ask everyone in conservative societies that gleefully chop off these works of art to wait for the DVD.<br/><br/>And yes, the end-title montage more than makes up for all the other dull montages that came before, and is perhaps one of the best ever montages ever!!! Well-worth the price of admission."

Schmidt and Jenko's relationship starts to develop into a full out bromance-bordering-on- gay-married-couple and you start to laugh.

"DanteBacani","8","2","7","13 July 2014"," A hilarious sequel to end all sequels
","22 JUMP STREET is one of the most laugh-out-loud comedies I have seen -- and in nearly 50 years on this planet, I have seen plenty. <br/><br/>Before writing this review, I skimmed a few of the one- and two-star IMDb reviews posted for this movie, and I gave up on them after a while. Humor is *extremely* subjective, and what I find funny won't necessarily click with someone else (and vice versa); having said that, I have a fairly broad (though hardly all-encompassing) sense of humor, and 22 JUMP STREET worked for me on many levels. I am somewhat surprised that there are so many people that *didn't* like this movie -- and that they are so vehement in their disdain for it -- that I was moved to post my 2¢, because it almost seems like we saw two different movies.<br/><br/>The key to enjoying this movie is to appreciate its ""meta-ness"": as has been said in virtually every mainstream media review I have read for this movie, this is a sequel about ""sequels"". There isn't a sequel trope that isn't subverted at some point during this movie (some tropes are skewered multiple times from multiple directions). The filmmakers are in on the absurdity: about the only limitation they gave themselves is that they don't break the fourth wall -- if they did, every scene would begin or end with the actors looking at the camera and winking.<br/><br/>Now, if you don't like that kind of movie -- if you just want a movie to be about what you see on screen without thinking about subtext, in-jokes, meta-commentary, etc. -- then I can see why 22 JUMP STREET might not be your cup of tea.<br/><br/>(Aside: Speaking of ""in-jokes"" maybe it's because N.W.A.'s first record is 25 years old and maybe it's because I saw the movie in a predominantly white Chicago suburb, but there's a joke involving Ice Cube and ""Straight Outta Compton"" that had me howling, but I was apparently the only person in the theater who got it.)<br/><br/>I couldn't stop laughing during 22 JUMP STREET, and I can't wait for the Blu-ray so I can listen to the filmmakers commentary (and maybe find out what joke/trope references I missed).<br/><br/>I don't think it's a *perfect* comedy -- those are few and far between -- and if the IMDb system allowed reviewers to give half-votes, I'd probably kick it up to 8.5 votes. But it's very, VERY funny, IMHO, and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>The movie has been out for exactly one month to the day as I write this review (July 13, 2014): the general consensus is that it has underperformed at the box office; however, seeing as it has taken in over a quarter of a BILLION dollars worldwide ($172+ million domestic), it seems to me to have performed just fine, and that it has connected with most of its audience quite well. (Plus, it doesn't have 3-D surcharges inflating its box office take, as do the top 6 grossing movies of 2014.)<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I attended this movie with a friend who hadn't seen 21 JUMP STREET, and he thought it was hilarious, too -- so you needn't see the first movie to enjoy ""22"" (though I'd urge you to see the first one so that the jokes which rely on familiarity with it register fully)."

","I honestly didn't think this would match up to the original. The original was a funny springtime surprise with an unlikely collaboration, a shallow plot, but some great chemistry among the cast and a lot of funny moments. It does no problem superseding the original in my book. The chemistry is there again. The supporting cast once again does a great job creating the funny moments, although it would have been nice to see Franco and Riggle in more than one scene, even though it is hilarious. The plot leaves a bit to be desired, but the execution, and the ability to not take themselves too seriously throughout the movie makes this one a winner. Also have to give credit to the directors for not just sticking the characters in the exact same predicament. This time Jenko gets a chance to have fun and hang out with the cool kids, and Schmidt is stuck with art and poetry students, meets an interesting girl, and an even more interesting roommate. Dickson (Cube) is also a good addition and the interactions with him create laughs as well. The credits montage is witty and entertaining."

"moviexclusive","9","2","7","15 June 2014"," By far the funniest comedy this summer has to offer, '22 Jump Street' coasts on a delightfully meta attitude and the inimitable chemistry of Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill
","Before you start accusing '22 Jump Street' of being more of the same, well writers-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller want you to know that they hear your lament. Yes, the duo whose Midas touch has made box- office gold of 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' and 'The Lego Movie' are keenly aware of the Hollywood symptom of 'sequelitis', and so they have followed up their sly, self-referential reboot of the 1980s TV series with a follow-up that is even more meta, achieving in the process the rare feat of a sequel that is brasher, angrier and most importantly funnier than the original.<br/><br/>To be sure, no one expected the 2012 feature film starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill to become the runaway success that it did; but instead of a straightforward update, its helmers Lord and Miller decided to turn a police procedural of youthful-looking cops going undercover in schools and colleges into a self-mocking romp. With just the right amount of self-awareness and some inventive flourishes, the retooled '21 Jump Street' became both a critical and commercial hit, which of course is the reason why this sequel is seeing the light of day.<br/><br/>Tatum and Hill reprise their roles as the pair of bumbling cops Jenko and Schmidt respectively, who after bungling up the arrest of a wanted drug kingpin (Peter Stormare) find themselves assigned to a second stint in college. The address here refers to the location of their headquarters, now situated in a Vietnamese church located right opposite their last rendezvous point in the previous movie whose rundown exteriors are in stark contrast to the fancy modern-day surveillance equipment inside. Hardass Captain Dickson is still their superior, and as Ice Cube growls, ""Nobody gave a s**t about the Jump Street reboot. We've doubled the budget, as if that would double the profit.""<br/><br/>Yup, before you start dismissing it as more of the same, their beleaguered deputy chief (Nick Offerman) already warns Jenko and Schmidt - and us - ""I want you to do exactly what you did last time."" You can't therefore fault the screenplay by returning writer Michael Bacall and his new co-writers Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman for placing our unlikely heroes into yet another shady drugs ring, although this time instead of bonding in the midst of their undercover assignment, Jenko and Schmidt find their bromance under pressure - as the fit, athletic and good-looking Jenko starts finding a soulmate in another jock named Zook (Wyatt Russell) on the football team, Schmidt finds himself snubbed and distraught.<br/><br/>It's a classic case of the college break-up between our two high-school chums, but it ain't without its surprises. Jenko's distraction isn't some hot chick, but a quarterback whom he seems to share absolute chemistry with - 'bros before lesser bros' according to him; and instead of hooking up with the nerdy crowd in school, Schmidt goes to excruciating poetry slams and finds a tender new relationship with sensitive arts major Maya (Amber Stevens), a relationship that builds to a hilarious turn of events at work. Before long, Jenko suggests to Schmidt that they ""should investigate other people. Sow our cop oats"", or in less geek speak, meaning to go their separate ways.<br/><br/>There is no doubt - this is through and through Tatum and Hill's show. As they had demonstrated in the first movie, the pair have a great double-act going, their disparities in physique and intelligence making them perfect complements whether they realise it or not. Sure, Lord and Miller amp up the homoeroticism between them, but there's no denying the goofy, low-key warmth that passes between them whenever they interact with each other. Between the two however, it's likely that you'll fall in love with Tatum, who has never been more puppy-dog lovable - and as an excellent case in point, his blissful thickness can't quite get more amusing than his delivery of a line about Cate Blanchett or 'carte blanche' in actual fact.<br/><br/>The rest of the casting is also unexpectedly spot-on. Ice Cube is in fine form as their surly captain, relishing the chance to go over-the- top as things get a little too personal between him and Schmidt. Jillian Bell is splendid as Maya's snitty room-mate, whom Schmidt has the tough luck of waking up to every morning after he sleeps over. And though essentially extended cameos, identical twins Kenny and Keith Lucas are laugh-out-loud hilarious as a a perma-stoned duo who finish each other's sentences. Together with Tatum and Hill, they make pitch-perfect satires of campus favourites, whether jock culture, the walk of shame or even the roommate you wish your date did not have.<br/><br/>With so many gags coming at you in record speed, it's little wonder that the plot takes a backseat; nonetheless, Bacall and his co-writers manage to keep the mystery humming with some perfectly executed twists that keep you guessing just where and who the investigation is leading to. The finale is appropriately set in New Mexico, where our leads follow their cohort to for Spring Break, and where Lord and Miller crank up the action for some car chases and explosions in order to justify the bigger budget that this sequel has naturally commanded (hey you can't pretend all of that went to paying the actors!).<br/><br/>But the show belongs undeniably to Tatum and Hill for their peerless chemistry, as well as to their characters whose mix of friendship, co- dependency and camaraderie. Their BFF homoerotic routine is unceasingly humorous, and the jokes are as meta as it gets without tipping into caricature. Indeed, this is a sequel even more enjoyable and entertaining than its predecessor, one that boasts more ingenuity, wit and derring-do than you would probably ever expect - after all, which sequel you know dares to burn its franchise boats in sharp satirical fashion by upending loads of serviceable ideas for future Jump Streets?"
"BrentHankins","6","2","7","12 June 2014"," Offers plenty of laughs, but ultimately falls victim to the same tropes it pokes fun at.
","One of the key things I enjoyed about 21 Jump Street was watching Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill being thrust into situations that allowed them to play completely against type, and much of the film's humor was derived from this idea. The success of the first film ensures that audiences will know what to expect, and 22 Jump Street deftly avoids repeating itself by repeatedly changing gears in an effort to keep the audience guessing.<br/><br/>After flubbing a major bust, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) find themselves sent back to the undercover division and tasked with infiltrating a drug ring that led to the death of a prominent local student. Jenko quickly assimilates into the faux college existence, walking onto the football team and rushing the hottest fraternity on campus, while Schmidt struggles to find his footing before making an unexpected ally in art major Maya (Amber Stevens).<br/><br/>Some of the best laughs come from the film's self-aware attitude, repeatedly poking fun at sequel tropes before unfortunately falling victim to them. The same ""bromantic comedy"" formula that worked so well in the first film is still effective here, but no longer feels as fresh or as clever. Likewise, Hill and Tatum retain their fantastic comedic chemistry, and they still know how to make us laugh until it hurts, but something about 22 Jump Street never quite falls into place.<br/><br/>Much like a Michael Bay sequel, this film is bigger, louder, and more expensive than its predecessor, yet seems to have lost sight of some of the smaller details that made the original so enjoyable. 22 Jump Street is certainly not a bad film - indeed, it's easily the best comedy in theaters right now - but it still doesn't work nearly as well as it should.<br/><br/>-- Brent Hankins, www.nerdrep.com"
"wparbowo","9","2","7","11 June 2014"," A lot of laugh
","If you like the first movie, you should totally go and see this one. And if you haven't seen the 21 Jump Street, it's not really a problem because I think you still can enjoy this movie.Comedy meets action is one of my favorite kind of movie, and the cast and crew pack that well in 22 Jump Street. The comedy part of this movie is nicely done. You can get a lot of laugh from this one. There's a part where you think it's the climax joke of the movie, you laugh out loud, thinking maybe there's no more LOL like that anymore and they give you another. The action and crime part of the movie are also pretty well done. It blended well with the comedy. The storyline is simple and it doesn't really matter to me because it's actually not bad. It has a nice pace and I can enjoy the movie. The bromance between the two main character played well by Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, it kind of annoyed me a little but it's not really that big of a problem. It's the kind of movie you want to watch when you had bad day and want to go home smiling."
"dunnypop","10","3","13","12 June 2014"," As good as the 1st one
","Comedy is difficult... personally I loved 21 Jump Street and laughed throughout the film even to the end... I haven't laughed that hard in a film since This is the End. Going into the film, I read that it's about 89% on rottentomatoes, so I had high expectations... but how do you make a sequel with a plot so similar?<br/><br/>You make the same movie and mention that it's the exact same movie (but not like Hangover 2 or 3). If you liked 21 Jump Street, you'll like this one. It's almost identical and the film makers know it. They have some amazing moments where the theater I saw it in all clapped several times. One of the funniest films I've seen in a while. Tatum and Hill have some great chemistry."
"ggibson63","9","3","13","11 June 2014"," Hilarious!
","I had the honor of seeing this movie in April at the very first public screening in Orange, CA, with Jonah Hill sitting in my row! This movie is absolutely amazing. I am a huge fan of the first movie, and I was nervous about this movie because I was hoping it would be just as good as the first one, and luckily it was! Channing and Jonah's chemistry is perfect and they are so hilarious together as always. Also, Ice Cube's character had a lot of growth in this movie and I really loved all of his scenes. All of the action sequences were very well filmed and highly entertaining. I especially loved how they emphasize Channing and Jonah's ""bromance"" throughout the movie. Especially with the therapist, I couldn't stop laughing. <br/><br/>I also appreciate this movie because I'm a college student and I connect a lot with the characters in this movie. 21 Jump Street came out when I was in high school, which was awesome, and now 22 Jump Street came out while I was in college. It's awesome to sort of grow up with these movies and feel connected to these characters. <br/><br/>Overall, it's just as good as the first one, if not better. I highly recommend going to see it. Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Ice Cube did an amazing job!"

","I understand when people said they don't understand this movie, I went with 2 friends and I was the only one laughing.

They are smart jokes. Enough said"
"RevRonster","10","2","8","2 July 2014"," Just as insanely fun and funny as the first one...
","Let's be honest; was any of us really prepared for how freakingly hysterical ""21 Jump Street"" was? I know I wasn't. So, since I laughed my face off (and paid millions of dollars in surgery to have a new face put in—that I regret wasn't Nicolas Cage's face), I had extremely high expectations from the comedy teams of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller and Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. And to a much smaller surprise than how hilarious ""21 Jump Street"" was, the film was flippin' hysterical! (I was fully prepared for hilarity this time)<br/><br/>The best part about this sequel is the fact that Lord and Miller were not shy at all at making fun of themselves and the fact that the film was a sequel. The movie is already gut-busting with its never ending line of never stale, always fresh and numerous types of comedy but the fact the film is so darn self-aware and filled with riding right up to the edge of the fourth wall and hurling out a hailstorm of META-gags made the film work absolutely perfectly as a follow up to the first film.<br/><br/>Once again, the movie has a great cast (especially the new additions to the film) and Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have great comedic chemistry together. The duo play so well off each other that they make all the jokes look like there was no effort whatsoever in them and end up making the film just one long smooth sail through calm comedy waters. ""22 Jump Street"" is just fun and absolutely hilarious to the point it is just as good as the first film—something very rare in the world of sequels. Like the first film, I will be watching this movie many, many more times in the future.<br/><br/>Greetings, gents and ladies. Feel like reading more of my rants, ramblings, geek references, bad jokes and more movie reviews (including a more in-depth look at ""22 Jump Street"" and other films that aren't comedy remixes of old TV shows that had Johnny Depp in them)?

"tao-and-zen1","3","2","9","14 October 2014"," Lame sequel
","To begin, I have to say that I didn't expect much from the first movie in this series, 21 Jump Street, but was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. When I saw that this movie had a such a high rating here on IMDb (8.4 when I first looked up this movie), I asked myself 'is it possible that a sequel turned out to be as good as its predecessor?' Well, it turns out that no, not in this case, and I was very confused by how this movie got such a high rating.<br/><br/>I think just about everything about this movie is lame, forced or a cliché. The dialog is cringe-worthy and the story is unoriginal, essentially just trying to capitalize on the success of the first movie. I give this movie a 3, which is the number of things I found funny in it. One of those was the closing credits, which I did enjoy very much. Another was the expression on Ice Cube's face after the discovery of a certain situation. A couple of other scenes made me smile, but that's about it.<br/><br/>My recommendation is that if you do watch this, just skip to the end credits. The rest isn't worth your time."
"katybug-22","10","2","9","20 June 2014"," genuinely laughing out loud...
","Watched it in theaters and EVERYONE in the place was CRACKING UP! I can't tell you the last time I laughed so genuinely hard... like ugly laughing hard. No question, this one tops the first. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have unreal chemistry on screen, no one could have done better. I was afraid the sequel would be a flop compared to 21 Jump Street but 22 exceeded my expectations. GO SEE IT! Ushers at the theater were watching and dying of laughter too. Throughout the whole movie they reference 21 Jump Street but in a way that makes it feel like an inside joke between you and them. So many ""comedies"" never give you the laugh the way 22 Jump Street does. In my opinion, movies like 22 deserve their own genre because calling it a ""comedy"" doesn't give it justice. I'm absolutely buying this movie and seriously we are considering to go see it again in theaters this weekend."
"jsteelefmc2","10","2","9","19 June 2014"," Hilarious Film From Start to Finish (and beyond)
","I think the biggest fear going into 22 Jump Street was that it would be just another sequel. Sequels almost never turn out as good as the original, because at the end of the day it's really just rehashing the same content to make more money. But the great thing about 22 Jump Street is that its fully aware of this 'futility', and openly mocks it.<br/><br/>It's near insane how well-written this film is, especially for a comedy film, and it just balances realism with absurdity enough to keep you laughing for the whole time. In fact, there are particular moments in the film which go beyond hilarious; almost a new level of hysterics that you just can't describe. You'll know exactly what moments they are when you watch, and if you're anything like me you'll be left in tears by it. Not tears like Marley and Me, but tears because you'll actually be in pain from laughing too much.<br/><br/>I thought Bad Neighbours was the comedy film of the year, but 22 Jump Street makes it look as funny as a Friedberg and Seltzer film (okay, I'm exaggerating). Ice Cube can proudly make his claim to having the funniest moment of the film, but to maintain the magic of such a scene I won't even start to describe it. The rest of the film does not fall short either. Even the end credits alone provide more laughs than 90% of comedy films out there.<br/><br/>This film proves to be an exception to the rule that sequels are never as good as the original; I believe that 22 is definitely more than 21."
"deckert215","9","2","9","13 June 2014"," 22 Jump Street... Amazing!
","I loved this movie so much! The first one is one of my favorite movies of all time and I had very high expectations for this one and it did not disappoint even with those high expectations. 22 Jump Street was just really funny and well acted. The chemistry (or as I call it, app chemistry) between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was great as it was in the first and even stronger in this one, they are a great comedic duo! Ice Cube was also great in this one with one standout part that was one of my favorite parts of the movie. I loved how meta it was too, they made it obvious it was a sequel with a bigger budget throughout. Comedy sequels aren't always great or even near their predecessor in greatness but this sequel is up there with, if not over in some parts, 21 Jump Street. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you are a fan of the first. Also, this is a comedy where the funniest/best parts were NOT in the trailers!"

","Most of the comedy in '22 Jump Street (2014)' comes from some stellar sequel satirisation, with its incredibly smart meta-textual commentary feeling like it does much more than just 'hang a lantern' on the numerous issues it calls out. Though some of these issues do plague the piece due to its follow-up nature, they're always made a part of the joke and are never truly detrimental. The flick isn't as good as the first (though, it's close) mainly because it is so similar to it and doesn't quite have as strong a handle on its characters or narrative. Still, it's a highly entertaining and amazingly funny flick that will surely keep you smiling throughout. 8/10"
"MrDHWong","9","1","3","21 June 2016"," An Equal Sequel
","22 Jump Street is the sequel to the action-comedy 21 Jump Street, which came out in 2012. I found it to be a solid sequel, just as hilarious and action-packed as the original. The first film was easily the funniest film I saw in 2012. I was pretty much laughing the entire time and that's also the case with this film.<br/><br/>The story involves police officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) once again going under cover as students, this time at a College rather than High School, to find the supplier of a drug known as ""WHYPHY"" (an acronym for ""Work Hard Yes, Play Hard Yes"" and pronounced like ""Wi-Fi""), which has killed another student. During the investigation, Schmidt hooks up with an art student and Jenko befriends a pair of athletic jocks, which puts a strain on their close friendship.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have great comedic chemistry, as seen in the previous film, but once again Ice Cube steals the show in every scene he's in. I really wish he'd do more harder comedy films like this, unlike those crappy Are We There Yet? family films. Even Ron Swanson himself, Nick Offerman, gets a few funny moments this time around.<br/><br/>I rate it 8.5/10, the same score as the first film, making it an Equal Sequel. If you loved the original, definitely give this one a watch. But even if you haven't seen it, there's a recap at the beginning of this film to help you fill in the blanks."
"mistoppi","8","1","3","3 May 2016"," I thought this one would be just repeating but...
","... I was wrong, in a way. Of course 22 Jump Street has a similar structure to the previous film, but still 22 Jump Street manages to be original and not just repeating the first one. While the situations and some characters are familiar, 22 Jump Street is still enjoyable and worth seeing. That's a lot more than I would've expected.<br/><br/>22 Jump street is still as hilarious as the first film. This time a good example of the quality humour in this film was the good trip / bad trip when Schmidt and Jenko are on drugs. I also thought that I had seen the funniest bit - how the relationship between Schmidt and Maya became extremely awkward. But even if I knew how that was going to go, it still was so ridiculous and hilarious, oh my god. 22 Jump Street also had amazing fourth wall breaks, mostly about the budget. Same could go with how much older Schmidt and Jenko look compared to the other students. It's like when you're watching a TV show and all the high schoolers are played by fully grown people.<br/><br/>This film is hilarious and so much fun. I thought I'd rate it lower than the first one, but I guess I was wrong about this one - just like the first one. But still, if I'd have to choose one, I'd go with the first one. Something about it just makes it so much more interesting. It's not necessarily funnier or more thrilling, but it's like the first time you see a film and it's so much better than the second time. I guess that applies to this case as well."
"Quinoa1984","8","1","3","30 November 2015"," what else to say that it's funny. well, it's a funny sequel that may be better than the first!
","My first thought as the credits rolled for 22 Jump Street - and of course these are the kind of credits you really have no choice but to sit and watch until they are all done just in case you miss 34 Jump Street or whatever the next one is - was this: it's funny. If I could make it succinct that's my review. The filmmakers practically dare me to write more like, 'hey, we already know this is a money grab with multiple references to appeasing corporate masters while also making constant light of how much goddamn bromance there is here in these buddy cop movies, so, take your best shot!' so... yeah, forget it. It's funny, and the bromance is not something to gloss over as it's one of those have-its-cake-and-eat-it-too things where it's full of genuine sentiment, but at the same time they get to have a 'breaking up/apart' montage that is just perfect comedy. Oh, and seeing how Tatum goes about his undercover college life with his, uh, new bros is also very funny.<br/><br/>In short, you should go see it, that's it. Oh, and those twins are very funny, and Ice Cube steals the show in one scene where he reacts to something I never thought I'd see but makes perfect sense: what happens when the Ice Cube of this movie, the hardass detective sees his daughter with one of his, well, underlings? His facial expressions in just one scene are more hysterical than ten average comedies."
"Cjalln1","7","1","3","25 August 2015"," Finally, a sequel which is equal
","""22 Jump Street"" achieves the highest praise a sequel can get, by being as good a film as the original. It succeeds in a different way: the good-natured action spoofing of the first film becomes the subject of knowing scorn towards sequels in general. It's not essential to watch ""21"" before ""22"", but a huge amount of its metahumour revolves around direct jokes and subtler references to the first film (and the original TV series). The action is in full swing, this time centered around all aspects of college from the manly fraternities to the beatnik art crowd. The (partially improvised) script is still hilarious; Ice Cube's irate police captain plays a bigger role in the proceedings, creating opportunities for many jokes about NWA. Both character development and plot deliberately follow exactly the same arc as before, presumably to poke more fun in the direction of sequels the world over. Technical achievements in this film are not pronounced, although they are uncommon in this genre of film - the music, lighting, editing and cinematography are all standard quality. The charisma of both Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, along with their bromance and banter, is the main saving grace of the ""22 Jump Street"". It's not a cinematic marvel, but for absurd action fun and witty metahumour raillery you can't do better than ""22 Jump Street""."
"bryank-04844","8","1","3","15 August 2015"," '22 Jump Street' is funny as hell and should be allowed to have ten more sequels.
","The movie theater chains across America are plagued with sequels, reboots, and remakes these days. It seems like almost every film out there is either a sequel or a remake of an older film, leaving the original indie films left out to dry for the more independent theaters or video-on-demand. While you want these sequels and remakes to be just as good as the original or first film, most of them fall a little short, or are down right terrible. There are only a select few sequels that receive the praise and box office power that have audiences across the globe cheering its name. And I'm happy to report that '22 Jump Street' falls into that category, maybe even being towards the top of that list.<br/><br/>First off, the sequel to '21 Jump Street', now titled '22 Jump Street' is funny as hell. I lost my breath from laughter several times throughout the film. Almost everybody is back this time around to add to the hysterical comedy. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are back in the director's chair again, and have just come off their massive hit 'Lego Movie'. These two guys are definitely the future of filmmaking. They have a very successful track record so far and with this sequel that promises bigger action sequences, more cameos, and bigger stunts, they delivered on every level. One thing I love about this revamp of the hit TV show from the 80s, is that it is very self aware, as we are told by Deputy Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) that his ""department"" is surprised that the first go-around of 'Jump Street' did so well, and since it passed people's expectations, there was going to be another case with a bigger budget in hopes of a good return (wink wink).<br/><br/>'22 Jump Street' is directly across the street from '21 Jump Street', and instead of a Korean Jesus, we have a Vietnamese Jesus. Schmidt and Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum) are enrolled in online college courses, looking for professor's who are using secret code in their lectures to inform people of drug deals. After a giant and hilarious car-chase that involves animal life, Schmidt and Jenko are back at 'Jump Street' in front of their boss Captain Dickson (Ice Cube, excellent), who informs them they are going to do the same thing as they did the first time around, only with better gear and more money.<br/><br/>It's the same set-up, as the unlikely duo are sent undercover to a local college to investigate a new drug that recently killed a student, and is about to make its way across campuses around the nation. This time around, Schmidt and Jenko assume their alter egos Doug and Brad Mcquaid, but don't get them mixed up this time, as Schmidt is in art classes and Jenko tries out for football and is accepted into a fraternity. Meanwhile, Schmidt charms a nice girl named Maya (the beautiful Amber Stevens). The rest of the film plays out much like the first film did, but with even funnier jokes, and bigger action set pieces.<br/><br/>Tatum and Hill's chemistry is off the charts. I think they are best friends in real-life, or at least it seems that way, and the two play off each other incredibly. Tatum just owns this role and has perfect comedic delivery, while Hill is the king of improv. Ice Cube receives more screen-time in this sequel, and still has me laughing as I write this and as you read this with some of the things his character did. Jillian Bell ('Workaholics') shows up too and proves that she is still one of the top comedic actresses in the business today.<br/><br/>Possibly my only complaint is that I didn't think Maya's character was fleshed out all that well. I loved Brie Larson's character from the first film along with her charm and wit, but with Maya, things felt lazy. But that is so minor in the scheme of this excellent film, that you won't think twice about it. Be sure to stay through the incredible end credit sequence for a final scene. '22 Jump Street' is funny as hell and should be allowed to have ten more sequels."

","22 Jump Street (2014): Dir: Phil Lord, Chris Miller / Cast: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Ice Cube, Amber Stevens, Peter Stormare: Superior sequel to the overrated standard fare 21 Jump Street. This time out our two cops, played by Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are sent to a college to investigate a new drug called Whyfhy that is responsible for a death. Plot doesn't matter but the structure is detailed with hilarious references to the fact that this is a sequel. There is also a cleverly written scene where the two leads go their separate ways and their amusing dialogue plays like a romantic relationship breakup. This allows this film to exceed where trash like The Hangover, Part 2 failed. Hill hooks up with the wrong female on campus resulting in the most hilarious set of events and consequences. Tatum is naive to everything around him but he finds acceptance at a gay frat house where he excels at football. Ice Cube's role in the first film was pretty flat, but here he is given broader material resulting in perhaps his funniest moments in film. Amber Stevens as the student whom Hill hooks up with is unfortunately flat. And Peter Stormare as a villain who calls himself Ghost is also a reduction compared to his sinister work in Fargo, The Brothers Grimm and 8MM. The budget is bigger and directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller heighten the action and even include great use of split screen when Hill and Tatum are on opposite ends of a drug high. It would be easy to write this film off as just a sequel but its in jokes and relationship references allow it to not just jump but to hit major leaps in what is a smarter film than anticipated. Score: 7 ½ / 10"
"CMTiago","8","1","3","17 June 2015"," Sequel that makes fun of itself...ummm
","22 Jump Street is first and foremost a sequel, something the movie itself will tell you repeatedly. Not a bad thing though as most of the fun comes from there. In this installment of the Jump Street saga, Jenko & Schmidt are now heading to college to take down a drug scheme that lead to the murder of a student. Sound familiar? That's because as they were instructed, our undercover agents are told to do ""it"" exactly like last time. In all seriousness though, we all came here for the comedy and that fact the movie goes for a self-referential approach is the platform for all the crazy stunts and jokes we want to see.<br/><br/>Hill and Tatum are once again great in their roles as they share an incredible chemistry on screen and nail their characters. As far as supporting cast goes Ice Cube is once again good in his type of character, particularly in one hilarious scene. Also a shout out to a great Peter Stromae turn, as he explores his comedic side. Overall this movie is a very worthwhile follow up to the original. It's as funny and explosive and it undoubtedly pleases fans. As the movie suggests as well, we can't wait to see what's to come for this building franchise. Let us hope 23 Jump Street is another fun one.<br/><br/>Rating: 8,5/10"

","Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are going to college. There is a new drug called WhyPhy going around at MC State that killed a girl. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) is sending them in to investigate. Schmidt gets to know Maya (Amber Stevens) who knew the victim. They are led to the football players who like Jenko more. The quarterback Zook (Wyatt Russell) becomes friends with Jenko and the prime suspect.<br/><br/>After establishing the chemistry with the first movie, these two take it to the next level. Their 'session' is gut busting. Tatum is even funnier now. Jonah is the butt of a lot of jokes. Jillian Bell is hilarious with her dead pan humor. The self referential jokes really work. Even the case works. It's a nice step up."

","It was actually way better than i expected. The plot is formulaic yes, there is no much room for character development, but the humor and the tone settled were perfect. The bromance totally works, all the gay puns are epic, it makes fun of itself, and most of his jokes worked. They really did. <br/><br/>This movie accomplished the aim of being a good buddy cop action comedy after all,but the tone and the humor put it in another level. This will be a classic buddy comedy in the future, who puts people seeing tatum and hill acting like a couple the whole time, and it works all the way. Plus, even though i thought predictable but i understand, the ice cube scene in the lunch is simply epic. I loved every second of it. <br/><br/>I really think this was one of the best of 2014. And one of the rare cases where the sequel gets better. I just hope the third chapter will be not much inferior to this. Don't think they will achieve greatness again. I hope I'm wrong. 2"

","Not always repeat the same formula takes to achieve equal results. Not the case 22 Jump Street, Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill managed keep the comic performances of the first film and once again tear laughs with simple comedy scenes and without ado. looks like directors and writers agreed on hand at creating mood just right for all audiences. The harmony of the duo makes very light film. The actors including criticize the films of humor, its clichés and the way how scenes are produced. A good movie to see with the family, with friends and that will surely brighten any situation. The relief, if we can call it that, has everything to topple successive successes, given the lack of humor in movies today. If you keep hitting the other hand, if the actors continue with this natural harmony, Jump Street has everything to be a great franchise mood of the decade."

","This Movie was Great. It was just as funny as the first one and is a great comedy to watch with your friends or older family members. It has very mild humor and contains very few obscene clips that could be rated above pg13. 22 jump street is a great comedy to watch when at home and hanging out with friends but I wouldn't suggest watching it with strict parents or younger viewers. This movie like the first one also has a life lesson planted into that without friends by your side it will be very hard to achieve what you want and it also shows that you should forgive and forget.<br/><br/>."
"InMyHonestOpinion","7","1","3","26 December 2014"," Can this combination work again?
","I have said time and time again I find it so hard to write a review for comedies, not sure why but it's always something I find difficult to do. Then again you get solid chemistry between the two leads and what's left to write. Only seeing the first film 21 Jump Street not long ago I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it, I actually refused to see it originally because it had turned one of my favourite TV shows of my much younger days into a comedy starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum I can honestly say only the worst things ran through my mind prior to watching it. So if you haven't seen the first film my recommendation would be to see it before seeing this one, a lot of old humour is used in situations like the fact only one year later and they had to move across the road to another abandoned church. There is so much in the film that kept my laugh on, I giggled and believe I even snorted in some scenes but in a film of this caliber would you really want anything less? So this time around now that Jenko and Schmidt have found their true calling once again they are sent to a school this time being a college where they need to discover who is selling the on campus drug whyphy by going undercover and taking up their alter egos a brother combo once again Greg and Morton. Chaos ensues and what turns out to be the easiest crime ever for the duo turns out to be a battle of new friendships and old ones dying out. Throughout the film the laughs just keep coming, perfectly timed humour makes this film work for all the right reasons. Some of the humour was so left of field but it all worked, whether it was stupid fall over and can't get up jokes or poking fun with cameos from another era, it all just worked and really well. I have never been a big Jonah Hill fan but he's up there for me now as well at Tatum not to mention their co-stars that fit like nice slices of pie into the combination. Ice cube being the main one, he plays the detective so well and so perfectly. Definitely a must see for my liking."
"Saiph90","2","1","3","26 December 2014"," Boring
","This is a really boring movie, we watched it at home and after about 10 minutes started to talk through it, I never watched Jump21 street so I guess I missed out on some of the in jokes. Reading other reviews apparently this is a verbatim reproduction of the first film. I laughed once or twice but then again I laugh more at what people say at work. Plot seems a bit stretched and for unfunny lines we will shout them because that makes it funny. I except films and the actions of the actors will not be a mirror of real life as they would be even more boring as films but this seems to an absurd concept, I am from England so don't have a full knowledge of the American education system but sending what appears to be two blokes in their 30's back to school to be undercover police just does not work and then so fat small one copping off with a fit college girl is even more odd. Tatum Channing spends the film looking being bored or hacked off. This is one boring, unfunny movie."
"BeneCumb","7","1","3","21 December 2014"," Uneven, but with several giggling moments
","I am not much into dumb-dumber or nerd-cutie type of movies, but from time to time I let myself into this world as well - for comparison, to keep up with the times etc. In this context, the movie in question is an annoying example, rather OK, with several references to famous related movies and sneering at clichés. Thus, the story is ""over the spindle"" and one might get tired - unless your attitude is easy-going. The events pass smoothly, there are some nice character actors included (Peter Stormare and Ice Cube, above all), and the post-ending (in parallel with credits) is distinct, probably the best and funniest part of the movie. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a good chemistry between them, female characters are less elaborated and the actresses less to my taste.<br/><br/>All in all, not bad, quite an okay entertainment; no brilliancy, but no flop either. However, people seeking profundity should give it a miss."
"brchthethird","7","1","3","12 December 2014"," More of the same, but still a good time
","Even though this is essentially the same movie as the first, there is enough meta-humor and self-awareness that you almost don't notice how derivative it is. This time Jenko and Schmidt are off to college to find the dealer/supplier for another synthetic drug (WHY-PHY) and have relationship hiccups along the way. All of the best parts of the first movie are back. There's more of Ice Cube's Captain Dickson, Jenko's non-sequiturs and Schmidt's awkward rambling. The two standout parts of the film are a brunch scene with an awesome cameo and the end credits. Still, I didn't think that it was as funny as the first one. As far as acting goes, everyone did a good job, although Channing Tatum and Ice Cube come off looking better than the rest of the cast. When it's all said and done, fans of the first one will enjoy this a lot and others need not apply."
"conlop03","9","1","3","11 December 2014"," Breaks down my opinion of this movie
","Back to Jump Street<br/><br/>Comedy and action is always a great combo, especially for a college kid such as myself. If you like explosions and laughing until your head falls off, then 22 Jump Street is a movie that you will enjoy. This movie has all sorts of action like shootouts, football, car chases, and fist fights as well as hilarious jokes and other hysterical scenes that you don't see coming. In this review I will be leaking a few jokes and explaining why I think it is a good movie for younger people.<br/><br/>In this movie Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are police officers assigned by Dickson (Ice Cube) to go undercover at a local college. They are looking for the distributors of a new drug called ""Why Phy."" During this they run into issues with their friendship, as well as issues between Schmidt and Dickson. Throughout the movie Schmidt and Jenko have to be able to work with each other to get the information they need to crack the case. The ending of this movie is during spring break and has a surprising twist that I did not see coming. The main characters are played by two completely different types of actors. You have Channing Tatum, a fit actor who all of the ladies want and then you have Jonah Hill, an out of shape comedian/actor seen in a lot of funny movies such as: This is the End, Wolf on Wall Street, and Superbad. With these two different actors, surprisingly they combine to bring a hysterical sequel to 21 Jump Street. The character I wanted to see more of was Rooster played by Jimmy Tatro. This name might not be familiar but he is famous on YouTube. He is also a comedian and has been seen on Grownups 2 as a high school jerk who makes the main characters in that movie jump off a cliff into a lake naked in front of a bunch of people. I enjoyed the acting in this movie and thought almost everyone in it played their roles well.<br/><br/>Another reason college students would enjoy this movie is because they can relate to the setting; as we know, it is set on a college campus. The first film, 21 Jump Street, was set in high school; I was in high school at the time and was therefore able to relate to it well. Because I was in high school when it came out it is my personal favorite of the two movies. Both would be very easy for a student to enjoy, especially if you just graduated from high school, because of the timing of both of them coming out at a point of transition from high school to college.<br/><br/>The jokes and funny scenes of this movie are by far the main reason why I enjoyed it. Jenko and Schmidt are self-conscious about students thinking they are cops, and Schmidt unknowingly has sex with Dickson's daughter. Schmidt and Dickson's daughter met at a poetry slam club. Later that night they hooked up, and Schmidt went back to Jump Street and bragged to Dickson about how he got laid the previous night. The funniest scenes in this movie is when Schmidt's parents come in for a family weekend at their college and that's when Dickson realizes the girl Schmidt has been bragging about having sex with was his daughter. During the family dinner, Dickson is sitting across from Schmidt and evil eyes him the entire time. Then when Dickson gets food he asks for peas and the server puts two peas on his plate. Dickson really gets furious and starts screaming what he likes and doesn't like while he is throwing the food around. In the end scene he drop kicks the flower pot. During this two minute scene I caught a cramp from laughing so hard. <br/><br/>If you are looking for about two hours to kill, I strongly recommend you watch this movie. You will be laughing the whole time, and possibly catch an unexpected cramp like I did. From the humor to the quality of acting I would rate this movie a 9 out of 10. Even though the first movie I think was slightly better, this movie can definitely compete with it."
"themightyservo","8","1","3","9 December 2014"," Surprisingly Sharp, With Theater & Film In-Jokes
","I didn't go in expecting much out of this, but was very pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The plot itself is pretty simple, the acting seems to be done by a cast that was really enjoying itself (Tatum as a jock really isn't a stretch), most of the bad jokes are at least grin-worthy, and there are a handful of really, really good in-jokes, as well as a lot of poking fun at the idea of sequels.<br/><br/>Specifically, there was one theater/storytelling reference used in the early-middle of the movie that struck me as genius. The people I watched the movie with who weren't even superficially familiar with theater/storytelling terms didn't catch it, but for those who do, it's great.<br/><br/>By that itself, it has the clichéd ""something for everyone"". Dumb humor, smart humor, and subtle humor - the latter two of which were unexpected.<br/><br/>It's got some dumb elements, but it's a comedy, and the handful of scenes that are bad thankfully don't drag. The end drags a bit, but not so much that it's aggravating.<br/><br/>Overall worth seeing, and fun... something I did not expect to write about it at all."
"stwasome","8","1","3","25 November 2014"," best comedy sequel
","If you enjoyed the first one then you shouldn't have a problem with this one. You actually might find this one more enjoyable. Why; well because it does everything right for a sequel, and like the first movie it even mocks it. This is what I love about these movies, they know what they are, and they acknowledge it. They do this through out the movie.<br/><br/>Another thing this movie does great is dialogue. The dialogue between Channing, and Jonah is really good. Most that's do to the twos chemistry on screen. Chemistry is important in these kinds of movies; because without it you wouldn't have a great buddy cop movie. This is why I think the jump street movies are two of the greatest buddy cop movies made.<br/><br/>This is a must see for all the fans of the first movie, and stay for the credits, that's probably the greatest part of the movie."

","The unlikely couple of crime busters--eye-candy, slow-witted Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) and awkward, insecure, pudgy Morton Schultz (Jonah Hill) are back again on the screen in 22 Jump Street.<br/><br/>Economics dictated a sequel to the 2012 21Jump Street, which grossed worldwide $201,585,328, on an investment of $42m, a fivefold return on a dollar committed tot the film!. Unlikely as it seemed, the film turned out to be not only a critical success, but also brought in a high return on investment for Columbia Studios, and acclaim to co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.<br/><br/>Co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller caught a falling star in 21 Jump Street that has never allowed the budding career of Johnny Depp never to fade from public view. On a rainy night, they seized that star to that transmuted an inane teenage cope show into a zany comedy that surprised Columbia Studios turned out to be a runaway commercial bonanza.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street's magic bullet struck a rich vein in the pairing of Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, as a pair of clumsy crime busters, who go undercover as high-school students, to break up a gang of drug dealers, that delighted critics and greatly pleased the public.<br/><br/>Lord and Miller effectively played mockingly off the Odd Couple formula of brawn and brains. Call it a bromance--with louche undertones--ludicrously clownish, that each actor's strength infused in an obvious police story with comic incongruity.<br/><br/>It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that a sequel was on the boards in 22 Jump Street. Writers simply had to dust off a formula and voila! Jenko and Schulz are off to college for another drug bust. The ""boys"" are visibly too old to fit into a student body, born for the most part in the 1990s. But we are at the movies where the art of the screen is to suspend belief; we are willing to do so since visions of 21 Jump Street dance in our heads.<br/><br/>And the shekels followed into the coffers to the tune of $253,426,687 worldwide and counting a month after 22 Jump Street premiered, on a$50m investment, turning it into another blockbuster.<br/><br/>And yet, the script monkeyed with a winning formula,by momentarily isolating Jenko from Schultz. Suddenly, manic, depressive Schultz becomes the lothario, a hero capable of seducing women. And here the film goes off the rails straining violently our disposition to believe too readily in Jonah Hill's acting. He is not funny, he is, to put it bluntly, rather pathetic and boorish.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Jenko is sent to the locker room with its heavy, sweaty odor of the homoerotic. By exiling Channing Tatum to jock paradise, his zestful, generous side that in 21 Jump Street made Hill look better than he actually was simply disappears form view.<br/><br/>Lord and Miller, for too long a moment, sacrificed the comic physicality of Tatum which recalls, the young Jean-Paul Belmondo and the middle-aged Jean Marais, as he performs his own stunts.<br/><br/>Jenko has, thanks to a class in human sexuality, a sudden realization of how much words can hurt. At a fleeting, amusing encounter with The Ghost (Peter Stormare), the drug king pin, before he bashes him in the head with his football helmet, he gives him a quick lesson why ""faggot"" is unsuitable to call someone who is ""gay"" or ""queer"" or ""LGBT."" (As an aside, here real life imitates the cinematic art: Jonah Hill hurled a gay slur at a paparazzo, and on late-night television shows, he had to strike his breast to acknowledge his personal error of judgment.) Feeling that 22 Jump Street was on the brink of a giant yawn, the screenwriters, perhaps, came belatedly to their senses, and reunited our odd couple, since the sequel desperately was in need of the strengths of one and the other.<br/><br/>A shout out to pokerfaced Jillian Bell as Mercedes who spots Schultz for what and who she is, almost steals the film, as the brains behind the drug network.<br/><br/>Once back on the track, 22 Jump Street finds new energy, yet the final sequences of events strains the conceit that Jonah Hill has Captain Marvel heroic abilities. Sadly ,once more, Channing Tatum is sacrificed to the myopic vision of the script.<br/><br/>Rest assured moviegoer, even Lord and Miller know that the cash cow 22 Jump Street is has run dry, and no 23 Jump Street is in the works. The last 15-minutes of film tells us so as in a Dadaesque moment, remarked by nonsense, travesty and incongruity Jump Street in hedge-fund algorithmic fashion is projected out to 2047 with the ""ever youthful"" Jenko and Schultz as doctors, lawyers, scientists and the like continue in the self-mocking spirit that made 21 Jump Street runaway success it was."

The undercover division is under a new name though, rent is expensive and Korean Jesus is popping so the department moves across the road to 22 Jump Street and embraces another Jesus.<br/><br/>Otherwise, take 21 Jump Street, ctrl+C, ctrl+V and voila the film 22 Jump Street is here. Do not worry though, this is not your stereotypical second film in a franchise. Actually, that is a blatant lie, and that is what makes this film so much fun. Writers Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman take the stale premise of a sequel and rev it up to an eleven and run with it full force.<br/><br/>The story plays up the justifiably cringe worthy potential in the film and mocks it with a meta tone that audiences should recognize and enjoy. 22 Jump Street manages to do all the things a bad sequel accomplishes but it is fresh, funny, original and entertaining. There were plenty of moments where the audience I was viewing the film with literally screamed at the screen from shock and absorption.<br/><br/>I watched this film when I was in desperate need to get lost in an entertaining movie where I could laugh. I got far more than I could have bargained for. Ice Cube is utilized to even more hilarious effect and the supporting cast somehow is just as good, if not better. Special commendation to the returning cast members and newbs The Lucas Brothers and Wyatt Russell for being enjoyable<br/><br/>22 Jump Street is laugh out loud funny and a delightful comedy that fits the bill.

"LivBrumei","7","1","3","9 November 2014"," A breath of fresh air in comedy
","About two days ago I was talking to a friend on how most comedies fail these days to deliver anything new to a viewer. They're obvious, the jokes are old and the most reasons to laugh that we get are based on stupidity. Resuming there aren't almost any comedies new in the market that are worth watching. Specially because most of them are romantic comedy which only makes it even more cliché. 21 Jump Street changed this opinion in me and made me believe that there is still hope in this field. Now the 22 version doesn't disappoint!! I love the fact on how they joke with the obvious for people watching. It's like if I watched the movie, pointed out all the clichés and then decided to remake the movie joking about it. It's great because you wouldn't see that coming, like you didn't expect them to joke about the fact that the movie is about the same as 21, so it's like they only had to repeat everything again (like many sequels do..). This is what's mainly refreshing about 22JS. That and the fact that the two main characters play very well together and make a different team from what we are used to. Even in the very end, after the plot is done, they still have something for you and it will make you laugh because of their audacity of again playing with the obvious. Very worth watching!!!"
"utgard14","6","1","3","31 October 2014"," ""Lambos are lame.""
","I had very low expectations for the 21 Jump Street movie but found it to be surprisingly good. So I looked forward to this sequel and, for the most part, I wasn't disappointed. It starts off strong but does lose some steam around the hour mark. It really should have been ninety minutes instead of nearly two hours but no one likes to trim the fat in movies these days. Speaking of fat, ever since ""losing"" all that weight, Jonah Hill appears to be aging faster. He looks forty-five here but they wisely write that into the script. Particularly in the form of insults toward Hill from Jillian Bell. She's the funniest part of the movie, by the way. Anyway, it's a pretty good comedy. Hill and Channing Tatum both do fine. Ice Cube gets more to work with this time. Lots of in-jokes and self-deprecating humor to go around. If you liked the first movie, you should enjoy this one."
"Jerghal","6","1","3","26 October 2014"," Starts out okay...
","I had been warned about this film. It did start out okay with self-reflecting jokes about it being the same as the first time and stuff and them looking like narcs in college. But then they go off into these awkward scenes that go on way too long like most American comedies seem to do these days (the Heat etc.). Same can be said about the film itself: Do we really need it to be 112 mins? It could have been easily cut down to 85 or 90 mins. I never liked Jonah Hill but after 'The Wolf of Wall street' he was scoring points. Points he lost completely after this flick! I'm back to hating him again. Tatum plays the dumb guy, but they lay it on way too thick (Cate Blanchet / Carte Blanche joke? Give me a break). A shorter film with a better script and better written comedy would have been a lot more enjoyable. I did laugh at the 'Mercedes' character who keeps insulting Jonah Hill on him looking old. Judging by the credits I would think they didn't plan a sequel but I quickly checked on IMDb and there it is: 23 jump street. Get ready for tons more lame and awkward comedy, ye be warned ;)"

","No doubt it's a good laugh. Jonah Hill was awesome as usual. Channing Tatum was annoying. I like this movie. It's a nice movie. It's worth a watch. 22 Jump Street is successful in Box Office and under critics pen. That says it all. Watch it, pass a good 2 hours.<br/><br/>That being said. It felt like same as 21 Jump Street. The plot was similar, the dialogs were similar, the sub plots were similar. But they've managed to execute the idea successfully. That is something I can't ignore. But if they plan to move forward with the same idea in near future, I guarantee they'll fail. So move one people.<br/><br/>And last thing I'd like to mention, they credit scene was probably the one of the best credit scene I've watched. It is crazy guys.<br/><br/>My final verdict: 71%. It's damn good comedy movie, probably a good movie in general. But this s*** is getting old."
"sohansurag","7","1","3","15 September 2014"," A Little Less Original, A Whole lotta Fun!
","Schmidt and Jenko's back and if you thought this is gonna go exactly like that previous reboot, you are oh so right! 21 Jump Street, as I had previously stated, had me in splits, it was one of those movies that genuinely tickled my funny bone. While the 1987 TV show that it was based on was a bit serious and had little humor, the reboot starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was made to be screamingly hilarious. Thanks to the directors duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who also bestowed upon us the brilliant Lego Movie this year, 22 Jump Street is on the same page as 21 Jump Street. It is the same 21 Jump Street formula, rinsed and repeated and the directors takes a jab at it every chance they get and that's exactly why it works.<br/><br/>After the successful bust of the high school drug circle in 21 Jump Street, Schmidt and Jenko is sent to college this time to investigate another drug case. Its the same thing all over again but it works out well promising truck loads of fun. The directors addresses this as a sequel-sequel to 21 Jump Street and does almost everything that made the original a terrific comedy. Much of the 80s nostalgic moments from the original is missing here instead the role reversal works out again, this time in favor of Jenko. Even the investigation plays out pretty much same with us as the audiences trying to guess and figure out the whodunnit mystery. Familiar faces pop up here and there and we get hooked on thinking they'd be the culprit, without spoiling anything I'd like to add that the movie does the job fairly well. But of course you are not here to watch a perfect thriller, you are here for the same awkward, goofy moments and NSFW fun from the original and you get that served in plenty.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum once again shines through as the undercover duo and a lot of bromance is to be found here. They still carries on their terrific chemistry from 21 Jump Street and keeps em coming till end. Even Ice Cube gets extended sequences here and a particular scene with him and Hill was particularly uproarious. On the downside though, I'd say Peter Stormare's screen time wasn't up to the mark, the same goes for the female leads which weren't as compelling as 21 Jump Streets'.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street was Pure Comic Gold, and 22 Jump Street is no different. While the first cracked me up, 22 Jump Street still managed to crack me up if not as much as the original. The comedy might not be as hard hitting as 21, many of the sequences may not work as much as the original but 22 Jump Street is still hilarious and if you loved 21 Jump Street you'll be right at home with this one.

","A torrid weekend, the best recreation is a cinema getaway in the local multiplex, the options are paltry, having no slightest interest in the fourth TRANSFORMERS juggernaut, I have to choose between two sequels, HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON 2 or this one, it is a tough choice, I enjoyed HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON (2010, 8/10) thoroughly, but due to a recent impassivity towards animations, eventually I opt for the latter albeit I have yet watched its predecessor, a Hollywood comedy might be the elixir to quench the summer lethargy.<br/><br/>After their debut animation CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS (2009), director duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller went in for revive the popular 80s undercover policemen series 21 JUMP STREET (1987-1991) on the big screen, and it was a box-office hoot in 2012, two years later, the sequel arrives, the odd pair Hill and Tatum go to college this time! <br/><br/>School days are mostly stupid in retrospect, drugs, parties, sports and hormone-driven sex adventures, one must be glad to finally get over with them, thus, understandably the main arc of the story is the à la mode bromance between Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum), conceivably an impending fissure is magnified by Jenko's jock popularity in the fraternity and Schmidt's contrasting nerdy awkwardness. The investigation to unearth the WhyPhy (a new campus- permeating drug) dealer are considerably short-circuited by incessant japes and bro-bonding- or-clashing set pieces which are functionally devised without resorting to the low-end and cringe-worthy lavatorial jokes. A time-tested one is the classic unintentionally sleeping with your boss' daughter and the romance benefit falls upon on Schmidt, he meets the art student Maya (Stevens) and competently justifies ""nerds are the new sexy"", until a raging Ice Cube stereotypically break them up. Meanwhile Jenko has a more conventional male-bonding with fellow football jock Zook (Russell) with an unspecified undertone comes close to a fantasy for more trendy interest, along with many bold gay-related insinuations. <br/><br/>It is scintillating to witness a not-over-stagy let-go-and-reunite plot mingles with two partners certainly care for each other where sexuality is irrelevant. The natural bond is authentic, which is the only thing matters. Tatum grandstands in the mandatory action sequences with Hill's rib- tickling unwieldiness, but villains are carelessly characterized, up to the moment when they fall prey to utter triviality and deprive of any sense of being other than their default duty. <br/><br/>During the ending-credits, a deluge of mock-sequels pokes fun of industry's franchise over- exploitation, and this year earlier, the Lord-Miller pair has already stunned the world with their money-making bulldozer THE LEGO MOVIE (2014), a new profitable product-line awaits a follow-up, so with two smash golden bowls in their hands, 23 JUMP STREET might come to its fruition behind the usual two-year schedule, or perhaps 22 is also a wonderful number to leave our perky memory unsoiled."

","22 Jump Street is an action comedy that is a sequel to film 21 Jump Street,based on the television series of the same name.It stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum together with the beauteous Amber Stevens,Jillian Bell and Ice Cube.After their success in the 21 Jump Street program,Schmidt and Jenko are back on the streets once again in pursuit of drug dealers led by Ghost.However,they fail once again in their mission that Deputy Chief Hardy puts them back into the program now known as 22 Jump Street headed by Captain Dickson.Their new assignment to go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as ""WHYPHY"".This sequel is written by Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, and Rodney Rothman; and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller.<br/><br/>Jenko and Schmidt go deep undercover at a local college to locate the supplier of ""WHYPHY"".Jenko meets a kindred spirit on the football team while Schmidt infiltrates the bohemian art major scene.As they try to solve the case,their partnership becomes an issue as maturity and their transformation from young looking men into real men as undercover college students.Also coming into the picture is Jenko's relationship with Maya,who unknowingly happens to be Captain Dickinson's daughter.<br/><br/>Just like the predecessor,Hill and Tatum manage to make their characters appealing and entertaining.Their odd partnership - one being a nerd and the other being idiot/athletic - still provides a lot of fun as it remains refreshing and entertaining.They were able to provide added new vibe to their relationship that the viewer will find compelling.In addition to that,it is a funnier comedy as the sequel did not fall into the trap of relying on the previous elements of the predecessor that made it successful.What made it better is that it managed to made fun of its lack of creativity and despite the fact that its humor is mostly slapstick,crude and sexual, it does not suffer from lack of intelligence.Overall,it is even funnier and better than its predecessor. No wonder 23 Jump Street is in development while this review is being written."
"cfisherjr","3","1","4","14 December 2014"," waste of time
","I kept fast forwarding until at least the half way point before it stopped being too stupid or boring. The rest of if was sophomoric at best. The gratuitous swearing by the Captain was indicative of the rather juvenile scripting. It'll be tough to write ten lines of text without getting down to the movie's level of vapid spew or sleep inducing text. I realize this is not an Oscar level piece of film, but they could have at least done a better job of it. This makes Mall Cop and Furry Vengeance look like a Masterpiece Theater offering. The basic story line of mismatched partners doing undercover work to catch the bad guys is a well proved armature to hang your script on. Too bad they made theirs out of used tissue causing it to collapse right from the start."

","After one of Schmidt and Jenko's missions go awry, they are sent back to Jump Street to once again go undercover and find out who is selling drugs. <br/><br/>But this time they are sent to college to investigate the drug problem and have only one lead on who it is. <br/><br/>Schmidt and Jenko's relationship is tested when Jenko is brought back on the cool side while Schmidt hangs out with a girl named Maya. <br/><br/>At the same time they must decide if they can keep there relationship together as friends, or as cops......<br/><br/>If there was a written rule about sequels having to be bigger, louder, and more over the top than its predecessor,then this would get full marks. If it was only a little self aware, then it wouldn't do the film justice, because,mew didn't really need a sequel.<br/><br/>But no, Lord and Miller go stupidly over the top with references and self awareness, and it makes the film into one of the funniest of the year. Writing is brilliant, and like I said the references are so blatant, you cannot help but laugh, but its Tatum that makes the movie.<br/><br/>He's usually the straight guy in his movies, but wow, he really gives it his all, and totally wipes Hill off the screen. If it wasn't for Hill doing the same thing over and over and over again, he would be funny, but he does the same thing here he does in every film, and it's getting tiresome, thin or heavy.<br/><br/>But thankfully it doesn't deter you from the rest of the film, and even though he is in the films funniest scene, its Ice Cubes expression that makes that scene.<br/><br/>So all in all, its a silly comedy, that knows its silly, isn't shy to be silly, and you'll be laughing like a silly child all the way through.<br/><br/>Just the tonic to put on when your feeling a little under the weather."
"TyJustice","8","1","4","29 November 2014"," Excellent movie, definitely worth your time to check it out.
","It's literally non-stop laughter from the beginning. I can safely say out of all the comedies I've seen this year, this one's the only one that made me struggle to contain my laughter throughout the entire duration.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are the dynamic duo of comedy and are written to play off each other perfectly. Nick Offerman as a sarcastic, pessimistic police chief also makes for a relatable, laughable experience.<br/><br/>The story is where the movie falls short, it feels more like an account of all the wacky antics Schmidt and Jenko embark on during an undercover assignment rather than actually focusing on the task at hand. In other words, it relies too much on funny subplots to make the movie good, the thing is though, it works. Despite the issue stated, the humour makes this movie one of the best I've seen in 2014."
"Iron_Knight","7","1","4","26 November 2014"," It's funny-Except for the Gay Jokes
","22 Jump Street is a wild fun comedy that is just as good as its predecessor. Around the beginning they make several fourth wall movie jokes in like under 5 minutes, which I thought was really funny. Most of the jokes are kind of predictable but they're still funny and there are some that will surprise you--Except for the gay jokes. The gay jokes are so bad! They aren't a offensive (luckily) but they still aren't that funny! I don't know why these movies think they need to put in a gay joke we all know is going to be an awkward misunderstanding for BJ. Well aside from that, it's a fun flick. Not the best,but totally not a waste of money."
"priyantha-bandara","8","1","4","2 November 2014"," Improved from the previous
","I honestly don't think that this movie requires any introduction to any of you who are fans of Hollywood comedies. This is the second installment of one of the most successful and talked about comedy 21 Jump Street back in 2012. And this is clearly an improvement to the sequel and seldom have we got to witness a comedy that evolves for better. While the story is almost the same to the previous one just as the movie want it to be the clear new addition is the emotional bond that hilarious lead duo fantastically portray.<br/><br/>Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) is back with a new assignment to bust some emerging new drug by going undercover in college. But when Jenko accidentally joins the college football team and meets up new guys to hang out with Schmidt finds himself left out. To make things worse his new found college girlfriend's family becomes hostile.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street is filled with belly tickling humor. And they come in most strange place with most strange disguises and sometimes it takes a while to stop laughing. But for any who have seeing the previous movie this is no surprise and it's exactly what they would require. This time the movie goes a bit further and brings in some action comedy to fit the bill along with extended college comedy. Clearly the undercover investigation is bigger and the bad guys too that bring in a grand showdown at the end. Jonah and Tatum are just perfect in their roles and it's quite a surprise how such chemistry exist in between these completely opposite actors.<br/><br/>It is a must that I keep a note of the ending credits as this could be the most creative and clearly the toughest to make ending credits I can recall. It last for some time and will blow the fans away with makeup, CG and surprising guest starring."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","4","27 September 2014"," Not as great as the first, but...
","The first one was hilarious, but it also benefited from not trying to do as much. This one certainly wants to be bigger, and as a result, it comes off somewhat confused at times. There's also some mediocre moments of comedy. Mostly, though, it works like a charm, and there are some absolutely hilarious moments sprinkled here, many times hitting higher heights than the first. Hill and Tatum are still basically their old selves and it works, even if I enjoyed Tatum in the first more. Ice Cube's act was great in the first, but it gets old really quick here. I wouldn't mind if he was replaced in the third film. Overall, still really good entertainment."
"CrisMovieCorner","8","1","4","24 August 2014"," Equally as good as the first!
","Not going to jump on the hype, I will be straight up honest none of the trailers done it for me, just felt like recycled jokes from the first and an unneeded sequel. So now you know my thoughts going in, here is my ""review"" I guess.<br/><br/>So here we are round two in a franchise, a franchise in my eyes I couldn't see progressing after the first, not that I didn't enjoy the first it was a surprisingly enjoyable watch so I was worried about the second. You know sequels usually don't live up and Comedy sequels in recent years have been extremely poor ""The Hangover Part II & III"" spring to mind quicker than you can say ""Why was Justin Bartha even in it?"". There it is a sequel to a reboot of a TV Series, wow who'd have thought it ha. The first was a shockingly good success, which now a days means they have to make a sequel.<br/><br/>It is a very stupid concept to stick to your formula to an exact, however the guys behind the success of 21 decided to stick with it even with their bigger budget, however the big budget didn't get to their heads they stayed true to their nob gags, slapstick and the fact Jenko (Tatum) is a few bullets short of a full clip. All we truly care about with a film like this is over the top action, the Comedy that borders on idiotic and enjoyable characters, so three ticks there.<br/><br/>However, plot is one of the last things you care about when watching a film of this calibre. That being said here is a brief outline without giving away to much. The film revolves around Jenko and Schmidt trying to track down the latest drug craze sweeping the school scene (of wait we're in college now) WHY-FHY, huge over lying element is the dealer may be Jenko's new best bud Zook (Russell). This time around we get to see Jenko in his element like, while Schmidt is swimming in the deep waters fearing their border line homoerotic bromance is over.<br/><br/>Tatum and Hill have a brilliant on screen relationship, from the get go their on screen presence is as good as it was in 21 along with a barrage of self-referential humour from Jenko joking about protecting the White House to pretty much EVERYTHING Deputy Chief Hardy (Offerman) says. However, Tatum and Hill aren't the only ones on top of their game in the film, every scene that Ice Cube has playing Captain Dickson he steals and makes his own, so many times do you forget how insanely funny his character is when he gets angry and this time around he is even angrier.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is so much better than I expected I went in expecting one or two laughs here or there boy was I wrong I laughed pretty much the whole way through. You will be in pain from pure laughter, however I do have one complaint and that is the film is a bit too long, just as you finally feel like it's dragging there is a truly incredible credits scene that will make the dragging feeling disappear in an instance. I've seen some fellow reviewers saying ""bigger AND better"" however, in my honest opinion, bigger doesn't always mean better, they should be saying ""bigger yet equally as funny""."
"AlejoSoler","5","1","4","16 August 2014"," Absolutely Nothing New
","In this sequel of the television series, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum bring on Schmidt and Jenko all over again but this time they don't go to high school but to college. Watching this new movie makes you feel you are watching the same first movie all over again. You get to listen to the same lame jokes and the same lame performances as the try to catch again a drug dealer and it's boss.<br/><br/>I guess the only interesting thing about this movie could be the 5 second appearance of Richard Grieco as Booker in the last minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Don't expect to see anything new, and don't waste your money at a cinema. Wait for it to be on television if you can. I can't understand how can it be so highly scored in IMDb"

In the case of 22 Jump Street it's good to report that this is the case. The two leads Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have great chemistry and are very watchable.<br/><br/>This time Shchmidt and Jenko go to college for their undercover operation to track down the murder of a college student which is believed to be drug related.

"advaitkamat","6","1","4","10 July 2014"," Lackluster as a sequel, a hoot as a film.
","Rejoice. The thickheads are back to their old bumbling selves. Or are they?<br/><br/>The inherent beauty of watching a movie is to walk into it with the notion that it won't be good and the trip is nothing but a mammoth waste of time, but it unexpectedly sweeps you off your feet. That's what happened with me with ""21 Jump Street.""<br/><br/>Sadly, that's not the case with ""22 Jump Street."" Not by a mile.<br/><br/>That's not to say it is a bad film, no, but unless you relish bon mots carefully placed between squishy sentimentality, there is no way this will add up to be the kind of film its predecessor was. ""21 Jump Street"" was an enormously goofy film that had a unique plot with the kind of tart humor that at times surpassed acceptable standards. That was what made it a film I kept going back to, starving for more of that hilarity seamlessly blended with great chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. With ""22 Jump Street,"" we get the exact same plot as before - and we know this because the characters keep repeating how similar it all is to 'the last time' - but none of it is even mildly astounding. Sure, one or two gags strewn casually over some scenes crack you up, but it lacks the twists that made its predecessor a risqué but entertaining ride.<br/><br/>However, not all of it skids. The argument could be made that ""22 Jump Street"" is more heartfelt, more realized as a 'buddy-cop' film, with a more intricate plot to work with. The humor is squeaky clean this time around too, making it more accessible to its target audience, but for a staunch fan of the first film like me, this was a major negative. I don't associate clean humor with the franchise, that simply kills the intention, you see. But that's just an essential for me.<br/><br/>The element that impressed me the most was the film's willingness to laugh at itself, its characters - a few of them could have been done away with though - and the gimmicks it throws up. It features one of the most comical brawls I have seen in the movies recently, and more of Ice Cube's priceless tirades. It's a sequel so aware of the responsibilities it is shouldering that it sticks to the old formulas like moth to a flame, and the clichés it does well. Really well. <br/><br/>I didn't expect ""22 Jump Street"" to be a perfect film by any standard, but my expectations were right through the roof. It needed its characters to be more fleshed out, more detailed, its plot a bit more incisive and it could have hit the spot beautifully. But what I saw was a film desperate to keep up with my patience that was fast vaporizing. Strip the film of the unnecessaries and you would get the sequel I had envisioned. And that includes the disposable bit of Schmidt's love interest. Come on, what purpose did Amber Stevens serve to the plot eventually? Zilch.<br/><br/>In one of the scenes, there is an indication of a ""23 Jump Street"" coming up next. I shall wait. But I do hope that it will be more like the first than the second. So do the audience who watched it with me in the theaters. I reckon they weren't too amused either."
"scottjohnson7896","8","1","4","2 July 2014"," It Knows What It Is, and That's OK (Raging FIlm Reviews)
","Much like The Hangover and its not so great sequel, The Hangover Part 2, 21 Jump Street decided that it was going to stick to the same formula for its sequel, but instead of high school, they were going to go to college. Like The Hangover, they took most of the major plot points and humor and changed the location. This did not work for The Hangover, but it certainly worked for 22 Jump Street. Why, you ask? Because the movie acknowledges it multiple times throughout, sometimes giving us a big (purposefully funny) middle finger saying, ""We know this is the same movie, so let's have some fun with it,"" and it totally works, making this one of the funniest movies of the year.<br/><br/>It is clear that the writers probably intend this to be the final film in this little series. With so many cheeky references to, ""the same plot"" and ""Just solve the case like last time,"" it is pretty indicative that either they are ending the series, or taking it somewhere entirely different in 23 Jump Street (it is referenced comically in this movie). It is also clear that the writers wanted to infuse as many film references into this movie as possible. From Annie Hall, to Channing Tatum saying they should be Secret Agents for the White House (an obvious reference to his White House Down role), the references are all funny. The movie tries to balance old jokes with new, which results in some very funny memories and sometimes blatant repetition.<br/><br/>Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are a comedic dream-team. The chemistry they share and their great comedic timing gives us constant belly-aching laughter. I do not want to mention any of the other jokes that aren't in the trailer because they need to be seen first and not told secondhand. They are supported by a bigger role from Ice Cube, a plethora of cameos (which work only part of the time), and a new cast of people who are pretty darned good. Wyatt Russell, who really has not done anything other than a couple episodes of The Walking Dead plays Zook, Tatum's new best friend in the film. Their scenes are great together. Also joining is Amber Stevens, the girl who Hill falls for after just one night together, and Jillian Bell, most notable from her role on Workaholics, plays the rude and bitter Mercedes.<br/><br/>As I have said before, the plot is essentially the same. There are times when it drags on just a tad too long, and the jokes have appeared to be all used up. It comes to an entirely all too quick end though, which does come off as a bit rushed compared to the rest of the movie. Yet in the end it still makes you laugh. I think that it will be pretty polarizing, whether you love it even though it's the same or hate it because of that same reason.<br/><br/>In the end, 22 Jump Street stands tall with its predecessor. It is imbued with enough new jokes and references to the first one and knows exactly what it is trying to be without trying to pass it off as a whole new movie with the same plot while still acting like it's completely original. If you loved 21 Jump Street you will surely not be disappointed, and even if you haven't seen the first one, it is essentially the same and you get a ""Previously on"" at the beginning of the film. 22 Jump Street is hilariously gut-busting, go check it out if you're in need of a chuckle.<br/><br/>P.S.

The on screen chemistry between Hill and Tatum blends into a smooth picture (pitcher) of tequila margaritas; feels so good going down and then you wonder what happened (in this film) when you wake up in the morning with a 'rufie' hangover. The concept of a ""canned formula"" is taken to extremes, you'll see concerns about filmmaking budget, chase scenes, and special effects {SFX.} A totally new partnership with Tatum and Russell (Zook) takes the jocks into a new Bromance level.

Here's are some of the highlights. In one of the scenes, Maya(Stevens) and Smidt are together siting peacefully. Maya is doing an Art's Major. They are in front of two Stone Structures against each other. She stats simply that a person could be leaning against the other person for ""Support"". I found that quite light heart warming. Another quote whereby Smidt was saying to Jenko when the two were apart, there friendship and partnership was heavenly and severely tested, Smidt describes himself as the ""flower grew out of the seed"". I found it to be of interest and quite euphoric. However, Gays and LGBTs communitys and citizens will be very happy that my precious hottie Tatum, I'm referring to btw. haahah, stood up for the LGBT when he states ""Man, its 2014,"" HE continued to saying That ""Homosexual is OK, Gay is OK, etc., Tatum was referring to a scene when he was accused of being a ""faggot"".

It is like with anything that the critics or the audience could have used to make fun of the movie or rate it down, they did it themselves first which is quite smart since it does not leave any room for those comments really.

And this time Channing Tatum thinks he wants to leave the force to stay in college, whereas in the first one Jonah Hill wants to leave the force.<br/><br/>Funny parts are few and far between, now that I think about it."

","22 Jump Street (August 2014) A sequel to the movie 21 Jump street, 22 Jump street is a no brainer yet highly entertaining movie. The dynamic duo of unlikely cops Shmidt(Jonah Hill) and Jenko(Channing Tatum) sets the stage ablaze with their rib- tickling antics. Their sizzling chemistry and bromance is the highlight of the movie and creates several comical and amusing situations with events constantly testing their relationship. Shmidt in particular takes the hilariousness of the movie to a whole new level constantly making the audience burst out with laughter with his childishly innocent acts. Script wise the movie is very similar to it's prequel 21 Jump street with the lead pair sent into college as under- cover cops to unravel the drug cartel operating in the college selling the dangerous drug ""Whyphy"". Captain Dickson(Ice Cube) playing the not-so-cop-like Mission chief and the deceivingly innocent Mercedes(Jillian Bell) add to the laugh riot by being involved in a flurry of funny situations right throughout the movie. Kudos to directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller for this amazingly directed comedy during which one just can't stop laughing. Brownie points for the ending credits which give us a glimpse of what to expect from the franchise in the upcoming years and ensures that the movie is entertaining to the very hilt right till the end."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","5","26 July 2014"," Pulls off the near-impossible feat of being as good as the first
","The mystery of making a great comedy sequel has been solved. The catch? Now that it's been done, it can never be done again.<br/><br/>""22 Jump Street"" is on par with its predecessor. What it loses in freshness it makes up for with sheer wit. The first movie was a genre sendup nothing short of genius, and Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill, who whipped up the first film's story, have gone all in on the sequel: no, not bigger and crazier, but more tongue-in-cheek and self-aware.<br/><br/>If directors Christopher Miller and Phil Lord (""21 Jump Street,"" ""The LEGO Movie,"" ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"") hadn't earned carte blanche already, making one of the only good comedy sequels of all time will. This feat is so hard to achieve, it arguably warrants ""22 Jump Street"" a perfect rating. But the reality is that the film is more of the same, it just knows it, and the filmmakers package it exceptionally well.<br/><br/>In fact, in the first self-aware scene, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are debriefed by Dep. Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) — in and of itself a replica of a scene in the first film — who tells them how their first mission was a big success, and no one expected it, so now the department is throwing more money at them in hopes of a bigger success, and he encourages them to do ""the exact same thing."" This becomes a motif of the movie, so it knowingly replicates itself. By and large this works (both actually and in the meta sense) though there are slow parts in the beginning.<br/><br/>Essentially, as promised at the end of the first movie, Schmidt and Jenko have to go undercover at a college to find yet another new synthetic drug. They find it a little more challenging to accomplish than last time, but ultimately they both connect with students who are connected to their only lead: Schmidt falls for an art major (Amber Stevens) while Jenko meets his twin (personality-wise) in Wyatt Russell's character, a quarterback and frat boy.<br/><br/>Of course with any comedy sequel, doing ""the exact same thing"" puts the movie at risk for getting stale. ""The Hangover: Part 2"" is a prime example of trotting out the same exact formula and failing miserably. ""22 Jump Street"" counters this problem by laughing at itself a lot and going over the top with the repetitive, familiar scenes, such as whenever Schmidt and Jenko fight with each other and go off on their own. It also stays fresh just by the extent to which it copies stuff from the first movie and does so while winking at the camera.<br/><br/>In order for this to really work, however, the foundation still has to be solid and Hill and Tatum provide that effortlessly. Their chemistry maintains interest in the story even though the story has no interest in taking itself seriously. Tatum was a secret weapon the first time around, as no one had seen him do comedy like this, but he still pulls off the meat-headed pretty boy man- child while Hill does his improvisation thing and proves why he's the class of the Judd Apatow prodigies. <br/><br/>The supporting cast doesn't add much (Ice Cube is what you'd expect) though Jillian Bell's dry deadpan evokes some Kristen Wiig before she became a star.<br/><br/>So why can't this type of comedy sequel be replicated ever again? Not every would-be comedy franchise can just make fun of itself in this meta way and poke fun at sequels in general. And the truth is that doing so was the difference-maker. Without an action scene, for example, in which the main characters are trying to outrun drug dealers in a football helmet golf cart and avoiding hitting stuff because too much wreckage will ""cost the department too much money,"" it's just a dumb chase scene. ""22 Jump Street"" would've surprised and impressed very few people without these twists. And now that the meta card has been played, it's hard to envision a third ""Jump Street"" as good as the first two. You can't just play another and surprise anyone. Perhaps that's why we get a highly amusing credits sequence at the end.<br/><br/>How nice, however, to tell that a sequel really tried to be better and conveyed that to the audience. Rather than just throw something together to take advantage of the comedy sequel cash cow, Bacall, Hill, Lord, Miller and the other screenwriters really put some intelligence into making ""22 Jump Street"" and the genre is better for it.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","Sometimes, after you've transcended the reality of physical existence; experienced two-faced deception from a companion and witnessed a 500 foot monster lay waste to the western seaboard, you're ready to sit down in front of a balls-out comedy and laugh your a** off. Enter 22 Jump Street, the latest somewhat manic creation directed by the somewhat manic Phil Lord and Chris Miller of 21 J.St., Meatballs and Lego fame. There's no rocket science going on here, but the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum carries the film, delivering belly laughs aplenty. The screenplay by Michael Bacal (Scott Pilgrim, Project X, 21 J.St.), Rodney Rothman (Grudge Match) and Oren Uziel is chock full of side references, adopting a heavily meta approach that is not new, but has never been so blatant or effective (staying through the end credits is essential). The script on its own could not carry this, and the 'waffer-thin' plot verges on insulting, but that is not the point of course, it's all about the gags and Hill & Tatum deliver these with gusto as their relationship is put under the spotlight to hilarious effect. Lord & Miller deliver a pacey, punchy film that is just plain funnier than any other comedy this year. It's perhaps a tad baggy in places and suffers slightly from a couple of gags stretching beyond the punch line (you know, that awkward moment of standing looking at each other for an instant), but this never detracts from the whole, which sweeps logic and structure aside in a glorious typhoon of uproarious laughter. Don't analyse this film, just let yourself go."

It's also the sequel to the reboot of 21 Jump Street. Is it as funny as the first? <br/><br/>Yes. Yes it is.<br/><br/>The characters of this movie are pure gold and you can't help but love every single one of them. That even includes the antagonists because nearly every person in this movie get's funny stuff to say. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum reprise their roles and do it perfectly all over again. Nearly every joke hits perfectly. Especially a scene where Jonah Hill and the antagonist are trying to fight but keep stopping to argue over what they're doing.<br/><br/>The movie follows the same story as the first one and shoves it down your throat that it's doing so. Though there is a slight twist as to who the bad guy is. Besides that it follows everything. They get to college, one is having more fun than the other, they argue, they make up, they stop the bad guy.<br/><br/>I was kinda skeptic to see this because there were lots of movie coming out that had my attention more than this one but I can say for a fact that I'm very happy I went to see this. I know I'm super late with this review but I had other stuff I wanted to see.<br/><br/>There's a scene in this movie where Ice Cube freaks out because of something Jonah Hill did during the mission that had me fighting back tears from laughing so hard.

","Honestly, this movie was much funnier than I expected. Sequels almost never pan out the way you want them to, but 22 Jump Street found its footing by making fun of itself. It was lighthearted and funny and I honestly laughed out loud. There was one moment where two characters met for the first time and they literally were talking about ""meat q-ts"" and I was the only person laughing over their meet cute.

","The sequel to the 2012 film 21 Jump Street and based on the 1987 television series of the same name, 22 Jump Street is a 2014 American action comedy film produced by and starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, scripted by Michael Bacall and Oren Uziel, from a story by Hill and Bacall, and directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. After successfully making their way through high school (twice), Officers Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are sent to college to find the dealers and supplier of a new drug named ""WHYPHY"". <br/><br/>On majority the film's opening act introduces the gloriously self-aware and assured tone of the film, with consistent subtle references to the film's predecessor and the consistency of film sequels generally never living up to the original. Despite this, the initial opening sequence of the film (which has the spectacle but lacks the emotional engagement) does feel oddly jarring in comparison to the rest of the film. Whilst the fast-paced slapstick-filled action sequence certainly establishes initial exhilaration, the ridiculously dangerous set piece stretches the authenticity of a world which priorly felt completely genuine. <br/><br/>The performances are uniformly outstanding. Hill and Tatum have remarkable on screen chemistry and regularly showcase their ability to appear both hilarious as a pair or individually. The writing challenges Hill and Tatum to continually switch between physical comedy and substantial character-driven passages – a challenge which both actors manage superbly. All returning cast members from the original are also as well balanced as the two protagonists. Ice Cube's character in particular is much more fleshed out than within the original, and his vast range of facial expressions provide some of the funniest moments of the film. <br/><br/>The film appears distinctive and memorable through the director's matchless visual style and inventive cinematography. In particular, the chase sequence in which the two protagonists find themselves racing in a buggy shaped like American-Football Helmet is shot very uniquely and demonstrates that the directors are just as intent on creating a visually striking film as well as making it funny and digestible for its audience. <br/><br/>22 Jump Street jokes that a film sequel typically can never live up to the expectations of the original. Ironically this is not the case with the film, as the film's amazing balance between comedy and emotional investment is a breath of fresh air and as such the film manages to even surpass the momentous expectations of the original."
"elijahhandley","10","1","5","23 June 2014"," A sequel that is greater than the original - quite uncommon
","When I saw that this film was announced, I had the same mixed feelings as I always do when a sequel to a film I really loved is announced. Mixed feelings of excitement (as the original film was excellent) and fear (that the sequel will disappoint). 21 Jump Street I found was an excellent film - very funny and showcased marvellous chemistry between a pair of actors that previously I certainly would have never imagined would fit together in a film. So when 22 Jump Street came out, naturally I experienced these same emotions. It's great that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are reuniting as Officer Schmidt (alias Doug) and Officer Jenko (alias Brad) - but surely the new film couldn't improve on the original?<br/><br/>I am delighted to announce that I was completely wrong. 22 Jump Street simply improves the fantastic chemistry between Hill and Tatum. The brilliantly awkward moments the two characters find themselves are somehow even more awkward than the ones experienced in 21 Jump Street, whilst still offering a strong story to boot. In my opinion, the supporting characters in this film were generally stronger and offered more comical lines, so there is less over-emphasis on Hill and Tatum. Sceptics may suggest that the sequel is simply the original film set in a college rather than a high school. This is not the case at all - with just as many twists as the original that shape the plot in unexpected ways, it is just wrong to claim that the films are the same story in a different setting.<br/><br/>No film is perfect and 22 Jump Street is no exception, but the problems are few and far between. For example, as is often the case with films of this genre, some of the 'solutions' to problems Schmidt and Jenko arrive at are rather far-fetched, more so than 21 Jump Street. In all honesty though, I can't fault the film for much else, and off the top of my head, I can find no more issues with the film. If you enjoyed 21 Jump Street, and are worried the sequel will disappoint, don't worry. You will love 22 Jump Street, I guarantee it."
"nick-sultana","9","1","5","22 June 2014"," For once, the sequel is ACTUALLY better and great as the first!
","21 Jump Street was indeed an hilarious reboot of the 80's teen cop drama, it packed more laughs and action in ways you wouldn't expect it! It's latest sequel however goes bigger, funnier and even strives to be better than the first (and that's even rare for sequels in films, most fail or even get a so-so approval).<br/><br/>Following their success in busting the high school drug investigation, our lovable but clumsy heroes Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are assigned to another case of drug trafficking but in collage. Thinking its the same case as their first, they attempt to find the source that leads them to the person responsible but even though they are undercover as college students, they find themselves in some hilarious, emotional and even confronting moments in the process!<br/><br/>What makes 22JS so much better is the strong comedic chemistry that Hill and Tatum bring together, they aim themselves to keep the humour going with a strong flow and know when it is needed. The directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (returning from 21 Jump Street and even The Lego Movie) give detail to the comedy genre as seen in 21JS, they have a strong way of delivering the film's structure and what it is aiming for. The supporting cast too does give all their best and in particular it's Ice Cube (yep, returning from the first movie) that is given much more screen time and humour throughout, and even leads to deliver 22 Jump Street's most-confronting but hilarious scene of the film (I won't give any detail of it but it's a surprise on how it's delivers).<br/><br/>Overall, 22 Jump Street is no failure of an sequel (like The Hangover Part III) and actually proves to be stronger than its first one (which is just as funny to re-watch again and again). Go see it while you can :)"
"zardoz-13","8","1","5","22 June 2014"," 22 Good Street!!!
","The shenanigans are far more silly, and the pandemonium far more preposterous in the farcical ""21 Jump Street"" parody sequel ""22 Jump Street"" co-starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. Several actors from the original opus reprise their roles in this side-splitting sequel. Mind you, even Rob Riggle, who played dastardly Mr. Walters, the H.F.S. drug dealer whose penis got shot off, shows up with David Franco as prison inmates in a scene. Schmidt's mother and father turn up, too. Of course, since original TV ""Jump Street"" headliner Johnny Depp suffered multiple gunshot wounds in the initial film, he doesn't come back. Rarely does a remake have the nerve to liquidate the heroes from the show that spawned the remake. Nevertheless, comedy is a genre that evolves with each generation. Meantime, ""21 Jump Street"" co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller do their level best to bring audiences back up to speed after a two-year hiatus. They rely on the television rehash exercise where a narrator informs us what 'previously' happened. Audiences are treated to a condensed version of ""21 Jump Street."" When they aren't delivering better jokes and staging bigger Keystone Cops action set-pieces, Lord and Miller ridicule the formulaic conventions of sequels in general as well as ""22 Jump Street"" in particular. Lord and Miller also explore the bromantic relationship between the two protagonists in greater depth. Indeed, while ""22 Jump Street"" adheres to the blue-print plot of the first film, our heroes' new college-oriented assignment, the beefed-up, $50-million budget, and the clever end credits constitute some of the most imaginative comedy you'll ever see. One of the funniest gags features comic Seth Rogen in a droll cameo near the end of this crackerjack comedy of errors.<br/><br/>Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are not actually attending a traditional college when we first meet them in ""22 Jump Street."" Indeed, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube of ""Friday"") told them at the end of ""21 Jump Street"" that they were going to college because they were too old to pose as teenagers in high school. Instead, they have been assigned to monitor internet communication at an on-line university. Specifically, they must listen for either suspicious keywords or phrases that might serve as code words for potential crimes. Our heroes learn about the meeting time and location at the harbor. Remember, Schmidt and Jenko are not brainiacs. The professor states the location in no uncertain terms during in his lecture. Like they did in ""21 Jump Street,"" Schmidt and Jenko find themselves out matched by the opposition. Schmidt masquerades as a laughable Mexican. The Ghost (Peter Stormare of ""Armageddon"") and his henchman have a tractor-trailer load of contraband exotic animals. Predictably, Schmidt tangles with a large pink squid before all hell breaks loose. This idiotic moment rates laughs because comedian Jonah Hill is clearly doing all the work with his phony squid. If you've seen horror icon Bela Lugosi wrestling with an obviously fake rubber octopus in Ed Woods, Jr.'s ""Bride of the Monster"" (1956), you can truly appreciate what makes such a scene such a howler! Afterward, our heroes struggle to stop The Ghost,"" but this wily opponent eludes them with ease. The truck stunts in this scene get ""22 Jump Street"" off to an adrenaline-laced scene. Naturally, Schmidt and Jenko make buffoons of themselves, and Ghost gets away. <br/><br/>Our heroes wind up in Deputy Chief Hardy's office to face the music. Hardy (Nick Offerman of ""We're the Millers"") assigns them to 22 Jump Street, and they find themselves reunited with the profane Captain Dickson. The new office is located across the street from a church with a Korean Jesus. Schmidt and Jenko must find the villains behind a new synthetic drug called WhyPhy. According to Dickson, WhyPhy is a mixture of Adderall and Ecstasy with something else. You focus for the first couple of hours and then you party like never before and then you die. The only clue that they have is a photo of the student who bought the drug and later died using it. Schmidt and Jenko start hanging out with likely suspects. Jenko acquaints himself with two football players, Zook (Wyatt Russell of ""Cowboys & Aliens"") and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro of ""Grown Ups 2""), who belong to a fraternity. Meantime, the athletically challenged Schmidt attracts the attention of an art major, Maya (Amber Stevens of ""The Amazing Spider-Man""), when he performs slam poetry. Gradually, Schmidt and Jenko fall out of touch with each other, and this creates friction between them. Jenko has taken up big time with Zook and joins the college football team. These two are literally wired into each other because Jenko is always where he is supposed to be to catch the football! Eventually, our heroes take a break to visit Mr. Walters (Rob Ripple) and seek his advice about finding the WhyPhy suppliers.<br/><br/>Happily, ""22 Jump Street"" never takes itself seriously and never loses sight of its origins as a sequel. ""21 Jump Street"" should be best remembered as the first buddy cop movie to address the relationship dynamics between male partners. ""22 Jump Street"" pokes fun at Schmidt and Jenko, and our heroes have to endure a droll counseling session with a shrink. The African-American twins Keith & Kenny Yang (The Lucas Brothers) who live across the hall from them in the dorm will keep you in stitches with their antics. Similarly, Mr. Walters' prison scenes are humorous. Our heroes experience some changes themselves, particularly Schmidt. Schmidt loses his virginity, and the surprise is the identity of the girl's father. Jenko indulges in malapropisms. He says 'anals' when he means 'annuals.' He also practices Parkour and is able to shimmy up anything. I didn't laugh as often at ""21 Jump Street"" so ""22 Jump Street"" took me by surprise. Not only does it live up to its predecessor with its ""Saturday Night Live sketch-type humor, but ""22 Jump Street"" also surpasses the original."

The best part is that they keep a good storyline with all the crazy stuffs going on there. Jonah Hill really rocks it, we know him for an Oscar nominee now, but he's the best at this type of comedy.Channing Tatum also doesn't disappoint,both of them made a great chemistry.This is the only movie that i watch until the end credits since they had a lot of made-up sequels that are really funny.

There might be more to the plot of 22 JUMP STREET than that, but few in my audience would have noticed a plot unless it bit them on their noses. About half of this movie is devoted to making fun of sequels, and most of the other half is a discussion of the latest fashions in political correctness. Since 22 JUMP STREET positions itself as a comedy, cast and crew go out of their way to avoid anything that smacks of reality. There are many crude moments in 22 JUMP STREET, one of which comes AFTER ALL the credits, when the theater workers are squirming around getting antsy to clean up all the crap abandoned many minutes earlier by the departing majority of the audience. However, the two minutes of the DUMB AND DUMBER TO trailer shown before 22 JUMP STREET contained twice as much gross material as the latter feature's entire 112-minute running time. Showing some women's sex toys is about as risqué as 22 JUMP STREET gets."
"Sandcooler","8","1","6","9 July 2014"," Sequel that fixes all the flaws
","This movie summer is pretty much going to be nothing but sequels, prequels and reboots, but if they add as much to the original as this one does it won't be completely useless. ""21 Jump Street"" had its moments, but it also followed a boring, formulaic plot and featured extremely repetitive comedy. ""22 Jump Street"" mostly just ignores its plot (which is...better?) and mixes it up a little. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are also way better in this sequel. In the original there wasn't much chemistry and they didn't exactly play off each other well. Here they're clearly improvising more and they basically make the scenes go whichever way they please. Furthermore, Ice Cube showed up for more than one day this time around, and his stereotypical angry police chief role is just an instant classic. ""22 Jump Street"" has every telltale sign of a lackluster sequel, but against all odds it's completely worth seeing."
"Jmrin108","8","1","6","8 July 2014"," Self-aware comedy in the last place you'd expect.
","Going into this movie, I was pretty skeptical of a sequel's ability to repeat 21 Jump Street's formula - relatively straightforward, slapstick, often crude humor - and come up with something that still entertains. The weaker segments of this movie are indeed the ones where the writers attempt to do exactly this. Some of the film's final act feels rather humorless compared to prior sequences because it draws most of its humor from the already well-developed joke that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are mismatched. <br/><br/>This is a shame because the rest of the film is brilliant in balancing a varied palette of humor, ranging from well-executed slapstick in the vein of 21 Jump Street, hilarious performances from the entire cast (particularly Ice Cube, whose menacing glare never gets old), and the film's strongest selling point: self-referential humor. A number of scenes or plot devices are of deliberately low quality, which Hill and Tatum point out in apparently clumsy dialogue that lampoons the haste of many studios to rush out sequels. The police force's upper ranks, likewise, become stand-ins for the producers of the film itself as their concerns over a scarce budget and audiences' desire for continuity in sequels directly affect the assignments of the main characters. Another notable running joke is the relationship between Tatum and Hill's characters, whose ups and downs mimic that of a romantic partnership in very deliberate ways. Though this joke threatens to grow old, the film plays off it in a variety of entertaining ways, parodying famous romances (one reference to Annie Hall was perhaps my favorite moment) and stretching it with increasingly complex analogies that keep the trope fresh. <br/><br/>22 Jump Street does best when it doesn't try to be 21 Jump Street, which is fortunately quite often - its relentless mockery of sequels explicitly distances itself from its predecessor. Admittedly, it cannot at times resist using the same devices and style of humor as 21 Jump Street, but it does so as part of an unexpectedly wide arsenal of jokes that ensures that nothing bores the audience. This film was quite a pleasant surprise."
"dylan-brody","8","1","6","6 July 2014"," college comedy
","An uplifting, not-too-serious movie about two mediocre police agents being sent back into familiar territory. Though the duo had conquered the drug scene at a prominent high school in the first movie, the next assignment to find a drug supplier and take them out at a college proved to be a lot more challenging.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street employs many similar tactics as the first movie, adding in elements such as gratuitous sex references, party scenes, drug happenings, and improvised hilarity. The approach taken by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller to maintain a similar formula as the first movie actually rendered pretty successful. The linearity of the plot line, again, followed a similar tone as the first movie. Though the formula was similar, the movie was able to add slight changes to continue the excitement and fun even through there was a repeated story base.<br/><br/>Not only did the storyline retain legitimacy from the first movie, but Barry Peterson (Director of Photography), and Keith Brachmann and David Rennie (film editors) did a fabulous job at keeping the action high paced, but congruent with the flow of the story. The makers of 22 Jump Street knew the demographics of their viewers to a very precise account, and catered to it accordingly. From big chested college broads to homo-erotic fraternity gestures, the film crew did their homework. As a college student and fraternity member myself, I can say positively that the crew's work in 22 Jump Street examples the exact stereotypes of college life, while adding in their own unique flair.<br/><br/>While the overall flow of the movie has an intensely unrealistic tone, the believability of the characters undertone keeps the interest of the viewers. The relationship between the main duo allows the atmosphere of the sets to get wild and frantic while still keeping some sense of realism. Overall, this movie is a great adventure for those that are looking for something a little more light-hearted, and are willing to go about a movie a little less seriously than most."

Finally, the ending credit sequence is absolutely hilarious and a nice cap to the entire film.<br/><br/>The only annoyance happens during the first chase sequence at the beginning of the film.

","After watching the first part of the Ice Cube has made it clear to the audience that will be a sequel. And when? It's only a matter of time. The difference between the release dates of the first and second part of 2 years, but the interest in the film is great. Since 2012, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ice Cube have risen greatly in terms of the career ladder. I think it fueled interest in the film. <br/><br/>Honestly, before watching the film, in the morning, I wrote in his twitter that the picture will be stretched only humor. That is, in terms of the script will not be fun to watch the movie. I assumed that the movie will be copied from the first part, but it is not. Which is a funny movie characters themselves thought so too. But it is not so. <br/><br/>Just before you start I did not think I would laugh, honestly. Assumed will smile, but no. I really laughed at the two points in the hearing, which is quite rare for me. <br/><br/>The very plot of the film develops very gradually, but sometimes is forced under braking. In order that the viewer would relax a little. And it is a minus. Since the comedy genre, and stay no one wants to laugh. <br/><br/>As for the film itself. STRONG will not spoil. Nice to see the work on the characters and preferences heroes. Strong worked on camera movements, and now it's really cool to watch and not hurt the eyes when watching a movie, compared with the first part. Now I had a fight on the localization of the film, they again cut a number of scenes that simply breaks off. In the voices of the problem is not serious, but they are, yes they are. I'll wait for either an extended version in Russian, or the original version without translating votes. Here in the last hidden all the funny moments and jokes. Loved the characters and moral attitudes of the film. I am also surprised timing almost two hours! Two hours for a comedy that's cool, honestly. Also, do not get up from their seats immediately after the end of the film look it straight to the end, as at the end of the third season of 'Sherlock' surprise awaits you. And finally why this movie is cool? One word - soundtracks. It's just amazing. Guys offers songs for artists such as Wiz Khalifa and Tiesto. Speaking of music in the movies. Recently watched 'Transformers: The Age of extermination' and there also made ​​some emphasis on music and this is direct gave me hope and a sign on the film industry development, I do not think that will give rise to a revival of musicals, but the symbiosis steep action accompanied by thoughtful soundtrack makes viewing of the film even steeper. <br/><br/>At the expense of the genre, to my surprise the film not only comedy, but also a detective ... There are twists and turns in the investigation that the fans of the series 'Sherlock' will be at least surprised by the course of events. <br/><br/>That's because of all these cool things and want to buy a movie on DVD. <br/><br/>My rating 8 out of 10. This film is better than the first part. This film is a worthy continuation of the first part. This movie hot first part."

","Before I went to go and watch this movie; I will be honest - I was a bit hesitant. I wasn't sure if it could live up to it's first film (21 Jump Street). Especially when it comes to comedic movies, it's hard to surpass the first result. However, the powerful duo (Jonah Hill & Channing Tatum) pulled it through. These two were meant to be put together for such films. They made it happen, along with the other side characters such as, Ice Cube, his daughter in the movie, etc. The acting was pretty great. Yes, it's no movie that requires much thinking or one that will leave you speechless at the end, and such. However, it's a touching & funny film that had (and still will have) the whole crowd laughing crazily. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, from the very start of the movie, hooked the audience by their antics and hilarious disputes/conversations. The side characters acting skills were just as amazing - they, too, have you laughing your pants off. The setting was pretty cool, and the soundtrack (although too mainstream for me), did add to the adrenaline the viewers felt throughout the film. It was entertainment, and a party at the same time. Overall, the craziness is just as spectacular (or possibly even better in other people's eyes) as the first movie. I suggest you all to watch it if you're looking for some fun entertainment to lighten up your day! You'll be heading home, already on YouTube, searching for ""Funny scenes in 22 Jump Street"" in know time! Hopefully, this review was helpful! :)"

","22 Jump Street is a return to Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill's Jenko and Schmidt, two polar opposite cops who, after finishing their drug bust in the high school, have been assigned a new (exactly the same) assignment in college.<br/><br/>Before you think ""why has he rated this movie 8/10 if it's just a simple rehash of the first movie?"", I must tell you that this movie makes itself known from the start. Characters such as Ice Cube's captain and the police chief act as borderline fourth walls, doing everything but saying this movie is exactly the same as the first. But this makes it all the funnier, with new and old gags mixing together to form what some may call a parody of the original movie.<br/><br/>The jokes in 22 Jump Street are still exceptional, being rude and crude but never offensive, even when they delve into racial stereotypes. Tatum and Hill again reprise their stellar chemistry, along with Ice Cube delivering another angry and hilarious performance.<br/><br/>Take my word for it, you will enjoy this movie even if it is more of the same, because the ""same"" was already brilliant."

","I have never laughed so hard in my life. I nearly peed myself. Easily the funniest movie I have ever seen. I definitely think that everyone should watch it, unless you are under 15. Ice Cube in this movie stole the show. Like seriously, his furious off face is priceless. Jonah Hill has also really stepped up his comedic ability. Channing Tatum has always made me laugh. Him and Jonah have so much chemistry together, you could tell with 21 Jump Street that they literally pulled off that they were actually brothers. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, its a great laugh to have around friends and if you have some spare change, go to the cinema and definitely watch this film."
"investedinterest","10","1","6","22 June 2014"," Hilarious and well-written, 10/10!
","A big fan of the first movie, I wasn't sure what to expect from 22 Jump Street. I knew it would be funny but I figured it wouldn't have a plot to compete with 21 Jump Street (movie). I was so blown away by how great this movie turned out to be! My friends and I all laughed through the entire movie, it was so funny and I loved the plot, characters, acting, writing, the whole nine yards. I think some of the humor is ""smart humor"". For example, some jokes were pegged at actors in the movie and at the original TV show 21 Jump Street. If you were watching the movie and didn't know much about the actors or the show, some jokes may have gone right over your head which would be unfortunate because they were hilarious. This was so absolutely funny I will definitely go see it a second time and again once it's out on DVD. I was so impressed by everything in this movie, down to the choices in music. I would definitely recommend it if you enjoyed 21 Jump Street or any funny movie ever."

","The plot of the film was well established and set for the guest. They were able to capture what the scene was going to take place and how the process was going to begin. However, I believe they should have set the plot better and have added some more action to it than making it the same story like the previous movie just a different story. The movie was well and did show some entertainment to the guest. <br/><br/>Canning Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Ice cube came back with a Jump Street 22 to expand a whole new case with the two trouble cops. All the characters seemed believable except one actor and she was really annoying through out the entire movie. However, the dialogue and communication between the actors was incredible. Not the best they can do but it was good enough to have the crowd laughing. Just the verbiage they used and the foul language that was making it entertaining. Ice cube like always does an awesome job as a comedian. His facial expressions are just so irresistible. The main character Canning, Jonah, and Ice Cube did not change through out the film only the two police cops that were assigned to be part of a case and act younger than they appeared. The main conflict was to stop the distributions of a pill that was popular in high school students. A student was distributing that drug. Thus, Canning and Jonah were assigned to search for that student having to pass as a high school student. The story was funny more than having suspense or interest.<br/><br/>The actors were awesome!!. The way they would act with so much emotion made their character so real. The way they would speak to each other with foul language is what made them fit their personality. In fact, with the very last scene Jonah did an awesome job at pulling an awesome move to help his partner in crime by having flashback of previous events that made him capable of doing something he was never able to do. The locations that they were filmed at were interesting because I just think about all the students that were restricted from certain locations for the film to take place or if that was even filmed at an real location. Not to mention, the ocean scene how they made it so realistic. Of course since the major famous actors played in this movie they guests immediately assumed it was comedy. Since they know the starters are all comedians in other films.<br/><br/>In fact, the movie had current music, which gave it that head knob when it came out during a scene. The videographers did a good job filming with those close ups and further away shots during the drama and adrenaline scenes. Where everything started moving so fast with the cars, people fighting, etc. It was nice and clear with no blur."
"sky_klown","7","1","7","6 July 2014"," Funny story that leaves you wanting more
","22 Jump Street is a funny movie geared towards the young adult minded individual. If you don't like homosexual and/or racial driven jokes, then this may not be the best choice for you. Also if you've never been to college or cannot fathom the realities of college, than you may have a hard time catching onto the puns and satirical aspects of the film. The movies plot incidentally has two climaxes in my opinion. The first one being that of Schmidt finding out that he doesn't always need Jenko by his side when they split up to hunt down two separate assailants, and the other one is when Jenko realizes that he does actually still want to work as a police officer. Both climaxes were turning points for both characters; where they each have come to self realizations about each other and how they work as a team.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie the theme of homo eroticism, or a more contemporary term being ""bromance"", is seen over and over again. Often times the homo erotic jokes get intermixed with the homosexual type ones due to the nature of both relational perspectives being so similar. I found the jokes to be hilarious because of the simplistic style that makes the viewer pick up on the subtlest forms of the jokes. And they are not short handing you when it comes to quantity either; 22 Jump Street just keeps on throwing jokes at you throughout the whole story.<br/><br/>I found the action to be on par of other movies designed to be purely ""Action"" movies, while this film is more of a hybrid of Comedy and Action. There were multiple times in the movie where the bangs were the size of ones seen in like Mission Impossible or even Transformers. Schmidt and Jenko are seen countless times running, shooting, running while shooting, and even getting into a nice fist fight towards the end. If you're a fan of ridiculously stupid that it's funny type of movies then you must definitely go check out 22 Jump Street."
"kafflen","9","1","7","6 July 2014"," 22 Jump Street
","Since I am a current college student I thoroughly enjoyed this movie with all of the fairly accurate typical stereotypes it contained. The movie takes place at a college where two police officers (Channing Tatum and Noah Hill) go undercover as fellow students in order to find a drug dealer. Their vulgar boss (Ice Cube) has his two officers try to locate a ""whyphy"" drug dealer. Whyphy, or ""work hard yes, play hard yes,"" makes the college student intensely focus for four hours and then progresses to the student tripping for four hours. Within the film there are several side stories, such as romance and friendship, which almost overwhelm the main theme of locating the criminal. 22 Jump Street is filled with many hilarious every day comical antics that everyone is able to relate. The bromance between Hill and Tatum is threatened by another ""dude."" Hill begins a relationship with a young lady who has some rather interesting relatives. This movie is full of all sorts of twists that keep the viewers on their toes. Nobody is as they seem and juicy secrets are exposed as the plot develops. Although there are quite a bit of chasing scenes and violent fighting scenes with guns, there really is not a lot of blood in the film as opposed to the average action/drug movie. If you are not into a lot of blood and gore in a motion picture, but still like to watch a good fight scene, then this film is for you. There is a lot of appropriate ""inappropriate"" language throughout the film. In college it is almost impossible to not hear bad language, making the inappropriate language sound quite appropriate. The music was amazingly perfect for the story. Most of the music was very upbeat and very popular at college parties. After watching the movie I felt a strong urge to go to a crazy outdoor ""spring break/summertime party."" This was definitely one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. Go out and watch it! It is totally worth seeing in the movie theater."

","From the opening scene you know that this is going to be a fun ride. The chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill is simply brilliant. If you liked the first one you will LOVE the second one. It is one of those rare times where I believe the sequel is better than the original.<br/><br/>This is an action/comedy but I would say that there is something you laugh at every 30 seconds. The things they make fun of are delivered with such ease that you wonder if most of it was improvised. The action scenes are pretty entertaining as well and the movie has a couple surprises that had me laughing well into the next scene. Also, I would definitely pay attention to the dialogue because some of the lines pass by so quick you may not get the joke.<br/><br/>Bottom line this is one the best sequels I've ever scene and I hope they make another one."

"rjsf96","8","1","7","30 June 2014"," Lord and Miller Strike Comedy Gold
","What a pleasant surprise this is and a joy! 21 Jump Street was also an unexpected treat, because truth be told it did not look as though it had enough comedic potential for a feature length film. The director duo, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, have proved themselves worthy of comedies for the younger generation with The Lego Movie which was released this year as well. Yet for the adolescents their footing comes much more naturally.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street takes place after the events of 21; Jenko and Schmidt have successfully brought down the destruction of the drug HFS at a high school. They saved the damsel in distress (Brie Larson) who added warmth and fire to the film. Then proceeded to stop Mr Walters and Eric from getting out of the drug charges; they now share a cell together – much to Eric's annoyance. This provides an exceptional end credits scene, so be sure not to leave until the curtains are closed.<br/><br/>In 22, Jenko and Schmidt are enrolled into college by Captain Dickson, played with laugh-a-second gags by Ice Cube. They yet again have to stop a drug known as the street name WHYPHS (the unabbreviated version is hilarious), which when spoken sounds similar to Wi-Fi. So in terms of the plot and structure there is little difference to this film and its predecessor. It has the same bromance theme – helped tremendously by Schmidt and Jenko's chemistry and likability; which shine here. There are car chases and numerous action scenes; this is more of a buddy-cop film than the first, but I'm not complaining. We also get another romance between Schmidt and Maya (Amber Stevens). This sadly, feels out of place and taped in at the last minute, only to serve as conflict towards Schmidt and Jenko's appreciation for each other. It begs comparison between Molly and Schmidt in the previous film and the romance here feels forced and under-developed.<br/><br/>What it comes down to is that this is more of the same – if you liked the first, you'll enjoy this more and if you didn't then you will dislike it. But, you probably already know if this film is for you, however if you are unsure I implore you to watch it. Overall, the film is funnier, alas this sometimes comes at the expense of the film's heart – something had to give. The jokes come thick and fast, at several points I had to hold on to my belly in fear that I might just die from laughing. Ice Cube gets a supporting role this time, rather than the almost cameo appearance he had in 21. This is definitely the film's strongest point and it utilises it to the max. He gets the broadest laughs and I can only hope he has even more screen time in the inevitable 23 Jump Street.<br/><br/>Yet, one of the greatest elements about this film is how knowing and self-aware it all is. It is as if the directors are winking at the audience, and this does not come across as cheesy, which it could easily have done if not handled with care. There are nods at other franchises, gags about clichés (""the girl always gets kidnapped"") which are turned on its head. Jokes about how this will not be as good or as fun as last time. Yet, for all the times that the film says it won't be as awesome as the last, this is not the case and I am all the more happy for it.<br/><br/>If you thought that Lord and Miller might have lost their touch after delving into kiddie fare, then rest assured this instalment is as great as if not funnier and better than the last. This is one of the best comedies in years, I am sure it will stand the test of time like Shaun of the Dead will. It has the potential to be as outrageously hilarious as Pegg and Frost's Cornetto trilogy. This outing proves that the director duo is more than up to the challenge."
"eddie_baggins","6","1","7","19 June 2014"," Slight, light and bright - a fast paced and instantly forgettable comedy
","21 Jump Street was a real surprise hit upon release in 2012, for surely a film spoofing a cult 1980's TV show and starring the seemingly mismatched parring of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was doomed and destined for the mediocre bin and middling box office takings. 21 Jump Street however defied many of the expectations lashed upon it and became not only a hit with critics, but audiences and evidently box office kitty. What made 21 Jump Street such a breakout hit it is fair to say was the low expectation heaped upon it but now with 2 years in the making and a continual rise in popularity for both Hill and Tatum expectations are a lot higher for this particular comedy venture so is it worth the hype? Judging by its box office takings so far you'd be led to believe it's a resounding yes.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street is that odd type of film, a film that remains highly enjoyable without ever once threatening to break out into anything highly memorable. Like a stick of fairy floss, the film is sweet while it lasts but once it's finished you'd be hard pressed to remember what was so enjoyable about it in the first place. A major plus for directors Lord and Miller (who have at present an unprecedented hit ratio with their films) is of course the pairing of Hill and Tatum who found such golden chemistry together in the first film and that continues on here. Hill as Schmidt and Tatum as Jenko just feels so right and anytime the two actors are together on screen the film transcends whatever goofy or immature gag it's setting up, but once the two are separated the films quite obvious flaws are made far too evident.<br/><br/>While the first film in the series is anything but high class or quality storytelling (and really doesn't need to be) the sequel seems to bask in its own ability to re-tread similar plot points (actually referenced numerous times throughout the film as though it's funny to re-hash) to the first and produce a story that barely allows any character growth and eventually repeats many jokes that worked well in the first due to a feeling of originality which is here blanketed by audience expectation. Lord and Miller certainly keep the pace at a high level but there is no getting over the fact that bar some nice moments from Ice Cube as angry Captain Dickson the films supports and again leads on their own are quite lacklustre. Newcomers to the series including renowned character actor Peter Stormare and Kurt Russell's very own Wyatt Russell remain all sadly forgettable in a bare bones story.<br/><br/>With added weight of expectation and with two lead actors who now know their respective characters back to front, 22 Jump Street should've and could've been a whole lot better. The film still has its fair share of charms thanks to the lead duos intact chemistry and Lord and Miller as always show flair when it comes to their direction and there revelling in keeping things stupid can be commended but the film can't hide the fact that what it produces is light, slight and bright entertainment that we'd be hard pressed to care about a couple of weeks from now. A third entry into the series may be pushing this ventures welcome to far.<br/><br/>3 inappropriately hidden hand grenades out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","Police officers Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Schmidt (Jonah Hill) team up again to chase down drug dealers, but this time, in college. The success of the duo in the 21 Jump Street assignment led to their new undercover jobs at a local college. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) gives the partners an assignment to identify and track down the dealers of a new drug that goes by the name of ""whyphy"" that is connected to the death of a college student. In college, the partners begin to drift apart from each other, with Jenko moving towards the fraternity scene and football team, while Schmidt gravitates towards a girl named Maya and the art community on campus. With the drug ""whyphy"" on the verge of spreading outside of the local college, the partners must travel to Puerto Mexico to stop the distribution of the drug. In an epic, action-filled comedy, the duo ultimately put aside the problems between them in order to solve the bigger problem in front of them. <br/><br/>The film was overall very hilarious and could, in many ways, be better than the preceding film. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have amazing chemistry on screen and their interactions seem effortless, as if they have been life-long pals. The ""bromance"" shared between the duo was a nice comical touch. With the film catering to a younger crowd, the language and dialogue of the film is covered with jokes, slang, and comedy that the younger viewers would find comedic. The main conflict of finding the drug dealer and stopping the drug distribution was interesting, and with new twists being thrown in, the story line was dynamic and kept the viewers full attention throughout the entire film.<br/><br/>The film mostly took place on a college campus, with the latter part of the film taking place in Puerto Mexico. Changing the scenery when the film was coming to the climax kept the story rolling with interest and surprise. Tatum and Hill were dressed in casual, everyday wear throughout the film, which was appropriate for the rolls in which they were playing. As for the cinematography, nothing was particularly unique or extraordinary. Aside from the few slow motion action shots, the camera angles were standard and very normal. The sound effects, however, were quite hilarious and added to the jokes, making them even more humorous. The music of the film comprised of today's hip-hop and rap hits. The music was appropriate for the mood of the film, and added to the atmosphere of the action and party scenes. <br/><br/>A change that could improve the film would be to not build so many of the jokes off of the preceding film. The viewers who did not watch 21 Jump Street would not understand some of the jokes, but for viewers who saw the previous movie, the jokes were extremely funny. Including jokes that everyone in the audience could understand would improve the comical aspect of the film. Overall, the film was excellent and exceedingly funny. I would definitely recommend 22 Jump Street to anyone looking for a good laugh."

","'22 JUMP STREET': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum once again team up for this buddy cop sequel, to the 2012 hit '21 JUMP STREET' (loosely based on the 80s TV show of the same name). It was once again written by Hill and Michael Bacall, this time along with Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller returned to direct the movie; they've gained a lot more celebrity status since directing the first one, for directing and co-writing 'THE LEGO MOVIE' (released earlier this year). I don't think this installment is as consistently funny (or as well made) as the original but it still has a ton of great laughs.<br/><br/>The sequel has Officers Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) now going undercover as college students (as opposed to high school ones, like in the first movie) to catch the drug supplier of a new deadly drug called 'WHYPHY'. Also unlike the first movie Jenko is now the popular student, once again (and becomes really good at football), and Schmidt is a picked on nerd, once again. Jenko also makes friends with a jock named Zook (Wyatt Russell) while Schmidt starts to develop a romantic relationship with an art student named Mercedes (Jillian Bell). The two grow further and further apart while also blowing their case. Ice Cube, Nick Offerman, Rob Riggle and Dave Franco also reprise their roles from the first movie.<br/><br/>The film is of course, once again, all about Schmidt and Jenko's relationship and how it's jeopardized by their new fake identities (returning to school life). Hill (like his buddy Seth Rogen) is a master at these exaggerated male (friend) relationship movies. The story is pretty predictable, and it is kind of just a rehash of the original movie, but there's still a lot of great jokes and Hill and Tatum have beautiful chemistry together (once again). People, that are looking forward to seeing a movie like this, should know to expect a male bonding (spoof) commentary with lots of silly jokes (mostly gay or 'not gay' ones). It's not as funny as the original movie but it still delivers the laughs; they're just a little more hit-and-miss this time. More hit than miss though (once again).<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2f4dnLXvGI"

","Comedy sequels are unusual beasts: on one hand, they have to be about as funny as their predecessors, enough to justify their existence. But on the other, if the humor strays too far from the original, it gets harder to call it a sequel. Such is the dilemma faced by 22 Jump Street. Seeing its huge box office haul, it's probable that those who wished to see it have done so already. However, for those who haven't, you'll get almost as much enjoyment from watching the first one again. Yes, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are still a great class act, and there are plenty of great comedic moments. But too many of those moments are recycled, and starting to get a bit stale. In this regard, the film is funnier than it perhaps should be, but this is barely enough to keep it afloat."

","An entirely worthy sequel to the 2012 surprise blockbuster, ""22 Jump Street"" manages to acknowledge and spoof the obvious financial motivation behind big-budget sequels while also being hilarious and entirely worthy in its own right. It's a delicate balancing act, but the entire production is on point: From the acting to the writing to the direction, this is a satire of sequels made by folks who have a clear reverence for the formula, and know exactly how to lovingly poke at it. Channing Tatum is just as charming and compelling here as he was in the original, while series newcomer Jillian Bell steals every scene she's in.

","Very early on in ""22 Jump Street"", the guys are basically told to do the same thing as the last time since that's their best chance for success. While it's nice to see the screenwriters basically admitting that they're following the template of the first movie, it still leaves us with a sequel that's more or less trying to recreate the success of its predecessor. On one hand, using the same framework opens the door to variations but, at the same time, it's hard to avoid a sense of 'been there, done that'. Then again, the entire premise of the series is inherently limited, so there's only so much that you can do with it.<br/><br/>After going undercover at a high school in the first movie, the duo take the next logical step and go undercover at a college. Once again trying to infiltrate a drug ring, the story obviously feels similar to the first movie. Where the differences lie is mainly in the interactions between Jenko & Schmidt. This time around, Jenko is the one who fits in better, which ultimately creates friction between the two. In the end, I'm not sure that the story is different enough from the first movie but it should please fans looking for more of the same. Probably the only area where the movie improved upon its predecessor was in the action department.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Channing Tatum & Jonah Hill are of course back again and they're just as good together as they were the first time around. Ice Cube & Nick Offerman make welcome return appearances as well. Joining them is the always reliable Peter Stormare as the requisite bad guy along with Jillian Bell, Amber Stevens West & Wyatt Russell. Not a bad group but probably not quite up to the standard of the first movie. There is, however, a nice surprise appearance by Queen Latifah.<br/><br/>In terms of production values, the movie can't be faulted. With the original directors returning, the quality didn't dip as is often the case with sequels. In fact, a larger budget enabled them to add more spectacle to the mix and they were able to accomplish this without overshadowing the movie's comedic core.<br/><br/>Even though I enjoyed the movie I was nevertheless left with a feeling that it wasn't entirely necessary. I appreciate the self-aware approach to producing a sequel but, in the end, the result was still fairly formulaic and predictable in spite of that. While the excellent end credits sequence just about single-handedly justified the existence of the movie, I'm not sure what it says about a movie when the end credits is the best part."

","22 jump street
2014
Director: Phil Lord and Christopher Miller
Screenplay: Michae; Bacall, Oren Uziel and Rodney Rothman 
Based on 21 jump street by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannell 
Cast: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Peter Stormare, Ice Cube and Amber Stevens West
Plot: The Team of Schmidt and Jenko are sent to a college to deal with an outbreak of a new drug. 
Review: I really didn't like this movie because everything I enjoyed from the first movie was exploited. There is a lot of unneeded gross out humor also. The direction and screenplay are horrible. The casting and acting are horrible also. I feel so sorry for Peter Stormare because he is wasted as the secondary villain. All in all I would give this zero out of a possible five stars."

The humor was silly, inane, yet at the same time clever such as a silly chase scene taking place in front of ""The Benjamin Hill Center for Film Studies."" Anyone not hip to Benny Hill, might miss the real joke looking at a chase scene that is otherwise unappealing.<br/><br/>At one point our undercover guys act like a couple breaking up ""Maybe we should start investigating other people."" Tatum has met a meat head football player who thinks identical to him, leaving Jonah Hill as the third wheel.<br/><br/>The film had a number of good one liners, such as ""I don't know if I like you sober."" The scenes worked fairly well, building upon each other.<br/><br/>Parental Guide: Plenty of F-bombs. No sex or nudity."

","This was SO much fun to watch. Screw writing a review, the soundtrack just makes me want to throw a party right now. Seriously downloading that shizz immediately. In this sequel our abysmal police officers are sent to 22 Jump Street (a much better title than 21 Jump Street 2) to go undercover in a college to bust...you guessed it, another drug dealer. This drug is called ""why-phy"" and makes you ultra focussed before sending your mind down one heck of a trippy trip. That scene alone, was just a beauty to behold. Channing Tatum dancing in a rainbow land, adjacent to Jonah Hill listening to hellish rock music. Majestic. That obviously conveys the contrast between them and they do go down a rather formulaic personality clash only for them to regroup to try and save the day! That's my biggest problem with the film, it's far too formulaic and is pretty much a rehash of its predecessor. I get it, don't fix what is not broken but with a bigger budget this was more unfocused. In fact I don't think anyone cared for the actual plot this time. What this did do though, was pull a damn good twist in the middle which I did NOT see coming. One of those moments where I shouted ""Oh. My. God. Nooo no no noooo!"". If you've seen the film, you know what I mean (hint: involves parents visiting the college). The script was self-referential and clearly used this awareness to poke fun out of itself, which was a smart move. The end credits showed that hilariously. Best end credits scene I've seen in a looooong time. Jonah Hill was occasionally good but again, I just don't like him. Channing Tatum was not as consistent with his line delivery, some of them fell flat. The action scenes were well filmed and had some flamboyancy to them which made the experience all the more enjoyable. That's exactly what this is, a damn good enjoyable flick with some hysterical scenes...and a kickass soundtrack which I'm downloading right now. No joke, turning my laptop on now."

","Sequels sometimes suffer from not being able to live up to the predecessor, in this case, 21 JUMP STREET. Like the title of this review suggests, the story is not as good as the first film, but the comedy is definitely there. This time around, Jonah and Channing go to college to find the supplier of a new drug, WYFY.<br/><br/>This film is somewhat of a mirror to the first film, in which Jonah played the popular kid in high school, and Channing was the nerd. This time, Channing is the jock and Jonah is the nerd. They still work under Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), but now at 22 Jump Street (across the street!).<br/><br/>One of the funnier moments include a drive through campus in a golf cart style vehicle, chasing/being chased by the drug dealers; recklessly destroying anything and everything, much to the chagrin of Capt. Dickson. The other moment is the dinner that Schmidt has with Capt. Dickson, staring him down the entire time.<br/><br/>A good film, suffers from sequelitis, but still funny."

","After the critical and commercial success of 21 Jump Street here is the inevitable sequel with a bigger budget, bigger sets and more bromance.<br/><br/>22 Jump Street is just across the road from 21 Jump Street but this station is more hi tech. The duo of Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) go back on the Jump Street program to work for the angry and shouty Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) but this time they go undercover as college students and locate the supplier of a drug known as 'WHYPHY' that killed a college student photographed buying it on campus.<br/><br/>The film makes a lot of references to the plotting of the previous film as if the film is making a statement that sequels tend to be a rehash of the original and not as good. In essence 22 Jump Street is a retread of the first film with this time jokes about how old they look as college students.<br/><br/>Still the film is enjoyable enough, the gags still make you laugh, the cast seem to be having fun, there are enough action set pieces that some to be parodying the Fast and Furious films. <br/><br/>The end credits scenes is inspired as they go through future sequel ideas including a cameo from another star from the original television series leading to the poster for Generations: Jump Street."

","After a failed attempt to arrest crime lord 'The Ghost' , agent Schmidt and Jenko get a mission where they have to repeat their special trick : they have to infiltrate. This time it's college time. The new drug has already cost a student's life. Now it's our 'heroes' time to take down the dealer and the supplier. '22 Jump Street' is a sequel of '21 Jump Street'. Therefore the expectations are to high. But a sequel is always a risk, will it surpass the first part? And will the makers manage it to not repeat themselves. 21 Jump Street is indeed above all more of the same, but never feels like a lazy repetition exercise, such as in The Hangover 2 for example. That is largely due to the chemistry between the protagonists Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum which already worked well in the first part. The two are even better attuned and also seem to have really fun with each other. Moreover the film is also chock-full of successful jokes and quips. Like the scene in which Schmidt spontaneously participates in a ' poetry slam 'is painfully funny. And whether it's a lecture, a party or a football game; everyday school activities always degenerate in hilarity at the hands of the two clumsy undercover agents.<br/><br/>21 Jump Street is full of self-conscious humor. The production value is visible elevated, what more, better and, above all, those action scenes.It is not often that a sequel is better than the previous one but this one is. With another blockbuster there definitely will be a<br/><br/>third part . But who knows if another repetition will be good or not. So stay put at the end of the credits to see their hilarious future films."

"brando647","8","0","2","7 July 2015"," A Worthy Sequel to the 1st Surprise Comedy Hit
","I'll keep this simple from the start: if you enjoyed 21 JUMP STREET (the 2012 movie, not the TV show it was based on), then there's a good chance you'll find enough to enjoy about 22 JUMP STREET to make a viewing worth your while. There isn't a whole lot different between the two movies. The meta-humor is refocused on the fact that this is a sequel and the ""bromance"" has evolved to the next level but, otherwise, these movies are nearly the same beats. Some would find problems with this (because it's not the most creative way to handle a sequel) and normally I would agree but what can I say? I bought into it. I had fun. At the end of 21 JUMP STREET, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) promised the next case would send Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Schmidt (Jonah Hill) to college. After a failed undercover case to remind us that these two aren't ready for real-world criminal justice, the pair are dropped into college to engage in literally the same premise as the first film. The two of them resume of their previous identities as the McQuaid brothers and are enrolled in college to locate the dealers and find the suppliers of the campus' latest drug craze, WhyPhy. The question is: having never had the chance to experience college for themselves, can Jenko and Schmidt maintain their cover and solve the case without going too deep and losing themselves in a world of fraternities and parties?<br/><br/>I'm finding it hard to comment on 22 JUMP STREET without just copying/pasting everything I thought about the first movie. It's one of the main gags scattered throughout the film (the concept of essentially doing the same thing all over again to placate the audience) but, whereas I thought the movie would deviate a bit from the normal formula, it instead follows right along with what it promised. A lot of the story beats are pretty much identical to Jenko and Schmidt's adventure in high school with a few updates. The partners find themselves at odds (again) and drawn to different cliques of school life (again). This time, it's a little easier to accept as Jenko blends into the jock crowd as a star football player and Schmidt finds acceptance in the liberal arts crowd. The bromance between the two reaches new levels as the movie brings them to the point where they contemplate whether they're right for each other. Should they ""break up""? Cue the drama. Still, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are a talented duo and they know how to handle it, bringing out the inherent funny while Tatum and Hill's natural buddy chemistry makes it all work perfectly. There's no denying that these two are a perfect team and Tatum continues to display comedic chops he doesn't often get to utilize. As basic as the story is, it's these two that continue to make the Jump Street movies so much fun to watch. Two movies in, and I'm not tired of them yet.<br/><br/>Whereas most of the movie recycles heavily from the first film, it doesn't forget to inject some new blood into the movie. Ice Cube's role as Captain Dickson, head of the Jump Street department, is expanded and I love it. Peter Stormare has a minor role as a black market dealer known as ""the Ghost"" and doesn't get much to do but the behind- the-scenes footage shows how much fun he was having fun on set. The movie's breakout performance comes from Jillian Bell as Mercedes, the roommate to Schmidt's new ""girlfriend"". Bell has a talent for improv comedy that allows her to not only keep pace with Hill in their scenes together but even surpass him for most of them. She's great and I wouldn't mind seeing more of her. As good as Bell is, the movie is lacking a villain as fun as Rob Riggle from 21 JUMP STREET as Mr. Walters. The best part of this sequel is a scene where Jenko and Schmidt go to prison for a Hannibal Lector homage where they interview Mr. Walters (now missing his manhood and embracing his newwomanhood) for clues on where to find their culprit. Despite its flaws, 22 JUMP STREET is a worthwhile sequel to the original surprise comedy hit. It maintains the same level of fun, the gags are just as unrelenting, and most of the jokes land. I reiterate: if you enjoyed the first 21 JUMP STREET (as I did), then this movie is a no-brainer and I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
"midas-jacobs","9","0","4","17 June 2015"," the first one was better
","This movie is the sequel to 21 jump street. I liked the first one more because it was just a bit funnier. But this movie is again about some kind of drug. But this time at a college. At college Jenko meets Zook. Jenko and Schmidt and Jenko have to find the dealer of the drug and stop him. The only clue they have is a tattoo. Than there are some bromance moments. <br/><br/>The acting was good, it wasn't amazing, but I thought that Ice Cube. And it surprised me. Jonah Hill was also pretty good. Channing Tatum was OK. I personally find that he was just there to be funny. And it worked. The directing was also OK, it could have been better if Nolan dit it or Fincher. The script was also pretty funny. The thing that I liked is that the movie laughed with itself. They often say that it is repetitive and stuff. Or like the mission is exactly the same as the previous one. The lines while they are fighting are funny. Something else that is funny is the contrast between Schmidt and Jenko. Jenko is very sportive and good at parcour. In contrast to Schmidt, he's lazy and not active at all. (you may see this as a spoiler) The ending when they blow something up is also pretty funny. The end credit scene is also very funny.<br/><br/>Here are some individual scores:<br/><br/>directing: 8/10<br/><br/>acting: 8.5/10<br/><br/>creativity: 9.5/10<br/><br/>jocularity: 9.5/10<br/><br/>that's 35.5/40 which is rounded 9/10"

","Generally I am far from being a big fan of modern day youth-oriented comedies, so when I sat down to watch the first ""Jump Street"" movie, I was filled with dread. To my surprise, I didn't find it so bad - it had a good amount of humorous moments that made me laugh. Despite this, I was not looking forward to this sequel, seeing how Hollywood sequels are almost always greatly inferior to the originals. But once again, I was surprised. This sequel does have some really funny moments, the best being those that poke fun of ""sequelitus"" and various movie clichés. I really got the feeling the writers were laughing out loud when writing this script, because they seemed to admit how silly this movie was. The humor isn't perfect - there is definitely an over abundance of it tied with foul language and R- rated content, which seemed to suggest the writers at times were desperate for laughs and to be ""edgy"". There is also not quite enough plot, as well as a few plot points that are not made clear. And at 111 minutes, the movie does run too long. Despite these problems, I will say this: If you liked the first movie, chances are you'll like this sequel."

It is pretty much the exact same as the first one. Normally that is something I would complain about, but this movie did something very smart with this. In the very beginning, they make it very clear that they know they're making the same movie again. This makes for much needed self awareness and for a funny joke. Since this movie follows the formula of it's predecessor, it is very predictable, granted, but it is also filled with plenty of hilarious scenes, which is my main requirement for a comedy. This sequel is certainly worth watching. It's funny, clever, and just maybe better than the first."

Also it is a great action film when the Mexican Wolverine and his gang are chasing the boys at Spring Break. Also it is great at the beginning when the ""My Name is Jeff"" scene is happening.

The movie had a similar plot to the first, but so does almost every sequel to any movie that was ever made. It was funny from start to the finish and was well put together and was easily one of the funniest movies put out last year.

This movie begins to shine in the third tier and the final couple of scenes where the action picks up, the jokes are more fun. There it catches again the funny irreverent cliché tone of the first movie and becomes truly enjoyable. The high school setting was better exploited than the college setting of this movie; which is why it's slower to start. Also, while fully assumed by the movie, the repetition from the first movie reinforce the slow start. Overall still OK and a perfect movie to lazy out in front of. Wait to have forgotten the first one before you watch."
"ahegde3149","5","0","1","13 January 2015"," You will enjoy it if you liked the first one.
","21 Jump Street offered many laughs from its dynamic duo of Chaning Tatum and Jonah Hill. While it wasn't anything monumental still was great fun to watch. Now if you didn't feel the same regarding it then I advise you stay away from 22 Jump Street as its nothing more than a rehash of the plot with similar comic situations. Despite that directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (who gave the wondrous Lego Movie this year) keep us engaged by making the things look very less serious and investing more in the bromantic relation between Schmidt and Jenko established in the first film.<br/><br/>Now if you remember what Ice Cube said at the end of 21JS that "" you'll going to college "". Well that's the setting, our undercover cop- buddies need to crack down drug suppliers and dealers in a college now. The way the events unravel is almost same as the first one, still it's not boring as there are some constant gags put in every now and then. Romance again here doesn't fit nicely but there is a very surprising comic twist moment involving Jonah and Ice Cube which was really amusing. I found Ice Cube much more funny in this one. New characters are introduced but they are as interesting as Walters, Eric or Molly of first one, while the earlier two appear for brief amount of time in jail Molly is completely erased. Again the duo of Schmidt and Jenko are the standout. Even if they undergo similar situations where they have their differences for some time but at the end realize they are best buddies. There is also a cameo during the credits but its not as amazing as the one in first film.<br/><br/>Overall 22JS is pretty much entertaining but most its credit goes to the nice story established in the 21JS. Also the climax is unnecessarily dragged and quite cliché, I wished they at least come up with an unpredictable ending. The beach and spring break setting for finale doesn't match up to the stylish prom-night entry of 21JS. The credits are more hilarious and fun showing us different mock sequels of Jump Streets, do not miss them. Considering most of the positives of the film are derived from the first one and also since the first one had much better third act I will rate this slightly below the first film. Comedy wise both are enjoyable at the same level, so if you had a good time with the 21 then don't miss 22.<br/><br/>RATING: [2.5/5]"
"CountJonnie","5","0","1","5 January 2015"," A simple and loud copy of #1 and they even admit it.
","You don't need to be a fan of the original series, but it does help to enjoy the movie. Part 1 succeeded in being different enough and still respecting the source material. Not saying it was a good movie, but still enjoyable.<br/><br/>Now part 2 is not much different, yet it is. At the end of part 1 and the beginning of part 2 they even admit that this is going to be the same movie. But instead of adding something that might make this movie somehow original, they decided to make a movie built out of jokes that seem incoherent. Jokes work for 10 minutes, but they get old in this movie very soon. What doesn't help either is that they repeat the ""relation-joke"" over and over, without adding real characters or development.<br/><br/>Personally it felt as if they didn't really write this movie, but just crammed the leftovers of part 1. Leftover; that is exactly what this movie is. The only relief are the bad guys and some comedic guest parts, because the others seem to have given up halfway this movie."

","OK, this is not the type of movie I enjoy, but my public library bought the BluRay so I felt compelled to see it, especially now that I am laid up for a couple of weeks from foot surgery. Come on, golf season!<br/><br/>Anyway if you look at the IMDb votes distribution (I always do) you see that boys and girls under 18 give it the highest ratings. The movie is silly, goofy, the partners are a bumbling pair of police placed in college to help solve the drug-related murder of one of the coeds. What really ruins it for me is the pervasive filthy language and impolite sexual references. That is usually a sign of uninspired script writing, as is the case here.<br/><br/>Jonah Hill as Schmidt and Channing Tatum as Jenko are the undercover cops. Both of them are actually pretty good actors in the right roles, but here it seems their only interest is collecting a paycheck. And it did pretty well world-wide returning much more than its cost.<br/><br/>My favorites in the whole movie are Kenny and Keith, The Lucas Brothers, as Keith & Kenny Yang. They explain their dad is Asian and their mom is black. Identical twins they are just great together and all their parts are very funny. I had never heard of them before but they apparently have been in one or two TV series.<br/><br/>My second favorite part is about the first 2/3 of the movie is shot in New Orleans, including the area of St Charles Avenue near Tulane University, and probably some campus shots there.<br/><br/>And finally, the third favorite was the ending credits where Jump Streets 23, 24, 25, and on to Jump Street 2121 are depicted in various unusual placements for the two partners. The ending credits show way more humor than anything in the actual movie.<br/><br/>A silly movie that seems to be what the youngest generations want these days, but not particularly entertaining for the more mature movie watchers."
"Bruce722","7","0","1","1 January 2015"," A repeat of the reboot.
","22 Jump Street is essentially the exact same movie as the first film in this newly rebooted franchise. Why does that not matter all that much? Because in this laugh-filled comedy, they actually mock that fact multiple times where they tear down the 4th wall and don't even care. Sure, I felt that they overdid it a bit with this, as well as the exaggerated homosexual innuendos, but the good still far outweighed the bad. Like the last film, the sequences were outrageous but funny and the acting was just dude-bro enough to be spot on for what they were going for. Expanding Ice Cube's role was also a smart idea, as was the casting of the stunning Amber Stevens. It astounds me that she hasn't had more success in her acting career. Overall though, if you enjoyed the first one, you'll like this movie too because 22 Jump Street is essentially the exact same movie as the first film in this newly rebooted franchise... see what I did there?"

","22 Jump Street succeeds entirely because if its own self-awareness that it is, ostensibly, an obligatory studio sequel intended to achieve success through mimicry. With the filmmakers in on the joke, there is breathing room to approach the material with clarity and purpose, hitting the necessary character beat and maintaining the necessary consistency in tone with the first film. Tatum and Jonah Hill make the ride once again worthwhile whether covering the same type of material or breaking into new territory. Marital banter, physical comedy gags, a reversed loser or winner perspective within the college setting, the duo are given enough to do in order to generate the necessary renewed passion and commitment to the material."
"TheMarwood","5","0","2","30 December 2014"," Fun enough disposable entertainment
","Like its predecessor, 22 Jump Street is a lightweight and instantly forgettable film that manages to get enough chuckles throughout. This very self aware sequel is less than slapdash in its plotting, it's barely a functional narrative. It's mostly episodic situations that our two leads find themselves in when these two undercover buffoons go to college. This meta cash grab of a sequel is definitely lazy in the filmmaking department, but the picture is held up and watchable from the chemistry of Hill and Tatum. Tatum is especially committed to this ridiculous material and he actually has a great knack for comedy. 22 Jump Street is mindless, the plot is always secondary to the jokes and it lands just enough laughs to be worth killing some time watching it."

","Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have been called transgressive directors, who bring movies in Hollywood format and at the same time spread an anti-capitalist message in a subliminal way. That might be said of The Lego Movie for example, but even in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs it is possible - with some imagination - to find this ""hidden message"". I, on the contrary, tend to agree with John Podhoretz, a conservative and republican journalist for The Weekly Standard who dismissed all the liberal (in the American way) and anti-capitalist interpretations of The Lego Movie and said they all fell into a marketing trap. 'Cause in the end it is the Lego Group who profit and the anti-capitalist who pays and spreads the word of the so-called subversive message, which makes other anti-capitalists pay. So that's why I, as an anarchist and anti-capitalist, won't pay to see movies of the Lord-Miller duo. I download them and rate them poorly. So suck it. In any case, while The Lego Movie was an enjoyable film, it's harder to enjoy the cynical tone and often easy humor of the Jump Street reboots. Although I must admit I did enjoy 22 Jump Street a bit more than the first one. There were some truly humorous moments which appeal to the liberal (again, in the American way) in me. But as with a lot of movies that aim at teenagers and twenty-somethings, it just fell short in so many ways that finally the short-lived moment of entertainment ended as soon as the credits rolled over the screen."

","A really terrible sequel compared to the first part. It's just likable in a mediocre sort of way. It tries way too hard to show that it's not trying that hard to be unique or different from the first one, which feels really lame. Most of the jokes seem too silly or repeated. The only memorable scene is where Channing Tatum couldn't stop laughing after he finds out that Jonah Hill is sleeping around with their Captain's daughter. Even the weird and mouthy character who's Maya's roommate was interesting and funny.

","Two cups go under cover as college students in order to find who sales dangerous drugs there after the death of a student. To be honest, I haven't seen 21 jump street, so I don't know if the previous one was better than 22 jump street. So I am only going to review this with no comparisons to the other movie. Now, what I didn't like was the failure to make something original. It had some good moments, and some funny moments, but overall it wasn't unique, it reminded me of other comedies, that apart from the theme of course. The ending was bad too, but I am not going to discuss it further because I don't want to ruin it. I liked Jonah Hill, he was funny, and Ice Cub. I guess when you are watching a film with Channing Tatum you don't observe his acting talent but rather his muscles, that were really well displayed, so I can't have an opinion on his performance. It didn't make me tired to watch, which is a good thing too, and it had just the right amount of action for a movie that is rated as a comedy. So 5 out of 10."

","22 Jump Street 7/10- I loved 21 Jump Street to say the least, it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Needless to say, I had pretty high hopes for 22 Jump Street. I was satisfied with the results, not overly impressed, but satisfied with the sequel. While 22 Jump Street suffers from sequel prone receptiveness, it still delivers on good humor, a well enough thought out plot, and solid chemistry from the lead actors: Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. <br/><br/>Even though this film says that it is basically doing the same exact stuff in the first one, if you do a joke a second time, it is almost never as funny as the first. The Hangover Part II definitely told everyone that. I get that sending youngish looking cops into a school demands some of the same routine, but I was expecting at the very least a different approach on it. Now, they did do a different approach on some of the routine, but if the director did this for all of it, the movie would have benefited. I also believe that this film lost some of the concepts that made it so hilarious to begin with. The main one being that Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are just regular cops, not a couple of James Bonds where every little thing can cause an explosion. They played this well in the first film, but it seems like they forgot about it in the second film. There was other little stuff that bugged me, but that comes with every movie. The only other thing that I would have changed was the ending credits scene, which was funny, but over- extended. <br/><br/>I thought the casting for this film was really done well. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have such great chemistry together that it is hard not to laugh when they are together. Ice Cube is an easy pick for an angry captain and plays it very nicely. Most of the returning cast was probably the best actors of the film, but the new members still kept the scenes they were in entertaining. The new gags were probably my favorite part of the film, I do not want to give any of them away, but they nearly had me on the floor laughing. <br/><br/>I liked that 22 Jump Street was set on a much bigger stage, the first film had to do the ground work, but I was glad it was taken to a new level. With a new stage came a much broader range of jokes and gags that helped this picture differentiate from the original. It was also a nice change of pace to see Channing Tatum as the one having fun and Jonah Hill as the one who was having a hard time getting through the case (which is what I thought was going to happen in the first film). Football was a nice touch to the storyline, even if it was very hard to believe. The only thing I would have changed about it was to go away from the same cliché of football players being dumb, hard headed jocks. I thought taking Channing Tatum parkour skills to a new level was a nice change of pace. The plot twists kept you on your toes for most of the film and this Jump Street franchise still did well at making fun of the past buddy-cop Hollywood movies. <br/><br/>Hands-down funniest movie out right now. Its been a while since a solid comedy has come into theaters and I recommend you take advantage of that and see this film in theaters(only if you like to laugh though).<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

","""I want you to do exactly what you did last time!"" bawls Captain Dickson (Ice Cube). No-one really expected 21 Jump Street (2012), a re-boot of a long-dead TV show, to be a hit. But it was, and a hit spells sequel in Hollywood. And so returning directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, fresh off the colossal success of The Lego Movie (2014), use 22 Jump Street as a canvas to riff-on the idea of sequels. Actually, to label it as a canvas is not doing it justice - Lord and Miller, two of the wackiest and most inventive directors of our time, stretch it out, beat it with a hammer, and make a strange yet lovable mess out of it.<br/><br/>Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) do exactly what their captain says and head to college, going undercover to bust yet another drug ring. The film embraces repetition wholeheartedly, all the with a winning wink to camera, so we have a Vietnamese Jesus (as opposed to Korean), a suspicious teacher, explosive action-movie car chases, homoerotic bonding, an accidental drug intake, and plenty of scantily-clad ladies. It's a formula that has worked once already - the first film was a hoot and Tatum truly excelled - so the director's laugh at their own willingness to bend to demand and their audience's willingness to lap it up, but never in an offensive way. Lord and Miller make sure you're in on the joke.<br/><br/>But simply acknowledging the cliché doesn't necessarily mean that it makes for entirely satisfying viewing. The jokes are clever, yes, but it still means that we have to sit through a very similar film as we did the first. This is where Lord and Miller's energy really becomes important, as the visual pizazz and the sheer momentum of the one-liners and zippy editing prove an easy distraction from what could have ultimately been a one-joke movie. In one inspired scene, Schmidt and Jenko trip on Why-Phy (the new drug), with Schmidt having a bummer and Jenko euphoric. They share a split screen, each in their own weird little world, as Schmidt tries to break the barrier into Jenko's more colourful trip. It's a crazy scene, especially for a widespread release, but delivered with such commitment that it proves a ballsy move.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the action scenes get in the way, offering plenty of gunshots and explosions but never really rise above the kind of thing we've been given before in the old action movies it's lampooning. Other aspects also don't quite work - Schmidt's relationship with the gorgeous Maya (Amber Stevens) just feels unrealistic, Queen Latifah's appearance as Dickson's wife spawns a few jokes that simply don't work, and the whole thing feels over- long. But when it sticks with it's heroes, the film is consistently laugh-out-loud funny, and Tatum again delivers a performance that will leave many scratching their heads in disbelief at the idea that this is indeed the same person as the pouting, dead-eyed t**t from Step Up (2006).<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","22 Jump Street is the latest summer comedy. It features Jonah Hill as Shmit and Channing Tatum as Jenko once again. But not everything is as it seems....no wait it is. 22 Jump Street has an identical plot to 21 Jump Street. Go undercover, find the dealer of a new drug, and take him or her down. Its usually very hard for a sequel to do any better then the original. But 22 Jump Street lives up to and in some ways passes 21 Jump street. Yes, the premise is the same. But it seems like this film had more energy pumped into it. I don't know if it was better acting, directing, or jokes but whatever it was it worked. The film moves along quickly with Jonah and Channing hoisting it up. With out their energetic honest performances this film very well could have flopped. Putting their soul into every joke and scene. It really made for good cinema. And once the film nears the end It gets even better. The jokes fly at 100 miles per hour. They never stop, even through the clunky bits. There are moments in the movie that are wasted or could've been done better. For example, The scenes when the leads get high unexpectedly. This also happens in the first film and its a riot. But here its only used to serve later in the movie. Which is good but it really didn't do anything and wasn't that funny. Its also surprisingly unpredictable. New clues popping up about the investigation left and right. Pointing to different people each time. It's fun to see each shred of evidence actually mean something. And once everything connects and you see the true drug dealer it catches you off guard. Once the this movie hits the credits it even gets better which is always a great thing. Showing fake parodies of future Jump Street movies. It was hilarious. All in all 22 Jump Street is a slight improvement on the first. Yet a lazily written plot holds this film back from greatness. The heart and soul that jonah and channing put in is well worth it on its own. This movie is hilarious and fast paced. Nearly, the perfect summer blockbuster."

As far as I'm concerned, if a movie has a single moment that can generate that, it is a good movie.<br/><br/>On the other hand, in a classic Scooby Doo fashion, the plot was very predictable. It was not hard to know in advance what was going to happen, almost scene by scene. <br/><br/>So if you want some good laughs, rent the DVD. It is worth it. Alone, with someone else, sober, drunk, doesn't matter. There is at least one scene in which you'll feel like you're going to get sick from so much laughing.

","22 Jump Street, a sequel to 2012's 21 Jump Street, which was a remake of the 1981 television drama 21 Jump Street, so it's safe to say that this idea has been around the track a few times. In this episode, we find Jenko and Schmidt immediately following where we left them in 2012, to recreate the exact same story we saw two years ago with minor details tweaked here and there. In a nutshell this movie is funny, it's a mockery, it's laughing at its own stupidity, and absolutely nothing more comes from it. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill return to star as the leads. Both do an excellent job, as it is clear that they now know for sure what kind of movie they are making: a movie thriving off of stupidity, and they grasp that well. Hill has his classic awkward character he often plays that is thoroughly entertaining, feeding off of a script written to match this dork of a character. As good a job as Hill does, I was honestly entertained more by Tatum's performance. The more solemn character who says just the right thing at just the right, or wrong, time is always a delight, and Tatum executes this marvelously. The two leads were great and without their willingness to do whatever it was they did during filming, this movie could have easily been horrible. In the main supporting role we find Ice Cube, who frankly pained me every time I would see him appear on screen. His character was so incredibly forced, and whether or not this was intentional, it was surely not pleasurable. Also co-starring are Jillian Bell, who was very entertaining with the short on screen time she was given, Amber Stevens, Wyatt Russell, Peter Stormare, and briefly Nick Offerman, with that identical character seen in every film of his which never fails to spark some laughter. Returning to the director's chairs are Phillip Lord and Christopher Miller, directing a script penned by Michael Bacall, Oren Uziel, Rodney Rothman, and star Jonah Hill. I believe the charm of this movie was a result of the latter four's work. When sitting down to write the screenplay, it is clear that the writers were well aware of the fact that they were doing a sequel to a remake of a five season, 102 episode TV show. The best part is, they grasped that. As opposed to trying to escape the fast current of making a formula sequel, they chose to hop right in and race to the front, and then mock themselves for it. Directly throwing in lines such as ""keep it like the first time"" or ""it worked the first time, so let's do the same thing"" right into the dialogue of the film. That's what this movie is all about. Sure it has characters and a storyline, but more than anything the filmmakers are taking a look at the profession they work in and what has become the easy money in that field, and then ridiculing it. The funny thing is, in doing so, they made the easy money too. I didn't particularly like this movie; I felt it went on too long and there was zero closure at the end of the film, but that doesn't really matter. This is a movie made to be stupid, and it was, and I laughed. I give 22 Jump Street a 7.8/10."
"dfranzen70","9","0","4","22 June 2014"," Come for the witty banter! Stay for the post-credits!
","Yes! 22 Jump Street is even better than the original movie. Or the TV show, for that matter. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have terrific chemistry, perhaps the best in comic cop movies since some guys named Gibson and Glover (over and over) were roaming the streets of LA. The laughs come fast and furious and are generally not of a PG nature, although apparently that was of no concern to the family of four behind me in the theater.<br/><br/>Officers Jenko (Tatum) and Schmidt (Hill) are now enrolled in college, trying to nail down the source of a new designer drug (again) that's overtaking the campus. They remain in their high-school guises from the first film, mismatched brothers. Their handler, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), is sort of glad to see the boys again, since their previous success resulted in a huge budget increase. Which he exploits to the hilt. (I wonder if he ever did get that shark tank.)<br/><br/>Anyway, Jenko and Schmidt try to find out where the new drug WHYPHY (""Work hard - why? Play hard - why?) is coming from. Their only lead is a photo of one student buying it from another, with one of the students later winding up dead. Jenko pals around with the jocks, which include possible suspects Zook (Wyatt Russell, Kurt's son) and Rooster (Jimmy Tatro), while Schmidt falls into the boho scene, meeting cute with Maya (Amber Stevens), to whom he develops a kind of liking.<br/><br/>For those of us who thought that the title sounded pretty lame, well, it's better than ""21 Jump Street 2,"" right? And of course, this film being as self-aware as a film can be, there's a reason - Jump Street HQ is now located across the street from the old place, since the Koreans wanted their church back. Makes sense.<br/><br/>Much of the plot does indeed follow that of the first film, but as Chief Hardy (Nick Offerman) tells them, the boys should handle this case the same way they handled the high-school one. It's what the brass wants! But the taking-down-the-bad-guys plot is only window dressing for the real problem, the conflict between the partners as they discover that they've become more different than they were in ""high school."" Is it possible that they'll need to go their separate ways in order to finish this case? Will this be the last case? Well, no, that's not likely. But the first one is possible. Remember, in 21 Jump Street, somehow Schmidt was the cool guy and Jenko was the schlub who had to hang out with the AV guys (who, naturally saved the day). This time, not so much - Jenko is a BMOC, what with the being strong and apparently immune to alcohol and such. Schmidt is now the one with some doubts about their partnership, and that's the real story behind the story. He can't follow in Jenko's path, or even walk alongside him, because people like the jocks don't want him around. And suddenly Jenko sees his partner as a hindrance, someone preventing him from his true calling - football player. <br/><br/>Much mirth is made of the similarities between the duo's partnership and a full-blown emotional relationship. At one point they even visit a psych professor (well, it's to get info about a patient who had taken WHYPHY, but still) and wind up revealing more of their feelings than they may have intended.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine better casting for the roles of Jenko and Schmidt. Tatum and Hill appear to have been working together for decades, honing an act to impeccable heights, so good is their banter. But the fun doesn't stop with them - Ice Cube is a terror as a father and a cop, Rob Riggle and Dave Franco happily reprise their roles from 21 Jump Street (the movie), there's another cameo of a veteran of the ""old"" TV show, and both Amber Stevens and Jillian Bell (playing Maya's roommate) are killer good. Also on hand is the usually oily Peter Stormare as, surprise, the bad guy.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, I'm much more inclined to laugh out loud at a movie while at home than when I'm at the theater, but I couldn't stop laughing (or giggling, possibly when Jenko and Schmidt inadvertently take some of the designer drug). The movie was that funny. 22 Jump Street is definitely as good as the first, and for my money it's a step up."

","I was a big fan of 21 Jump street so going into 22 Jump Street I was pretty excited and though I was not disappointed I was not blown away either. 22 Jump Street has a lot of similarities to 21 Jump Street and they even joke about that fact throughout the movie which is pretty funny. Even though it's so similar in so many ways it still seems fresh it does not just feel like a rehash of the first one. The plot revolves around Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum going to collage to catch underground drug dealers and like the first time around stupidity follows and it's pretty entertaining.<br/><br/>The acting was all around good in this movie. I really don't understand why Channing Tatum in particular gets so much hate about his acting because just like in 21 Jump Street the fact that he is pretty much Hollywoods favorite pretty boy right now does not mean that he can't act. Jonah Hill is of course funny as always and it was also cool to see Jillian from Workaholics in something else. For me the big surprise in this movie as far as acting goes was Ice Cube. Every scene he was in was hilarious. All of the villains were good though maybe a bit generic but still for a movie that is a comedy above all else that is okay with me. For a comedy though both this movie as well as 21 Jump Street both did a great job with the action though I think it was just a tiny bit better this time around.<br/><br/>Overall I personally liked the first movie a Little more than this one but they are still both great comedy movies and 22 Jump Street is definitely the funniest movie I have seen so far this year.<br/><br/>I give 22 Jump Street a 8/10"

","Greetings again from the darkness. In this day of 3 minute trailers that give away the best gags, if one can walk out of a comedy having laughed a few times, it must be deemed a success. Such is the case with this sequel to 21 Jump Street (2012), which was borne from the 1980's TV show of the same name.<br/><br/>A couple of years ago, officers Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) went undercover at a high school to bring down drug dealers. This time, they head to a local college for the same purpose. If that sounds like a re-tread, at least the film acknowledges such. In a scene with Nick Offerman, a few minutes of self-parody are devoted to the mis-givings of re-do's ... even with double the budget! Co-directors (back from the first) make this film the butt of its own joke, and for the most part, that approach works.<br/><br/>The best buddy comedies work because of two things: the script and the rapport of the leads. The pairing of Jonah and Tatum works very well, even when we get the predictable split into liberal arts and sports (take a stab which actor gets which assignment). There are a couple of actresses who play vital supporting roles - Amber Stevens as Schmidt's love interest, and Jillian Bell in an offbeat and quite funny take as the nemesis. Oddly enough, Jenko's relationship is a bro-mance on the football team with the QB played by Wyatt Russell (Kurt and Goldie's son). One of the poor decisions was to quadruple the screen time for Ice Cube ... his antics are funny in limited doses. Very limited.<br/><br/>There are some terrific ""old man"" jokes, as well as references to Maya Angelou and Tracy Morgan ... both who have been in the news for less-than-uplifting reasons lately. Most will find the best sequence to be after the movie ends and before the credits begin. The mock sequels (23 Jump Street, 24 ...) appear in rapid fire mode with a couple of cameos and some creative ""schools"". While the movie wobbles between spot on and over-the-top, it delivers what we expect ... a funny enough sequel to a funny enough tribute movie."
