","Fans of Michael Haneke's more morally shocking films such as 'Funny Games', 'Benny's Video' or the draining 'Time of the Wolf' might find themselves surprised by the quieter and slower analysis of evil in his latest work 'Das Weisse Band'. <br/><br/>The action takes place in a North German village shortly before the outbreak of the First World War and in structure presents a number of subtly drawn individual characters as they are caught up in a mysterious series of violent events. <br/><br/>In the hands of a mere moralist this could be an unbearable few hours. But it's credit to Haneke's skill as a film-maker that we are utterly caught up and absorbed by a large cast of children and adults.<br/><br/>One of the on-going arguments in Haneke's films appears to be the origins of human evil, or perhaps more precisely put, individual acts of evil behaviour. Are such acts an individual's responsibility or do they spring from a climate in which particular energies are at work? This is the question Haneke appears to be exploring here (just as was a central question relating to French society in 'Cache').<br/><br/>One of the most disturbing things at the heart of the film is the fact that we do not know why particular acts of evil take place (including the maiming of a disabled child and the beating of a nobleman's son), or even who commits them. However, this is no 'whodunnit', although with its retrospective voice-over from the School Teacher's p.o.v. we are let to believe for a long time that were in a crime/thriller genre.<br/><br/>Throughout his body of work so far, Haneke has suggested that looking for the sort of easy answers films and TV all too readily supply is partly responsible for our misunderstanding how violence in society occurs. (Funny Games). <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' bypasses the usual dramatical devices of motivation and blame and instead softly focuses on an environment (in this case Germany in the first quarter of the Twentieth Century) in which certain unhealthy energies are at work. <br/><br/>These energies include an emotionally repressed and joyless Protestantism, the mistreatment and oppression of women, the familial abuse of children, the fetishism of strong masculine and patriarchal values, and the un-breachable divide between the rich and the poor. Set over all this, like an umbrella, is the fact that the small provincial society depicted in the film is all but completely isolated from wider society.<br/><br/>Another poster here has pointed out that Haneke is using his village as a microcosm to reflect Germany as a whole, and I would agree with that. Haneke's Dorf, whilst having an individual character, is a relative of Von Trier's Dogville in the sense that it stands for a larger set of national values. In this respect Haneke seems to be diagnosing German society in the run up to the 'Great' War as one of authoritarianism, religious doubt, intolerance, and fear.<br/><br/>What is remarkable in such a film is how little human joy or love is to be found in such a seemingly idyllic rural landscape. The love strand (between the narrator Teacher and the dismissed 17 yr old children's nurse) has a rather strained aspect. It is as though the film maker is suggesting that affection might also be down to available opportunity. <br/><br/>One of the most moving scenes in The White Ribbon is when a young child brings his father, a Priest, a caged bird he has nursed back to health. The father's beloved pet canary was killed (by his daughter as a protest against the bleak, loveless household she's been reared in - a home in which a father shows more affection to a small bird than his own children. <br/><br/>Thus the scene symbolically depicts a child demonstrating the love that the parent himself is unable of showing. Tears fill the priest's eyes. It is a tiny moment of love and hope in an otherwise emotionally barren wasteland. It is also a symbol of how a new generations of Germans have dealt with, and healed, previous decades of pain."

","Admittedly, I was underwhelmed at its conclusion. I knew it was something great, especially in construction and visual prowess, yet I couldn't shake that feeling of clouded mediocrity. And then, after talking about it with my friend for an hour or two afterwards, it hit me. Haneke has intentionally filled our minds with detail upon detail, setting up conspiracies and unsolved mysterious, leading us to believe things only to plant clues that refute them. Looking back, I found that each second stuck in my head; I couldn't shake even the minutest detail because it might hold the key to solving this puzzle. Deaths, tragedies, and accidents are happening every day, possibly connected, but how? Our narrator, the town's schoolteacher played by Christian Friedel, is relaying the events that occurred before being sent off to fight once the Archduke Ferdinand is assassinated. He believes the strange attitude and mysterious activities all began with a freak accident of the doctor. Riding his horse back home, he is thrown off when its legs trip on a wire spanning two trees, causing a lengthy hospital stay to recover. Next come a death, a kidnapping, and a beating, all unsolved despite hunches and hypotheses going through the town. Something is in the air, but what it is and what will come of it is unknown.<br/><br/>The children are the key to everything. They are the easiest to blame, as it seems they are always there by the tragedies. Definitely hiding something, the kids begin to stare authority in the eye and practice what has been preached. Haneke mentions in an interview attached to the press notes that he wanted to show the sort of ""black"" education going on at the time, breeding Fascism and terror. Good and evil fall to strict black and white, every action has a reaction, a punishment to set things right. The children are of an age that they are beginning to understand that life is not eternal, there are consequences in their actions and the adults are not afraid to tell them so. When you don't follow the rules, you will be caned, (a brilliant scene showing the young siblings enter the room, but allowing the audience to only see the closed door during the abuse), and you will have to wear the white ribbon in order to show the world your transgressions and need to earn back the right to be free, (the precursor to the Jewish stars perhaps?).<br/><br/>What about the adults? What about those practicing adultery, or abuse of power, or destruction of property, or sexual abuse with a child? Who has the right to punish them? When, after the second kidnapping and beating of a young boy, a note is found stating intentions, that the children of transgressors will be discipline for four to five generations, you start to see the severity of the actions—as well as allusions to the Holocaust and the mass genocide of an entire people, rooting out the ""evils"" of the world by excising the entire population, killing the bloodline at the source. But it can't be the children, right? They are too young and innocent, unknowing of the world set before them. Yet with the upbringing in this town, treated as adults with responsibilities and accountability, anyone would grow up fast. Cause a raucous in class and be chastised; be the leader and stand in the corner. Forgiveness is a liability. When the oldest girl, and leader of the wolves if you believe the children are the monsters, Klara, (wonderfully portrayed by Maria-Victoria Dargus), is ready to accept Communion, her own father, the pastor, (a menacing man of authority realized by Burghart Klaussner), pauses, contemplating whether she deserves it. You know he doesn't want to give in, family bond means nothing.<br/><br/>Haneke has woven a tapestry of intrigue that will keep you on edge throughout. The anticipation of a solution is palpable, and the fact it is never released makes this film so riveting and unforgettable. The payoff is that these children will grow up into the generation that becomes the Nazi party, making this sleepy rural town a breeding ground for young Fascists that will change the world. Retribution is being taught, atoning for ones sins practiced. World War II is after all an answer to the punishment inflicted on Germany after the first, isn't it? It's a cycle of getting back, proving one's pride, and seeking revenge upon the children of the enemy if the enemy itself is unavailable. God's will has to be upheld and that intrinsic fact is ingrained in the minds of the youth. When Martin, an effective Leonard Proxauf, is discovered walking along the railing of a high bridge, he responds to the yelling of the man that finds him with the line used to title this review. If what he was doing was wrong—we can only infer on his role in the incidents occurring around him—then God would have let him fall, paying for his sins. But the fact that he gets to the other side unscathed only proves his work is that of the creator of man. Haneke says he had another name for the film, God's Right Hand, and I think it would have been just as appropriate a title. A powerful film, sharing so much information without any answers; it takes our mind into overdrive, trying so hard to find a reason for it all. But sometimes there are none; sometimes bad things just happen. You can only speculate and hope to prevent them from ever happening again."
"anjru","8","163","202","17 January 2010"," Haunting Prequel to the Third Reich
","Filmed beautifully in black and white with subtitles, The White Ribbon is a movie that will leave viewers with a lasting residue long after it ends. The film portrays the residents of a northern German village, dominated by a baron, sometime before World War I. <br/><br/>Inhabitants of this village, young and old, are sliding down the slippery slope of moral decline. The men in leadership positions - a doctor and clergyman, for example - are detestable, especially in their treatment of women and children. The most brutal scene in the movie, perhaps, was not one that portrayed physical violence, but verbal abuse towards a woman that served faithfully as caretaker, and more, for the town's widowed physician. As for the some of the children, although it is only suggested, it appears that they are budding sociopaths that perpetrate despicable acts against others. <br/><br/>Weeks after seeing this film, I started thinking more deeply about the children in this town. I realized that they would become young adults during the time Hitler would rise in power. They live an incubator in which the cruelty that they experience they, in turn, perpetrate against unsuspecting victims. Their circumstances are such that they are being unwittingly primed for carrying out the atrocities that will come to characterize their future in Nazi Germany. The White Ribbon is a prequel for the rise of the Third Reich. <br/><br/>Seeing this film led me to wonder about what present times are a prequel for."
"howard.schumann","10","191","241","19 October 2009"," Creates an impeccable sense of time and place
","Strange things happen in a small rural village in pre-World War I Germany. The local doctor is thrown from his horse and seriously injured because of a trip wire stretched between two trees; the wife of a farm worker is killed when she falls through a rotted barn door; a young boy is beaten and tied upside down; the son of the Doctor's mistress, a boy with Down syndrome, is blinded in a fierce assault; and the Baron's barn is set on fire. These incidents and others create a climate of fear and suspicion in Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon, winner of the coveted Palme D'Or Award at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. It is the kind of climate in which a hornet's nest of guilt, repression, and abusive behavior that have been festering in the community for years begins to surface.<br/><br/>Created and written by the director with an assist from award-winning screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere, the film is shot in high contrast black and white and narrated by the village schoolteacher (Christian Freidel), the film's most sympathetic character, many years after the events have taken place. Though the film is dark, the courtship between the young teacher and the Baron's nanny, a shy 17-year-old Eva (Leonie Benesch) lightens the mood considerably, almost a necessity in a film that stretches to almost two and a half hours and can be a grim experience.<br/><br/>Although the children are named, the adults are referred to only in terms of the role they play in the village: the Baron, the Pastor, the Farmer, and the Doctor. The most powerful person in the village is the wealthy Baron (Ulrich Tukur) who employs most of the farmers and laborers. His wife (Ursina Lardi) is a woman of culture who looks upon the uneducated people in the village with disdain. It is a patriarchal society in which repressive and puritanical rules are rigidly enforced, everyone knows their place and, if they forget, the club of religion is used to make sure that they remember. In the meantime, acts of cruelty toward women and children are kept secret.<br/><br/>The worst hypocrite is the pastor (Burghart Klaussner) who preaches about God's love but physically punishes his two oldest children Klara (Maria-Victoria Dragus) and Martin (Leonard Proxauf) and humiliates them by tying a white ribbon on them as a symbol of the purity and innocence they should strive for. He even has the boy's hands tied to the side of his bed at night so he won't masturbate. The doctor (Rainer Block) who cares for the villagers by day shames his mistress (Susanne Lothar) at night by means of cruel verbal assaults. As the bizarre incidents pile up, the mystery deepens as to the identity of the perpetrator(s) and even the police are called in but all they can do is to browbeat a young girl who claims to have predicted one of the beatings in a dream.<br/><br/>The White Ribbon stirs up images of the Germany that would emerge years later under Hitler and there is a strong suggestion that the way the children are constantly punished for minor infractions played a role in that development, creating a vicious circle in which the distorted values of the parents are internalized by the children. Reminiscent of the austerity of Carl Dreyer's Ordet, The White Ribbon creates an impeccable sense of time and place, succeeding as an engrossing mystery, an insightful character study, and a cautionary tale that suggests that the roots of war and hatred lie not in ideology but in the corruption of our values and the emptiness in our souls. It is not difficult to see how the Jews in that setting could become scapegoats for that emptiness."
"molecule18","9","119","164","6 January 2010"," This is a movie against all extremisms
","In an interview with the French newspaper ""Le Monde"" on 10/20/09, published on 10/21/09, Michael Haneke has explicitly and unequivocally declared his intentions in making the movie ""The White Ribbon"":<br/><br/>He intended to make a movie about the roots of evil. He said that he believed that the environment of extreme, punitive and sexually repressive protestantism in Germany, has laid the groundwork for Fascism and Nazism. He also said that he saw the same patterns developing in fundamentalist Muslim societies today, and that it is those societies that today were spawning terrorists and suicide bombers. Finally, he expressed the sentiment that ""The White Ribbon"" is a movie against ALL extremisms.<br/><br/>Michael Haneke has directed his vision in a very masterful and artful way: the cinematography, the acting, and the script are all superb. <br/><br/>The only problem I have is with the vision itself: The environment certainly plays a role, but to explain evil exclusively as the product of one's environment is simplistic and goes against common sense observation: The majority of people on this earth have grown up under repressive regimes and yet have NOT turned out to become murderers, mass murderers, terrorists or suicide bombers. Something is missing in the equation."
"mensch-2","10","189","267","21 May 2009"," Exquisite and brooding mood-piece
","Few film auteurs can match the consistency of Michael Haneke, and once again the Austrian filmmaker has come up trumps with an exquisite and brooding mediation on repression, tradition and the sins of the father. <br/><br/>Shot in stunning black and white, the film chronicles a series of mysterious events in a town leading up to the outbreak of WWI. The pace is slow and thoughtful, and the film is reference to August Sander while being a respectful throwback to the German expressionists whose work would come out of the horrors the film's narrative seems to foreshadow. <br/><br/>The hallmarks of Haneke's body of work are all there – elegiac tone, clinical editing, wincingly frank dialogue – but in many ways The White Ribbon stands alone in the canon. It is a challenging work that will polarise audiences but represents a breathtaking new wave not just in the director's career but in European cinema. <br/><br/>Some might say the film's inherent flaw is that there is no-one to root for, but this is perhaps its key strength. It's certainly plausible that this is Haneke's intention: he wants to position us as mute outsiders to a slowly creeping menace, unable to have a say in the invisible horrors that await us. The result is a deadening and thoroughly rewarding experience - a combination few filmmakers could hope to achieve."
"mehmet_kurtkaya","9","132","188","23 October 2009"," Nurturing Fascism Somewhere in Black and White Germany
","During the course of the year before WWI, a series of tragic and suspicious looking incidents take place in a small farming village somewhere in black and white Germany. The culprit or the culprits behind the crime wave will not be too easy to find.<br/><br/>The doctor, the priest, the baron and the teacher who also narrates the film form the elite of the village. We get to know each one of them and a few other villagers along with children of this village, calm on the surface but deeply tormented by an undercurrent of brutality, envy, malice and apathy.<br/><br/>The children's natural path to maturity is blocked by strict religious morality, cruelly enforced by the priest, thereby inhibiting their personal observation of the world around them. The priest feeds children with guilt and sexual repression instead of love and punishes even their most innocent mistakes. Certainly this environment will make it easy for them to not only accept but seek ruthless authority later in life.<br/><br/>As might be expected, love in this town is restrained and uneasy, while incest and affairs are overlooked by villagers. The Baron employs half of the village in his farm, yet almost no one seems to be against feudalism, nor rise up against the accidents that happen in the workplace. Social justice is a stranger to town, yet villagers are entrenched in apathy.<br/><br/>If adults do not face up the truth, however this truth might be against their convictions, rise up and take charge, then who will? And according to whose morality? Isn't fascism with racism, in short Nazism, misdirected popular anger and an easy response to deep injustices within a society ? Haneke observes mostly psychological, educational and religious roots of Nazism while leaving economic aspects mostly in the background.<br/><br/>Visuals of the film are very solid. The symmetry in the shots and the tidiness of the houses, even of those belonging to the poor farmers hint at the discipline and rigor Germans are well known for. Acting is top notch by the whole cast, especially children's faces beam just like in Bergman films. Directing was superb.<br/><br/>Haneke uses a village and a narrator similar in essence to Lars Von Trier's Dogville, still these two movies are clearly different.<br/><br/>Das Weisse Band has also some similarities to Cache, but just one notch less satisfying than his masterpiece which had a slightly more intriguing and fulfilling story. This movie is made more accessible by Haneke with his choice of more obvious tips, where sometimes characters talk directly about the situation. But in a time and age when people are battling too many problems and drug themselves with TV and easy payoffs who could blame Haneke? <br/><br/>Given the current global economic conditions and the fanaticism running high across all three major religions, this is a must-see movie for anyone caring about the future of our global village to avoid a Le Temps du Loup type of ending!"
"markgorman","9","85","119","15 November 2009"," Intense and very rewarding
","Michael Haneke; infant terrible of the art cinema world is not to everyone's taste. He doesn't exactly make action movies.<br/><br/>But the movie did win the Palme d'or at Cannes this year so certainly the critics liked it.<br/><br/>It's long and it moves at a slow but steady pace. It's black and white (often dimly lit) but beautifully realised. In fact at times the cinematography is so beautiful that it's like a moving Ansell Adams. It is variously graded throughout with the merest hint of a cream or a brown creeping in from time to time that creates some variety. It's mesmerising.<br/><br/>And it's weird. Really weird.<br/><br/>Apparently, and this is not blindingly obvious, it is an allegorical take on the birth of fascism.<br/><br/>It's yet another movie where the heavy hand of religion gets the blame for most evil. The pastor of the remote German village that it is set in, in the lead up to the First World War, is a central character and is the sort we've seen many times before (The Magdalene Sisters being a good example). Outwardly pious; inwardly, and to his family, a callous and vicious bastard. Quick to blame, shame and moralise. His presence throughout is powerful and visceral.<br/><br/>The dawning of fascism is subtly portrayed because no politics enter the film overtly at any point. Class wars and sexual politics do though in what is clearly a male dominated culture and one where sexual transgression is rife (child abuse, domestic abuse, illicit masturbation and secret affairs are all featured).<br/><br/>But it's the children (spookily played by one and all in a sort of village of the damned way) that steal the film. They appear to be forces of evil and if not (the plot is never explained and the strange occurrences left to hang - it is Haneke after all) they are certainly victims of it.<br/><br/>Haneke seems to be saying that the rise of fascism came out of this age of suppression and a sense of revenge - after all the destruction of the Jews is often taken as a form of revenge for their post WWI success.<br/><br/>Haneke makes films like only Haneke makes films. Some people find them slow and boring. I think he follows in the style of that French New Wave of the 60's but with a better grip on audience manipulation. He makes thought provoking masterpieces and this is another one.<br/><br/>Simply wonderful."

"Galina_movie_fan","10","46","68","4 September 2010"," ""A horror drama, free from horror images""
","Stunningly beautiful, shot in the exquisite black and white, with the faces of the characters looking like the old pictures from the beginning of the 20th century, The White Ribbon has the longer title in German, Das weiße Band, Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte -The White Ribbon - A German Children's Tale. The longer title gives quite a good idea behind the mystery of the troubling, disturbing, and shocking events in the film that did not have an explanation by the end of the film and left some viewers confused and unsatisfied. I think that the film is very clear and if approached with the open mind and readiness to accept the subtle details in the storytelling and implication, the open end will not disappoint. Anybody who is familiar with the work of Michael Haneke knows very well that he does not make pure mystery/thrillers even though his movies have a lot of mysteries and often very dark secrets By his own admissions, he uses the mystery in the White Ribbon to show the origins of the extremism of all epochs, and what could have been the beginning of the darkest times in the history of the country. Looking at the life of one small picturesque village in the northern Germany just on the brink of the World War 1, Haneke explores the malice, envy, apathy, hatred, and brutality that envelop the village like a web, and lead to the outbursts of evil that goes unpunished and will bring the larger evil in the future. While watching the film, I kept thinking how much it brings to mind the films of another master of grim and sad yet compelling and thought provoking pictures, Ingmar Bergman. Two of his films remind The White Ribbon especially. One, The Winter Light, a tragic and thought-provoking film about a village priest (Gunnar Bjornstrand) who can't give much comfort and hope to those who need them as he feels none for himself. Another - Fanny and Alexander, the story told from the point of view of two children, a brother and a sister whose lives changed tragically after their widowed mother married a local bishop, seemingly a charming and caring man. What would have happened to Fanny and Alexander, what kind of persons would they have become or would they have survived had they not had a big dysfunctional but loving family who saved them from the abusive, cruel hypocritical stepfather, Bishop Edvard Vergerus? <br/><br/>Like Bergman, Michael Haneke does not make the horror films but the computer generated monsters are simply a joke comparing to the real monsters of hatred and evil that found a place to hide and grow in the souls and minds of the characters in his latest film. It is a serious, disturbing, and thought-provoking film. With all its darkness and pessimism, the film has sweet, touching and even humorous moments. They have to do with the only love story in the film and come to think of it, the only love story in all Haneke's films I've seen, between the film's narrator, the local school teacher and the 17 years old Eva, the nanny for the children of the baron, the most powerful man in village.<br/><br/>One of the critics said that The White Ribbon is the film that will haunt the viewers for days and will be seen, discussed and thought of for the decades to come. I completely agree with that, and I feel I can watch it again and again. Yes, it is that good."
"tieman64","Null","59","90","17 November 2009"," The Inevitability Of Blowback
","Another excellent film by Haneke. Some points...<br/><br/>1. Haneke's ""Cache"" used a mystery plot as a scaffold to examine the 1961 police massacre of Algerian protesters, an event which he then used as a symbol for the growing unease between France and Arabic minorities, and by extension, the West's mounting paranoia towards Arabs and Islam.<br/><br/>2. Haneke claims that ""The White Ribbon"" is about ""the origins of every type of terrorism, be it of political or religious nature."" This is an important statement, as it provides a guide as to how Haneke intends this film to be viewed.<br/><br/>3. The film takes place in an agricultural village in pre-World War 1 Germany, in which most of the locals work for an aristocratic land baron. Other characters include the local doctor, pastor, teacher, farmers and their respective women/wives/lovers/children.<br/><br/>4. The film is structured around a string of horrific crimes that befall the citizens of the village. But this is not a ""whodunit mystery film"". Instead, like Antonioni's ""Blow Up"" and ""The Adventure"", Haneke's mystery is never resolved, the crimes being used to make a series of far larger statements.<br/><br/>5. This film will appeal to a very limited audience. Like Tarr, Kubrick, Antonioni, Jancso, Wajda and Egoyan, Haneke is a cold, sometimes intellectual, director, who voids his films of narrative crutches and forces his audience to study every minute detail on screen. Like these directors, he uses a variety of distancing techniques, designed to instill an air of quiet contemplation.<br/><br/>6. In true Haneke fashion, the film begins with a confession of artifice, the narrator plainly stating that he is not quite sure whether his story is true or false. Of course the film is far less self-reflexive than ""Cache"", ""Funny Games"" and ""Benny's Video"", mostly because of its period setting.<br/><br/>7. With its stark black and white cinematography, the film works as a counterpoint to Dreyer's ""Ordet"" and Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"", a film which Haneke regards as ""exploitative"".<br/><br/>8. Haneke's Brechtian distancing effects at times feel gimmicky. Consider two scenes, one in which a boy is whipped by his father and another in which a man sits over a bed, his face obscured by a wall. These feel less like genuine attempts at alienation than impotent ""copies of distancing effects"".<br/><br/>9. All the crimes which take place in this film form an intricate web of ""causes"" and ""effects"". The village is a very morbid place, every relationship and interaction poisoned and perverse. Haneke takes aim at the way religion represses people sexually and emotionally, the way it bolsters a social hierarchy in which women are oppressed and mistreated and in which children lay prostrate to an abusive patriarchy which fetishizes masculinity and patriarchal values. He portrays an authoritarian world in which the divide between the rich and the poor is impenetrable, everyone subservient to someone else. This is a dark world in which values become evil the moment there are applied as a social rule, in which jealousies lead to violence and injustices and inequalities lead to various terrorist actions.<br/><br/>10. Haneke has made German, French and English language films. Has any other director so effortlessly hopped from one language to the next?<br/><br/>11. Haneke says his film is not about fascism, but we see clues in ""The White Ribbon"" as to how these German children of 1911 will later become either Nazis, Nazi supporters or men and women violently opposed to fascism. The seeds of a macabre future are being sown here.<br/><br/>12. The last scene of the film is a simple shot in which all the villagers gather and sit down within a church. The image then very slowly fades to black. This shot is intended to mirror a cinema audience, the seated villagers being a carefully composed reflection of the film's audience members. Haneke's point: recognise yourself.<br/><br/>13. Note that the 2 child victims in the film (the Baron's boy and the handicapped child) are not subjected to the harsh social structures which affect everyone else in the village. In some ways, they are jealously punished for the very freedoms they possess. Note too that whilst all the adult women are subservient and dutiful, trapped in an abusive system, the female children possess an outsiders view which allows them to question and rebel against the very system that entraps their mothers.<br/><br/>14. Many have complained that none of the crimes are resolved, but with a little detective work the diligent viewer can make educated guesses as to who performed each of the crimes and needle out their various motivations.<br/><br/>15. Late in the film a caged bird is killed, symbolising the refusal of the ""terrorists"" to become ""domesticated"" or ""subservient"". The owner of the bird then replaces it with another bird which he initially promised to set free. The point: man has abandoned his true parental responsibilities (to nurture and guide that which was born wild) in favour for possession and control. The captive will not be set free, lest he violently breaks away or the captor willingly lets him go.<br/><br/>16. Note the characters whispering in the final shot. Dark futures are being planned here. Note too the final conversation between the pastor and the teacher. This is a battle between ""truth"" and ""curiosity"" vs ""willful delusion"" and ""false beliefs"". The pastor lies to himself in the service up upholding the status quo. <br/><br/>17. Will time be kind to Haneke? He's a great director, but he needs to marry his intellect to stronger visuals.<br/><br/>8.9/10 – A bit too joyless, misanthropic and heavy-handed, but what else should we expect from a director nicknamed ""The Ice King""? Nevertheless, the film has a powerful message, and the relationship between its narrator (a teacher) and a young girl is beautiful, respectful and optimistic. Of course, their age difference and her vulnerability suggests that even their romance is borne of dark opportunity."
"nurika","8","51","82","19 November 2009"," A Masterly Tale on the Circulation of Violence
","White Ribbon focuses on a pre World War I German town and surveys the evolution of violent, wild incidents resembling punishments indicted on certain individuals. We are provided access to the story from the point of view of the town teacher, whose recollective voice-over interposes throughout the film. The narration competently obscures the culprits, thereby attributing the responsibility for the rage, and its (hypocritical) social incorporation to the whole society rather than certain ""abnormal"" characters.<br/><br/>In movie circles,White Ribbon is widely regarded as depicting the evolution of a microcosm of a proto-fascist society (which is to a certain extent viable by the way). However, the movie is a less Germany-specific and more universal parable on the socialization of rage and violence, on the evolution of the social circulation of rage and violence. The film follows a route from local (Germany) to universal, coming up with far reaching arguments, just as Foucault focuses on 18-19th century France and presents arguments on the evolution of prison and punishment systems.<br/><br/>Considering Haneke's entire filmography, it is evident that the director has always been interested in philosophical takes on pschology and human interaction, without historicizing his filmic arguments strictly, i.e., without attributing time spans/societies to them. If we leave the mediocrity of the enterprise aside, Haneke's recent remake of Funny Games shot-for-shot, yet in a different society (USA rather than Germany) fittingly illustrates the point.<br/><br/>After a span of work disappointing for many Haneke fans, the auteur returns with an influential and aptly argumentative film."

","Das Weisse Band represents the kind of cinema that is cerebral, cognitive and dialectic without deviating from the conventions of classic storytelling. In examining the origins and nature of terrorism in human societies and psychology, the film quickly resigns from a simple depiction of country rural life in 1913 and transforms into a sadistic 'whodunnit' thriller with the main protagonists being two conflicting generations: the elderly and the youth. Das Weisse Band takes the risk of setting off too many narratives in accordance to the individual stories that occur, but the utterly terrifying aspect and power-point of the film is what we do not see happening in front of our eyes. Gripping, exciting, focused cinema."

","What do you do when you 'know' there is a very tangible threat but cannot point the finger? Recall, if you will, Jean. Julianne Moore's character in Crash: "" . . . and it was my fault because I knew it was gonna happen. But if a white person sees two black men walking towards her and she turns and walks in the other direction, she's a racist, right?"" Or the dilemma of Islam in Europe. On the one hand, we are impelled to protect the rights of the vulnerable minority. Protect their beliefs. Their innocence. Everything decent within ourselves that we wish to respect and preserve in others. But on the other, we are terrified of the prospect creeping Islamic militancy. We teeter on the brink of racism. Islamophobia. If we risk the sacred humanity in others we attack it in ourselves. And what if all the indications are wrong? What if all our beliefs are wrong? What if all the words led us astray? Too late, we know we have to talk about paedophile priests. Too late, we know we should have talked about Hitler (in the days before, yes before, he was the Bad Guy). Or even World War One before it happened. There are times when we cannot accuse. Times when it will do no good. But still, as Lionel Shiver might say, there are times when we know, 'We need to talk about Kevin.' Haneke confronts the paradox of confronting the unimaginable. Not in the Hollywood sense of 'too scary to think about.' Just confronting something that is outside the ability of the imagination to foreshadow. In Hidden, the format was an intricate art house film that appealed more to the cinema geek. The cult viewer. A brilliant film – but one you would probably need to watch at least twice before you could 'get it.' The White Ribbon is an altogether different genre. The mystery is laid out as carefully as any Hitchcock classic, albeit with the more restrained tones and iconography of Luis Buñuel. There is not the surrealism of his Exterminating Angel, but the clearly delineated social restraints that refuse to acknowledge anything that does not fit, they are all there. A small village on the eve of World War One. A fierce Lutheran Protestantism that will admit no way of thinking unless it is true to the cornerstones of its faith. Ignorance poses as innocence. And the horrors that can spring from deeply ingrained discipline.<br/><br/>Somehow, within a community where everyone knows and trusts each other, a series of very unpleasant incidents occur. A wire is strung to trip the doctor's horse. A disabled boy is brutally attacked. A woman commits suicide. Unexplained arson. The seeds of deadliest emotions are there in a society that allows for nothing except goodness.<br/><br/>Haneke carefully details various forms of patriarchal enforcement of this goodness. It might be righteous anger or compassionate punishment. I recall my philosophy teacher at university saying how some things can be learnt but not taught. Then another professor's dismissal of Aristotle's virtue theory on the basis that it cannot be 'taught.' In this Haneke world of black-and-white moral righteousness, those characters who seek no more than a least worst option seem to come, quite logically, to an untriumphant end. A boy who wants to save a wounded bird. A schoolteacher who wants to reveal with gentleness that which force cannot uncover.<br/><br/>With Funny Games, Haneke shocked with intruders. With Hidden, he forced us to confront a barely solvable mystery. With The White Ribbon, his greatest work yet, a simple story takes on universal proportions. No intruders. No outsiders. We can no longer take refuge in any system of 'universal truth.' Whether it be the science of our sense or the dictates of religion. We must learn as we grow. This White Ribbon is no fairy tale story. It has no fairy tale ending. All is logical. Just that you might never, ever, be able to prove it."
"Buddy-51","6","45","83","9 July 2010"," the very definition of an ""art film""
","Movies don't come much more austere or art-house friendly than ""The White Ribbon,"" a German film written and directed by Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke. With its stark black-and-white cinematography and deliberate pacing, the film has the look and feel of an old Ingmar Bergman picture - Ingmar Bergman crossed with M Night Shyamalan, that is, since its story centers around a village in pre-World War I Germany where strange and inexplicable things begin to happen. The town doctor is injured in a mysterious horseback riding mishap; the baron's son is found hanging upside down in a barn; a worker dies in a freak factory accident. All of this is narrated by the town's schoolteacher (Christian Friedel) who falls for a sweet, shy girl who works as a nanny at the manor house.<br/><br/>The children - most of whom look like they just stepped out of ""Village of the Damned"" - struggle with thoughts of death and the guilt caused by a repressive society, while the adults - an emotionally rigid and unyielding pastor, a cruel, incestuous doctor - contend with their own inner demons, as they groan under the burdens of a class-conscious feudal system and the weight of their own conflicted desires. The theme seems to be that when people bury their natural urges under a crushing mountain of rules and regulations - whether societal or religious in nature - those sublimated urges will manifest themselves in other, demonstrably harmful ways (killing birds, destroying property, kidnapping and torturing children, etc.). The conclusion we're supposed to come to, I guess, is that it was from just such seeds that the war that was to come would eventually spring. I guess.<br/><br/>I wish I could say that I liked ""The White Ribbon"" better than I do. It's certainly wonderful to look at, and there is something haunting and hypnotic about Haneke's vision of life in a small German village at that particular moment in time. But the plotting is so obscure, the pacing so funereal, and the overall demeanor so heavy-handed and pretentious that, I'm afraid, it takes quite a bit of forbearance and patience just to get through it all.<br/><br/>Still, the mood and the visuals make it worth the effort."
"Chris Knipp","9","29","51","7 October 2009"," A portrait of collective evil
","'In The White Ribbon,' the masterful film that won Michael Haneke the Palme d'Or at Cannes this year, the Bavarian-born, Austrian-raised writer-director turns to a period costume drama shot in black and white. He focuses on the year leading up to the outbreak of WWI in a fictitious village called Eichwald in the northern, Protestant part of Germany where the local baron (Ulrich Tukur) employs half the population. It's a time and place where people were unusually evil: Haneke has said something like that about his setting. The story is riveting and its presentation is brilliant -- performances that are memorable and vivid; settings that are authentic-feeling; images that linger in the mind. The effect is chilling and though-provoking.<br/><br/>There is a series of malicious and cruel acts. A trip-wire causes the town doctor's horse to be crippled and the doctor (Rainer Bock) is hospitalized. The baron's little boy Sigi is found tied upside down in a barn, beaten and terrorized; the Down's syndrome child of the midwife is attacked and blinded. There are efforts to chase down the culprit or culprits and at one point the schoolteacher, who narrates the film, speaking long afterward, thinks he has figured it out. But typically for Haneke, as in his widely seen 'Hidden'/'Caché' (2005), it all remains a mystery. If this is a police procedural -- and county police are called in finally to investigate -- it's one that fizzles out. The focus isn't just on criminal acts so much as meanness, such as the protestant minister's harshness toward his own children (whom he torments both physically and psychologically for minor misdeeds); or the farmer's grown son who ruins the baron's cabbage patch during the autumn celebration because he blames the baron for his mother's death in a barn accident, or the doctor's verbal abuse toward his secretary, assistant, and sometime lover. Or even what the baron's wife (Ursina Lardi) says to her husband: ""I can't live in an atmosphere of malice, envy, cruelty and brutality."" For the misfortunes and misdeeds there is much blame, and little forgiveness.<br/><br/>There is a slight sense that this is some kind of artful horror movie about evil children, like 'Village of the Damned.' Particularly in the verbal harshness between couples, the film sometimes seems to go a little too far. Haneke doesn't give you a good time. Whether he's speaking of a suicidal family ('The Seventh Continent'), marauding killer youths ('Funny Games'), modern disconnectedness ('Code Unknown'), a sado-masochistic music teacher ('La Pianiste'), a world of lawlessness and chaos ('The Hour of the Wolf'), a paranoid bourgeois couple ('Caché'), there's a kind of severity and grimness about Haneke's world that, if it works for you, becomes tonic, worth the discomfort. But can we bear the thought that there can be so much nastiness in one little village? Can the elders' (and particularly the minister's) relentless morality cause the children to be more than anything filled with malice? This is why the 'Variety' reviewer justifiably says 'The White Ribbon' ""proves a difficult film to entirely embrace."" But the way Haneke complexly weaves his spell and creates his village society out of dozens of little details is difficult not to admire. Reportedly, the German is full of flowery touches that evoke the period. Few films convey so vivid a sense of a late nineteenth-, early twentieth-century world-view and lifestyle.<br/><br/>The redeeming vision it that of the schoolteacher (Christian Friedel), a shy, plodding, decent fellow, and Eva (Leonie Benesch) the 17-year-old girl who comes from another town to mind the baron's young twins, who catches the teacher's eye and whom he wants to make his bride -- she too, disarmingly decent and sweet. Haneke is as good at making this couple endearing and touching as he is at making the other adults peevish or indifferent or cruel. And that helps quite a lot. As an older man the schoolteacher is the narrator (Ernst Jacobi), and his humane vision and decent voice provide a perspective on the collective evil that seems to dominate events in this unfortunate year.<br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' has an cumulative, episodic structure. One thing happens after another. Things reach a high pitch when the midwife borrows the bicycle the schoolteacher has borrowed, saying she's found out who hurt her son and is going to report it to the police, and then is never seen again. In the end, the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand changes everything, and at the church the town community recognizes that. The narrator explains that he went to war and when he came back moved to another town and never saw the villagers again.<br/><br/>Haneke is extraordinarily good at making his little Eichwald come to life, showing its central square in snow and summer and autumn, planting the facades of the baron's mansion as firmly in our minds as the doctor's bourgeois brick pile, showing us rooms packed with children whom a harsh father can banish with a word. He brings the church to vivid life and every face in it seems right. The children stand naturally in their old-fashioned clothes and their homemade nightgowns and in their faces we feel their emotional pain. If the lines are drawn harshly, they're also drawn lovingly. And this is another redeeming feature.<br/><br/>Is this the world from which Nazism comes? Not exactly, but 'White Ribbon' shows the ugly element in the German character. But while Germans may read the film that way, it's meant to show fundamental human traits, and in particular -- the pastor is the dominant figure -- how an unrelentingly cruel and judgmental viewpoint can lead to radicalism and violence.<br/><br/>Shown at the New York Film Festival 2009. In an article about and appreciation of Haneke in 'The New Yorker,' Anthony Lane describes 'Das weiße Band' as the director's ""most accessible,"" and ""best"" film; it's definitely his longest (145 minutes) and richest in incident."

As anybody who is familiar with the work of Michael Heneke will suspect, this new opus, will provoke you in so many different ways that you will want to leave theater many times but you won't be able to, I certainly couldn't. This man is a wizard of sorts. I can't think of no other director who could get away with this in the new millennium. I haven't even started to talk about the film yet and I'm not going to.

"rowmorg","8","22","43","17 November 2009"," A Children's Story
","The sub-title (A German Children's Story) shows where director Haneke's mind was in the making of this excellent mystery, The White Ribbon. The young schoolteacher hero clearly suspects his class of village children to be the chief suspects in a series of local crimes, although the shocked Pastor makes him swear to silence. The teacher (in old man's voice-over) postulates the popular explanation for the events: that the Doctor and his mistress, in their perverted relationship, themselves caused or perpetrated the crimes. But his own suspicions loom larger in the end, hinting at some unspeakable change occurring in European humanity at the dawn of the 20th century.<br/><br/>Typically, the English-speaking take on this wonderfully evocative monochrome movie is that it hints at the origins of Nazism, but this is a parochial view. The British and Americans themselves have performed unspeakable acts in modern times: for example, the imposition of slavery on generations of Africans, or the cruel suppression of the Kikuyu people in their own land of Kenya, just to name two examples.<br/><br/>This powerful film says something, not about Austria, or Germany, but about the western human condition, with its hypocritical hang-ups about sex, its obsession with books, and perverted male chauvinism. This is a long film, and non German-speakers have to rely on sub-titles (although the German is excellently spoken), but for those with eyes to see, and hearts to feel, it is an important statement. Not to be missed."

","A couple of years before the outbreak of the First World War, in a feudal German village, mysterious events happen. First, the local doctor has an accident when his horse stumbles on a hidden wire. Then a woman falls in a hole below the rotten floor of a barn and dies. The young son of the local baron is found hung upside-down and tortured. The retarded son of the midwife is found tied to a tree and brutally battered. In an environment of cruelty and abuses, the local teacher suspects that the repressed daughter and the son of the pastor are the responsible for the crimes.<br/><br/>I was anxious to see ""Das Weiße Band - Eine Deutsche Kindergeschichte"" and today I have finally watched this awarded film. Unfortunately I found it prolix, overrated and very disappointing and gives the sensation that the ending is missing. <br/><br/>The black and white cinematography is top-notch and one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. The performances are awesome and I was particularly impressed with the beauty and acting of the unknown Leonie Benesch. The screenplay is intriguing and engrosses the attention of the viewer from the very beginning. Unfortunately the story that has the obvious intention of showing the birth of the serpent egg of the Nazism and Fascism does not have a conclusion. <br/><br/>Claude Chabrol, just to give an example, was specialist in films with intelligent open ends that forced the interpretation and the discussion of the viewers. Michael Haneke, on the contrary, leaves many questions without answers, even very simple points, like for example whether the teacher has married Eva or not; or the fate of the doctor and his family and the midwife. There are so many abusive and wicked characters that almost everyone would be capable of the evilness against the children. But I believe that the two adolescents with the white ribbon may be the responsible for the cruelties. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Fita Branca"" (""The White Ribbon"")"

"Perception_de_Ambiguity","8","17","37","8 October 2009"," What we have here...
","...is partly a recycling of the 'Caché' concept, Haneke's previous (original) film which proved to be an international hit. Again we have a whodunnit to conceive greater themes and to show ?more important problems? that are not as easily perceivable on first sight as a dead body. I think I won't reveal too much if I say that again, just like in 'Caché', Haneke doesn't reveal to us what, I am sure, most of the audience wants to know, whether they like to admit it or not. I won't even bother looking for the solution, because I think I know M.H. well enough to be convinced that he did his best to leave the big mystery unsolvable. I admit that I was foolish enough to look forward to that ?banal? piece of information. But as the movie started to become suspenseful 'Caché' came to mind again and I remembered that what I am watching isn't a Hitchcock movie, even if he enjoys coquetting with the elements that Hitchcock is partly responsible for popularizing.<br/><br/>Apparently Haneke fears that revealing the perpetrator of the story's crimes to the audience would make this person the scapegoat for all the wrongdoings in the community. It certainly is an argument. But you could just as well say that without blaming somebody specific for the most obvious crimes everybody is to blame, but only abstractly, diminishing the power of the indictment that this film is, while if you have a physical perpetrator the more intelligent among the viewers will also realize the share of the blame of many members of the community. The definite revealing of the perpetrator would make it a more powerful statement just like it makes it more powerful to have the story take place at a specific time and at a specific place. It's what elevates it from abstractness to a parable that connects itself automatically to our own time and situation.<br/><br/>After two viewings I could half-forgive this audacious practice in 'Caché', because it indeed had interesting and more unusual things to say that go beyond a simple whodunnit. In 'Das weiße Band' I can easily half-forgive it since the movie is less of a mystery, instead the focus is more on making us witness how this village's community reacts to the crimes as well as how adults raise their children, but I wouldn't be able to tolerate this trick a third time in an M.H. film.<br/><br/>Violence is the order of the day in 'Das weiße Band' and the imposed restrictions gave about anyone in this village reason to do those things, which makes it less important to actually know who did what. As usual life at those times is one full of conventions, restrictions and artificial politeness motivated by fear. Superficially it is the old story of hierarchy where those with the most power still are no more free or happy than those with the least. But thanks to the subtle way this is handled it isn't a film about anything in an obvious way. First and foremost it is the portrayal of a few people and families in a rural community.<br/><br/>The acting by the whole cast is excellent as usual, which notably includes the children too, and the B&W photography as well as the set design and costumes and the whole mise-en-scène create a convincing pre-WWI atmosphere. Plot-wise it also is a more interesting film than 'Caché' thanks to its complexity, telling stories of not only one but several households. The 2 1/2 hours pass swiftly and it is almost not enough time to make us understand all those people. A film that profits from rewatches, I reckon."
"radeherb","6","18","40","24 November 2009"," Do things just happen?
","I watched this movie yesterday. As soon as I left the theater, something quite unusual happened. Its content lost all of its grip on me, while its artistic brilliance stood out almost the more. How could that be? I thought about it and came to the conclusion that the story was not convincing enough to hold itself up, at least not for me. <br/><br/>I often like stories even if they are unconvincing. Why not this one? If somebody tries to tell something, just as it happened and without explanation, what he tells has to be plausible to be of interest to me. It must be capable to bear some kind of logical explanation to keep my imagination. Otherwise my interest jumps from the story to the person who talks. <br/><br/>The schoolteacher's suggestion sounds too much like an intellectual construction, including the events leading up to it, and some grey eminence caught playing God by his own children would indeed look rather cheap. In fact, the whole story seems too much constructed for me to be taken in by it permanently, too constructed to even appear to be true. In consequence, all the breathtaking scenes of parental violence and abuse seem corrupted, damaged, invalidated, almost lost by their involvement into the context of an unbelievable story. How sad.<br/><br/>The movie had my interest in a firm grip until the very end and then lost it as an intrinsic provocation to be thought over. There seemed nothing more to it than the excellent artistic surface I had already witnessed. <br/><br/>Things happen, and in peculiar atmospheres peculiar things happen. Like gives birth to like, I knew that before. Everybody knows and maybe fears those suffocating circumstances where nothing really happens apart from a series of cruel events passing by, interrupted by bumping holes like being processed by a stuttering slaughter machine. So what all this brilliance for?<br/><br/>Under an intriguing surface, things happen in cruel innocence, mechanically interlinking two generations, devoid of even the possibility of anything like responsibility, not to speak soul, maybe with the exception of two little boys. Apart from those, every single beautiful puppet in this movie carries a white ribbon around his very clock-like heart which never gets soiled, never could be.<br/><br/>Which makes this movie exactly alike to what it depicts. That seems frightening, at least to me. What happens now, in 2009, is this movie, a work of art, ironically, like it's pre-WWI-content, imposing itself as the result of thousands of years of civilization. Too old compared to those two little boys?<br/><br/>I'm just a usual guy and not much of a critic or writer, that's true. But a nightmare of only analogically connected random events, even if it was history itself, I would not consider as true or for that matter real, what ever its aesthetics might be.<br/><br/>I searched the comments on this page for some controversy, thinking this movie deserves it."
"Turfseer","4","26","62","14 July 2010"," Specious attempt at explaining roots of 20th Century Fascism
","We're told at the beginning of 'The White Ribbon', that this is a story that seeks to ""clarify things that happened in this country"", as if to imply that we're about to gain some insight into the origins of Nazism. But director Michael Haneke has made it clear that he was aiming for a more generic understanding of the roots of Fascism when he was quoted as saying that the film is about ""the origin of every type of terrorism, be it of political or religious nature."" Note that Haneke doesn't speak of ""Nazism"" or ""Fascism"" but uses the modern term ""terrorism"" to describe the actions of many of the characters in his film. The setting of Haneke's tale is the fictional village of Eichwald, right before World War I. There is virtually no effort to link the story to actual historical events except for the specific reference to the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand and the start of World War I at the film's end. Haneke does this because his story is really a PARABLE; by making it (in part) applicable to all nationalities and to different historical epochs, Haneke, in effect, minimizes the responsibility of the German and Austrian peoples who lived during the time leading up to the Holocaust and participated in it, either directly or indirectly. If his parable is universally applied, the unique horror of Nazism can't really be any worse than any other atrocities committed by other groups in history. The generic nature of his story (or parable), bears this out.<br/><br/>Despite his insistence to the contrary, it remains obvious that 'Ribbon' IS also Haneke's attempt to explain the rise of the Third Reich. He is not unlike a bevy of German and Austrian filmmakers who utilize a fictional melodramatic narrative to assuage their own guilt (as well as an attempt to speak for the collective guilt of a nation). It's not easy being German or Austrian when your recent ancestors are linked to mass murderers. If the ancestors are portrayed as likable, normal people but also capable of violence (or supporting violence), this would lead to unpleasant feelings of cognitive dissonance. But what if the history is reduced to a more simplistic formula consisting of monsters, victims and saints? The viewer no longer has to be confused rooting for a complex Tony Soprano type of character—an extremely violent man who is also likable and sympathetic.<br/><br/>In 'The Reader', the monsters are the cold Concentration Camp guards in the docket, who won't admit their guilt. The victim, however, is Hanna Schmitz, the guard who is presented as a tragic figure, done in by ignorance. During the trial, it was her compulsive need for order that prevents her from allowing the prisoners to escape. The saint is the protagonist, Michael Berg, who can still have sympathy for the 'tragic' Hanna as well as offer to pay money to a Holocaust victim's foundation.<br/><br/>Haneke also must create his share of monsters. In doing so, a guilty populace no longer has to believe that their grandparents were part of a 'normal' silent majority that supported Hitler. How could anyone's ancestors be like the Eichwald town doctor, pastor or baron? The doctor is someone who sexually humiliates his long-term mistress, the midwife, as well as sexually abuses his own daughter. The pastor utilizes corporal punishment to raise his children, which leads to acts of revenge on their part. What's more, he promotes unhealthy sexual feelings in his children, by denouncing masturbation as a sin. The Baron neglects workers on his estate, leading to the death of a worker's wife in a work-place accident. He also neglects his wife, the Countess, who ultimately leaves, after she accuses him of allowing a lot of unhealthy stuff to go on in the village.<br/><br/>Like Hanna Schmitz whose behavior was excused on the basis of being raised in a bad environment, the White Ribbon kids also get a free pass. They are the 'victims' of the monstrous fathers and enabling mothers. How can any child be completely responsible for crimes committed as an adult if the upbringing was so horrendous? This is the film's 'hook'--it's the kids who committed most (or all) of the crimes in the village: the doctor is injured after his horse falls in an encounter with a trip wire; the baron's son is hung upside down in the forest and caned; and a mentally challenged kid is tortured. The kids cover their tracks by appearing en masse at the victim's home, asking if they can be of any help.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the 'saint'--here is the character which a guilty audience can identify with ('Hey my grandfather didn't support Hitler at all—he was apolitical and a nice guy to boot!) The school teacher fits the bill perfectly. Not only does he save the hapless Eva after she's fired but figures out who's responsible for the crimes committed in the village and has the guts to reveal the ugly truth to the town's power broker, the Pastor! <br/><br/>While it is very wrong to blame today's generation in Austria and Germany for the sins of the parents and grandparents, it is equally disturbing to realize that there is a pattern of denial amongst the younger generation in regards to the idea that the enablers of the Holocaust were not the monsters, victims and saints depicted by Mr. Haneke but rather ordinary people who one could easily identify with.<br/><br/>Despite its facile explanation of the roots of Fascism, the White Ribbon has some value, precisely because it sparks debate. With its austere, Bergman-like, black and white cinematography, and recreation of a bygone era, Haneke scores points for atmosphere. But instead of focusing on 'why' the Holocaust occurred, the 'what' and 'how' would have been more than sufficient."

","A pretentious film from the haughty but occasionally interesting Austrian art filmmaker Michael Haneke (Hidden/Cache, for instance, was a fine if unsubtle movie about the profound guilt that westerners should feel for being successful, a common theme from the director). Filmed in a delicate black and white, The White Ribbon takes place in a small German town in the immediate period before World War I. Through a number of mysterious violent acts occurring in the village, Haneke wants to show the hypocrisy of a society rigidly stratified by class. Haneke refuses either to give a clear explanation of these acts (though they turn out to be carried out by children of the community) or to follow a clear narrative line. These make the movie more irritating than surprising (though there always will be snobs that will claim that we are in front of a masterpiece). Some reviewers have claimed the movie to be some sort of metaphor for the birth of National Socialism (with the children supposedly turning into Nazis 25 years later), but there is really nothing here about this. Boring and disappointing."
"Billygoat","1","32","81","8 October 2010"," A journey of tedium
","""The White Ribbon"" certainly has some good qualities: good production values; great acting; excellent photography; great set pieces & costumes - the film certainly succeeds at evoking a sense of time and place that seems so real and yet so foreign to the modern 21st century audience.<br/><br/>However, these qualities are not enough to save this film from the torturous journey of tedium and humourlessness that it takes the viewer on. It really doesn't matter what the subject of a film is - to succeed, it (almost) always needs one thing at least: a story. You know, things like a beginning, a middle and an ending would be sort of nice. The White Ribbon is lacking in this. This is a collection of vignettes - the pace and editing style is similar to a Jim Jarmusch film (along with the black & white imagery, which Jarmusch tends to use). Unfortunately, it has none of the wit and humour of a Jarmusch film.<br/><br/>In ""The White Ribbon"" these vignettes take us nowhere. There is no explanation of what is going on in the village. We know something is - different individuals get hurt, assaulted, tortured - but we never learn why or by whom - or for what purpose. This is all intentional, of course - the film maker suggests different possibilities, but also throws at us reasons at is as to why it isn't the very person(s) we might have suspected. (For example, the schoolteacher makes a good case for suspecting the pastor's children - but then we recall that they were sleeping when the fire was set. Was the fire unconnected to everything else that was going on? Could be - who the hell knows though, it's all deliberately ambiguous.) Now, a sense of ambiguity can be effective at times. It can force the audience to think and come to a conclusion of sorts (hopefully one that the film maker had in mind). But when it's so pervasive that you're left with absolutely no idea with what the hell is going on, well, it's just unsatisfying. That this film is deliberately ambiguous is clear. A quick perusal of the topics on this discussion board illustrate that very well, as different people offer their theories on what it all means, and even on who did what. But this film goes too far - one has sat through over two hours of dark, oppressive scenes of psycho-sexual repression with absolutely no payoff. It's not enough to throw out the glib ""it explains how Germany embraced fascism"". That's too facile, and in any case, who cares - I want a good story, and there is none here."

","'The White Ribbon' deals with Michael Haneke's household issues, loss of childhood innocence (for which the title is indeed a cipher), and unexplainable violence. The latter subject makes for much of the appeal of his earlier works like 'Benny's Video', which feature a rather uneventful plot turned upside down by a chain of unexplained and therefore intriguing events. 'The White Ribbon' follows this formula so closely that one may be excused of thinking of this film as some sort of remake in a different historical setting.<br/><br/>The difference is that this time, the story leads absolutely nowhere, This again is some sort of fixture in Haneke's oeuvre, not finishing the story and just ending the movie like that. But while this worked quite well in 'Caché' because it left the viewer with a sentiment of foreboding, this time it's plainly annoying, probably just because of the fact that Haneke has done this so many times before.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it is worthwhile to imagine how the intended performance of Ulrich Mühe (the Stasi official in 'The Life of Others') would have changed this film. Given his vocal intensity and talent to express a lot with little gestures, 'The White Ribbon' may have been a less drab, unexciting experience, but the script leaves little room for the cast to add something interesting to it.<br/><br/>Still, 'The White Ribbon' won the Palme d'Or in Cannes this year plus the European Film Awards and the Golden Globe, which illustrates how prizes are won these days: a household name, an established routine, a carefully orchestrated press campaign alluding to the symbolic nature of the story, black and white for a notion of art, and nobody dares to say the film is dull. Yet that's what 'The White Ribbon' is - boring. The longest two and a half hours of your life expect you.<br/><br/>A tip on the side: The Jury Prize in Cannes this year went to Jacques Audiard's 'A Prophet', which is a good juxtaposition to this film: it also follows a formula, but with much more zest and brilliant acting."

But, alas, in this film the spirits never come to life! <br/><br/>For nearly three hours, we are exposed to a recurring series of genre paintings accompanied by trite dialogues that are probably supposed to reflect an atmosphere of repression, hypocrisy, social injustice and what-not, but remain shallow common places at worst and hilarious parody at best. A number of acts of violence thrown in now and then are arguably intended to provide a hint of a plot and -for the same price- conjure up the lurking-presence-of-evil-inherent-to-human-nature, but both their cinematic and philosophical potential remain undeveloped in the scorching light of the director's self-loving drive to show us how Germany really looked like.<br/><br/>Haneke has no doubt read his Fontane and his Thomas Mann too. He probably expects his audience to have done the same and be ready in advance to put him in the same set, which he seems to get away with, if the ratings are anything to go by."

I strongly disagree with this point of view and that's the main (but not the only) reason I rate it so bad. Families with strict parents existed, still exists and will continue to exist all over the world, not only in Germany. The reason we don't have so many wars nowadays is mostly thanks to the media like TV and internet, who entertains, brainwashes, and opens minds even of lazy people who doesn't read books.<br/><br/>I expected good crime/mystery thriller, but all I've got is dumb incoherent story I don't buy at all, and without an end."

","I've seen more than my fair share of hateful behaviour during my lifetime so there were points during this film that seemed to drag. I don't think this makes it a bad film or a poor edit however. <br/><br/>It struck me that there was a great deal of honesty about the treatment of the subject of hate. All of the action appears to have occurred during the year 1913-14 before the Great War began in earnest. The attitudes are those promulgated by the particular Calvinist sects that operated in the German speaking world. That hardness was also prevalent elsewhere in the English speaking world so it is not fair to suggest that Nazi's were bred this way. The Germanic way of subsuming emotions, however, has a lot to answer for. <br/><br/>This film is, in a way, showing what happens when so called 'spiritual' ideals are placed above emotional bonds. There are many heart rending moments but, the one that struck me most was the Doctor's young sensitive son giving his father the bird he'd rescued in order to make his father feel better about the loss of the caged bird. Not only is the son considerate and emotionally intelligent but he sets his father a challenge. It's a very intelligent challenge and one that needs to be seen in the doctor's relationship with his murdering daughter. An incredible film, produced with great mastery and perfectly shot in a period feeling black and white. A must see."

","I'm no stranger to Michael Haneke's movies, especially when it comes to the ones that have often gotten much attention. Haneke is a very interesting person; however it also goes without saying that I have only seen one movie of his that I enjoyed: The Piano Teacher. What was great like that was its suspense buildup and its dark comedy. There are some scenes wher eyou don't know if you should be horrified or humored (BTW people, Haneke even said it himself that he looks at the movie as a Dark Comedy).<br/><br/>However, Of all the movies I've seen (the mentioned PT, alongside Cache, Funny Games US, White Ribbon and Seventh Continent), I've only really enjoyed PT. I find the trouble with Haneke is that his movies, while they aim for something, end up making Haneke someone who hates his audience. For example, Funny Games, a movie I despised, tried to get the ""Kids, violence is bad, mmkay?"" message across, but ended up beating the pish out of the audience with it. It's almost as if he has no respect for his audience, and like my dad always said, ""Difference doesn't equal talent"".<br/><br/>The White Ribbon, while being slightly better than the average Haneke movie, is unfortunately a hair different than the rest. What managed to keep me interested was its gorgeous B&W cinematography; it was very creepy brooding. However, the film's snail pace and shallow story prevents it from getting anywhere, and in the end, the film relies on its gorgeous cinematography to carry on for two and a half almost pointless hours.<br/><br/>Basically here we have an interesting concept- taking place in a town in pre-WWI Germany, a series of disturbing happenings including an (overly fake and CG'ed) accident which happens at the beginnng. More disturbing crimes keep happening, and nobody will admit to doing it, which leads to resentment towards the town leaders. More accidents keep happening and people still don't know who is responsible; though it is hinted at times that the Children could be the people in charge.<br/><br/>This sounds interesting. That's what I thought before entering the theatre. However, since most of the accident scenes are simply implied, the movie's mystery becomes harder and harder to follow. What is even more frustrating is how Haneke ends the movie without even providing a proper resolution. But while that worked for ""The Piano Teacher"" because it left the viewer with a sense of foreboding, here it just leaves the viewer angered.<br/><br/>In short, this movie was a mediocre way to spend 140 minutes, which felt longer, and while Haneke may be making art, art is as art does and the movie does very little. In short, it's a very grand argument in style over substance, though I guess would be recommend worthy for its B&W visuals."

","This is about the worst movie I have seen in a while. The acting was very good though, especially by the children (very expressive and believable), which is why I give 2 out of 10. Overall, the movie is just depressing from start to finish. It's a long one (2,5 hours) but it felt like being much, much longer. I was thinking of leaving the theatre earlier, but then figured I'd waited long enough already, and perhaps the end would explain it all. Well, there was no end. The movie just stopped at some point. Yes it is a portrayal of people in a German village just before WWI, but the thing is, hatred, brutality and disgust are so dominant in this whole movie, that no other emotion seems possible (except for a little love story, which makes up for only about 5% of the whole story though). Discipline, self-hatred and hatred of others, abuse (of children also), punishment. These are the themes. And they are being shown in a depressingly dense and one-dimensional manner. I cannot relate to any comparison to Lars van Trier movies (which I just read in another comment), because this movie here does not have any hope or lust for life in it. This is such a typical German way of portraying the evil. And I had so looked forward to this one, because it was supposed to tell us something about the ""old"" Germany, without being a movie about WWII and the Nazis, like most other successful German movies are. Look at ""Life is Beautiful"" in comparison. It's an Italian movie, yes, and one can so much feel that. It is full of hope and also joy, yes joy, despite the tragic theme. But this one? Forget it. It gave me the creeps. I regret not having left the theatre earlier. If you want to watch 2,5 hours of misery, go and see this movie. Otherwise, save both your precious time as well as money. No wonder that the best ""German"" director these days is not German, but Turkish (Fatih Akin). I am utterly disappointed. I couldn't care less about the characters, despite some very good acting. Amazed at the Golden Globe nomination."

","This is truly beautiful, not in the way that Bergman's Sven Nykvist made beautiful silver insertions into loneliness, but as pure, soulless visions of soulless people and their children being ripped. Haneke has famously ""explained"" this movie as depicting the oppressive fog on the land which generically produces twisted, homicidal societies. I wish he had kept his mouth shut because that much is obvious as a background.<br/><br/>What is more interesting is who Haneke has revealed himself to be, and what he thinks of us as viewers. I've always felt uncomfortable with his films, not because they have an intended unsettling effect (that makes you ""examine"" self), but because they make interestingly flawed assumptions about me and how to get to me. Those flaws are fascinating and far, far more engaging and disturbing than the events depicted.<br/><br/>In this case, as with many of Herzog's films, the very thing that is being revealed to be destructive is built into the fabric of the thing and the contract with the filmmaker we are forced into complying with. Simple, reductionist morality? Obsessively bleak vision? Condescending view of natural emotions and passions? Yes, yes, yes, both in what we have and how we have it. ""Cache"" was at least cleverly constructed, just as this is wonderfully framed. But the man is just too, well too Austrian.<br/><br/>There are several mysteries in this story, cleverly not closed. The loud implication is that the children were behind many of the events. This fits the film's intent, as the filmmaker has patiently told us in interviews that these children become the Nazis he is beholden to understand. But much more interesting is a different solution to the mysteries, surely subconsciously placed.<br/><br/>Our narrator is the village schoolmaster. He is in a unique position, the only institutionally allowed connection between the children and the adults. He alone has anything remotely like honest love. He uniquely is untouched by the disasters. He is also our narrator, a role we are reminded of throughout. He also tells us at the beginning that what he will tell us is partly lies, partly truth. No doubt, Haneke identifies with this storyteller and has hidden truths about himself just as our teacher has.<br/><br/>Look at this closely and you may interpret as I did the second time around. I think the teacher is a plausible culprit, wholly unintended by the filmmaker and hiding his worst tendencies just as the filmmaker has.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"manicman84","6","11","30","21 March 2010"," It just fails to be emotionally compelling.
","Widely regarded as the best European film of 2009, Michael Haneke's The White Ribbon centers on the birth of evil in pre-war Germany. A year before the breakout of the World War I a series of sudden accidents interferes with the peaceful life in one of German villages. This concept sounds much better on paper, and with Haneke's methodical approach The White Ribbon tends to be slow and mundane. Haneke cares more about concepts than characters. That's why he mechanically subordinates every event to his fatalistic thesis. To my surprise, it works really well introducing dense atmosphere of dread and tension into the film. While Haneke's examination seems relatively credible due to stark realism throughout the film, he keeps using his old tricks: the lack of climax and unresolved ending. They certainly worked way better in his metaphorical thriller Cache (Hidden) than in The White Ribbon that would benefit from the strong filmmaker's statement in the end. On the top of that, the latest Haneke's offering represents an artistic cinema with impressive cinematography, detailed set pieces and lavish compositions. It's just a major letdown that the film fails to be emotionally compelling. 6.5/10 (B-)"

Someone is terrorizing the village, committing brutal crimes, and no one seems to be able to figure out what's going on. The children seem to be implicated in much of the mischief, but it's nearly impossible to tell them apart—which child belongs to which family. Is this kid the steward's son? The pastor's daughter? The Baron's child? It all gets too confusing. Maybe it's too much to ask of a contemporary German film (yes, it's recent, despite the early 20th-century setting and the black-and-white), but I would appreciate a bit more clarity, at least when it comes to differentiating the characters. I know the ambiguity in the plot is intentional and the whole thing is supposed to be some sort of extended allegory for the domestic roots of German Fascism and the titular white ribbon symbolizes childhood innocence and so on—but please.

I could pick up the distance each actor had with their role from every character except the old Felder and the teacher. It's not enough to speak (""recite"" would probably be appropriate speak) the words of 100 years ago, you have to use the proper intonation and body language, too. Watch any German movie of the 30s and you will see how far off these actors were.<br/><br/>What added to the ridicule was that the movie looked as if they had removed the colour from a colour movie. It was a new movie half-heartedly made look old. You can't just remove colour in post-production. When they made black-and-white movies in the 30s, they were playing with light and shades and they were producing a black-and-white movie from the time the scene was set up to the time the movie was cut to the time the movie made it into the cinema. If you just kill the colour in post-production you will have a movie made for colours that has then one of the elements that influenced the artistic work cut out by a computer. And that's how it looked.<br/><br/>Lastly, and here is where spoiler comes in, I was so disappointed that a vague and depth-less story actually ends without an ending. From a movie with such an unsophisticated story telling I would have expected an equally unsophisticated end. But the movie doesn't really give you an end. Instead it distracts by calling in WW1 and then letting you know that the tale-teller never has seen any one of the characters again after it. WW1 didn't contribute anything to the story, it should have ended with the teacher talking to the pastor."

At bottom it's just another of those suspense stories that amount to a half-hour TV episode--specifically, an episode of the old Alfred Hitchcock series--padded out to five times the length; but this one differs from the rest in its aesthetic and social pretensions. Quite evidently, the director set out to make an art film and a political parable, and prepared himself by watching a lot of early Bergman and late Carl Dreyer, and probably Bela Tarr, as well as art horror movies. And so the movie is shot in black and white, in formal, frozen compositions that last forever; it takes place in an isolated, almost medieval village, where everybody looks as if they were in mourning; and the whole story is narrated offscreen in a muted voice. All this seems like much ado about nothing, since the moral of the fable becomes obvious at once and that is the point of the exercise, as well as the sole source of dramatic interest. Having gotten the point already, and not feeling the need to undergo ritual purification, I found the movie a reverse luxury: something I could have afforded but didn't want.

","There is a very important scene in Michael Haneke's new film The White Ribbon, which is on the surface about a series of crimes and deaths and strange occurrences in a small German town around 1913-14 before WW1. In fact it's one of those rare scenes in movies where it had me tearing up, almost without knowing entirely why until after the movie ended, from its existential significance. A little boy's father, a doctor, has been injured after being on a horse that was tripped over by a wire left mysteriously tied up. The woman taking care of him assures him he'll be alright, that he won't die or anything. Then the little boy asks her 'What is dead?' The boy is so innocent and unknowing of anything about death that she has to explain to him, holding back some tears, about death (specifically about his mother), and that she will die, just some time later. It puts him in a foul mood, to say the least.<br/><br/>While I can't be sure if Haneke meant for this to be a key scene, it feels like one. A mystery is taking place where all of these things are being done (the horse-trip wire and doctor's injured, a woman is found dead, a barn is set on fire in the middle of the night, a retarded boy is beaten mercilessly and left in the woods), and by the end of the film it's really hard to say exactly who did it. We might believe the Schoolteacher (Christian Friedel) and his theory that it was some of the children who perpetrated these acts, as they were present at some of the occurrences, but, as with something like Zodiac, Haneke makes no claims and nothing is resolved. Which works fine, except that there is something that those in the town know and know perhaps all too well: death is a certainty, be it by disease or war or some other act. And as well, as Haneke also wants us to leave the theater knowing, evil is pervasive and starts at the dinner table or behind closed-doors.<br/><br/>It's a bleak story, something that, maybe obviously, echoes some of the emotional dread conjured by Ingmar Bergman (there's one scene specifically, when the Doctor stops his midwife woman from trying to arouse him and berates her about how she looks, kicking her out of her job and his life, that looks especially cribbed from Bergman, lovingly of course). But it's really Haneke all the way, and anyone who has seen some of his solid previous works (Funny Games not included here though some might) know his attitude towards the evil in men, women and even children. It doesn't just spring out of nowhere, and bad deeds aren't just committed out of boredom. His message is strong on this point: in repressed societies, where punishment and brutality are an unspoken given, and sex and love is kept down (except, of course, for things like molestation as we find out in a shocking night-scene), and where people, ultimately, start to forget about these crimes after a time, it's very likely a Nazi regime could come about twenty years later (the mention of WW1 isn't subtle, though it is effective).<br/><br/>The White Ribbon is, as they say, an 'art' film, but this is not a bad thing for Haneke. He paints with his camera in black and white a very cold and rural environment, often marked by dark rooms at night and shocking images like the barn burning at night or when a character discovers a suicide by hanging (listen to the audio there, by the way, for the irony in children playing in the distance). It's an unrelenting tale with multiple story lines that all feel crucial, especially the character of the Pastor who most of all comes from that 19th century time of being a ""tough-love"" father, always with a cane by his side. And there's some fantastic acting throughout, and some really haunting-beautiful images conjured up in these scenes of silence, or a camera placed specifically at a door or at a dinner table. There's a lot going on here.<br/><br/>If there is a criticism, however minor, it's on the narration. I found there to be just a little too much at times, too much explaining or telling the story in such a way that, while from the reminiscing of the teacher, didn't do much to add to what was on screen (it also may be covering up points as Haneke had planned this originally as a mini-series). It's not all bad, but it does get distracting, albeit usually done over shots of snow and fields and the town that bring out the emptiness and chill of the countryside. For those who are ready for Haneke's level of moral expurgation, of indicting humanity, not just Germany or modern-day Muslims (as he's been quoted saying, again repression), it's breathtaking and provocative. And if you leave knowing a little more about life and death, there's another point to take in favor of the film. It's a genuine article of classic cinema."

","The White Ribbon was one of the best 2009 movies I saw. My only previous experience with Michael Haneke had been 2001's The Piano Teacher, which I loathed. I didn't know what to expect from this black-and-white movie; I feared I'd hate it or find it boring. Besides, it's winning all the awards I was expecting to see A Prophet win, which for me was the best 2009 movie. Now I'm not so sure.<br/><br/>The White Ribbon is above a well-crafted piece of cinema by a master of the medium. That's evident in the way he shoots the shadows and the outdoor light, playing with the contrasts and setting up beautiful frames; in the way he keeps the viewer in thrall without the need of music, wonderfully using silence as a part of the experience; in the way he recreates an era through dialogue, mannerisms, dogmas, social rules, costumes; and, for a movie centred on children, the way he gets amazing performances from the young actors, of several ages, who had to play complex roles. I haven't seen children and adolescents perform so well in a movie since Fernando Meirelle's City of God.<br/><br/>The story seems not to amount to much, but in the hands of Haneke it's a gripping mystery. In a small German village mysterious incidents happen: a doctor falls off his horse because someone put a wire across the road; someone sets a barn on fire; the local Baron's child is kidnapped and whipped. Who's doing all this? Are the events connected? Are the children involved? And if so, does it have anything to do with the oppressive way they're treated? People who enjoy puzzles will certainly enjoy spending hours discussing this movie, trying to make sense of it, even though I'd say it's impossible to ever get down to the truth. For those that don't care about speculation, these mysteries nevertheless allow us to see the way the village works, with its prejudices, hatreds, secrets, envies, fears, strange hierarchies. In sum it allows the village to become a theatre about the human condition, although one that only depicts the worst in mankind.<br/><br/>I've read interpretations that suggest that this movie is an allegory for Nazism; that it seeks to explain how Fascism appeared; that the children in the movie would grow to become Nazi generation. I think that's possible, but I think it's also too reductive and if that were so why Haneke bother with such a roundabout way of doing things? I think this movie mocks exactly such simple, reductive answers. Children are spanked and disciplined, and that led to Nazis! But the same generation that begot Nazis also begot Nazi opponents. The same educational system that created Hitler also created Einstein. And Germany wasn't the only country that used harsh methods to bring up children.<br/><br/>This movie is a mystery in the vein of many great European mysteries. I think Europe produces mysteries that go beyond the mere fascination about finding clues. They even go beyond the psychological mystery, which is about finding clues in a person's mind or behaviour. No, these are anti-mysteries, movies that suggest that reality is just undecipherable, that logic and reason are not enough to explain everything. This puts The White Ribbon on the level of masterpieces like L'Avventura, Blowup, Professione: Reporter, and Mr. Klein. Good European cinema continues to exist."

","Tons of accolades for this film: an Oscar nominee, BAFTA nominee, Caesar nominee, triple award winner at Cannes, and many many more.<br/><br/>Michael Haneke makes films that make you think. He doesn't give you the answers. Remember Cache and Funny Games? This film is no different.<br/><br/>Accidents(?) happen and we don't have easy answers. Where is the evil coming from? What will be our response? Usually the response is an increase in authoritarianism. Witness the easy manner in which many Americans were willing to give up their hard won freedom after 9/11 to obtain some quieting of their fear. It is the same everywhere. We do not see the rise of fascism in the film, but we see the seeds being sown.<br/><br/>The children grow up in a paternalistic highly religious society where rich and poor are strictly separated. Children are punished for the slightest infraction, while the adults practice adultery and incest with impunity. There is no love shown anywhere except between the teacher and the nanny.<br/><br/>These are the children that will become the Nazis of the future. Is it this upbringing that caused that? This seems to be what Haneke is trying to say, but he leaves it to us to sort it out.<br/><br/>The film was riveting and the time flew by as we looked at clues to determine who was the source of evil.

"NoArrow","7","6","18","7 February 2010"," A great movie, but for who?
","When I say that ""The White Ribbon"" is a great movie, I mean, only, that it's a movie made by a great director. And when I refer to Michael Haneke as a great director, all I'm really saying is, the man knows what he's doing. He's no hack.<br/><br/>My problem – or, I should say, my issue – is with exactly that: what he's doing. If I seem ambivalent or undecided about this review, it's only because that's how I felt about the movie. It's a mystery/drama about a town on the Austrian countryside right before WWI. It has the appearance of a regular, idyllic town, but, some really bad things start happening. People start getting hurt, when no one else is around. It's clearly more than one person perpetrating these crimes, which start to resemble ritual punishment.<br/><br/>So it's a mystery. But since this is a Haneke film, we know the ""mystery"" is unimportant. It's about what the mystery reveals about the town. This is the same storytelling technique he used for ""Cache,"" a movie that a lot of people spend a lot of time trying to figure out. I can't imagine why – the movie, like this one, offers no concrete solutions, only ambiguity, and since any definitive conclusions (about the plot) would draw too much from the viewers' imagination, and not enough from the film itself, such conclusions are rendered completely irrelevant to the film. It's sort of like the Philip Seymour Hoffman/Meryl Streep movie ""Doubt.""<br/><br/>Now, thematic conclusions – those are abounding. And since Haneke pushes the plot so far to the side they can come off a little heavy-handed. This is my primary issue (problem?) with the craft of ""The White Ribbon."" Whereas ""Cache"" focused mainly on two wonderful performances (from Daniel Auteuil and Juliette Binoche) that lent the film a certain precision, ""The White Ribbon"" is about an entire town's worth of characters. Each is allotted less time, and therefore, fewer dimensions – and therefore, less precision, and morepredetermination. They come off as numbers in a thematic equation Haneke is calculating, or trying to.<br/><br/>The ""trying to"" is the part I'm back and forth on. I haven't mentioned how starkly beautiful the film is, thanks to the black and white cinematography and compositions of Christian Berger. It'll remind you of Bergmans like ""Through a Glass Darkly,"" ""Winter Light"" or ""Hour of the Wolf."" The film is so visually arresting, if it was Silent, I might call it a triumph. Even so, there are ways Berger (or Haneke) use their camera that disturb me, and not, I don't think, in the way they mean to.<br/><br/>I'm sort of dancing around – I know. Let me talk about one thing that really struck me about Haneke's film: the way he depicts his ""good"" characters. There are a few of them. The story is narrated by the town's resident teacher, much older, trying to make sense of the events that shaped his personal history. The younger version is played by Christian Friedel, and he's seen as ugly, weak and completely ineffectual. It's not quite his fault (it's society's!), but there is some intended frustration caused us by the character's complete inability to alter the course of his life or his town's. Another character, a farmer, is perhaps the only one in the film with a rigid code of honor he apparently lives his life by. He's got a lazy eye. There's an extended close up on his face where the focal point is the bridge of his nose, and his left eye points to the left and his right eye points to the right and he comes off as practically inhuman. Is Haneke saying to live righteously in an authoritarian society you must be a freak, or abnormal? I don't know – all I know is, if I was the actor with the lazy eye, I might be insulted.<br/><br/>To call the film misanthropic would be overstating the point, I guess. It's about bad people. I haven't said much about what the movie's actually trying to say, because, after saying it, it seems almost pointless. ""Religious suppression and societal demand for perfection are the seeds of fascism."" There it is, more or less (read Ebert's review if you want a really meaningful dissection of the film's themes). It's the kind of thing you can sort of nod your head to, I mean; it makes enough sense within the confines of the movie. Is it an important statement on German/Austrian history or the beginnings of Nazism? I don't know enough about the history to really say.<br/><br/>No one loves a movie, or returns to it, for what it's saying. ""Avatar"" didn't gross two billion worldwide because of its metaphorical criticism of outsourced American capitalism (well, maybe in some places). It's because of the way it looked, and ""The White Ribbon"" will be embraced by cineastes for the same reason, I think. It's well-made. Like I said earlier, it looks beautiful. Is it a great movie? It looks like one.<br/><br/>SoI don't know. 7/10. I don't regret seeing it. It held my interest for the most part, if not rewarding it completely. How could it have, you ask me? I don't know. It's the right movie; it's the movie Haneke was trying to make. But I don't think I'd watch it again."
"ElMaruecan82","9","5","15","25 January 2018"," Critique of Impure Reasons...
","Michael Haneke ""White Ribbon"", Golden Palm winner of Cannes Festival in 2009, takes place in a small German village one year before World War I. The mention of the war sounds like the kind of elements that foreshadows some role the major conflict would play, but if it's any spoiler, I'll say that war has nothing to do with the story and if you expect the kind of movie to provide hints or signals, you'll be disappointed... first and mesmerized after. This is an extraordinary journey in an atmosphere of nauseating and sickening suspicion without any resolution whatsoever.<br/><br/>And the warning is necessary because if there's ever a genre to classify the film, it is Mystery. The word should even be used in the plural form as it features many incidents that punctuate the daily routine of the village, from a prank leading to a fall from horse, to a fire, from cabbage decapitation to child molestations, it is bizarre that all these deeds are strung together but that's because the movie brilliantly reflects the fullest range of human malevolence and that we never know who's committed each act is more disturbing than the acts themselves. <br/><br/>Haneke fears violence like the next decent man but he fears it so much, he feels the need to anticipate it, to expose its in frontal nudity to better conceal its reversely sacred status, he's not a glorifier of human violence but an iconoclast. Whereas Hollywood is often timid when it comes to display real-life violence, using over-the-top depictions to better make up for their falseness, Haneke dares to show a dead body being toileted or the bloody face of a child who's just been molested, with macabre details revealed. It is ugly but it does justice to the moral fight against violence to show 'the enemy'.<br/><br/>Violence isn't just physical, it is also verbal and sometimes with more devastating effects. There's a scene where a doctor confronts his nurse and what comes from his mouth is a flood of verbal bullying that would lure any fragile soul into suicidal candidacy. The man who speaks is the one who fell from the horse in the opening scene, when the animal's legs were stopped by an invisible cable tied between two trees. He's the first victim, but he' as capable as being pitilessly cruel as the monster who pranked him.<br/><br/>The film is shot in black and white, but this is not just an artistic license, the early century was old enough to be captured in monochrome, whether cold photographs or silent archives and recent enough not to be depicted in bright painterly colors, it was indeed a time in black and white. But that look precisely invites us to focus on greyish parts, the shadows, what lies behind the curtains of respectability or that dusts off the ashes of evil. Because this is what the white ribbon symbolizes, not the so-called purity but the pretension to achieve it.<br/><br/>The film circles around the lives of many villagers, from various ranks and backgrounds at a time where people were mostly defined by their jobs, a baron, a priest, a farmer, the doctor, the teacher, and every one of them tries to maintain a façade of dignity. In an intense scene, a priest delivers a long monologue to his elder children after they've come late home... this is a clear reflection of the kind of puritan mentalities that forged some artistic geniuses like Ingmar Bergman, the use of repression or symbols to conceal the demons. But Haneke is as explicit when it comes to show how laborious these rituals are as to demonstrate their uselessness.<br/><br/>This is a village where moral and social conveniences end up poisoning relationships, aa farmer's wife dies because of a work accident but the husband can't complain because he knows it's a lost cause, the baron is the employer and you can't cut the hand that feeds you. A young optimistic teacher tries to seduce the baron's nurse but fails to convince her father to marry him, the priest's son prays God for killing him because he did something wrong, what he did we never know. Still, enumerating all the episodes would be futile and meaningless compared to the main experience.<br/><br/>The real achievement is to create a journey where we can sense the presence of two forces, evil and guilt, but with cloud of uncertainty making impossible to associate them with the perpetrators, only the victims, and even then, there's a crucial point Haneke makes is that victimhood doesn't make you an innocent person. In the context of today, where there's a clear gap between victims and predators, you'd have serious troubles if you even dare to say that, but this is why German cinema is so cold and detached, it respects our intelligence enough not to take side, or flatter our moral conscience, it invites us to reconsider our certitudes. <br/><br/>""The White Ribbon"" isn't an intellectual exercise, it's a film about people, men, women and children, caught in a sort of hellish spiral they don't know about. Trying to associate this pattern of violence with the rise of Nazism would be too tempting and reducing, because evil has no boundaries, we all carry it, we all have reasons to fear it as much as to commit it. What Haneke does is depicting violence to deprive it from any kind of taboo value, and by refusing to provide hints or answers, he makes both everyone guilty and everyone innocent, and you've got to figure out which option is the worst.<br/><br/>We all have our 'white ribbons' our limits, and in the absolute no one would over cause harm to anyone, but these things happen, and just because they are irrational doesn't make them immune to a form of rationality, this is the country of Kant that established that for each cause there's an effect and inversely, and one effect becoming a cause, and maybe that's the perpetual movement of history captured in this microcosm of humanity"
"by_StrayDog","Null","5","15","12 January 2013"," Decline of the West
","It seems that a consensus's been achieved at last if not regarding this movie's meaning, but its main theme at any rate - it's apparently meant to be an exploration into the origins of totalitarian mentality and conditions promoting its development with Nazism taken as an example. Haneke is also known to have claimed on multiple occasions that his movies are too complicated to reduce their supposedly multi-layered and exquisitely nuanced meaning to messages roughly formulated in a slogan-like way of bad criticism. Well, let's take the liberty of not taking the director's word for it and ask ourselves: what does this film say anyway? And is Haneke's persistent elusiveness an indication of profundity or cowardice and manipulation?<br/><br/>First of all, let's admit the obvious - the nature of totalitarianism is hardly all about distorting ideals through turning them into a soulless absolute. Or rather this turning is the process's technical outcomes, not its underlying reasons. While the reasons, again, hardly constitute the binomial theorem. In which case, what would be the purpose of the movie's quite complicated construction and the essence of its hypothetically subtly nuanced meaning? Is it an attempt to provide an in-depth examination of the subject or is the author simply trying to dodge calling things by their right name and selling vagueness for complexity?<br/><br/>I'm afraid that Haneke's most recent film is not so much more than just a brilliantly - which should be admitted - executed manipulation that fairly successfully accomplishes the shift mentioned. In quite cunning a manner the director fills this work with multiple ostensibly mysterious scenes and details that are obviously supposed to create an impression that they can be validly interpreted in several different ways. However, by means of that the author totally eliminates the possibility of a single consistent overall explication. As a result the audience is left with nothing better than the necessity to invent for Haneke the meaning - or meanings - of this indeed highly intricate construction which he has forgotten to put into.<br/><br/>Or deliberately decided not to do so - at least in any articulate way. Even though he was talking about things which were, in fact, not that ambiguous at all. As well as he failed to think of nothing better than referring - though in a parabolic way - to a hundred year old events and some relatively ""innocuous"" at present nation to fabricate a simulation of an honest utterance on this indeed very serious and momentous subject. And did so now - when our world is balancing on the verge of a catastrophe, which coming into reality will inevitably make this subject even more relevant. Because it's much easier to assume the demeanour of an aesthete and deliver abstract judgement in respect of something so distant. And, of course, we are all against any manifestations of fascism and totalitarianism. But it somehow doesn't prevent us from accepting the Patriot Act.<br/><br/>And it's so nice of the director to have avoided any didactics, too. Because how can we be bothered with telling us what is what without being provided with a choice to decide for ourselves whether we want to think so or not - or rather with an idiotic illusion that we do have such a choice - even if the audacity of an utterance just amounts to observing in a definitive manner that the sky is blue? And, surprisingly enough, guess what? This sickening ""political correctness"" conveniently applied to the process of perception of reality - so that anyone could lie to oneself and everyone around unrestrictedly regardless the degree to which this reality happens to be distorted along the way - doesn't somehow lead to neither increase in acuity which is employed in the process of observation nor to greater accurateness of its results.<br/><br/>Instead we see every day how black is sold for white in ways so barefaced that they often happen to be not just beyond good and evil, but far beyond any boundaries of elementary sanity. And in this badly strange world, where all philosophical systems happen to be pushed out by vulgar kinds of phenomenology, where art suffocates from a reek being issued by the decaying corpse of post-modernism (the latter, frankly, never smelt too good, even when alive), in our completely screwed-up society where everything is faked - politics, economy, religion, communications, culture - such ""heroic intellectuals"", who come up with such daring insights, seem to know exactly what they do. To such a world they offer the art of imitation and an imitation of art - that is the only kinds of it that will be welcomed by those who chose to imitate their existence. Thus it may simply be about offering a product that is in demand and will be ""bought"" - consider a basket of awards won by this movie, while similarly impeccable in purely cinematic terms but also honest in terms of their messages Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"" or Von Trier's ""Dogville"", for instance, were either completely misunderstood or pretty much disregarded.<br/><br/>So what we are dealing with here is hardly a mercilessly honest investigation into the nature of violence, origins of totalitarianism or anything of the sort. Frankly, to a much greater degree it looks like a manipulative and cowardly exercise in political correctness, undertaken in the area of ideas, the apotheosis of our Western hypocrisy of today - albeit very skilfully disguised by the undoubtedly highly proficient director as something more dignified. While what we really need to do, instead of getting engaged in such exercises, is to say that ""2 + 2"" doesn't equal ""it's very complicated and depends on many things"" nor ""whatever suits you today"". It equals ""4"". It makes sense to say this today - if we still want to have this option tomorrow."

","In a German village, prior to the start of the First World War, strange things are happening. A doctor riding his horse back home is tripped by a deliberately placed wire and a farmer's wife is discovered to have died in an accident without anyone else seeing it occur. Later, the son of the town Baron is discovered tied up and beaten. With each of these incidents, tensions begin to rise throughout the village. Narrating this story is an unnamed school teacher (Christian Friedel) who becomes romantically involved with a much younger woman from another town. Meanwhile, the parents of the village are finding it increasingly difficult to discipline their children, who have begun to continuously misbehave, leaving them as the youngest suspects for some of these occurrences.<br/><br/>Director Michael Haneke rarely provides any easy answers for his films. Cache (2005) smothered audiences with a subtle but claustrophobic sense of menace, never clearly stating the true motivations of the film's unseen stalkers. What made Cache so intense was its tight focus on a single family and for the audience to be drawn into their emotions. Yet The White Ribbon (Das weisse Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte) has been crafted to deliberately isolate the audience from this village. As everyone is a suspect, there can be no emotional attachments. Shot entirely in black and white and decorated with impeccable costumes and set designs, the film is strikingly beautiful but also cold and distancing. Though all of the characters are convincingly portrayed by the members of the cast, they are either so deeply flawed or outright nasty that it is difficult to access them and feel for them. In one scene, a doctor tells his mistress that she is not only old, flabby and smelly, but that she should die as well. At nearly two and a half hours, this endlessly bleak picture is somewhat intriguing but also overlong, slow and emotionally uninvolved.<br/><br/>A scarce number of disturbing images are left to shock the audiences throughout a film that relies far more on reaction rather than simply action. Almost all of the incidents take place off screen, away from the eyes of both the characters and the audience. This notion of implying, rather than simply stating, forms a deeper thematic concern for Haneke. At the beginning of the film, the teacher who narrates the story mentions that this tale will explain things are going to occur later in history. Many critics have therefore interpreted the film as an allegory for the young generation of German children, who would escape suppression and grow up to embrace fascism before the start of the Second World War. To further illustrate this point, Haneke has seen the need to leave these crimes unresolved to demonstrate not only how these children were left undisciplined and unpunished but how the mere mention of their responsibility was entirely disregarded. Those that are willing to accept the film's deliberate sluggish pace and its lack of conclusions might find the subtext to be more rewarding and they might be more accepting of Haneke's motivates and choices as a filmmaker as well.<br/><br/>The White Ribbon is not easy viewing and it will hold its own strengthens and weaknesses depending on what some viewers are anticipating. Those that are more appreciative of the period piece genre will admire the sheer craftsmanship of the picture and are likely to be less deterred by the pace and more understanding of what is implied rather than simply spoken. Yet for many, not just those who are expecting a more conventional mystery, it will remain a completely isolating and ambiguous picture that deliberately distances one through its aesthetics and the characterisation of a number of the roles."

The black-and-white photography is just as marvellous as the impeccable cast (with some of the children particularly outstanding.)

","The White Ribbon is powerful and unsettling. Haneke's dispassionate look at a village and its unspoken problems only serves to heighten the audience's reaction to the systematic wrongs that are occurring. A sense of fear dominates every aspect of the film, and this is reflected in the general sense of apathy exhibited by all of the characters. The black and white cinematography gives the film a very distinct look, fitting for the film's pre-WWI setting while also adding to the uneasiness of the village's lifelessness.

"Michael Fargo","10","5","15","16 January 2010"," A cold kettle of fish
","This austere, ravishingly beautiful film by Michael Haneke ostensibly concerns itself with the German mystique that led to their involvement in two World Wars. It may well be that, but what Haneke accomplishes is nothing less than exploring the nature of evil itself that emerges from cruelty, forced servitude (in many forms), empty dogma and the corruption of innocence (that white ribbon that symbolizes innocence in the title of the film and is physically manifest as a real ribbon worn on the arms of children who would—in 20 years--replace those ribbons with swastika's).<br/><br/>Universal in its scope it may well attain ""masterpiece"" status even as we watch. While the performances in this film are impeccable, it's the filmmaker's realization of what he's putting before us with such confidence and beauty that overwhelms. I won't pretend this is a movie for everyone since the subject matter alone will alienate many and the resolution leaves all that we've seen open. But isn't that true in life? The most horrible crimes are never completely understood even with intense study. How much has been written about the Holocaust and we still grapple with it even being possible. Haneke lays before us the origin of such evil, but we still find it hard to understand those who act it out.<br/><br/>This is one of the few films that the subtitles spoil compositions on the screen. I hope the DVD edition places the titles off the frame. Great technical devices draw us into a world that is only half seen. The camera will fix on a physical composition and the action will take place off screen or half-hidden by some architectural feature, for instance a brutal corporal punishment occurs after we watch a child fetch the cane and disappear behind a closed dooronly the sounds of lashing and cries of pain are what we hear. Over and over, this technique is employed and rather than frustrating us from actually witnessing the horror of very cruel acts, we only imagine them and it unsettles us more. <br/><br/>Walking out of the theater most of the audience was silent, but I heard one fellow whistle and exclaim, ""Boy, that's a tough one!"" Yes, tough and beautifully made and hard to shake off. But undeniably a rare achievement in the cinema."

","A long and slow portrayal of a very conservative and judgemental Austrian village, just before the outbreak of World War One, in which some moderately interesting events happen to some dull and spiteful characters.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in building an atmosphere of bleakness - if you want to know exactly what it feels like to live in a joyless, judgemental, protestant, Germanic society where traditional protocols are enforced by miserable dominant patriarchs then this is your film. If you want to get an impression of how German or Austrian society could have been gripped by the charisma of an obsessively judgemental fascist dictator, then you might think that this gives you some insight.<br/><br/>Certainly, this film leaves an strong impression, although partly this is because watching it was such a miserable experience that I felt like I was actually there. Visually, is where this film excels, although there is a touch of emperor's-new-clothes about the choice of black and white film. There is very little use of artificial light which means that in the inside scenes are dim, but the contrast is beautifully balanced and details are retained. The wide aperture required in these low lighting conditions causes a short depth of field (only a short distance is in focus), which gives these scenes a certain realism and is sometimes used to add emphasis. In the night time scenes, the bold contrasts between light and dark are used creatively in conjunction with the narrative. A lot of the other technical aspects of this film are good too - set and costume design all create a sense of authenticity.<br/><br/>The characters leave a strong impression too. Every one is poker faced. Dialogue is either formal, angry or judgemental. No-one cries or laughs throughout. They feel very realistic but superficial. We see how people are, but we don't see why they are that way. It is obvious to say that growing up in such a place is not going to do wonders for the mental health of the next generation, but I would have found it much more engaging to have had insight into at least one of the characters, or a character that provided perspective. Even the narrator is charmless and dull. Maybe the characters are not realistic after all, because in the world that I frequent, I occasionally come across someone that I don't want to slap around the face.<br/><br/>The plot is meant to be intriguing but it happened too slowly and it happened to characters that I was quite happy to see go off to the First World War trenches. I felt mildly intrigued towards the end, but before all was revealed, the film ended. This was meant to make you think but by this stage all I could think about was getting to the bar.<br/><br/>There is a chance you will find this film very absorbing, haunting and thought provoking, but in my opinion, life is too short (and it is arguably shorter than this film). Do yourself a favour: spend the time you would have spent watching this film down the pub talking to someone that actually IS interesting, and if anyone asks you what the film was like just say ""Oh it was a fantastic allegory of the rise of 20th century fascism."" Also mention that it was black and white which, naturally, adds 2 points to any film's profundity. Every one's a winner."

","Filmmakers can be excellent in the visual narrative, the structuring of a movie or the staged play itself. Only a handful of them are able to handle these three qualities simultaneously. Haneke for example, although competent in the latter two, misses visual imagination. His movies are mostly too static to be relevant in say 20 years.<br/><br/>Haneke's trademark is the hiding of the story beneath the surface and in this respect Das weisse Band can be seen as Caché 2. Besides heavy borrowing from his own movies there is also an extreme amount of copying from very diverse types of filmmakers.<br/><br/>Most remarkable is the acting here, almost Scandanavian in nature (restricted, inside-out) and almost identical of that found in Bergman's work. The pastor's section is strongly reminiscent of Fanny and Alexander, both in style and substance. Also borrowed in this segment is Bergman's strong symbolism, although generally less powerful and more direct here (the bird, e.g.).<br/><br/>The voice-over's diction and neutral tone reminded me of Dogville and Manderlay (von Trier). A lot of camera-work is also done by fixing the camera behind the character, showing his or her perspective in the story and mostly seen in work by the brothers Dardenne (and later Aronofsky's The Wrestler).<br/><br/>Haneke copied the shock-editing from Kubrick, and it is almost strange to see so few other filmmakers use it, while it has become one of Haneke's major styles. The other major style is mentioned before: hiding the story, whereby the reverse consequence is that 'The camera lies all the time' (taken from DePalma).<br/><br/>Das weisse Band also resembles The Village from Night Shyamalan, but here the overlapping is only superficial, as the political allegory about the dooming world war is more direct. The allegory itself, albeit intended powerful is relatively weak, as the mapping of events and institutions in the village is not always directly possible to the complex factors surrounding the start of WWI.<br/><br/>The whole movie contains almost no music (except for some live music), the persons representing institutions in the movie have no name, things also present in La Pianiste. The tranquility of the acting and the slow pace all transform you to the beginning of the 20th century, but again copied from Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (both Kubrick and Haneke make also heavy use of Schubert).<br/><br/>The problem is that Haneke's style is not innovative enough for me to be overwhelmed by his productions. In the first hour Das weisse Band comes a long way in setting out something new, but after all the typicality's of Haneke's movies are introduced, the interest on my side faded. I hope in the future he will act as another famous Austrian and ride more the waves of creative destruction."

","Honestly, if you just want a vision of pre-war rural Germany then The White Ribbon is an idyll, very picturesque indeed. Beyond that, I'm not sure what the filmmaker was aiming for. My take was that as a result of the entrenched disciplinarian conceit of an older generation, with perversion as well as cruelty, some sort revenge by a younger vigilante is randomly attached to the most severe and guilty of this isolated community. Or perhaps, presciently perceiving the coming horrors of war, someone thus disturbed has protested with inspired acts of terrible cruelty. The movie is beautifully filmed, and the choice of black and white was inspired in that regard, but, alas, it's slow moving and the story is dark and strange and although a kind of resolution is achieved, I'd venture, for most, it will not be enough. Mind you, as a subtle warning against a type of strict conservatism of the past that we may at times confuse with a cleaner, more innocent time, well, in this regard the filmmaker may certainly have made a brilliant point."

","Many of the other reviewers have perhaps missed a larger point of what I think (IMHO) this masterpiece is about. They've attributed the pre-WWI straight-jacket, blinkered and regimented lives of the people in this village as explaining the rise of the Third Reich. Other reviewers have complained about the 'unsatisfactory' ending: that the unsettling events portrayed were not fully explained. The movie ends just before the onset of WWI. The writer's point is that evil cannot always be explained, but it always begets further evil (e.g. WWI - a horror in itself, and which in turn led to the subsequent horrors of the Third Reich). The many 'little' horrors committed in the village by unknown perpetrators are matched by other little horrors committed by fully known perpetrators. The ghostly quietness of this movie, the drabness (black and white frames only) of what should have been a gorgeous rural backdrop is very much in sync with the existential solitude, feeling of entrapment, and inevitability of something dreadful that lurks ... in all of us. More prosaically though, this movie contains all the ingredients key to any good story: the viewer wants to know what comes next; wants to get to the bottom of the mysteries; cares about the characters; the dialogue is spare and riveting; the acting, cinematography, casting and directing superb. Memorable, thought provoking, spellbinding. (If you only like fast paced action movies, or whodunits, then you'll hate this movie)."

","Movie directors are no different to any other kind of artist. They have a view and they use film to show it. Great directors are usually thought of as being great because their view is broad and sheds a lot of light into the areas of human contact that are often hidden. The stories they tell emerge from the feelings of characters. There is no story in Waiting For Godot. It is about nothing other than what happens when the characters interact. The White Ribbon has no story apart from a peep behind the doors of people living in a small German village in 1914. One has sex with his daughter. Another hangs himself. Another sticks a pair of scissors into her father's pet canary. A woman dies in a work accident. A boy is beaten until he is blind. Another boy has his hands tied to the side of his bed when he sleeps to prevent a defiling of the flesh. And on. And on. And on. And all of it, in case you miss something, underscored with a narrator, who was himself a teacher in the village all those years ago. I read that the Austrian director of this movie makes a lot of these sorts of films and as a result, he wins loads of prizes in art house festivals. Art house being another term for small audience. Don't waste your time with this black and white fake pretending to be an egg work out. When I see a film get ten stars I just know it will be a turkey.

If you're looking for the political tension that was present in previous German films like ""The Lives Of Others"" and ""Good-Bye Lenin"" you won't find it here. There's not a lot to like. The cinematography is quite nice, the whole film is in black & white which extenuates the time and place.

","Sometimes you have to ask yourself, is it fair to pass that burden onto a person was 3 when Hitler died? From a sociological POV, I don't think it was that on the mark. Nazism was largely a product of the 20th Century mass, democratic urban society, of largely Catholic roots(Hitler, Austria, Bavaria all Catholic). The Nazis were ex servicemen, mainly mainstream urban working and lower middle class people. It was also a product of a society that was almost totally militarized up to 1919.<br/><br/>In contrast, the was set in an agrarian Protestant village. It had the timeless feudal pattern where the baron called the shots from his estate and everyone fell in line. The pastor was the right hand of authority, flanking the baron on the sky front. Even thought military service was compulsory for almost all males, and after active duty, they became reservists. There was none of that in the movie even though almost every village, like the fictional Eichwald, had a drill hall and armory so the Army could easily train & mobilize their men. Yet none of that was discussed even though the movie was just before WW l. Also, at that time, this village pattern was dying as huge industries, opportunities, cities, schools, railways and other institutions sucked the villagers away from their stagnant, poverty ridden villages.<br/><br/>This movie might have been better at displaying the roots of Prussian militarism, but Nazism, no. As unpleasant as some of the people were and unjust and authoritarian the way of life was, there were limits to the depths that a traditional society like that would sink. It took a modern, mass movement exploiting mass democratic choices & fears and shorn of any inhibitions from religion or tradition, to perpetrate the horrors of Nazism. It also took a similar society of Communist fanatics to the East to instill fear & to emulate. In defense, this type of traditional society simply fell in line and went along like the rest of the more ""enlightened"" urbanized German masses. Also, in defense, one could say the movie was a parable, not to be taken on the literal level as I have done. And as a parable of evil in innocence, it is okay. But I am still waiting for a movie that realistic depicts why they became Nazis."

He replied that there is no lesson. Sometimes there is atonement, sometimes not. Is this what Haneke s trying to say? I think that unloading a big downer on the audience obliges the auteur to explain himself. <br/><br/>Compare this one to another German film, The Lives of Others. Both deal with the dark side of human nature (German culture seems preoccupied with the dark side), both leave evils unatoned, but Lives of Others leaves a beautiful grace-note.

"dromasca","8","4","12","6 February 2010"," punishment and guilt as sources of evil
","The full title in German of the film is 'Das weisse Band – Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte' – 'The White Ribbon – A German Children Story' which could translate as 'story for children' or 'story about children'. A story for children it certainly is not – Michael Haneke is the author of some of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen, and if there is some sense in age rating of movies, I would avoid showing his films to children under a certain age to protect them emotionally. It is a story about children, and the film can certainly be categorized in the genre of these horror stories where the Devil seems to be incarnated by innocence, and for sure a good one in the genre. Haneke knows how to create and maintain tension, how to film the real while suggesting the missing, how to pass the anxiety beyond the polish of civility. But the film tries to be much more.<br/><br/>We are actually warned from start what the film is about. The story happens in the year prior to the first world war, in a rural area of Germany, where the social and moral system in place for centuries seems to have little chances to change. Peasants work the Baron's fields and gardens, the priest and the Church defend the existing order and the morals, teacher and priests are not more than associates of the existing order. And yet strange things start to happen, some get obvious explanations in the human conflicts, other remain unsolved – accidents, deaths, violent deeds. As the story is told by the teacher of the village many years after the events we know exactly the location in time of the events, and we know that the storms of history will blow up the whole system and apparent tranquility of life soon. However, before war starts the life fabric seems to deteriorate from inside, the whole society and its institutions – church, medical practice, family fife – are deeply sick.<br/><br/>The thesis of Michael Haneke is not far from the one of the American author Norman Mailer in his book 'The Castle in the Forest'. As Mailer goes back into the ascendancy of Adolf Hitler trying to discover the roots of evil in his family life and sins of his ancestors, Haneke takes a more general approach and tries to discover the roots of Nazism in the internal conflicts, the puritanism, the unspoken dark secrets of the family life of a constrained society. Obsession with order and discipline, education by punishment and guilt, tight guarding of the appearances of morality without deeds being true to principles do not necessarily lead to the order and quietness that is aimed, but long term can generate quite in the contrary. In a society where speaking the truth and revealing the evil at small scale are less important than keeping appearances of social order the freedom is in danger and evil can develop at bigger scale.<br/><br/>All this is spoken in few words by the off-screen commentary of the village teacher who tells the story, but is not explicit in the cinema language of the film. The impact of the film would not have been that deep without the master cinematographic treatment that Haneke applies to the story. First the black and white image fits perfect the world that is being described, and not only because its a world still lit by gas lamps, but also because the lack of colors reminds the classic German expressionist films that caught in the epoch contemporary or soon after the action of the film takes place the same type of angst. Then the acting is simply amazing. Many of the important characters in the film are kids or teenagers, and Haneke had to do a rigorous selection to select his best actors. he succeeded at utmost, I have seldom seen such a range of kids characters, each of them different, human, true. They seem to belong to their time, and to live through the painful coming of age, which is their growth into maturity in a world which becomes ugly.The tension between the not so innocent childhood they are going through and the adult world that tries to educate them by oppressing their feelings, punishing and inflicting them a permanent state of guilt is well acted and described beyond words.<br/><br/>Haneke avoids to make a harsh judgment. The whole fabric of human relations is not dark, we do have a love story between the teacher and nanny and we do have the innocent gesture of a kid trying to give consolation to his father by making him as present the most important thing in his universe, which say that even in the darkest times and circumstances there is still hope that a flame of humanity is kept alive. He does not completely solve the mystery of everything that has happened on screen. As in real life some facts remained unexplained, and judgments, even historical judgments need not be fully radical, and and good that such it is."

","Michael Haneke's new film is a mystery ""whodunit"" without a tiresome detective Poirot summing up the situation and announcing his conclusion at the end. This can be an unsatisfying experience for the spectator, who may feel being conned for over two hours watching a drama without ending. It certainly is a very intriguing film. Strange that most comments in this forum like to associate this story to the genesis of Nazism, this seems to me far-fetched. The story unfolds in a small village in Germany just before WWI on the events involving children – who are aplenty in the film (it seems that every family in this small village has at least 8 children, except the doctor whose wife died after the birth of his second child). The mysterious occurrences in the village all seem to have appearances of divine retribution for the ""sins"" of the victims either in their present or their past lives. <br/><br/>I am not convinced that this signifies the birth of the Nazism. Some commentators in this forum seem to complicate the story by reading too much between the lines and missing the obvious fact. I am surprised that no one made any allusion to the sexual deviance and paedophile behaviour of the Pastor in the film. Watch: instead of being enraged by the incest between the doctor and his daughter, the Pastor was secretly jealous. His apparent severity towards his own children in matters of sexual nature was his deliberate act to disguise his sexual frustration. When the teacher mentioned that the midwife had found out the perpetrator behind the torture of two children, the Pastor was visibly shaken, and immediately closed the windows to prevent the leaking of the news to the outside world. Has no one ever thought that this is a story about a sexually frustrated paedophile in the guise of a Pastor?"

","""The White Ribbon"" is set in the northern German village of Eichwald during 1913 and 1914, the months immediately before the outbreak of the First World War. Eichwald is a picturesque village of half-timbered houses, not too different from many similar English villages, and many of the characters would have had their English equivalents- the squire, the parson, the country doctor and the village schoolmaster. And yet it is difficult to imagine a film of this nature being made in Britain, or for that matter in France, and certainly not in America. <br/><br/>A British film about country life during the 1910s would almost certainly be made in the ""heritage cinema"" style, with rich colour photography and great attention to period detail. It would probably be nostalgic in tone, with pre-war society painted as a relatively stable, prosperous and happy one; any reference to the coming war would be to an impending catastrophe, threatening to sweep away all that that society holds dear. This is emphatically not a film of that type. <br/><br/>""The White Ribbon"" is not shot in colour but in a harsh, cold black-and- white, which seems designed to distance it from any nostalgic feelings; the society depicted here is not one likely to inspire nostalgia in anyone except the most hardened masochist. The story tells of a series of dark and unexplained events which plague the villagers. The doctor is injured in a fall from his horse, which appears to have been caused deliberately. A peasant-farmer's wife dies in an accident at work at a sawmill. The local Baron's young son is kidnapped and badly beaten and a barn on the estate burns down. <br/><br/>Numerous villagers, especially those in some position of authority, appear to be hiding some sort of guilty secret. The Baron's wife is having an affair with another man. The widowed doctor is popular with his patients, but is having an affair with the local midwife and is sexually molesting his own teenage daughter. The village pastor is a severe and joyless puritan, who mercilessly beats his own children for minor transgressions- he is particularly obsessed with masturbation- and forces them to wear white ribbons as a symbol of their lost innocence and purity. The Baron's bailiff also thrashes his son. The one authority figure who appears to be a genuine man of decency and integrity is the young schoolteacher who acts as the film's narrator. <br/><br/>The film bears the subtitle ""Eine Deutsche Kindergeschichte"", ""a German Children's Story"". The word ""Kindergeschichte"" normally means a story written for children, but here it rather means a story about children, and it is very much the children and young people who are at the centre of the story. No solution is provided to the mystery of the various crimes which have afflicted the village, but there is a suggestion that at least some of them may have been committed by these young people, possibly in revenge for their mistreatment by the adult world or because they have learned this sort of callous behaviour from their elders and supposed betters. <br/><br/>There has been a lot of discussion of the supposed political significance of the film, discussion which, I suppose, is inevitable in the context of any German film about early twentieth-century history, especially when it deals with that generation, born around 1900, who would have been young adults during the rise to power of the Nazis. One critic attacked the simplistic notion of trying to locate the seeds of fascism in religious hypocrisy and authoritarianism, but the director Michael Haneke never makes this explicit parallel, although some have seen the name ""Eichwald"" (""Oakwood"") as a portmanteau of ""Eichmann"" (""Oakman"") and ""Buchenwald"" (""Beechwood""). It may also be significant that three of the boys are named Adolf, Rudolf and Martin, as in Hitler and his deputies Hess and Bormann. <br/><br/>There is no attempt to make the case, beloved of British historians of the Colonel Blimp school, that the Second Reich was merely a dress- rehearsal for the Third. There is no evidence of anti-Semitism or hatred of outsiders, no charismatic leader who could be considered a proto- Fuehrer. (All the authority figures in the village are singularly devoid of charisma). Certainly, the social attitudes on display here seem to us harsh and authoritarian, but such attitudes were by no means unique to Germany. ""Spare the rod and spoil the child"", for example, was once a popular proverb in Britain, and paternalistic landowners like the Baron could have been found in virtually any European country, including those where no significant Fascist movement ever developed. America was perhaps more egalitarian than Europe, but no less puritanical- in some respects, indeed, possibly more so. Indeed, one could interpret the film as making the opposite case, namely that Nazism represented a reaction against the values of Wilhelmine Germany rather than a continuation of them and that elements among the German people, tiring of a joyless emphasis on discipline, self-control and self-denial, eagerly embraced a world-view which allowed them to give full vent to man's baser instincts in their vilest form. <br/><br/>Perhaps the best way of approaching would be to view it not as an explicit political allegory but as a wider human allegory about the dark, irrational forces which can lurk even in seemingly tranquil village. There can be no doubt that the atmosphere of the film is one of gloom and foreboding; the village seems a sombre, forbidding place even on bright summer days. It is down to the individual viewer whether he or she interprets this mood as a portent of approaching war and dictatorship, or simply as a sense of pessimism about man's capacity for inhumanity. ""The White Ribbon"" is not, unlike say ""Downfall"" or ""The Wave"", a film explicitly about Fascism or dictatorship, but all three films are evidence of the 21st-century German cinema's ability to produce original and troubling ways of responding to 20th-century German history. 8/10"

It takes skills as a dramatist to make something such as this, with complex ideas framed in place and time.<br/><br/>But the big philosophical ideas apart, the technique, writing, the photography, the way the actors perform, the execution of this film is simply stunning. The voice over narration that begins sets the place but does not lazily tell, it is elusive and leads into the action. Like much else in this film it is superbly balanced, not too much or it would undercut the action. <br/><br/>The set scenes between actors achieve a finely tuned naturalness and rhythmically counterbalance the forward action of the script and the interplay between the actors so another degree of interest is revealed and what it might lead to.<br/><br/>It is not predictable, not with the range of characters, the events that occur and a very strong evocation of place in a film in quite some time, make this worth watching again and again."
"DarthVoorhees","8","3","8","2 July 2010"," Underwhelming
","White Ribbon is by no means a bad film. I think it is very well made, well acted, and shot but in the end I just didn't see the overwhelming arch. The reviews and press for the film coming from director Michael Haneke suggest that the film tries to dissect the origins of the fascist mentality that drove Hitler to power in Germany. Without knowing that walking in from prior reading I would have had no idea that was what Haneke's intent was. It's an ensemble picture with different stories and different dilemmas coming from the citizens of a German village circa early 1910's. If I had to maybe come up with a central theme unifying the picture it would be a critique of the parental role. I don't think you can directly link that to the stated intent. In retrospect it makes sense. Modern Germany having to suffer the sins of their fore bearers, but this really isn't a story about the origins of fascism but rather a cultural fighting back. If this truly was what Haneke wanted to enstow as the message of his film he set it in the wrong time period. It simply was a different mindset post-WW1. He seems to want to project that the roots of fascism come from overbearing Christiandom, but is this a uniquely German phenomenon? No. So I don't agree with Haneke's observations, but I don't think this hurts my appreciation for his film.<br/><br/>That being said the film works and works well as a drama. There are fine performances in a very strong ensemble cast. I like that Haneke centers the film around a school teacher played by Christian Friedel. Friedel's performance is the strongest of the picture. For one he relays an optimism not crushed. There is something foreign about Friedel as if he doesn't belong in this village. He looks Jewish and I think there had to have been some intent in this perception. And audiences will come to whatever conclusion...<br/><br/>The thing I love about the film though is the strong camera work. Haneke can stage a scene and he can do so well. In some ways the film reminds me of a Kubrick film. The framing of each scene is done with utmost care as if to create miniature paintings of the stills. There are some powerful moments which showcase this ""mis en scene"". The image of the burning barn, or the scenes where the boy approaches his father the pastor, who is on an impossibly higher level than he, are very powerful.<br/><br/>All in all I recommend the film.

","This was an unforgettable movie experience. I don't recall ever seeing such starkly beautiful cinematography, where every frame seemed like an Alfred Stieglitz black and white photograph. The artistic nature of this film seemed to combine the rustic simplicity of Andrew Wyeth's paintings coupled with the literature of Stephen King. The trailers seemed a bit pretentious, but the rave movie critic reviews now seem well deserved. The story itself had a slow but ominous development, where the people of a rustic pre-WWI German village are experiencing various accidents and wanton acts of vandalism. It's unclear who is at fault, and much of the storyline falls around who the culprits could be. I found the pace fit very well with the plot development. The movie really kept me on the edge of my seat. The dialogue and plot are all very good, and the camera work and photography are truly one of a kind. <br/><br/>Many might find the plot too slow and the characters too harsh and unlikable. Yet the character development was excellent and the screenplay seemed as though it could have been written by Thomas Mann. I hadn't seen any of the other Best Foreign Movie Oscar nominations but it wouldn't surprise me at all if this film walked off with the prize. It was outstanding."

","Having seen a few of Michael Haneke's movies, I expected something good from ""Das weisse Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte"" (""The White Ribbon"" in English). It's certainly a good one, and in fact, I think that it might be a look at events to come in Germany's history. Set on the eve of WWI, it portrays a series of unsettling events in a village, and no one can figure out who is responsible. As events unfold, it throws into question just how much we know about the various characters.<br/><br/>What I mean about the possibility that it deals with later events in German history is this. It begins to look as though the abused children are behind the misdeeds, most likely as a result of their unpleasant upbringings. Could these children become the people who would later make up the Nazi Party? That's just conjecture, so don't quote me, but it is something to think about.<br/><br/>All in all, this is definitely a good movie.

","Here is a film that has already received its share of recognition, but few people are aware of it because it is sort of a well kept secret. Eventually, the film will earn even more well deserved accolades as people discover it, as they experience a powerful account of how evil lurks in the most unexpected places, and how tension can, without the aid of loud special effects, or contrived and overreaching expectations, can truly feel the human soul overwhelmed by forces that can destroy a soul.<br/><br/>Set in a small German village, the film focuses on some mysterious events that rock what at first perceived as a bucolic, peaceful, and nondescript community. In fact, initially, and throughout most of the film, as the drama unfolds, the town is portrayed as a very quiet place, where people might be bored, but they could be in any sort of danger. However, horrible things happen, and they can't be explained, or maybe, the town's inhabitants just chose to ignore them? If one is a careful observer, the signs are there: in the eyes of a child, in the gestures of an adult who moves a little too quickly, in the body language of most of the citizens who remain paralyzed when they should be looking for clues and solutions. There are in fact, too many questions, and not enough answer. There is a tacit acceptance that maybe the actions are justified, and it isn't until innocence is threatened that someone demands intervention.<br/><br/>There are magnificent performances here, particularly the ones by the young couple who portray the teacher and his fiancé, each giving each other plenty of information and acknowledgment about each's affections for the other during an era where there is much reservation and propriety, so much in fact that it provides a rather effective cover for the true emotions festering at the core of the village.<br/><br/>Symbols are important in this film, and most of them are based in the colors we see: black and white. White, supposedly standing for purity, and black, as being the absence of light, when things of all kinds happen. There are truly horrifying moments in the film, and although most of them are kept off the screen, their power overwhelms the audience, as lies pile, people become accomplices by their lack of reaction, and eventually, indulge in self denial and hypocrisy.<br/><br/>""The White Ribbon"" has come in too late in the derby and lost its well deserved place in the list of best pictures for the year, but this is just in one group's perspective. I'm sure those of us who are lucky will know its importance, recognize its quality, and will walk away from the cinema knowing that a true classic has been born."

But yes, the Cinematography was good, its just the whole squinting factor when your trying to read the subtitles against snow, or fields of grain, is highly painful; so indeed, this is a hard film to watch.<br/><br/>The characters literally are avoiding conflict! Someone tells them to do something, and they just do it. Now what is a movie without conflict? Its a piece of crap and a waste of time. I'm glad I got to see what trashy films are.

"Sergeant_Tibbs","9","3","9","2 September 2013"," Haneke's masterwork.
","Michael Haneke relishes in the ambiguous and the uncomfortable yet the conflict is always clear, it's just the intention that is up for interpretation. In The White Ribbon, it's almost as if the film is self-aware of the impact of its drama. It's a vast ensemble which leads to many scenes feeling like vignettes featuring inciting incidents to spark further interesting stories. They're heartbreaking yet subtle and utterly human and often end, in true Haneke fashion, in brutal violence. In each story, there's a common theme of overreaction to change, insisting that ""the world won't collapse."" The smallest irregularity in a routine leads to an overcompensation of punishment or paranoia. The irony is that the effort to try and stop the change effects the routine severely. It's a town that is scared of death and how that impact ripples through society.<br/><br/>It's revealed later in the film that the 'white ribbon' is a symbol of innocence, naivety and a protection from evil so the film is a study of the consequences of that protection. But it's all for nothing when by the end, the first spark of war has begun and everything changes. It's a film about the inevitability of change, despite the force of resistance. Its a fascinating place to study in the realm of storytelling and The White Ribbon is a truly exquisite piece. It's enhanced by theatrical and measured performances by the entire cast, especially the compelling actor playing the Doctor and particularly impressive performances from all the children. Haneke usually relishes in the grain and dirt of his photography but here it's slick and stark. It absolutely deserved its Oscar nomination for the terrific cinematography. The White Ribbon is easily Haneke finest work and immediately enters the canon of great films.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Disturbing! Not because of the amount of blood (there is none), nor the scorn (there is none), nor the shocking images (there are none). But, you feel the film running around your head, your bones and your muscles even after hours, days have passed...<br/><br/>How to film evil? Not that ""soapopularish"" evil of reality shows, not that evil of the Manichean struggle against good, not that evil we see in others, but the evil that is within us all. This is what goes on in ""The White Ribbon"", by Michael Haneke, a profound example of how to shoot the essence of the evil.<br/><br/>To this end, the Austrian director uses a fundamental archetype - the purity of children - to dismantle it and slaughter it into frames. The image of the angelic child, which still inhabits the Western imagination, even though we have been made aware of Freud's theories for nearly a century, is gradually disassembled. Representations such as these of the purity of children or the ruling adult male – regardless the resistance of the minorities – are able to impose themselves when Reason takes a nap.<br/><br/>In the film, in a subtle matter, the children are the architects and pursuers of plans against the different - but their role are not explicit, thus watching their unveiling process is very disturbing. You know they are the masterminds all the time without any evidence, without being able to blame on them. Their alibi of purity blinds us the same way we are blinded by the whiteness of the snow.<br/><br/>Everything that is different and outside the normative rules of that small community are basically wiped out: whether it is the dysfunctional family of the physician of the village (the moral question), the midwife and her mentally handicapped son (the physical/ethnic issue), and the gap between the poor peasant family and the aristocracy of the village (the economic question). Many critics see this triptych - as the allegory of the Nazi consolidation which will emerge two decades later. I believe it is a valid vision, despite its shallowness.<br/><br/>The question is beyond the chronological sequence of historical events. The essential inconvenience of the movie is in the pact made with the evil that lies within us all. When we silence ourselves in the presence of evil, when we deceive ourselves and distort the facts to avoid facing evil, when our vice is our passivity, or worse, our denial in face of horrific events so we can keep an unambiguous conscience, or, still, when we prefer taking the easier path of believing that it is all good. At this point we are all evil.<br/><br/>(TEXT WRITTEN UNDER THE VIGILANCE OF REASON)"

Obviously some people have baggage they need to leave at the door before seeing this masterpiece. The film hit home for me personally because my maternal great grand-mother grew up in a small village like this one in Croatia near the Hungarian border. That village also had a land Baron that employed nearly half the residences as was depicted in the film. My great grandmother's brother was the town black-smith. The film's Baron was a carbon copy of what I know of my great grandmother's Baron. He was kind and concerned about the villagers by loaning money when needed and making sure the village had its social necessities. The film's story kept me riveted but the edgy character of many of the villagers was a personality trait that I recognized in many of my older Croatian relatives.

","Northern European literature is rife with family tales and coming-of-age stories told against the backdrop of Lutheran austerity. During its heyday - he 1970s and 1980s - Dutch and German filmmakers translated several of these novels to the silver screen, with reasonable results. But here comes Michael Haneke, an Austrian(!) director with the superb, original ""Das Weiße Band"" to belatedly capture Calvinist cinema's crown.<br/><br/>Shot in stark black and white, ""Das Weiße Band"" transports us to a German village in the 1910s, where people work hard, pray hard and go nowhere, literally. If you squint, there's a touch of Twin Peaks here: Haneke's efficient script wastes no time introducing us to a variety of villagers, all of them struggling in one way or the other. Instantly, ominous things start to happen. Right from the opening credits, the atmosphere is captivating and believable. My grandparents grew up in the 1910s, and Haneke's sets look completely like their family photographs.<br/><br/>Without giving away too much of the plot: this movie is very pretty, but contains some painful images. It is restrained and formal, but emotionally draining. It is not recommended for viewers who can't stand to see children get hurt. At the same time, it features some great, lighthearted scenes illustrating the social customs a century ago. The scenes with the schoolteacher and his fiancée are particularly priceless.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
"chaos-rampant","Null","2","5","1 September 2012"," The narrator
","The idea here is to have one layer outside the film that is (conventionally) recorded , solid history, and use the actual film to examine mechanisms of the actual bleeding reality that gives rise to it. That history could be anything, since it is little more than a commonly agreed way to tell a story, Haneke simply chose something that hits close to home and almost always lends itself to sympathetic ears. And here we have a (fictional) story that is recalled by one of the participants, and in a way that is obvious it's only the commonly agreed version of what happened, if that.<br/><br/>By now, it is all but common knowledge: we see the generation that would grow up to be the Germany that in its moment of despair flocked to Hitler and the Nazi party, as well as witness some of the childhood trauma that perhaps explains it, explains how a society could acquiesce to Nuremberg and Krystallnacht, some less reluctantly than others, would come to crave the grandiose vision, and went on to scatter the bodies of its youth across three continents and two oceans.<br/><br/>On a broader level, there is a small , elusive aperture in the machinery of the universe that evil flows from, and depending on your predisposition, you will come out of the film with a few things about the nature of that evil.<br/><br/>You may note ancient sin that mysteriously stole into the world and poisons its way through the generations, sustaining and replicating itself like a virus.<br/><br/>You may note what in the Eastern world is known as karma, which is not a metaphysical proposition but a simple truth: every force in nature promulgates its reaction, and it is no different with mental pain you inflict (and had inflicted on you by your father's father).<br/><br/>You may note that karmic cycle of sin as nothing other than ego and desire, that aspect of self that thinks the world including its own offspring should conform to its image, and spends a lifetime tinkering with that self-image - ambition, pride, vanity, hate, all means to control life that is ever-changing and flows.<br/><br/>All of it true, but I like to settle for something else, which I believe explains deeper. The story is framed as memoir of an unreliable narrator, a schoolteacher.<br/><br/>And this is the thing; we simply cannot trust the reason of recall that would allow us to see the narrative in its entirety, to fully and deeply experience, in a single moment, the truth of what has happened to us in a way that liberates from the need to repeat (and inflict anew) the thought that is memory that is inner pain that has to take form in the world as a hayloft barn ablaze. And no doubt, that was not the last Holocaust the world is going to see.<br/><br/>It's a less exciting Cache, overall. The same set of gear, a set of images that form a world that we contrive to happen in order to have something to inhabit. But, this one has to labor at the same time under its own stark past and the need to exorcise it, much as Bergman did. One layer is simply outside the film, history, and that layer is its own multifaceted narrative prone to much analysis to be a powerful anchor.<br/><br/>Ways to improve that? How about some of the kids are aspiring athletes, and we can see in the ferocity and dogged determination of their training all that is to come including the sculpted heroes of Riefenstahl's films. Just a thought."
"intern-88","8","2","5","22 June 2012"," Haneke: films for middle-class masochists
","Austrian film director Michael Haneke's latest, The White Ribbon: A German Children's Story, has already won the Palme d'Or. The chances are it'll pick up Best Foreign Film at next month's Oscars, too. Critics have heaped praise upon it, and art-house audiences have flocked to see it. You see, there's just something about Haneke's work that culture vultures can't stick their beaks into quick enough.<br/><br/>Which, in its way, is puzzling. Not because Haneke is not a talented filmmaker. Far from it, in fact. From their stately structures to the languorous, deliberately disconcerting extended takes, his films are always painstakingly crafted. No detail is accidental, no thing unthought. No, what's puzzling about Haneke's popularity amongst those who take their films nearly as seriously as they take themselves is that his films are so desolating. Almost every review of Haneke's work gushes with the same adjectives: disturbing, disquieting, discomfiting. Haneke's films don't please, they unsettle. They are the artistic equivalent of middle-class masochism.<br/><br/>Funny Games, for instance, was the heartwarming tale of a nice bourgeois family tortured to death by a couple of boys in tennis kit. The Piano Teacher was the groin-girding story of a nice bourgeois society driving a libidinous pianist to torture her genitals. Hidden was an endearing portrait of a nice bourgeois couple tortured to distraction by post- colonial guilt, and unfathomable surveillance. But it's not just the content that is so dismal. Formally, too, his films resist pleasure. Almost without fail they refuse to resolve themselves into anything resembling a conclusion. This is hardly surprising: agency in his work, whether that of psychotic kids or camcorder-wielding stalkers, is without reason. Bad things happen, that's all we on Earth can know.<br/><br/>The White Ribbon: A German Children's Story is no exception to Haneke's rule of thumb – build something dispiriting and the plaudits will come. Set in a German village on the eve of the First World War, it centres around several inexplicable acts of cruelty and misadventure that perplex the small community. The local doctor is sent tumbling from his horse by a trip wire; a female labourer has a fatal accident at the saw mill; the son of the village baron is found hanging upside down in a barn, his backside bleeding following a severe beating. Misfortune and malice continue to afflict the locals. And they, along with us, have no real idea, but plenty of suspicions, as to who is causing this.<br/><br/>The chief suspects are ostensibly the village children, a ghostly bunch that congregate near the houses of victims. Whether this is out of concern or cruelty we are never sure. But Haneke has a deeper motive than creating some Turn of the Screw-style ambiguity around pallid kids, or even a whodunit, with no who and little dunit. His concern, rather, seems to be with a society that breeds cruelty.<br/><br/>Consequently, the village here functions as Haneke's view of society as a whole. It's a study in psychopathology, a portrait of a community in which cruelty is mundane and evil banal. Haneke seems to want us to see this village as an incubator for some coming monstrosity. Little wonder that every relationship is packed full of latent violence, each interactions pregnant with menace. And given the film's pre-First World War German setting, we can be in little doubt that Haneke intends us to see where and when the seeds of fascism were sown.<br/><br/>The problem with all this is that it is so thoroughly hackneyed. The principle unit of socialisation here – the family – is portrayed as little more than a Freudian caricature, which, given that Haneke studied psychology in Vienna, is perhaps apt. Still, that doesn't make it any more edifying an insight. From the doctor 'fingering' his 14-year-old daughter to the pastor tying his son's arms to the bed to stop him from masturbating, abuse and repression is the familial norm here. And so it must be if Haneke is to reduce the brutal extremes of Nazism to a psychological sickness generated in the bosom of the family.<br/><br/>Perverting the great psychoanalyst himself, one child, Erna, asks her teacher 'if you dream of something, really dream of something, can it come true?'. Her dream? The torture and near blinding of the local disabled kid. The suggestion is clear. The routine repression, often cruel, always damaging, is creating psychotic dreamwork, and dreams here, as the eventual torture and near blinding of the local disabled kid show, do become real.<br/><br/>To Haneke, this is just how it is – 'the truth is obscene', he said in a recent interview. All he's doing is making us see. And what a vision it is. In Haneke's films, human society is sunken, rank, a place where mass culture is dumb, where people, turned on and tuned off by TV, are cruel and complacent, and where families will, for time immemorial, f*** you up. Socialisation here is virtually synonymous with corruption.<br/><br/>Why is this vision so popular? What is it about this crass, aloof moralising that is so attractive? The answer lies in the question. In Haneke, every countercultural prejudice, from the perils of consumerism and mainstream entertainment to the denunciation of the family, is given a sophisticated artistic form. Never has liberal snobbery looked so clever."

","Obviously it is not an effortless film to enjoy, Haneke's HIDDEN (2005) is one of my favorite films of all time, in spite of that I admire his works, most of his films' frosty characterizations, restrained accusations are rather uneasy to follow and swallow. So is the case of THE WHITE RIBBON (his Golden Palm winning film in 2009 Cannes), in a completely black-white mode, the film no doubt stands firmly among the best of his magnificent opus. <br/><br/>I found it extremely unsatisfying when the end-credits rolled over, there are tons of questions remain unsolved after 160 minutes while over 30 characters were introduced in the film, for sure Haneke doesn't want to give us any definite explanations of the crimes happened, the whole film demonstrates a ubiquitous mental abuse among the German village at the time before WWI (especially towards children), which caused abnormality in their thoughts, the power of poisoned minds was so overwhelmingly dominant so that it would ignite the naissance of Nazi among the next generation while a detectable overthrow of religious paternity was under the way. <br/><br/>For me the ace of the film is the camera work by Christian Berger, darkness saturates in every corner of the village, leaves creepiness and shadows on almost every character. The pace is slow but not tedious, several fixed long takes are gripping. There are some excellent performance by Burghart Klaussner (the pastor) and Susanne Lothar (the midwife). Still, it is purely difficult to love this film other than admire it from some distance.<br/><br/>Maybe the hidden truth is not important, as every audience has his own version of comprehension, nonetheless, with such a thorough reticence, I think Haneke does underestimate the needs of his audience this time, connotation can be obscure, meanwhile, the film itself hides too many clues, which is able to catch a title as an individual auteur, but for the reverent Haneke, there is indeed no need to take great pains to do so both for him and his devoted groupies."

","The White Ribbon (2009)<br/><br/>A brave, intense, complex, nuanced movie. It's got an edge of Ingmar Bergman to the quiet, rural, psychological edge to it, but it's also a big movie with lots of characters and a social theme fitting, somehow for German culture, or so it seems from here, New York.<br/><br/>There are issues here that are daring for any movie--child molesting, patriarchy run wild--but it is put so thoroughly in the context of the 19th Century these themes are weirdly shocking. That proves if nothing else the persuasiveness of the movie and its mise-en-scene.<br/><br/>Another brave aspect to the whole enterprise is the filming, in tack sharp black and white. This isn't the shadowy, silky, dramatic black and white of classic Hollywood of the 1940s, or of film noir, but a more precise and technically clean monochrome. Shadows are dark but with great detail. Highlights sparkle without washing out. It's a thrill to watch, and it gives every scene a documentary clarity and beauty that's bracing. And in keeping with the film's contents.<br/><br/>There no question at all that many people will find this slow, obtuse, overly detailed, and even banal between all the short sensational moments. And the narrator might be wearing more than the voice of a reminiscing old man. But if it does click for you (and you'll know in ten minutes, for the pace and flavor does not change, beginning to end), you'll find a very delicate, razor sharp sensibility that is fresh, and refreshing. I can't say I loved the movie as a narrative experience--as a story, as a long two hours of immersion. But I did love aspects of it without reserve. This alone makes it worth watching at least part of. That's kind of a condemning suggesting, to watch half of a movie, but once you start you'll see what I mean. <br/><br/>And it isn't giving anything away to say that the movie doesn't resolve everything by the end. All the loose ends remain loose ends, which is wonderfully disarming as much as it is unsatisfying, both good feelings, and rare ones. The acting is intensely serious, the sets and costumes have authority, and the tenor can't be anything but legitimate for the times, just before WWI."

That ambiguity allows interpretations that range from original sin to the coming of the Nazis.<br/><br/>Random bad luck such as a farm wife falling through rotten floor boards to a wire strung to trip a horse and its rider plagues a very ordered, even stern, small town without anyone being able to solve the mystery. The most plausible and outrageous solution is the children, but proof is non existent. Besides, as in life itself, many adults qualify. The allegorical implications of children being readied for Nazi crimes against mankind in the next half century are clear, so looking for symbolic clues among caged birds and repressed love is legitimate. You'll not see a better artful analysis currently about the origins of evil.<br/><br/>The title itself refers to ribbons affixed to malefactors to remind them of their sins and the innocence from which they came. The similarity to Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter can't be overlooked as well as the Puritan environment that bred rebellion from authority and repetition of parents' sins. Rest assured, these townspeople are guilty each one of something. <br/><br/>Although deservedly nominated for the Oscar for Best Foreign film, it is also nominated for cinematography, perhaps its strongest technique. The simple farms, clean and straight like Amish settlements, highlighted by pristine snow, are waiting to be violated or can withstand righteous assaults enough to destroy whole civilizations. The black and white monochrome assures we know this is good and evil country.<br/><br/>Although White Ribbon is too long by a half hour, it is a satisfying tour of a landscape filled with malice, deceit, malevolence, and a bit of romance to remind us of the evil's roots and the rebirth and irony of white-ribboned innocence."

Which is absurd: the war produced fascism or similar movements in all countries that took part in it. Fascism was invented in Italy, and before Hitler came to power there were similar movements in all Eastern Europe apart from Czechoslovakia. And in the USA and Britain, similar movements maybe failed because the New Deal and National Government did similar things without breaking with conventional politics.<br/><br/>It is also slow and dull, or at least I found it so."

","Do you like films where almost everyone is rotten? Then this one is for you! The film is nicely done from a technical point of view, and does hold your attention. But the narrator and precious few others are sympathetic. Most are weird, horrible or both.<br/><br/>This movie also is preachy. Less than half-way through we took a break, and my wife speculated about which of the many characters were behind the horrible crimes. I informed her that the minister would be responsible. I was right! This is not because the movie gives it away- to the contrary, it is a pretty good whodunit (though very French in the lack of resolution). But movies of this sort are SO predictable- I am SO tired of being informed over and over and over again by the creative community that religion is responsible for the evil in our world."
"Magenta_Bob","10","2","6","2 January 2011"," Haneke's magnum opus
","Michael Haneke's latest film, The White Ribbon, is a mesmerizing masterpiece that has kept me at the edge of my seat every time I have seen it. It is a puzzle of sorts that seems to have a different solution each time you look at it. Furthermore, encompassing everything from domestic violence to religion and politics, it is probably one of the most ambitious films of the 2000s so far.<br/><br/>Apart from the story, about a German village right before the First World War where some strange events take place, being absolutely fantastic, this is an astounding work from a technical point of view. The black and white cinematography is truly stunning – everything from the subtle camera work and shot composition to the lighting is among the best I have seen. The lack of music helps to build the atmosphere as well; sometimes, less really is more.<br/><br/>The White Ribbon is at times so tense and cruel that it is almost unbearable to watch. The narrator describes it better than I ever could when he says that he felt uneasy walking into a stranger's house. Supported by Haneke's magnificent direction, this is exactly what we get to do as well. However, even at its most painful moments, the film never wallows in misery, and much of the cruelty takes place off-screen (which in many ways is even more effective). Moreover, to balance the work further, there is a touching love story in the center and several genuinely sweet scenes involving children of the town.<br/><br/>By stating that the events in the film bear significance to later events in Germany, the film seems to suggest that it could help to explain the rise of fascism among other things. While I am not sure what to make of such a theory, it is easy to see how the parents' behavior in the film could lead to children being scarred for life.<br/><br/>Right from the start, Michael Haneke puts the viewer in a state of uncertainty by having the narrator tell us that he cannot be sure of the details in his story. Throughout the film, we are given information and details, but never to the point of certainty. Like an unsolvable riddle, there are plenty of possible solutions to what happens in The White Ribbon, but either way you look at the story, there is some anomaly that does not fit into the theory. Maybe the riddle is not meant to be solved at all, or maybe the solution is the very fact that there is not any answer that fits all of the crimes. Indeed, Haneke may very well be suggesting that there is never a single explanation for the kind of human cruelty that occurs in the film."

","It's a film about decent people, good parents and loyal churchgoers. This unshaken conviction is shared by all the adult characters. The only person who hesitates about his moral status is Martin, the Pastor's son, who is testing God's attitude toward him when he's walking on the banister of the footbridge: if God doesn't kill him, then things can't be as wrong as they seem to be. Of course, Martin's God is wearing his father's (Pastor) face of the cruel, scrupulous punisher.<br/><br/>In the society of decent people, good people, parents do not enter any sort of dialogue with their children. They produce lengthy speeches and whenever they ask a question, they answer it for the children, too. In the community of decent people, a child is their parent's commodity: you can beat them till blood is drawn, humiliate them and abuse them. A child is seen as a potential source of problem, disorder; an empty vessel to be filled with moral principles by means of pure aggression. Obedient mothers support this model of unremitting violence without uttering one word of protest.<br/><br/>But of course, it is not the principles that are beaten into the children's heads that remain. What remains and what the children learn is only HOW the moral lessons are taught. Their heritage is aggression and thoughtless violence towards anything that is not perfect (handicapped Karli) - or that is treated better than they are (the caged parrot that Klara kills with scissors, the little brother left to die at the open window, the Baroness's son, or even a flute made from a twig that doesn't sound as good as it could).<br/><br/>Some people argue that the character of the teacher stands out from the general emotional portrayal of the village community. I am not sure; the way he's telling the story does not match the content at all. It seems that even he does not give enough attention and enough thought to what is going on. Being a teacher - he should be the first to notice and to fight against the domestic violence. He's given many opportunities to enter the world of the children, who trust him more than their own parents. But in the end, he has just the same paternalist words of rebuke: for Martin on the footbridge, and for the girl who tells him about her ""dreams"" anticipating subsequent acts of violence. <br/><br/>How Nazism was born? Yes, of course. In the heads of children punished for any sign of weakness, any sign of human empathy, any sign of feeling at all."

","Austrian director Michael Haneke's icily beautiful The White Ribbon is a film very close to the perfection of a certain cinematic type. It lingers, it unfolds slowly and resolutely and unfolds further still when you start to try and unpack it after the fact - the film gets better in retrospect. Set in a small Protestant village in northern Germany in 1913, the film's various narrative threads interweave elegantly, obscurely, dreadfully until eventually, the bottom drops out underneath them all. <br/><br/>The film is narrated by a school teacher (Ernst Jacobi as the elder, Christian Friedel as the younger) reflecting on the time he spent as a youth in the village of Eichwald. Picturesque and seemingly idyllic, the village is shaken when the town's doctor is thrown from his horse after riding into a wire strung across his path by dun dun dunnnn... persons unknown. Is it the weird group of extremely polite creepazoid kids? Is it the humiliated midwife? The resentful libertine Baroness? As the schoolteacher attempts to woo a young nanny working for the Baron, a series of strange events unfold, small mysteries playing out: a barn is burnt, the son of the Baron is kidnapped and abused, the Pastor's bird is killed, the handicapped son of the midwife goes missing. The mysteries pile on top of each other, each small and unexplained, dour omens. The schoolteacher is witness and participant, observing without knowing a revelation of the dark, anxious and cruel character of the village. While Haneke and the cinematographer and frequent collaborator Christian Berger do an astounding job of very very slowly ratcheting up the tension in the film, it eventually becomes clear that they're not particularly interested in the MacGuffin details of any of the small, petty cruelties the film documents. Instead, it becomes cruelly clear that the film, as Haneke himself has said, is about the origins of terror, a story about the lashings-out of a town in the repressive grip of the state, the church and above all else a moral code mandating repression, self-control and the keeping-up of appearances. Haneke's film with its worm-holes of petty violence, cruelly and sexual abuse mining their way through a very crisp, fastidiously maintained façade of order and control is his own architecturally constructed, logically designed statement on the specific human flaws that led a generation later to the rise of Nazism.<br/><br/>Haneke's film is the rarest of things, a bit of very clever sleight of hand that doesn't leave its audience resentful or surly at having been misled, as the point of the film, its sub-textual ending-place is much much more interesting and a much better bargain than the film seems to be offering for the vast part of its textual bulk. This is something that Haneke does (but not always well - in his English-language film Funny Games he tries a similar trick and in that film it's incredibly irritating) and when it works, like it does in The White Ribbon or in his previous film Caché, we're given works that are the literal antithesis of so much disposable generic fare, one that offers unexpected insights and rewards careful attention, and offer more the deeper into them one digs.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Haneke is a skilled enough craftsman that his film doesn't wait until its conclusion to offer up its rewards. It's not a lecture, or a lesson, it's anything but hard to sit through. It's arrestingly beautiful, shot originally in colour and desaturated in post, classically composed and beautifully lit. The performances match the script - minimal, ascetic and austere - and from this very careful control the film spins out slowly a very real, insidious, creeping dread and human anxiety, a Hitchcockian unease and suspense. It's smart without pretense, complex without disappearing into itself, slowly paced without boring. It's masterful, a dark pleasure to watch and even more so to unpack in the hours and days after seeing it, and if it's not the best film of the year, it's very very close. 9/10"
"brianberta","7","1","2","4 April 2020"," Really good and interesting, but not great
","My initial response was that Haneke was exploring where the support for Nazism came from and how the treatment of many of the village kids helped to influence this movement. As the schoolteacher says, ""They could clarify some things that happened in this country"". After watching the film though, I looked up some interviews only to learn Haneke denied that this film says anything about Nazism/fascism, so I realized I had to amend my reading of the film. I then came to the conclusion that Haneke was more interesting in exploring the repressive social order of the village and its effect on its inhabitants. While I wouldn't say this is a great film, I'd definitely say it does a great job at painting a bleak portrait of the village, one which is a lot more nuanced and complex than one would expect from reading a summary of its themes.<br/><br/>In the village, the father figures hold the most power, controlling their kids and sometimes even going against their wives. The baron lies at the top of this social order. He has a paternalistic attitude which he displays throughout the film and occasionally lectures to the villagers. Though he isn't popular, most of the villagers are dependent on him. Since he's the employer of half the village, he has the power to fire and refuse to provide work to all the members of a particular family, shown by what happens to the farmer and his family. The next prominent character is the Pastor, who ranges from strict puritanism, seen by how he restrains his son to his bed after he finds out that, to authoritarianism, shown with his physical punishments of his kids and even his wife, to a degree. The film's title comes from how he ties white ribbons to his kids to remind them of their innocence and purity, but this motif later symbolizes the oppressive constraints placed on the kids concerning how white ribbon is used to tie the pastor's son to a bed or how ribbon is placed over a kid's eyes after he's savagely beaten. In spite of this, the pastor shows middle ground given a couple tender scenes where he allows his youngest son to care for an injured bird or how he accepts his son's gift of a bird later in the film. Another prominent character is the farmer. While we get to see some of the control he has on his family, he primarily shows us what can happen to a family who gets on the baron's bad side and he reinforces the dependency the villagers have on him. The last prominent character is the doctor. Although you initially sympathize with him, he's later revealed to be emotionally abusive to his wife (and possibly towards his previous wife) and physically abusive to his daughter. Each of these father figures contribute to the film's themes in many different ways. Due to this, it's not easy to pick up on everything from a single viewing and it usually takes a few viewings to grasp everything which goes on.<br/><br/>These father figures effect the children in a variety of ways, presumably causing them to carry out the acts of violence. The connection between these incidents are that they're caused by the repressive social order of the village. For instance, the farmer's son destroys the baron's cabbage field as he believes he was responsible for the death of his mother, leading to the other struggles his family undergoes throughout the film. The steward's son pushes the baron's son into the water as he was jealous of him for having a working flute (he likely had it due to his family's high position in the village) while he had trouble whittling one out of wood. The steward's violent confrontation with his son afterwards was the effect of that. It's likely that the acts we don't see are also carried out by the children. For instance, were the pastor's kids responsible for attacking the baron's son given how their Dad punished them in a similar way? Were the pastor's kids responsible for the rest of the incidents in the village concerning the conversation the schoolteacher has with the pastor at the end? The way the final act handles all these mysteries might disappoint some people, but I found the payoff to be quite unsettling. The schoolteacher's final narration stuck with me for a while after the film ended.<br/><br/>With all that being said, I'm not sure why Haneke chose to make the schoolteacher the protagonist. Where does he fit into all of this? Considering how fleshed out and interesting many of the other characters in the film are and how much they add to the themes, the schoolteacher feels one-dimensional by comparison. His relationship with Eva, for instance, holds such little relevance towards the film's themes, save for an admittedly interesting visit to her family where we see that the repressive social order of the village occurs elsewhere. For the most part though, I thought he was kind of boring. I wasn't quite as bothered with his character the second time around, but he still acts as a detriment to the film and locks it firmly in the really good tier.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'd say this is an example of a film held back from greatness from one major issue which could've easily been fixed. In spite of that, the rest of it is truly excellent. I imagine I'll get more out of the film if I were to watch it again since there's so much to unpack from it in terms of all the character dynamics (I know I didn't say much about the steward). If you haven't seen this one, I highly recommend it."

","The Palme d'Or to most is considered the superlative film award any movie can achieve. Now, is the highest prize Cannes Film Festival can offer a confirmation that the winner is ""one of the greats?"" Not at all. Does it mean the awardee has created something ""great?"" Possibly. One of those such victors, a German picture called The White Ribbon, seems to get close to being ""one of the greats."" Director Michael Haneke's tour de force exemplifies such a high quality of motion picture it's hard to decide where to begin.
A small Northern German town in 1913 may be just days away from the declaration of World War 1, but this quaint village breeds a true horror that will surely birth a second one. When the violent maiming of a child sends the townsfolk into a paranoid panic, they soon resort to an authoritarian regime out of fear. Children's movements are due to be reported regularly, freedoms become restricted, and minor atypical behaviors will be reported. Too often are freedoms taken in the service of protection. This social contract is a fallacy as no one is ever truly safe. Violence spurs even within the children's own homes: adolescents are smacked for disobedience; a preacher straps his own son's hands to the side of their bed in an effort to keep him from ""touching himself"" while everyone knows the town doctor touches his own daughter. On the cover of The White Ribbon, a box quote saying this movie is about ""a search into the roots of all evil"" is made hard to take seriously when you see evil has already blossomed.
Yet, the roots of all evil need someone to plant the seed. Here, violence just begets violence. I won't beat around the bush, there was a powerful desire to slug the preacher across the jaw, along with a few of the other prime characters. I suspect those feelings won't be unique only to me. Asimov once said that ""violence is the last refuge of the incompetent."" Well, I believe the quote could be altered to ""violence is the last refuge of the oppressed."" As we learn about how our good Christian characters aren't as innocent as they seem, we begin to understand why the cases go unsolved: how can we expect them to care about solving the crimes if no one is innocent? The kids fight, lie, steal, and behave erratically. No parent is willing to believe their own child would attempt to drown another for a flute (even if they did, the kid would still find themselves on the receiving end of their father's fist). If they act this way as kids, who will they be as adults? Given the time period and country, we already know the answer.
Supposing that my opinion wasn't already apparent, I'll make it clearer: there wasn't a single bad performance in this movie. More than 7,000 children were interviewed, and the casted ones don't hold back. A narration provided by actor Christian Friedel, who plays the local schoolteacher, is no less than fantastic when guiding us. All of this is aided with the direction of Haneke. The choice to shoot in stark black and white has multiple advantages: shadows are more defined, and with what little light there is in the frame, where the light goes is where the eye goes. Completely at the mercy of the director. Every shot is so carefully constructed, one could steal any frame to hang up on the wall of a modern art gallery. It would be easy for any director to use music as a quick path to the heart strings, but Haneke is no such director. The movie is noticeably absent of music, containing only diegetic sources of melody like a fair or church choir. Every detail and choice is deliberate.
Some will accuse this two-and-a-half-hour movie of being fairly slow; I'd suggest them to take up chess or fishing. Many will treat this as a classic whodunnit movie, where you leave the experience trying to figure out the ""doer."" I don't believe it matters. We bear witness to many horrific acts in the film that go unpunished, and compared to what is unsolved, things don't seem all that abnormal in the end. The adults are perplexed, however. They teach their kids manners: tell them how to act, make them wear ribbons to understand innocence, make sure they don't become too rambunctious. They just want the best for their offspring. Why are these awful attacks happening? Who'd want to punish such good, innocent people?"

","A horse with a rider falls, suddenly. So begins a series of events, some of them strange. We do get the answer; it isn't hammered in, it's hinted at, like most of what one can take from this. The setting is a small village in Germany, before WWI. Every character is a human being(flawed, not ""evil""; not all likable), no one in this is flat. The relationships are credible. We see under the surface in this, to the point where we realize the rot behind the pretty facade. The main turning points are three families, that of the doctor, the pastor and the baron(who provides work for many of the lower-class people there). We have a narrator in the 31-year-old school teacher(like all the adult males, only ever referred to by his title), and the growing love between him and Eva(every scene between the two is spot-on, the first is instantly recognizable) is beautiful. The acting is amazing, including for the children. Every performance is perfect. The themes of justice, retribution, guilt, shame, pressure and authority are explored impeccably well here. This has numerous long, largely static takes; nothing really ""changes"", in a sense. A lot of shots are rather dim, as well; not to be confused with ""poorly lit"", not at all... in fact, this accomplishes, like no other film I've ever seen, that feeling that there's something there, in the darkness(that we know from real life). The stark b&w is effective, albeit at times, it feels like they weren't planning for it(but decided on it in post), as a few bits are a little hard to make out sans color. There is a great richness in detail in this, and it really gives you an idea of how it was back then, and how people related to each other, including across the classes. This wasn't what I expected, and I watched this late, so I felt a tiredness set in, that I have yet to succumb to(as I type this, it's been two and a half hours since the end credits ran, and I haven't stopped thinking about it, or the issues it brings up). There is disturbing content and violence in this. I recommend it to anyone who finds what I describe to sound appealing. 8/10"

","Michael Haneke's latest film is a very gloomy picture. This is in itself not remarkable, since his movies are never exactly fun to watch. But in Das weisse Band the outlook appears to be grimmer than ever. According to the director, its story offers an explanation of the horrors that the European continent has witnessed in the course of the twentieth century.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around some dramatic, mysterious, even cruel events that upset a seemingly peacefull small town in southern Germany. The year is 1913, the first World War is, as we are informed by the voice over, close at hand.<br/><br/>The film opens as the village doctor and his horse trip, at full speed, over a piece of string, tied across the road. The horse dies, the doctor is hospitalized. Is it a children's prank that was taken a bit too far or is it an attempted murder?<br/><br/>To Haneke such a fall is almost a metaphor to life. His characters are prone to 'tripping' over unforeseen complications. The villagers however regard such an accident as fate. Everyone but the baroness (who found a lover in Italy) and the schoolteacher (who declined a prosperous future in the sowing-business of his parents) seems to have a genuinely fatalistic outlook on life. At one point in the movie the schoolteacher walks in on one of his students who is playing a very hazardous balancing-game. The boy explains that he gave God the chance to smite him. The doctors' fall is only the first of many disturbing events. Sometimes the cause is obvious, sometimes the cause is lost in the inky black communal conscience. Or do the children know more...?<br/><br/>When the children are to inherit the future, then the apocalyptic scenario of two world wars is a fitting inheritance for this generation. Or so it seems in this film. I wonder if Haneke's outlook is not equally fatalistic as his morbid characters'.<br/><br/>Still, it's not all fatalism or cynicism in this picture. Quite unexpectedly hope shines through time and again. In a little boy's offering his pet bird to his father, whose parakeet has been slaughtered. In the offering of music to a distraught soul. Even in a father's love for his children in the midst of a violent upbringing.<br/><br/>Das weisse Band is a very balanced film. Which is remarkable, since it moves between extremes. It is also a beautiful production. Shot in high contrast black and white, which gives the impression of watching silent- movie-footage. And the characters are acted out with love and depth. It is a film well worth watching, and it will surely give you something to think about for a long time."

They are surrounded by a web of apathy, malice, brutality and envy. As the Baron's wife said! But in the midst of all this innocence blossoms, as the narrator, the young schoolteacher, falls in love with the even younger nanny in the big house.<br/><br/>It's been shot in colour and printed in near monochrome, making each shot as worthy of framing as in any film-noir, and it benefits from the richness and subtlety of texture you'll only get with colour. <br/><br/>Added to that is the sheer intensity of the story telling, beyond Ingmar Bergman at his least stagey. There are hardly any extras; half of the characters get to be fully dimensional, and there is never any sense of acting. In this sternly protestant village they are all trying to keep their emotions buried but we, the fly on the wall, get to see the subtle signals in their faces.<br/><br/>The village is galvanised by a series of mysterious accidents and crimes, and these dramatic incidents link the whole thing together, but it's the fascination the camera has in these people that will hold your attention. It loves them all, the utterly vile as much as the sweet and tender.

","Michael Haneke's super creepy and unsettling film about a small German village in the days leading up to World War I is the best horror movie I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>Things are deeply wrong in this particular village, though they're wrong in ways that are hard to define and which no one will admit. We're introduced to a hard-core patriarchal culture in which men dominate women and children in whatever ways they choose and in which violence and brutality are so seamlessly woven into the fabric of the society they're not even worth commenting on. But the children are watching and learning, and when random, strange and cruel incidents start occurring, it's the children who are most suspect.<br/><br/>I don't think Haneke's point is that child abuse led to the rise of Nazism. Of course it's significant that this film is set when it is, and yes, the children in it would be the right age to become the Nazis of the future. But I think Haneke was interested in broader themes and means for his film to be an investigation of how the atrocities of a people at one isolated point in time are the product of a complicated and dysfunctional past. In this particular case, the result of an unhealthy German culture led to the development of Fascism and Nazism. But apply the same scrutiny to other cultures at other points in history (yes, even to the America of today) and watch the skeletons come tumbling out of the closet.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"MetalAngel","8","2","8","28 July 2010"," Bar none, THE most haunting film I've seen this year.
","Michael Haneke's ""The White Ribbon"" is a crude, dark film that haunts you endlessly- and I mean HAUNT in the highest sense of the word. I watched this film last night out of curiosity for the buzz it earned last year at the Golden Globes and the Oscars. As I was watching it I was both enthralled and appalled by how it vividly represented the darkest faults of human behavior, but I failed to consider it a masterpiece (like many other critics are doing). The film was over, I turned the DVD off and was soon asleep. I can't even come close to explaining how much the film haunted my dreams (and still does to this moment); I tossed and turned in my bed all night, my mind thrown into turmoil by the moral implications the film explores and the amount of difficult questions it forces you to face. It's a difficult film to swallow, but it's also a cinematic experience you'll think over for years to come.<br/><br/>The film takes place in a small village in pre-WWI Germany. It is filmed in black and white, and the cinematography is perfect in giving it its aged, depressive feel. The story follows each (or most) of the villagers' lives throughout the year and a number of disturbingly mysterious crimes or 'accidents' that oppress the villagers' peace and in which many of the children seem to be involved. It would be utter madness to try and describe each of the characters, or each of the mysterious 'accidents' that unfold. Suffice it to say that Michael Haneke has managed to give us a thoroughly-nuanced story, and even though it deals with a great number of characters, they're all well-developed and of multi-layered depths; a heaven-gifted screenplay, if I ever saw one. I remember that I kept thinking ""This is what M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village' would have looked like if it had been done flawlessly."" It's a suspenseful story because of the mystery behind the 'accidents', but it's actually more of a drama- a deeply-felt, crude but poignant exploration into the human soul and of the simplistic beauty in us all that rivals the beastly evil we all repress. It's about the loss of innocence to a world of war, greed, violence and envy; it's about love, and how such a pure feeling becomes adulterated with the hellish passion for sex; it's about the basest characteristics of humanity, and how they taint the existence of a few people living secluded in their village, quiet witnesses to the horrors around them but unable to act against them.<br/><br/>It's not a simple film, no. And it's not a film to watch on a rainy Monday night, cozily snuggled under your covers. It's a film meant to be taken seriously, to be thoroughly analyzed, to have its every frame dissected and squeezed from its significance. I watched it for mere pleasure and discovered that I was almost bored to yawns: it's two hours long but feels like five, it's incredibly slow-paced, there is no raw emotion meant to be immediately understood (but everything must be interpreted from the characters' faces and tone of voice), every single scene has a definite, non-literal meaning...in short, it's NOT a movie you'll enjoy, but a film you're supposed to analyze and then to treasure for the amazing message it conveys. I went to sleep after watching the film pleased with it but unable to understand how such a... slow, emotionless thing had managed to capture critics' attention so. And then came the sleepless night, where I unconsciously ran over many scenes in my mind, analyzing their meaning and coming up with the horrid, deep and frightening conclusions the film gives us.<br/><br/>Well, actually, it's not like the film itself gives us any conclusions, but it leads us to ask ourselves many questions concerning the abhorrent nature of humans and it points us to the turgid answers we'll be sure to get. It's a film that flawlessly presents beauty and horror as twin brothers who can't leave apart from each other. There's the mystery of the 'accidents' combined with the tragically dysfunctional lives of each villager, with the unfair treatment of the children, with the expressly marked roles of men and women, with the growing ambiance of war around them, with the loss of innocence in the town's children, with the inhibition of sexual discovery in each of them, with the refreshing love story between the narrator and a naïve teenagerwell, the movie imparts cold, direct facts of life, pieces of humanity in all their wonder or horror, and it's up to the audience to make any sense of it all and to come to one's terms with the implications of the film's message.<br/><br/>I think of ""The White Ribbon"" and I see it being the topic of discussion in cine-circles around the globe and in film classes. It's destined to become a classic because of the sheer amount of things it deals with and the absolute power one manages to uncover while analyzing it. If I were to start analyzing now I'd be giving away spoilers by the second and ruining what will surely be one of the best foreign films you'd ever watch. I can't recommend it enough!

"OneMinuteFilmReview","10","2","8","18 January 2010"," Extremely Memorable
","Is this 2009 Palme d'Or winner worthy of the honor? What made it something uncommonly out of the loop in lieu of what has come before consists of Haneke's adept hand in capturing a period in time with detailed precision, the wonderful performances of the cast and an extremely memorable story. Every single consideration made in the direction of this unhurried thriller assured it will attain classic status, made to withstand the ages of film-making. Its script centers on a series of malicious, spiteful occurrences perpetuated by culprit(s) who hide in plain sight amongst a settlement of church-fearing Germans. Still waters don't necessarily mean that there are no gators though and the deceptively polite characters in the film hold some dark secrets of their own. We were doubtful whether it deserved its prize when we arrived at the end, but when our minds refused to be rid of Haneke's carefully realized images as if we suddenly had an epiphany, we accept the jury's choice. Humbly and sincerely."
"burgershmurger","Null","14","126","2 October 2009"," A crude, puerile, anti-Christian attempt at explaining fascism
","I will never understand why any movie buff would consider Haneke's movies anything more than self-righteous and arrogant trash. His latest film is just puerile and crude. Fascism was all due to authoritarian upbringing and Christian ethics? Are we to believe that anti-authoritarian ""anything goes"" and sexual promiscuity would have been the panacea against fascism? This obtuse logic is typical of any lefwing ideologue. Haneke is no exception. ""Funny Games"" was a priggish attempt at condemning movie violence but made use of violence itself. I guess only Haneke is allowed to employ violence in ""Funny Games"" and ""Die Klavierspielerin"" but anybody else who dares employ the same device is fair game for him. Everywhere you look, you can tell what havoc anti-authoritarian upbringing and sexual promiscuity have wrought: Crime, rebellion,STDs, illegitimate children, sexual perversions. Maybe Haneke should consider the consequences of his morals before he points with the finger at Christianity. In my church, you won't find a tyrannical priest. If we sin, we confess and our pastors forgive us, just like Jesus taught us. Forgiveness is one of the most important principles in Christian lives. Why does Haneke use a caricature of a priest to get his point across? Because that's the only way he can impugn Christianity. Because Jesus' and Paul's teaching all make sense, even if sometimes it's not that easy to stick to them. But what is the alternative? No morals atall? Of course Haneke's devoted minions look at all his trite output as ""masterpieces"" because they are blind to the depraved and anti-Christian moral values that hide behind Haneke's work. ""Das weisse Band"" is a telltale testament of a man who hates Christianity, who shows a distorted picture of Jesus and his teachings, and who opines that celibacy until marriage is the root of all evil. A true Christian knows that Jesus' teaching all make sense. That's why I abide by them, not because I have to. How about this, Mr Haneke? There are people actually who do not consider sexual ethics as an abomination or a hindrance to a happy life. It's very fitting to the Zeitgeist that a movie maker has to be Anti-Christian to get all the accolades of an atheistic world. Mr Haneke, your jig is up."
"supernma","10","2","9","29 June 2010"," A work of art
","I have heard many different opinions about Michael Hanake's ""The White Ribbon."" Some call it a work of art and a masterpiece, while others accuse it of being shallow and unsatisfying; I happen to agree with the first assessment.<br/><br/>The film is a true work of art with the most beautifully stunning black and white cinematography I've seen since ""Schindler's List."" The costumes and locations are amazing and Hanake's preference for long static shots always enhances the experience, bring his films to a level of artistic brilliance often shied away from by less talented (or daring) filmmakers. I also thought the story was extremely engaging and I found myself becoming more and more wrapped up in it as the film progressed. The performances are very strong and the moments of anger or violence are further intensified because of this. The children do an especially good job at conveying suppressed emotions and truths. I also can understand why some viewers found the ending to be unsatisfying as it leaves a lot open to interpretation, but for me this is always a plus, as I hate being spoon fed.<br/><br/>I haven't seen ""El Secreto de Sus Ojos"", but I can only assume it's also a work of genius as it beat ""The White Ribbon"" for the 2010 Best Foreign Film Oscar. Hopefully I'm right, otherwise this would be a travesty."

","What is it about this film that is so good? It's not easy to place my finger on it. But what I can say is that while watching it, I feel like I'm watching a flawless film. I'm not sure if there's many other films I've seen like that, perhaps a few by Stanley Kubrick or some of the old masters. And, this is the company that Haneke is now in.<br/><br/>After all, he's now one of the rare winners of two best film awards at Cannes. I thought Haneke was brilliant in many of his other films, but I always found something questionable in them. Not so with White Ribbon. It has some of the trademarks of his other films, but this time they're rare and when placed between the rest, they stand out. <br/><br/>In the other extreme Haneke also made Amour, a film that's even more different from his others, besides perhaps the end. Anyway, we're talking about White Ribbon so I will stick to that here. <br/><br/>With all the problems with the youth in this film, the movie wins with the budding relationship that we are introduced to. It just offers something wonderful between the usual combination of weird sexual behaviour, murder and sin lurking beneath the surface. Yet, what for? <br/><br/>I know why Haneke's made this film but being in Germany, I don't have to spell it out. Haneke didn't find the need to and it's best left unsaid as an allegory."
"sorearm","10","1","3","12 April 2017"," I love you Michael Hanneke
","One of the great pleasures of watching a film for the first time is the bubbling of thoughts and ideas going through your mind about where this will all lead and of what meaning is being imbued. The White Ribbon is magnificent in that it keeps this constant inner dialogue alive throughout. By not over-explaining events you end up having a beautifully filmed and edited slice of life at it's most interesting. In life it often takes a period of time until you become fully aware of events and people's involvement in them and it's nourishing to know that your own instincts keep working behind the scenes to help understand things for the future. I love the way The White Ribbon doesn't tie up all loose ends, and although I have only seen it once, I have thought about watching it again many times.<br/><br/>My only disagreement with other 10/10 reviewers is the knife and fork linkage to Nazis. I think by inferring that the children of the film will be adults by the time of WW2 is clumsy and pointless. Michael Hanneke has on a few occasions held up the mirror that young people are not all harmless, lovable creatures and that innate fear by adults of this proposition is a much scarier vision than anything WW2 can conjure. It seems the English-speaking world are sick with the idea that nothing could ever be as bad as a Nazi. Hanneke knows better and so do I."
"KobusAdAstra","10","1","3","26 October 2016"," An important film with exquisite photography and lots of food for thought.
","In this exquisitely photographed black-and-white film we meet the inhabitants of Eichwald, a small rural North German community, shortly before the outbreak of the Great War, as seen through the eyes of an 'outsider' young schoolteacher (Christian Friedel), and documentary-style narrated by Ernst Jacobi. The baron (Ulrich Tukur) is a powerful man; many of the local inhabitants work on his estate as tenant labourers. Many of the people have large families with many children. <br/><br/>We quickly pick up that resentment is simmering among some of the kids. They are often treated badly by the overly strict adults. In particular, it is the children of the Protestant pastor (Burghart Klaussner) who get harshly treated, even physically and psychologically abused by their strict, sanctimonious father. It is the pastor who ties white ribbons to his children to remind them daily that they have to lead pure lives. It is a bitter irony that few of the adults would practise what they preach...<br/><br/>The apparent bucolic tranquility is shattered when the doctor's horse runs into a trip wire and the doctor sustains injuries to land him in hospital. Shortly thereafter the young son of the baron gets abducted and beaten by unknown assailants. And then there is the case of arson on the baron's estate. Before long a mood of suspicion and paranoia pervades the community.<br/><br/>One of the strong points of the film is that the focus is not on solving the mystery of who was responsible for the attacks against the 'establishment', but rather to let the drama subtly - and ambiguously - unfold, leaving us with important questions about the roles of religion, the social order and authoritarianism, and the nature of evil.<br/><br/>I have to re-emphasize the truly splendid monochrome cinematography; particularly some of the indoor shots and snowy landscapes look as if they should be exhibited as works of art in a museum. The soundtrack is wonderful too; it effectively complements the austerity of the more sombre scenes, yet also the ebullience when enjoying the 'end of harvest' festival. <br/><br/>The acting of the professional and non-professional cast is remarkable. It is particularly the young cast that stands out with their truly natural performances. Young actors that should be mentioned are Martin (Leonard Proxauf), Klara (Maria-Victoria Dragus) and Gustav (Thibalt Sérié). Credit to the casting directors; apparently they have interviewed more than 7000 kids for these roles. <br/><br/>Serious movie-lovers will enjoy the 'The White Ribbon'; it is highly recommended. My score: 9.5/10."
"mirkobozic","10","1","3","26 December 2015"," A haunting tale of premonition
","Michael Haneke is one of those directors who deliver tough love. There's no pampering of viewers with too obvious plots, shallow characters or corny humor. ""Das Weisse Band"" is a great example of this. Set in a pre-WW1 German village, it's a story about a series of disturbing, seemingly inexplicable events that shake the pious protestant community to its core. Basically, what Haneke does here is a biopsy of the roots of fascism in the human character and its slow but steady community cultivation that may, or may not, explode at a certain point in the future. This is achieved with an immensely subtle approach: there's no mention of Nazis or fascism itself; the narrator of the story itself just says at the beginning that he will try to ""explain some things that happened later"" and we're left puzzled until it dawns on us what he actually referred to. In a way, the film is structured with symbols similar to those from Georg Grosz's art, with the main protagonists being referred to only by their function, instead of their name (Priest, Teacher, Baron etc.), which is aimed at showing that this could happen-and has happened- everywhere. The cinematography is remarkably done in b/w and the haunting motif of the white ribbons on the kids' arms seem like a dark premonition of the yellow stars from WW2. The end comes as puzzling as the rest, there's no solution, nor absolution. The world is slowly descending into darkness, and everyone pretends they don't see it. What's more, it seems that we're in a similar situation today, with barbed wires in place of white ribbons. And yet, we didn't learn anything from Haneke, or an another man who showed us the sheer size of unleashed evil, and whose name starts with the same letter. Hitler."
"The_late_Buddy_Ryan","8","1","3","6 October 2014"," The sins of the fathers are visited on the childrenand vice versa?
","Not sure I buy Haneke's coy suggestion that the misdeeds of the spooky kid vigilantes that drive the plot of this film, set in a small North German village in 1914, might have something to do ""certain events that later took place in our country."" Doesn't really matter... ""The White Ribbon,"" filmed in silvery black and white, plays like an adaptation of a classic novel—right up till the copout pomo ending—and I found the doings of the pompous gentry (the Baron, the Overseer, the Doctor, the Pastor...) and their vindictive offspring quite suspenseful and involving, even though I knew better than to expect a tidy solution from the likes of him. If I were pitching the script, I'd say something like ""Agatha Christie meets Thomas Hardy meets Edvard Munch""; there's an atmosphere of brooding Nordic fatalism hanging over this village of the verdammt, but no Miss Marple or council of the Fates to sort things out. If you know a little German, the formal, old-fashioned dialogue is pretty easy to follow, with the verbs thumping down at the end like so many shoes dropping. Reminded me of Fassbinder's ""Effi Briest,"" classic 19th- century-style German storytelling refracted through a whacked-out visual sensibility. (I agree that the white-on-white subtitles were a bit of a drag, however...)"
"JackCerf","8","1","3","6 March 2013"," Those To Whom Evil Is Done
","Michael Haneke doesn't believe in solving mysteries for his audience. Apparently he does believe in the left wing Freudian analysis of Wilhelmine Germany. Between the wars, German thinkers like Reich, Marcuse, Bettelheim and Adorno all concluded that the culture of sexual repression and patriarchy had been the root cause of the First World War -- not simply the outbreak, but the dogged obedience and endurance the German people had displayed during four years of hardship, hunger and slaughter. A fortiori the same root causes applied to the German desire, epitomized by Nazism, to do the whole thing over and get it right this time. The Weimar fusion of Freudian psychiatry and Marxist politics is with us to this day. It was vulgarized during the 1960s to a slogan -- Make Love, Not War -- that assumed that fighting and sex were antitheses. It is still the conventional wisdom of middle class progressives about gender relations and child rearing.<br/><br/>The conventional view of European life just before the catastrophe of the First World War is one of hazy nostalgia for a lost world of order and certainty. Haneke isn't having any. His little village of Eichwald, somewhere on the North German plain, is a pastoral hell of patriarchy, subordination, violent punishment, heartless religion and sexual repression, breeding envy, resentment, hatred, and self-loathing, where children's natural impulses are driven underground by force to emerge in violent cruelty towards the helpless. The social structure of Eichwald is dominated by the Baron, who owns most of the land and who most of the peasants depend on for wage labor on the estate. Representing order, learning and moral instruction are the Steward, who is a porcine and subservient brute, the Doctor, who is a self loathing sadist and pervert, and the Pastor, who coldly dispenses humiliating punishment in full ""this will hurt me more than it hurts you"" mode. At the bottom of the educated elite, just above those who work with their hands, is our narrator, the ineffectual Teacher, who doubles as parish clerk and organist, and who is paid too little to afford to marry. All of these men are addressed as Sir -- Herr Baron, Herr Verwalter, Herr Artzt, Herr Pastor, and (by the children only) Herr Lehrer. The children address their fathers not merely as Father -- no Daddy here -- but as Father, Sir -- Herr Vater. The younger children are sweet and open, but by the time they're 10 to 12 the kids are hard, tight and closed. And onward to 1933-45."
"paul2001sw-1","7","1","3","24 February 2013"," Out of time
","In Michael Haneke's 'The White Ribbon', a serious of dark, mysterious events overtake a German village in the year immediately before world war one. Haneke's portrait of life in this era is mesmerising but more poetic than realistic: the tyranny of aristocracy, the climate of sexual repression and the mask of everyday quietness and civility seem deliberately overdone, albeit in an understated way; the film's schoolteacher hero seems almost absurdly unauthoratitive, and it's hard to imagine such a person surviving in a real school in any age. Yet the film, shot in black and white, has a certain power, and remains watchable in spite of its length. The odd thing is that I'm still not at all certain what Haneke's purpose was in making it."
"SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain","10","1","3","13 September 2012"," The White Ribbon
","Haneke returns to form after his very good, but unnecessary, remake of his own Funny Games. The White Ribbon focuses on a small village where mysterious things are happening. Not supernatural things, just weird and dangerous things. This is the kind of town where a ""tragedy"" is someone slicing up the Baron's cabbages. On many levels this is an exploration of inexplicable hate, the kind that often surfaces during childhood. There is no real reason for it, other than the child's view of injustice. A lot is left to the viewer, is this a single campaign of terror and hate? Or separate incidents aiding a myth? The perfect cinematography creates a peculiar, yet welcome, dream like fantasy world. It feels like a paranoid fairytale or Gothic fable, but always grounded in reality. It's a marvelous achievement and the perfect way to end 2009."
"deschreiber","Null","1","3","6 October 2011"," Did it all lead to Naziism? No.
","A very interesting, atmospheric movie. It sticks in the mind long after you've finished watching it.<br/><br/>However, I do taken exception to reviewers who try to connect the culture shown in the film--narrow religiosity, feudal social relations, stiff formality and discipline enforced by harsh punishments in family life--with the rise of Naziism some twenty years later. Most of those features were not at all unique to Germany but were present throughout Europe and North America. Think of the strictness of Dutch religious life, which never produced a Dutch Hitler, or of the sexual repression and cold, formal family life in Victorian Britain. Even in North America, in California, similar conditions were common, as can be seen in Steinbeck's East of Eden. The rise of the Nazis in Germany is well explained by events and conditions following the First World War, without resorting to these vague ""cultural"" principles. <br/><br/>So what about the submission to authority, as shown in the villagers' unwillingness to stand up to the Baron? Does this lay the groundwork for later compliance with the Nazis? No, that had nothing specifically to do with Germany. Remember the experiment with high school classes in California, when they were divided into groups, one given dominance over another and pumped up with parades, flags, armbands, uniforms, titles, all the paraphernalia the Nazis used for their mass manipulation. The California kids, for all their tradition of freedom and independent thought, reacted just as enthusiastically and diabolically as many German youth did in the 1930s.<br/><br/>No, I think this film is not about history and politics. It's about the forces that can appear anywhere and everywhere--perhaps even forces that are ultimately inescapable--that cause people to behave wickedly."

","Michael Haneke, one of perhaps the most gifted directors of our times, made a compelling piece of art. His movies are all but predictable and repetitive. ""The White Ribbon"" is a an incredible treatise on nature of evil and seductive power of violence. Small German village, year before bloody World War I, full of hard working and seemingly civilized people,turns into a dangerous place, where ugliness lurks at every corner. Amazing black and white cinematography gives powerful imagery. People with subdued emotions that eerily get expressed in a same black and white way. This is one of the most impressive movies I've seen in last 5 years. I firmly believe this will be a classic."
"Argemaluco","8","1","3","26 December 2010"," A very interesting, but not perfect, film experience
","It might seem strange the fact that director Michael Haneke, who is mostly famous for making thrillers, made a historical drama which emulates the visual chiaroscuro and the narrative melancholy from various films directed by Ingmar Bergman (1918-2007). However, the screenplay from The White Ribbon hides enough terrifying surprises to make it pretty tense, but the horror itself is left to the audience's imagination, limiting itself to show us the most mundane aspects which surround the moral and spiritual collapse from a small German town in the previous days to the start of World War I.<br/><br/>The elegant manufacture from The White Ribbon reminded me of the European art-house cinema from mid-20th century, cold on its surface, but with boiling emotions which are hidden by the habitual protocol from ""the old continent"".<br/><br/>The element I most appreciated in The White Ribbon is that the screenplay can be interpreted in various different ways. The historical period from the story (just before World War I) and the commentaries from the narrator (who seriously mentions ""the bleak future from my country"") can indicate that the movie tries to capture the social discontent which encouraged the nationalist movement...and the eventual rise of the Nazism. Something which can also be interpreted is that the point from the film is to show the inherent ""evilness"" which is developed from the intolerance. And it is also possible to conceive that what the film tries to say is that the evilness does not exist...the only thing we have is different points of view, where the atrocity committed by one person is the heroic act from another one. There are other levels of interpretation in The White Ribbon, but my point is that it was very interesting to see a film which can be interpreted on different ways, inspiring the spectator to think and draw conclusions.<br/><br/>On the negative side from The White Ribbon, I have to mention that some moments feel a bit pretentious, and that there are some scenes which could have been deleted, since they feel a bit unnecessary in the context from the movie. Nevertheless, the solid screenplay and some excellent moments of anguish and tension are enough reason to recommend The White Ribbon as a very interesting movie."
"ajs-10","6","1","3","18 December 2010"," Sorry, didn't get it!... This time...
","Film critic Mark Kermode describes this as ""A subtitled black and white film about precision anxiety."" Personally, I'm still undecided about it. Maybe I haven't watched enough films yet, but I feel there's something I'm missing here. This film has had a lot of praise, even winning the Palm D'Or at Cannes, but I'm struggling to see why. I'm sure there's someone out there who can explain it to me. But I digress, here's a brief summary before I tell you my thoughts (summary haters please guard the Baron's cabbage patch while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>It is Germany in 1913, just before the outbreak of World War I. The setting is a small village in northern Germany, a place where the rather straight-laced residents are about to suffer several unfortunate and mystifying events. First off an accident which results in a serious injury to the village doctor has everyone baffled. Then the son of the Baron, who owns much of the land around the village, is kidnapped and beaten by persons unknown. And there are several other events that occur throughout the film, some of which are explained, but others that remain a mystery. I really cant add much more, there are relationship issues involving the doctor and a bit of a burgeoning love story between the teacher (and narrator), and the nanny employed by the Baroness, Eva, but I guess that's all I can say about the plot without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Whilst watching the film I have the impression that the children maybe know something about the trouble in the village, but none of them are letting on. I guess it's deliberately left open to interpretation. Decent performances from all of the cast, in particular; Christian Friedel as The School Teacher, Leonie Benesch as Eva, Burghart Klaußner was particularly good as The Pastor and Maria-Victoria Dragus as Klara.<br/><br/>I feel a bit bad that I cannot give a higher score, I did want to like this film but it just didn't do anything for me. There are many out there, I'm sure, who totally get this one and I bow to your superior film knowledge. Maybe I will re-visit this one in years to come and see the critically acclaimed film I am supposed to. For now, only recommended for those who get it But I guess you won't know that until you've seen it.<br/><br/>My score: 6.2/10"

","Michael Haneke spent more than ten years on this production, which explains why every little detail about this movie is right. From the first frame on this movie grips you with its bare-bones style and unbearable silence. There's no music, long stretches without dialogue, most scenes only use natural lighting so the screen often goes black, but none of that is needed to generate an intensely powerful suspense. This is mostly due to the excellent child actors, who put in very effective performances. You feel sorry for them, but at the same time they're very ominous. Haneke's message seems to be that suppression only leads to more suppression, a scary basic idea that makes for a very frightening film. Rightful winner of the Palm d'Or, and I'm pretty sure it only got snubbed for the Best Foreign Film Oscar because several judges later admitted to never even having seen the movie."

","The White Ribbon is one of the most frustrating and antagonizing movies I have ever seen. But on the other hand, the film consists of sheer beauty from the story within and from the amazing black and white cinematography which adds authenticity to the film. This film moves at a snail-pace and is consequently devoid of thrilling action, but the story is very captivating and the lesson is simple: negative, authoritarian leadership will lead to negative, possibly devastating consequences.<br/><br/>Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke directs a film that takes place leading up the first World War. The location is a baron's land which consists of a doctor, schoolteacher, and so on. But one day, these mysterious events occur which results in injuries and even deaths of townsfolk. Now as they are trying to find answers, nothing can happen without drawing suspicion.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Christian Friedel does a great job as the young teacher who is witnessing these events and is trying to find answers which is proving tough as he is trying to marry his prospective fiancée. I also have to mention Burghart KlauBner as the preacher. He was very tough and is a man you can't look down upon.<br/><br/>Overall, The White Ribbon is a serious look about the root of evil and it is known for depicting society and family life on the dark side. This film essentially shows the evils or we shall say the roots of Nazism and Fascism which would rise to power less than two decades after the events of this film. This film is the meaning of beauty, technically and story-wise, but is also a very frustrating film and it is very hard to watch due to the tepid place. But it is a case study on human society, so it's well worth watching. I rate this film 8/10."

Its as much a mediation on the roots of evil and how in the years to come these roots will manifest themselves as history.

"ruby_fff","6","1","4","11 March 2010"," This film prompted me to view and truly appreciate the mastery of filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer and his ""Ordet"" 1955
","Austrian writer-director Michael Haneke's films are always serious & content controversial, with complex emotions, mostly joyless and lacking in warm lovingness, never sentimental. So they are definitely NFE: not for everyone. In ""The White Ribbon"" 2009, delivered in stark black & white, the film is to the point of austere. Hence when a glimmer of love beckons, peering through all the somber, mind-provoking issues paraded in front of our eyes - like the rare occasional smiles between the two demurely cautious young lovers of the village schoolteacher (played by Christian Friedel) and Eva, his fiancée-former nanny to the baron household (played by Leonie Benesch), you'd probably try to hold onto that flickering candle light and keep it closely guarded throughout the film as the young man did, so to come out (alive) of whatever consequences the story results in. Though skillful cinematography by Christian Berger of natural landscapes, village scenes contrasting specific interior lighting of the characters and situations, contributed to the flow of the 'filmic' journey.<br/><br/>The story is told with a narrator from the perspective of the schoolteacher recalling from his memories. It is true of Haneke's treatment here is likened to a mystery unraveling - but certainly not anything like what you might expect of the genre. He's merely providing 'facts' and pieces of information that could clue us in to what may be going on. Haneke has the polished sophistication of leaving it up to the viewers to contemplate the meaning of what we see on screen as he presents them. Yes, you might say going to a Michael Haneke film is in itself an introspective experience, potently emotional or provocatively intellectual (or both). Content is substantial, with multiple characters from adults to adolescents to children, doctor, baron, pastor, farmer, steward of a village community, and the turn of events keep coming one after another - intriguing more than entertaining. The film is in German with English subtitles, and dialog is not sparing at all (pardon the pun), mercilessly so. The runtime is 2 hours and 24 minutes.<br/><br/>You can easily find the synopsis or plot points spelled out through reviews and discussions on the Web, including the official Sony Classics site at ""sonyclassics.com/thewhiteribbon"". Press Kit with Haneke Q&A is available as PDF download. You may relish more by seeing the film without prior extensive exposure to the story. In any case, I felt there are parallels to Dreyer's ""Ordet"" (Danish for ""The Word"") with just as many characters and relationships, sequence of events, community pressures, yet through anger, arguments, anxious anticipations, the radiating realm of faith, belief in God and that miracles could happen provided more positive energy with forgiveness and retentive love emphasized. In ""The White Ribbon"", such 'goodness' human elements seem obviously scarce - the single image of the schoolteacher and Eva riding the carriage together stayed with me, echoing their smiles as a slim hope of coming through, thick and thin.<br/><br/>If you like Haneke, this is a must-see. If you want to try a Haneke film, go see it with an open mind and leave any figuring out of plot points after the movie, to discuss or further explore (or neither). ""Ordet"" of Carl Theodor Dreyer's? Yes, that is a must-see, whether you believe in miracles or not."

","""The White Band"" explains its title in a scene where the local priest's children, after supposedly having behaved sinfully, wear a band on their arms, as a remembrance of ""purity and innocence"", until these two virtues are restored.<br/><br/>But they are not. The white band, courtesy of history, that is Duke Ferdinand's assassination and the beginning of the WWI, enters the modern era, whereupon the narrator, the village's teacher, brings his narration to a stop, since, as he puts it, was thrilled by the festive prospective of his marriage to the appropriately named Eve. His voice gives in to the church choir which fills the tableau, the tableau fades, his last words being, ""I didn't see any of the villagers again."" Why did I choose these two moments? Because they are pivotal in a way; in a way, this is where complexities begin, not in a favorable way.<br/><br/>Even if the film is not wholly allegorical, that is how fascism emerged, as the general view goes, or, more closely to the title of the film, about the loss of innocence, there are allegorical pinpoints, like Eve's name, or again the title, that come as allegorical punctuation. And that should mark a stronger point than a full-blown allegory, because it should make more antithetical our reception of the film - but this does not happen. Why? The dialogues come off tendentiously as an accumulative, oppressive endeavor, as evil's own proof and repression. I, for one, would rather think that the introduction of a certain human detail would make the inhumanity of hierarchy's representatives even more terrible, for even a national traitor has his human moments; otherwise, the thing smacks of a schematic, one-dimensional allusion, or worse of a melodramatic, unintentional bad joke as when the priest is close to tears when his son offers him the replacement for his bird in the cage. But I think, if you allow the extreme reference, this was a bad pun intended towards Hitchcock's lovebirds from ""the Birds"", for Haneke has certainly has read his Hitchcock well, as most of his recent films show. There are no lovebirds in his films.<br/><br/>And this marks another weakness of the film: the voice off narrative is a device one should avoid, as any pupil of Hitchcock should know, unless one's intention is to frustrate, but I don't see how this is handled in a profitable way in the film since we are offered scenes the narrator could not have witnessed or heard. Of course a director can change registers at will, but - and here comes the second major reference in terms of influence, or if you want dialogue - when that happens, we are somewhat dragged into Bergman's territory, as many a reviewer has pointed, but I find that this lacks cinematic merit, and certainly Bergman's graceful touch. If it is not plausible, make it graceful.<br/><br/>But perhaps you will say lack of grace is the point. And perhaps you are right. But if grace is lacking, and be replaceable by a thorough grayness, then highlights of allegory that come as punctuation only steal both ways. To cut a long story short, you can have an allegory of repression, if repression is meant as police repression of a riot, but if it is psychologically, and more precisely, as surely Mr. Haneke intends, post-Freudian, then you can't have an allegory of it: it either seeps, breaks into the surface, bends and returns, or not. Yet ""the white ribbon"" remains white throughout. It just fades out in the end. And we do not fade in in our anxiety.<br/><br/>The film remains a good premise where it should have risen up to its promise. Mr. Haneke should stick to the amorous couple's discontents which bring obliquely and eloquently the community's discontents, as he superbly achieved it with ""the Pianist"". It seems that with a direct approach of the political he becomes literal, and not to the letter."

In retrospect, when I say ""behind the closed doors"" I mean so almost literally as household, bedroom, barn and other doors, gates, fences, etc., (open, closed and/or in the act of opening or closing) appear so frequently in this film that I can't help but wonder if such were not intentional.

"grayner-2","9","1","5","21 November 2010"," A haunting, thought-provoking masterpiece
","This is the kind of movie which haunts you and keeps you thinking long after it is over. If you are looking for a clear-cut thriller where the culprit is clearly revealed at the end, this film is not for you. Like many of his films, Haneke purposely does not provide answers and instead shows that things are disjointed and the ""who"" is less important than the ""why."" It is often speculated that the pastor's children are the one's who ""did it"" in this movie but this is the wrong approach both in terms of overall message of the film. The film is about seething anger that comes from unjust abuse and punishment, a top-down authoritarian society and about the types of behavior which sough the seeds for more violent, totalitarian societies, be they in Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Soviet Union. So we immediately see the basic power structures in the film: the baron oppresses the workers, the parents oppress their children, men oppress women and the cycle of abuse spirals downward until even the most innocent are the victims. We see 4 ""pillars"" of the community – the baron, the pastor, the doctor and the teacher. The hierarchy of the community is in that order with the baron acting as overlord, the pastor there to maintain the social order and prop up the baron's power, the doctor who is educated and needed in the community, thereby commanding respect. The teacher has little power and is not taken terribly seriously by many, yet he also does not seem to be the object of such anger. Then we have the social stratum - the baron, the steward, the employees, the farm workers and then the Polish migrant workers. We have the parent/child dynamic, where any misstep of a child outside can destroy a family, so the children, particularly the pastor's children, are held to a ridiculously high standard. Finally, many of the men oppress the women. At the same time, all of those at the bottom of the ladder start to revolt and strike out at others, sometimes hurting the most innocent. Central to the film, of course, is the children. The overriding point of the film is not so much who did what specific act but rather that this is a society of constant punishment and retribution. It is almost certain that the pastor's children are at least aware of some of the heinous acts. They are themselves victims of physical and emotional abuse yet are expected to be models to the community. They can be pushed only so far until the power structure is challenged and Klara kills her father's pet canary – once again striking out at the weakest. But there is much more to the story. First, the doctor is attacked, making the ""healer"" in need of healing. We have the farmer's son destroying the baron's cabbage out of anger for the way his mother died. In fact, one of the big culminations of the film is the big harvest festival where the baron can show his largesse to the workers, an event sanctioned by the pastor. But the event, coinciding with the death of a worker, seems to cement the resentment of the baron's family and the excess with which they live. This is followed by the savage beating of Sigi, the window left open at the steward's home to hurt the baby, the fire at the barn, the doctor's son wandering around in a confused state, the incident involving Sigi's flute and the severe beating of Karli. Clearly the open window and the flute incident were by the steward's children and the motive appears to be anger about being deprived things – from a new baby to Sigi who, the epitome of a spoiled brat, to a father who would kill his son for embarrassing him in the eyes of the baron. It would also seem unlikely that the pastor's kids would have caused the barn fire as Martin was tied down at the time and Klara seems accounted for. Now several points should be noted: 1) Perhaps Anni and/or the midwife would have a motive in attacking the doctor – he mistreated them both, sexually molested the daughter and perhaps others. 2) In the scene on the bridge, Martin reveals that he sees everything as being dictated by God, there is no free will. So any punishment meted out is ""God's will"" 3) Note that parallel and name similarity between Klara and Karli. Diametrical opposites: she as the eldest(?) female pastor's child is held to the very highest standards in the community, she represents order and a threat to the power structure, he is utterly powerless, flouts all social paradigms, has a questionable parentage. Karla is very aware of this power structure and is willing to mete out punishment herself. 4) What are we to make about the doctor? Why did he leave town so abruptly separately without the midwife, taking ""her"" child along? Was his sexual abuse going to be made public? Did the midwife have a role in her son's beating in more of this ""trickle down"" rage? Did the pastor make threats? There are no easy answers and Haneke doesn't want there to be. The point is that abuse travels downward until eventually some of the abused strike back. The individual culpability is not as important as the overall mindset of the authoritarian society which preys on the ones who are weaker. It is also worth noting the backdrop of WWI. It illustrates how these personal agendas are temporarily cast aside by larger, more sweeping changes but also how a war can start for the most part over one individual – the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand. So like in the film, individual behaviors can branch out and change an entire community or, in some cases, a whole society. The mindset of this generation would come into focus as its children grow up twenty years later in Hitler's Germany."
"jzappa","9","1","5","22 June 2010"," A Staring Contest with Danger
","This monolithic piece is set in rural Germany in the years before World War I. All has been calm and resolute in this village for as long as it can remember. Baron, farmer, pastor, doctor, schoolteacher, tailor, servants, children, all perform their designated functions. It is a male-dominated, dogmatic community, that is, the form of community that was common at that time throughout the world. We are told the narrative by the schoolteacher many years after it happened. In the film, we see him young. The old man wants to recount with impartiality and efficiency. He won't deduce or speculate. He doesn't have the answers. He'll consult only the verifiable truth. The initial one is this: While out riding one morning, the doctor was injured when his horse falls over a trip wire. Someone set up the wire. Could they have been certain the doctor would be their mark? Some malicious power is at work in a small village, initially suspected in a chain of unrelated ""accidents."" This compels the villagers, who all know each other, to watch more cautiously. Is one of them responsible? How can that be? One person couldn't be accountable for all of these off-putting occurrences. Have many been overcome by a depraved contamination? We're conditioned to view such plots as thrillers. A film by Michael Haneke is never that cut-and-dried. It all may have been committed, but what if there appears to be no guilty party? What if misfortunes affect good people who are not as good as they believe they are? Haneke's sense is that we can never be sure.<br/><br/>Other occurrences transpire. Each of these acts must've been done by someone, but the same person could not have competently done all of them. There is account of where certain people were on certain occasions. It's like an enticement to play detective and figure out the perpetrator. But the evidence never corresponds. Of what would evidence even consist? It might just be a matter viewed from the perspective of distrust. Life goes on in a conventional manner. The baron stabilizes his people. The doctor continues his work, yet he's shockingly callous toward his mistress. The teacher teaches, and the students study, and they sing in the choir. Church services are observed. The white ribbon is worn by children who have been immoral but will now try to be moral. The crops are gathered. The teacher charms the pretty village girl. And doubt permeates. There is an urge to resolve the enigmas. Arbitrary cruel deeds generate chaos and dismantle the people's faith that life falls into place. The idea that the verifiable truths cannot be made to connect is as disheartening as if the earth opened up under their feet.<br/><br/>Haneke makes the mystery more intriguing than its resolution. It's too much of a cinch to suggest the film is about the birth of Nazism. If that were so, there would be many more Nazis even now. It is plausible to say that when the suppression of ""terrorism"" is valued more than the protection of freedom and independence, tyranny strengthens and becomes its own enemy. If we are to stop terror, someone must be leader. The role of course goes to those focused on exacting control. Accordingly, all not under control is evil and must be stopped, and that's how the benefits of the state become higher priorities than the benefits of the people. Maybe the gist is that we become so unnerved by threat or catastrophe that we'll forfeit freedom, even expect to. Do we believe we're safer in a totalistic society? Many do. But things eventually flare up, and the Berlin Wall falls, or we see the Green Revolution in Iran. The catch-22, as some philosophers have observed, is that activists become consumed with driving their cause that it becomes a vicious circle.<br/><br/>For what little respect I have for a filmmaker who authentically slaughters an animal in nearly every one of his films, including this one, I have to accept that many admirable filmmakers have also done less than admirable things as people. Kazan named names. Gibson claimed Jews are responsible for all wars. Ford spent a career teaching a pivotal generation what to think of the savagery of Native Americans and the heroic superiority of their oppressors. Herzog authentically killed an assortment of animals in Even Dwarfs Started Small. We just have to judge their work for its own value, not how it reflects their character. Haneke's ingenuity lies in implanting deep ambiguities in films fixed on the day-to-day lives of everyday people. He cold-shoulders the clear-cut resolutions of most films, in which everything is resolved by the roughshod conquest of one side. His films are like twisted fables, professing that bad things sometimes occur merely because they occur. The cosmos ridicules man-made order and does what it will.<br/><br/>The film is aesthetically excellent. It returns to the beautiful artistic density of Ingmar Bergman. It's in black and white, naturally. Color would undermine its impact. In terms of cast, the real stars of the film are the children, who are perfectly cast and oppressed by so few lines they evoke so much disheartenment and bewilderment purely in their faces. Purely as it is, The White Ribbon tells an elementary allegory in a village about little people and indicates that we must face the randomness and unavailing complexity of our universe and achieve equilibrium between doubt and refuge."

","The White Ribbon (Das Weisse Band) tells the story of a small German village and the strange occurrences that happened in the months leading up to World War I. The film begins with an accident involving the doctor. He falls off of his horse and is severely injured. This is the first of several strange and out of the ordinary incidents.<br/><br/>There is tension building between the lower class and the upper class. The major conflict stemming from the death of a worker's wife. While the husband tries to look past it his son refuses. Other groups like the Baron's son and other children arise.<br/><br/>The film is narrated by the school teacher, telling the story many years after the incidents occur. He lets us know that even he is not sure of what happened, and what he is telling us might not even be true, much like a story passed down should be set up. It's not a perfect retelling, but it is (hopefully) accurate. What a story it is.<br/><br/>Each individual character has their own story. The school teacher, the Baron, his wife and son, the doctor,his daughter, the midwife, the preacher, his wife and children, the nanny, and the list goes on with several minor but important characters. Story lines intertwine and combine to construct a complicated web. It's very well written (Haneke penned the screenplay) and paced perfectly. There are several themes and conflicts that arise here. Marriage, faith, loss of innocence, death, abuse, just to name a few.<br/><br/>Filmed in stark black and white by Christian Berger (who worked with Haneke on Cache and The Piano Teacher). This is without a doubt one of the most beautiful films I have seen in a long time. There are some hard issues and startling images, but the camera makes each shot look like a work of art. Choosing to film in black and white gives the film an older quality simply because black and white tends to be associated with older films. It also makes light and shadow vitally important in helping to tell the story. There are no colors to help determine emotions and feeling, just white, black, and in between grays. One mistake could render the image unusable. It's a pleasure to watch a film that pays such close attention to each shot.<br/><br/>I was very pleased with the end. Throughout most of the film we are trying to figure why these horrible things are happening and in most cases who is doing them. Haneke keeps us guessing right through to the end. I'm not sure how others will fell but I felt very satisfied. I invested a lot of energy and emotion and continued feeling for the characters and thinking about the film long after it was over. That's my favorite part about great films. The ability to stay with you after the credits roll. Haneke succeeds."
"colinrgeorge","7","1","5","6 April 2010"," ""The White Ribbon""
","I'm not sure anyone knew exactly how to feel when the credits rolled and ""The White Ribbon"" ended. Standing outside the theater afterwards, a woman asked me for a supplementary opinion. I hesitated before replying, ""It's one you have to sit on."" She seemed disappointed, either in the film or my inelegant response, and shuffled down the sidewalk. I honestly still haven't made up my mind on Michael Haneke's latest, which leaves not on a moment of epiphany or quiet resolution but at the height of uncertainty. Perhaps appropriate, given its thematic wallpaper of suspicion and doubt, but unlike ""A Serious Man,"" which made an ambiguous ending absolutely incendiary, ""The White Ribbon"" is never quite satisfying in its conclusion.<br/><br/>Still, its palpable atmosphere and methodic pacing yield countless small rewards. There's a simple craftsmanship to Christian Berger's crisp black and white photography that lends the rural setting a muted authenticity, and Haneke draws humble, earnest performances from his cast that transcend the coarseness of his plot. The film is set in Germany just before the onset of the first World War, and Haneke paints the rural village of Eichwald as a crucible for guilt and cruelty amidst a series of malicious and unresolved crimes that turn the town against itself.<br/><br/>The film boasts an impressive recreation of 1913 Germany on an aesthetic level, but Haneke's modern sensibility sometimes spoils the illusion that ""The White Ribbon"" is classic film-making. For one, his poor use of voice-over sticks out like a sore thumb. It feels pointlessly neurosurgical for him to dictate the plot to the level of transcribing what has, is, and will happen in narration, especially when his characters and images speak so strongly for themselves. Secondly, his film has an off-putting frankness exorcised by several harsh characters that are so staunchly unpleasant and 2010-era transgressive that they seem misplaced in a period drama and even now feel hyperbolic. From the widower doctor who sexually abuses his daughter to the anonymous pummeling of a retarded child, Haneke paints his Hell in broad strokes.<br/><br/>Mostly, however, ""The White Ribbon"" plays like a mix of moody whodunit and bleak parable, which unfortunately never quite add up to more than the sum of their parts. There have been better films about the suffering we inflict on one another, just one being Lars von Trier's controversial ""Antichrist,"" which is certainly no more subtle, but impressed me at least with the emotional gravity it wields. The bleakness of Haneke's film feels forced and dishonest by comparison, shoehorned into every corner of Eichwald under the auspice of a greater looming threat. That Haneke never reveals the culprit of the crimes is, of course, the point, but it leaves the finished film feeling slightly unhinged.<br/><br/>What Haneke does achieve is a gorgeous, thoughtful, and well-paced mystery that's occasionally too cold and enigmatic for its own good. He plays with powerful concepts that he never quite tames, and they make their hurried dens in the wrong places as a result. ""The White Ribbon"" is absolutely uncompromising in its refusal to defer to audience expectation, even at its own expense in delivering a rounded narrative. On a technical level, its execution is all but flawless, but its content is sure to polarize those viewers who submit themselves to Haneke's bitter meditation on malice, and who probably won't know how to feel when it fades out.<br/><br/>It's one they'll have to sit on."
"sbrisend","Null","1","5","30 March 2010"," A Parable warning against moral absolutism ***Spoiler Alert***
","White Ribbon is an achingly beautiful parable that demonstrates how moral absolutism - expressed as strict, conservative religion and enforced with physical punishment, fear and shame - leads not to moral perfection but increasing violence, fear, chaos, and intolerance. Yes, obviously, at this specific time in Germany, Fascism and Nazism grew out of such an environment. White Ribbon's deep power is not only as a window to the past, but as a warning for today to any community. The religious-righteousness and fear-mongering, as well as threats of domestic terrorist violence, in the US in 2010 suffer from a similar desire for a kind of order that cannot bring the order and perfection envisioned, only a form of control that eventually strangles humanity. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT: To comment on an earlier thread, people in White Ribbon disappeared sometimes because something bad happened to them, just like Nazi Germany, but sometimes they disappeared because they chose to get out before anything bad happened to them, and because only something bad would happen to them if they didn't disappear. Hopefully that's what happened to the woman on the bike, the Midwife - that she disappeared to save herself after her son had been murdered."

Writer/director Michael Haneke takes us back to the northern German village of Eichwald of 1913-1914 just before the first world war. This is a feudal-serfdom type agrarian village that has not yet seemed to have entered the 20th century and where most of the villagers work on the local baron's (Ulrich Tuckur) farms.

None of these compare to the pre-World War I rural German village that director Michael Haneke plops us into.<br/><br/>Haneke is the master of keeping the viewer guessing and never really allowing us a clean solution to the mysteries he presents. Did you figure out what motivated the cruelty from the boys in ""Funny Games""? Did you ever really figure out who or why the family was being videotaped in ""Cache""? The same holds true here.<br/><br/>The story is told by the voice-over from the school teacher many years later. We only see the village and the residents as ""things"" happen - through the recollections of the teacher.

We witness only the aftermath and the distrust of the close community.<br/><br/>The film is up for Best Foreign Film and the stark, bleak, black & white look will put you on edge and create a feeling of discomfort, even in the somewhat happiest moments of the film.

"destroy-apathy","8","1","5","27 November 2009"," Terrifying repressed kids, but why are they and what does this mean?
","The following is taken from my blog, thought it would be more economical to copy and paste this rather than write it out again If you want to leave comments, go to destroy-apathy.blogspot.com<br/><br/>Here are a few paragraphs on my immediate impressions of the film. By no means do I incorporate everything that can be said as it has great depth and substance. I simply want to highlight the overarching themes that I felt were important. My views are pointless in isolation, I openly welcome anyone who has seen the film to complete the dialogue: fill in any gaps, strengthen some of my flimsily thrown out ideas or to tear it to pieces, completely disagreeing with what I write.<br/><br/>Narration I always thought I was dead against voice overs; that they are a lazy way of storytelling, spoon feeding you the narrative rather than letting the film speak for itself. Well this film made me realise that I am only dead against anonymous, omnipresent voiceovers. The one in this film is so personal and direct as it comes from one of the only sympathetic characters in the whole film. It is one of the tools used to reinforce the fact that the story is being told from an objective point of view. Another element supporting this is that right from the very beginning – through said voice over narration – it is declared that memories are funny things. A brilliant way of making it explicit early on that this is an objective point of view, a story but one which it declares will ""hopefully explain what happened to this country"". This gives you the bigger picture from the start. You are instructed - in a non-forceful way - to see this village as a microcosm representing the whole country; that the young characters represent the youth of the nation. The film takes us to the start of the First World War, but more importantly - as the film critic Mark Kermode rightly points out - it is the children here who will reach adulthood during - and therefore be mostly responsible for - the rise of the third Reich.<br/><br/>Terrifying Kids (especially Klara – who is one eerie but immensely powerful and articulate figure) The youth are completely fed up with the treatment they receive from the older generations. The film shows a variety of family/community settings and how the children are undervalued, unappreciated, sexually abused or repressed to a point of insanity. And my goodness are they plentiful; there are numerous shots families where the children swamp the screen, vastly outnumbering their elders, which really puts an exclamation mark on the fact that the old generation (along with all their values) are going to be viciously overthrown. The only middle ground / glimmer of hope is the relationship between the teacher and Eva. These are very important characters that differ from almost everyone else in the village, mainly that they both seem to have healthy relationships with their parents. Eva's dad embarrasses her but at least he speaks plainly, doesn't repress what he feels and expresses his disdain for ridiculous formality. More importantly is that both their parents do not live with them within this damned village (a representation of the whole nation – see below) and they are not products of the society within. This is possibly most important when he attempts to explain the situation as he sees it to the Pastor, who is so enmeshed with a culture of repression that he casts the teacher out. The teacher was so alien to this culture he could not even grasp why this was, anticipate that this would be the outcome of this conversation or even recognise that this repression existed, therefore he let it go on. This could be a comment on those who were not enthusiastically pro-Nazi but just did not do enough to stop them.<br/><br/>Rebellion Whether the film justifies this youth-led rebellion is left for the viewer to decide. It shows their reasons for it, i.e. the captivity they were being held in; a captivity that is clearly symbolised by the Pastor's caged bird. The fact that Klara kills the bird and leaves it as a symbol for her father to find shows the youths intention to fight this incarceration. To further accentuate the injustice of his contradictions, the Pastor keeps in that cage, the healed bird; the bird he told his son he must release back into the wild.<br/><br/>I really could go on, but it really would be... well 'going on'. I have tried to make this concise and focused and in case I didn't make the point clearly I think it is a tremendous film."

","While this isn't Haneke's best film (his 'glaciation trilogy' and ""Code Unknown"" are better cinematically, and are better examples of his personal directorial style), it is perhaps his most mature/restrained, since he doesn't resort to what, in his other work, may be seen by some as 'shock tactics' to get his point across. The use of a mystery plot as a way of exploring the characters' psyches and capacities for wrong-doing and self-denial is similar to what he did in ""Cache"", though the cinematography (which is outstanding in its starkness and formal composition), pacing and acting are more reminiscent of Bergman than any previous Haneke effort."

","Nobody commented on this, but villagers were poor and dependent on the Baron who could abuse or get rid of them at his whim (the governess, the husband of the deceased woman lose their jobs arbitrarily, through no fault of their own) ... Could the torture of the Baron's son be seen as caused by the envy of the have-not children (they throw him in the water to take his flute, but why is he hanging around them if they had tortured him )? There's obviously some (class) struggle there with the farmer's eldest son destroying the cabbage field (and also when he confronts his father). The father is resigned to it, but then he has an epiphany and torches the barn. Religion enslaves/constrains the free spirit, yes, the parents act cruelly towards their children, that too, but something is amiss with the way the property is structured too - if the villagers owned the cabbage field and the barn there would be no point in destroying the property and maybe the farmer wouldn't have hanged himself after his wife's death.... ... Could it be the way Proudhon said it, ""Property is theft!"", so the way the society is structured is built on false/abusive premises and everything else on top of it is just a house of cards? ... What's the story with the Poles the Baron is mentioning when talking to his wife? Is the Baron trying to replace the villagers with even cheaper labor?"

The framing, the music, the cinematography, the (minimalistic) acting and the (downbeat) mood of the movie! <br/><br/>It is easy to smash the movie, because there is not much happening. It does not offer any easy answers either. You might call it pretentious. As with every movie, there are people who'll love it to death and people who'll think it is just a waste of time. If you want easy though, you shouldn't be looking at a Haneke picture.

","I'm a middle-aged man and not really into dramas, let alone 2+ hour dramas, let alone black-and-white subtitled dramas, but WOW! Somehow this movie drew me in. The acting is absolutely superb, even the kids'. I admit I feel embarrassed as an American, looking at what Hollywood puts out as ""dramas,"" and then looking at this. There is no comparison -- this movie really shows the power of film. This isn't two hours of entertainment and then you go home, it's two hours that makes you think for another couple days.<br/><br/>I think the best part is everything really rings true. If you've raised kids in a small town (especially a Protestant town, or German-immigrant mid-western U.S.), and you know how your grandparents and great-grandparents lived, you can really understand how everything in this movie could actually happen. <br/><br/>When you also consider the supposed ""evil"" kids in this movie would be ""of age"" in 30's and 40's Germany, it does help to explain things a bit more, which may be the director's intent. <br/><br/>Powerful story, however you interpret it!"

","Although there seems to be some question as to what this film is about, the director spells it out in an interview on the blu-ray version I watched. I did not put the same interpretation on the film that he suggests but I can see it makes sense. He is also at pains to say that this isn't just about German society and could have been about anywhere with analogous conditions.<br/><br/>I always hesitate to use the ""M"" word but in this case I would call the film a masterpiece. I can also see that it isn't a film that everyone would like because it is a very still and calm film, despite the violent acts that take place. It also runs like a mystery but there are no easy answers given which might be unsatisfactory for some viewers. I generally like two sorts of film; either a straightforward good action or genre film or films that are highly metaphorical and mysterious. This is definitely in the latter category.<br/><br/>The White Ribbon is such a beautiful visual experience that I feel it could be watched with sound and the subtitles turned off. There's so much to see in each frame and the black and white photography is better than anything I've ever seen in a film before. Oftentimes the effect is quite painterly especially when featuring the interiors of buildings. It also leaves the viewer to do a lot of the work – sometimes the characters leave the frame and shut doors behind them and the camera is static for several seconds before characters come back into frame. Could be deadly yet it's always done in a way that allows you to know what is happening behind the closed door or at least be intrigued by the possibilities. Even though the film moves at a slow pace I felt constantly on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>The only thing I can compare this to is Powell and Pressburger's A Canterbury Tale which had a similar set of disturbing events going on in a rural town. But the White Ribbon stands on its own as a masterpiece of modern cinema. Although I've nothing against a good bang, crash type of film as I've said, this is on an entirely different level. This is pure art and lots of people won't like it. It just so happens that I do."
"MaxBorg89","10","1","7","4 July 2010"," Once upon a time in pre-Nazi Germany...
","The White Ribbon is an intriguingly strange piece of film: a deliberately elusive thriller, 150 minutes long, in black and white, set in Germany just before World War I. It's also the long awaited return to his mother tongue for Austrian provocateur Michael Haneke, after a decade filming in French and, in the case of his shot-for-shot remake of his own Funny Games, English. Additionally, and most importantly, it might be his most important film to date.<br/><br/>The story takes place in an unnamed rural village, where a strong Lutheran mindset rules. Over a period of a year, strange events occur which cause harm to some of the more respected inhabitants, like the doctor, the priest and, in a potentially political act, the local nobility. But who is to blame? Somehow, the children seem to be playing a significant role in this, and the priest comes up with a severe punishment: his offspring will have to wear a white ribbon, symbolizing their lost innocence, until they are trustworthy again...<br/><br/>Like all of Haneke's previous movies, The White Ribbon is, at first sight, a very frustrating picture: static shots, and overall ""coldness"" (despite a surprisingly spot-on comedic segment) and, most ""annoyingly"", a whodunit story with no solution. But that, of course, was to be expected: Haneke, an academic as well as a filmmaker, is not interested in easy answers, a fact that is most evident in his decision to deal with his trademark theme - the effects of violence on society - without depicting most of the acts on-screen (there are no sudden gushes of blood like in Funny Games or Hidden). Despite its straightforward storytelling, this Palme d'Or-winner could seem to be the director's most uncommercial feature, devoid as it is of a real ""solution"" and ""big"" names in the cast (although Haneke aficionados might recognize Susanne Lothar, the female star of the first Funny Games).<br/><br/>And yet it is a masterwork, because in his apparent refusal to spoon-feed the audience Haneke still provides a riveting - and frightening - study of human behavior, specifically man's capacity for evil. Beneath the sublime use of black and white and the period reconstruction, which give the picture a neatly anonymous, timeless feel (despite a couple of time-specific remarks), lies a very precise point of view on a very definite moment in history: the narrator (who, in pure mystery tale tradition, isn't very reliable) says the bizarre events in the village might shed some light on subsequent happenings, and Haneke seems to suggest the punished children of 1913 will have a chance to retaliate against other ""wrongdoers"" some twenty years later. It's merely an implication, with no closing captions to openly state the director's point, but it remains very unsettling.<br/><br/>Proving that you don't need blood and other gimmicks to make a statement about violence, The White Ribbon is a superb essay on the human condition: elusive, yet poignant and right on the mark. Extraordinary."
"gradyharp","10","1","7","2 July 2010"," Ignorance poses as Innocence: The White Ribbon
","In a small village in Northern Germany in 1916 a series of bizarre and horrid things happen. There is no explanation for these events, only mute rumors and musings in a town confined by strict Protestant rules of judgment and behavior. The town Doctor on horseback is tripped by a trap wire hidden on a path, is injured, and must leave town for a hospital treatment for a while: upon return we learn that the town doctor is anything but kind in his verbal and physical abuse of his office manager/mistress who may be the mother of 'his child' - a mentally challenged boy cared for the mother/mistress who also cares for his naive other children by his deceased wife. A young boy, the son of the town Baron, is found in the woods, bound and beaten, and the town fails to produce information as to the brutality. A woman falls through a dangerous flooring and dies, her husband commits suicide, the mentally challenged boy is severely tortured, the Baron's cabbage farm is destroyed, the children of the large family of the town pastor are punished for varying reasons (each offending child must wear a 'white ribbon of innocence' to remind themselves to sin no more - the young boy's sin is physical self satisfaction), a building on the Baron's estate is burned, etc. Oddly since there are no identified culprits, the town focuses on the children as the possible perpetrators of the violence - since they are ignorant until they receive Confirmation in the church - a ritual supposed to bring the enlightenment of adulthood to those confirmed! <br/><br/>There are many stories in this magnificent film by the gifted Michael Haneke and none of them is fully resolved by the end of the film. It is the tenor of the city that seems to breed ill winds that in turn suggests that the town's inhabitants - curious and possibly dangerous children and adults with both overt and subliminal evil in their characters - are setting the scene for a country that could produce the evil demonstrated by the events of July 1917 which opened World War II. Haneke captures all of this terror and submerged hate and fear and abuse and character dysfunction in startling black and white photography. The townspeople are all fairly similar in appearance, made more so by the black and white imagery, and the only person in the town that has some semblance of humanity is the young schoolteacher (even in his discovery of courtship) that seems to make the statement that it is only through education that change can occur. Haneke has the courage and sensitivity to leave the audience guessing about the etiologies of all the evils we have witnessed and simply ends his film in slow fadeout as WW I ensues. It is a heart-stopping film, brilliantly directed and acted and photographed and accompanied by a musical score that emphasizes choral hymns sung by children. This is magnificent film-making! In German with English subtitles. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

The movie is a fantastic inventory of objects and faces, an anthropological exposition of the German features, a live museum,a magnificent docudrama... The texture of the whole environment, the details of the set are altogether a masterpiece of film directing . Given this fantastic set we are set to immerse ourselves in every moral nuance of the story, of every common and flat sentence given by the voice over.

I had the (bad?)luck to watch(or try) the enormously overrated Romanian''Police,adj' after this and it didn't but make this one more majestic and strong.

","The extraordinary composition of frames serves to create a visual basis for a terse, complex narrative. The visual composition of each scene conveys what the verbal content alone would not. The acting ensemble was of the highest imaginable caliber. There emerges a third dimension in this art work which is seldom achieved in just 'motion picture'. Moralizing based on this work is really irrelevant. Expectations of linear, tidy narrative would not be met. The ambiguity which seems to pervade the core of the story is itself an aesthetic device necessary to the purposes of the maker of this work. Hanneke seems to have been developing and perfecting his skill in telling a story by thinking about his work as a painter of successive pictures connected by a common meaning."

Its arm's-length approach to the material diminishes its resonance, especially at nearly two-and-a-half hours of gloom on the cusp of monotony. Regardless of the reductive qualities of its chilly mechanism, the film's point is clear while evading an emotionally satisfying conclusion (this ain't a whodunnit begging for a dramatic reveal during the final reel).

The unfairness between the rich and the poor when facing the boredom, there was rich boredom and the poor boredom.

"markmuhl","8","0","1","1 October 2018"," Violence breeds violence
","That violence breeds violence is an old insight, a fact that nevertheless seems to be ignored also by the society pictured in this movie. We get to see obscure and violent events that happen in a Puritan German rural community in the early 20th century, shortly before the outbreak of WW1. Is it really possible that these violent acts are the joint deeds of school children?<br/><br/>What really makes it a rough story is not the fact that these violent acts do happen but the strictness and lovelessness with which these children are grown up so that some kind of counter-reaction is almost to be expected. Also women are not treated much better. Their financial dependency and the pending male violence makes them to obedient and indulgent creatures. It is only the baroness who dares to break free from the bigotry of her husband.<br/><br/>At the same time we do hope that the amount of pictured misanthropy is exaggerated. It also has to be considered that to a certain extent people are just caught in the beliefs of the time. When the pastor ties his oldest son up during the night to prevent him from masturbation it seems at least possible that he believes in doing it for the best of the boy. This apology, however, does not apply for the doctor, who really seems to be an upright sadist.<br/><br/>The deduction, that it was this environment that made these children to the delinquents of tomorrow and can therefore explain the cruelty of German fascism, seems to me a bit daring. I would say that it may have contributed to it like many other aspects and it should therefore be seen only as an attempt for an explanation.<br/><br/>What is it then that makes one fancy this Haneke movie in black and white?<br/><br/>First of all it is an interesting period movie that makes us see, how hard country life still was just about a hundred years from now, especially when families had to feed a lot of hungry children which by the way happen to be all over the place in the movie. <br/><br/>It also is a very self-contained story, quite different from the usual choice of films. If a comparison has to be made I'd like to stress the almost Hitchcock like suspense which makes one stay on with the movie. When the film has ended it will most likely be the other way round: the movie will stay on with the spectator and will keep his mind occupied for a little while longer."

","There are few filmmakers to whom I have as mixed feelings as I do towards Haneke. My favorite films of his- Amour, Code Unknown- I hold to be about as great as cinema gets. The Haneke films I hold in the least regard, such as the two Funny Games films and The Piano Teacher (the latter of which I know some people hold in very high regard), I think are ill conceived exercises in misanthropic sadism disguised, I think even to Haneke himself, as some kind of moralistic lesson to the audience. 
This film, one of his most celebrated, for me falls into neither extreme camp- I just found it tiresome. Indeed, this is an example of a film that is well made on just about every level, that still manages to be unsatisfying. The craftsmanship here is of a very high level- the cinematography is great, the art direction flawless, the acting top-notch. Even the narrative is passably entertaining in a prosaic who-done-it kind of way (although the ""surprise"" ending is anything but). And yet, I felt I'd wasted three house watching it. Perhaps this is because the film's message seems to be: 1. Early 20th century German culture was hella Protestant. 2. Puritanical protestant culture is hypocritical and oppressive. 3. Therefor, the generation of children who grew up in such a milieu grew up to be Nazis.

Director wants to show how the relations of people formed by the happenings of strange facts. Michael Hanecke indicates who's responsible for them : the children of the town or the doctor with the midwife? I will explain to you why I believe that both are. The children live in a strict disciplined, religious, society . They seem to manage to get over with it but the conservatism of their parents sample their patience . So when they are starting to feel isolated they react with different ways. Clara cut the neck of the bird , they drop baron's son in the river and someone bites his hand. I must say that the kid's of poor locals farmers react to the rich and comfortable Sigi because they feel that they are inferior of him. The question which creating is can the children do things like these happened in the small village of our story? Hanecke shows the indignation of children but he indicates what children can do ( for example when Clara cut the neck of the bird). The other suspects are doctor and midwife. The school teacher who is the narrator of our story indicates that these two might have a connection with the death 's wife of doctor. Doctor has sexual behavior with her daughter . The teacher said that Clari's eyes have been wounded them by the doctor and the midwife. The question is who put the wire on the doctor's house and he fell from his horse? Was it midwife or the children? Generally this movie like Hanecke's movies doesn't give you free and easy answers but he wants to make you think, to make you imagine things just like the end which is an open end .Clearly answers are not given and I like these kind of movies because they make you search for the answers and think how your life would be in 1914 . Would you have been able to live in an environment like that ? For Baron's wife, I don't think so and I believe that Hanecke gave so much freedom of her . Don't be free thinker Hanecke ,women didn't act like that especially the wives of rich people. The shot in black and white is very good idea because Michael wants to transport you in a cruel society of 1914.<br/><br/>Anyway very good movie"
"sharky_55","8","0","2","4 February 2016"," Das weiße Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte
","In The White Ribbon, Haneke's mastery of building a quiet, unassuming dread is evident. It starts almost cartoonish, as an elderly school teacher recounts the events of the fabled village that have faded into legend and obscurity. He narrates via voice-over as the doctor's horse is suddenly tripped and he is flung from its seat. Who could have put it there? Little things begin happening that plunge us deeper and deeper into the mystery. Birds are found impaled with scissors. Children are found strung up and beaten. A disabled boy has his eyes gouged out. The villagers look at each other, and then avert their eyes because it could be any of them. In the midst of the crowd is the school teacher, who attempts to get to the bottom of the incidents while also wooing the young Eva. <br/><br/>It is not entirely a whodunit. Haneke prefers not to give straight answers, and the voice-over admits that these events are not as crystal clear as he once experienced them. Perhaps he is the film's straightest character, and this slightly smoothens its edge. In one instance, in the period of their one year engagement, he plans a lake-side picnic for Eva and him, but within the context of the village's violence incidents, she does not feel safe about being all alone with him. His response to this establishes the moral pillar of the film from where everything else is judged, and he is the one to make the final accusation. This subplot does not entirely fit within the rest of the events; their quiet, giggling conversations and simple romance is so removed from the rest of the simmering tension. Haneke, I think, seeks to invite viewers to align themselves with this bespectacled every-man, and then harshly shakes his head at this decision. <br/><br/>But even without the connotations of the rise of fascism and terrorism as Haneke has been so outspoken on (see how the narrator resolves to dig for the roots of national socialism, not fascism, and how he is suggested to have survived World War 2 - and then link the ages of the children to the date), it is a tremendously disturbing film, yet plausible. Haneke at first distances us from these events via these still long shots that do not outright display the atrocities that are being committed, but rather hint at them, as the muffled sounds of a beating emerge from behind a closed door. And then it becomes more evident, but revealed with great terror. Kurti peers behind a closed door to see his father and sister against each other, and subtly she slides down her dress while spinning a alternate explanation. When the steward's little boy presents a stolen bird to compensate for the one impaled, he is beaten senseless for being too young to understand the implications of his crime. The last shot gradually cuts away to a distance until the village is framed by the black bars of the gate, but Haneke does not ever leave these confines. He suggests that in such a closed environment it becomes so easy to stir up these hypocrisies and cycles of repression until we get...something beyond morally compromising. <br/><br/>Haneke does attempt to draw comparisons between the terror that is political versus that of a religious nature. There are murmurs of a mother's death in the sawmills, and how the baron is dismissive of this, and how the villagers retaliate namelessly. And then there is the hypocrisy of the pastor, who preaches an absolute love and behind closed doors, practices an absolute discipline of faith that is theorised to be the root cause of these incidents. But it is also suggested that they share the same root problem, a human tendency to mutate into absolutism and authoritarianism without any opposition. How else will children learn if not from their parental figures? In this little village, there is no other answer."

","I enjoyed The White Ribbon because I wasn't spoon fed the answers to the crimes committed in the small village. By the end of film, I assumed the children were pure evil. Also I like the children because they reminded me of the kids from the Children of the Corn.<br/><br/>The movie is a told from the perspective of the school teacher. So everything seen is questionable. Why don't the adults have names? Did the kids use a trip wire to hurt the doctor? Did they beat the mid-wife's mentally disabled son?Everything is open to your interpretation.<br/><br/>The black and white film lets the actors shine through. The focus is on the actors and not the beautiful scenery.<br/><br/>One of my favorite moments is the awkward encounter between the school teacher and Eva. The scene breaks up the tension of the film with humor. Leonie Benesch, the actor who played Eva, was great. The range of emotions she displayed throughout the film was amazing. The first time the teacher meets Eva, she is bashful. When Eva was fired by the baroness, her face and posture conveys sadness. Happiness is displayed when she dances with the teacher. I wish she had more screen time."

In the village are a harsh Protestant minister, a schoolteacher, a doctor, and other figures of fierce authority, plus quite a group of children who have lived in oppressive conditions. We are mad privy to the humorless village where no one smiles and where common people live in fear of the future. Religion is presented as a venomous and ugly thing. The minister's children are routinely beaten and humiliated for their ""sins"" including an awful diatribe on the results of masturbation (sores, mental illness, and death).

","""The White Ribbon"" is a German film from over 5 years ago that almost runs 2.5 hours. The writer and director is Michael Haneke, a filmmaker who has been in the industry for many decades now and who made many acclaimed films that rarely received awards recognition in the United States. This one here makes a difference. ""Das weiße Band"" is set shortly before the beginning of World War I in a German village and shows us how a couple of strange occurrences happen and nobody knows who is behind these. This film is pretty much a perfect example of a truly atmospheric movie. It is extremely bleak from start to finish, which is also helped by the fact that it was made in black-and-white. If you know Haneke a bit, you will know that he always goes for realism in his films, even if it is a violent, ugly reality he depicts and, especially with the ending, there is no feel-good factor involved.<br/><br/>The main character here is a school teacher, who slowly gets closer to the truth about who is committing all the heinous crimes and may have found the solution in the end. Still, there is no closure. The last words are about how he moves away from the village and works in another profession as a tailor. Even if it is not a main factor here, I think one of the most interesting aspects about the film is the historic context. The children in this movie are roughly 20 years older when Hitler comes to power and you may wonder how their strict upbringing and education may have formed them into being the perfect target group for the Fuehrer's goals. But you could also wonder how the sufferings from World War I contributed to that. Anyway, even if it came short at the Oscars to the Argentinean entry, it won many awards, at Cannes for example, but also at the German Film Awards where Burghart Klaußner was for example awarded for his great performances as the village's pastor. And Haneke got a couple wins for himself as well. His works have really grown on me in the last couple years and you can see a common denominator of sociopath young people in his movies. Certainly very interesting and while ""Benny's Video"" and ""Funny Games"" play more in today's times, this one goes way back. ""The White Ribbon"" is one of my favorite German movies of all time and I highly recommend it."

","Directed by Michael Haneke (Funny Games (both versions), Hidden (Caché), Amour), this German/Italian/Polish film was listed in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book, it was rated well by critics, and I was hoping it would be worthy of recommendations. Basically in 1913, fifteen years before the breakout of the First World War, in the small Protestant village of Eichwald, Germany, a series of mysterious and unfortunate incidents are taking place. These occurrences include rider is thrown from their horse after it tripped on a wire, rotted planks cause a woman to fall to her death, the son of The Baron (Ulrich Tukur) is hung upside down in a mill, parents of village children are slapping and bullying their own offspring, a man is being cruel to his long-suffering lover, another man sexually abuses his own daughter, and many people disappearing. The School Teacher (Christian Friedel), who is immature and inexperienced, and is courting a nanny of the Baron's household, is narrating the story as an Old Man (Ernst Jacobi) and investigating the cause and connection of these accidents and crimes. There are pubescent children in the village with guilty consciences, The Pastor (Burghart Klaußner), he tries to reassure them, and gets them to wear a white ribbon, as a sign of the innocence and purity, but these children may in fact be the cause and at the heart of these strange circumstances, and it can only end badly for many characters. Also starring Leonie Benesch as Eva, Ursina Lardi as Marie-Louise, The Baroness, Fion Mutert as Sigi, Michael Kranz as The Tutor, Steffi Kühnert as Anna, The Pastor's Wife and Maria-Victoria Dragus as Klara. With having to read subtitles as well I did get very confused with this film, I did see the strange things happening and characters getting suspicious and paranoid, but I'm not sure I can fully agree with critics giving the film four stars out of five, or it being in the 1001 Movies book, however, it is not a bad film, it was interesting in parts, so overall it's an alright period mystery drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film Not in the English Language, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Worth watching, in my opinion!"

The doctor is hospitalized after his horse trips on the wire in his regular ride. Then a tenant farmer woman falls to her death in an industrial accident. The village is a strict harsh place. The puritanical pastor punishes his children with a cane and ties white ribbons on his children as a reminder of their need to keep their purity. The strange incidents continue. The movie ends with the start of the first World War.<br/><br/>I would have liked the movie follows one single lead as he/she experiences and investigates these strange incidences. The black and white photography is beautiful. The cold everyday violence is interesting. The movie portrays a very effective hard oppressive mood. However it is a lot of mood but very little drive.

","The film starts off with a long title sequence.<br/><br/>A series of strange events are befalling a small town in eastern Germany in the months before the onset of WW1. A wire is strung across the road throwing the doctor from his horse. A window is opened to the cold jeopardizing the health of a baby. The son of the baron is abducted and whipped. A local handicapped child is kidnapped and beaten. These events are mixed in with typical small town happenings and politics, so that it remains who the culprit is. It appears, according to the local teacher, that the children of the local pastor are responsible for the acts, but they go unpunished. <br/><br/>I've never thought of what the childhood of Nazi war criminals was like, but considering serial killers often have childhoods torturing animals and other deviant acts, it would go to reason that this was the case for Eichmann and Goering. That's probably the obvious interpretation. The Protestant discipline was not confined the the Puritans who gave us witch burnings and, arguably, the Bill Clinton scandal. <br/><br/>I felt like I was watching a ""Little House on the Prairie"" meets ""Children of the Corn"". It's very haunting and aggravating to see how cruel humans can be, unfortunately too disgusting. These pointless acts of aggression and torture are often repeated. Aptly, it is having large families that helps to create these bonds. Children were viewed as future workers and an investment in the future. Even the hint at incest between the doctor and his daughter, as well a small town suspicion of outsiders (present in the initial interrogation) help to solidify a statement that cruelty is a normal, albeit unwelcome, aspect of life. <br/><br/>In other words, this is likely just a typical small town experiencing the vagaries of life. It's a form all but gone in much of the world, even perhaps China at this point. <br/><br/>I did enjoy the love story between the teacher and the nanny. I also thought all the children did a good job of being sincere. It probably helped that most of their lines were ""No, sir"" and ""Yes, sir"". I liked the interplay between the workers and the baron. The workers seemed to be able to voice their opinions, though they remained largely ignored. <br/><br/>This film really deserves a more in depth analysis as it is about 2.5 hours long, but anyone who's willing to sit down and explore the mind of a small village capable of sending men to the slaughters of WW1 would get something out of it."

","The time period of our lives when we are the most susceptible and the most vulnerable to lessons of morality, differences between good and evil, death and life is childhood. But, the society norms say that childhood should be protected from all these thoughts. The White Ribbon challenges these norms and says the right time to discuss these things openly is from a very tender age. Hence we see a detailed discussion about death between a 13 year old girl and a 6 year old boy, where the girl says 'I am going to die, even you are going to die someday'. The level of maturity shown is very commendable.<br/><br/>The movie basically is about a pre-world war small town in Germany governed by a baron, pastor and a doctor who are powerful people holding moral and religious high grounds in the village. Some oddly weird things start happening which change the dynamics of the village and are felt mostly through the eyes of the village children. Narrated by the village school-teacher, the movie encompasses the life of several village families and more importantly the family children.<br/><br/>The director has used black and white as a medium to tell the story and it is extremely effective. Another unique quality of the director is his non-dwelling in scenes. He doesn't want the audience to linger in a particular scene for too long. Thus, sequences happen thick and fast and sometimes, you may loose track of what was happening (Thank god for the rewind button). Nevertheless the movie rakes the issue of violence and it's effect on children and the issues of morality and how they should be handled pretty effectively.<br/><br/>Rating : 8/10"

","The White Ribbon had been on my wish list for a long time, since it won the 2010 Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film. I had thought Haneke's films were mostly intense and violent, not at all a mainstream. But winning the Golden Globe Award gave me a feeling that this film should not be too difficult to watch. And it is really so, though the film is still intense and somewhat violent anyway.<br/><br/>The White Ribbon depicts society in a German village before the outbreak of World War I, where a series of mysterious violent events happened. The village was still under feudal system and religion had strong influence. The higher class used their authority over the lower, not just in the society but also in their families. The lower had no right to argue. Could the mysterious violence be a result of the pressure on them? <br/><br/>The White Ribbon is not as sadistic as Haneke's latter film 'Amour', and thus easier to watch. Perhaps also because it doesn't use lot of long still shots like Amour, and it's in a narrative story-telling style, so the audience do not feel so involved and so tortured. Both films are great, but in my taste I prefer Amour a bit more."

To his believe the children in the village are the generation of Germans who became Nazis. The movie runs in flashback where former teacher tells about different series of incidents take place in the village of Eichwald. These incidents starts with A horse trips on a wire and throws the rider; a woman falls to her death through rotted planks; the local baron's son is beaten and hung upside down in a mill; parents slap and bully their children; a man is cruel to his long-suffering lover and sexually abuses his daughter. People disappear. The teacher, who courts a nanny in the baron's household, narrates the story and tries to investigate the connections among these accidents and crimes. What is foreshadowed? Are the children holy innocents? God may be in His heaven, but all is not right with the world; the center cannot hold. (IMDB) It won't be wrong to say that The White Ribbons is one of the creepiest movies of all times. This Black&White venture didn't rely on screams, graphics, blood or torture to create creepiest. The creepiest relies in the people and children living in the village. They are obscure and living duel lives in front of public and behind doors. There are many moments in the movie which will literally put audience in shock and disbelieve. Some of the most bizarre scenes have to confrontation about masturbation between Pastor and his young boy who is entering into adolescence. Later for vindictive divinity, every night as punishment he ties his eldest son's hands to prevent even the possibility of nocturnal masturbation. Then there is a widowed doctor who engages in unthinkable practices with his 14-year-old daughter. Besides that the beating the Baron's young kid and torture upon midwife's special child makes you squirm. Michael Haneke has directed a beautiful movie about complex subject matter. As one critic rightly said ""Everything in The White Ribbon is true. And that is why it is so difficult to bear"". All the children are truly the star of the movie. I have to mention these names who were absolutely incredible Christian Friedel as the school teacher , Leonie Benesch as Eva, nanny to the baron and baroness's twin babies , Ulrich Tukur as the baron, Ursina Lardi as the baroness, Marie-Louise Fion Mutert as Sigmund, their oldest son , Burghart Klaußner as the pastor, Steffi Kühnert as Anna, the pastor's wife, Maria-Victoria Dragus as Klara, their oldest daughter, Leonard Proxauf as Martin, their oldest son, Roxane Duran as Anna, the doctor's daughter , Susanne Lothar as the midwife . The ending of the movie is ambiguous as the teacher himself doesn't know what happened to some of the people or who is behind the torturous events. But if you read between the lines and watch carefully you'll understand who can actually do that and Why? An Absolute Remarkable piece of Art, movies like A Separation and The White Ribbon makes me love foreign cinema."

The answer is never given, but hints of dark forces rising because of the nature of the society that the villagers are living in are given full rein. This leads to a growing sense of unease on screen and off screen amongst the audience.<br/><br/>I do feel it is about the fin de siecle of pre war comfort (but how comfortable was it really in an almost feudal society that tolerates child abuse and sexual exploitation?) leading to Prussian aggressive adventurism, so to the First World War, and, then more chillingly, the children who are to become the generation of Nazism with all its attendant horrors.<br/><br/>There are signposts to the Doctor with the bad shoulder (Kaiser Wilhelm) and the Baron, whose wife cannot tolerate him or his lifestyle (Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and his wife Elizabeth), which show the absolutism of empire and sleepwalking to war, but these seem minor compared to the horror of the following generations' actions which are caused by the repression et al of a society created by the older generation. The key moment is when the quotation from the Bible about sin of the fathers following down to the third or fourth generations is shown near the end - this is the central theme to the film.<br/><br/>But there is too much arch film making in a sort of fifties/sixties art house Bergfman/Antonioni homage to really leave you satisfied that you have watched a great piece of cinema.

This film shows the hypocrisy of the German adults who punish their children for trivial mistakes but find no faults in abusing women and children, including incestuous relationships.<br/><br/>The director showed the courage of having such characters like pastor who ties his adolescent son's hands to the bed because he knew his son had masturbated. A lot of disgraceful events happen at the village, but nobody is bothered about it. The parents look more of pedagogues, who attempts to instill hatred into their children instead of love. One more thing I've seen in this movie is that pure love is detested while hatred is embraced.<br/><br/>The kids who are punished for almost nothing, in future will do the same to their young generations. The story was set before the world war 1. So, it was clear that it were the parents and the German elders who were responsible for sowing the seeds of Fascism in the kids. While I was watching the film, I was confused whether the kids were orphans and they were living in the some church orphanage. This is because the kinds of conversation the children have with their parents. This film clearly indicates their is absence of love between the kids and their parents.<br/><br/>These kids never received any love so they will do the same to the upcoming generations. They will be ruthless, racist and disrespectful towards women. The director has done a very good job of showing how & why Fascism once surfaced in Germany. This movie is very good in conveying a good message, that Fascism never worked and can never work. This movie is not about who did all those terrible things in the village, rather it was an attempt by the director to show why all that happened. <br/><br/>This movie is very good and intelligent but not for everyone. Some people may find it boring and dull. This movie is more educational than being entertaining. So people seeking sheer entertainment may find it boring. But this flick slowly progresses to show gruesome nature of Fascism. I can say one downside of this flick is the length and monotony.

To be more provocative, it explores the dark side of children: that children can be, like adults are, violent, provided the 'right' environment. Others than LHP, where goodies and baddies are distinct, this film shows that things or people are not white or black (ironically, the film is shoot in black and white :-) ).<br/><br/>The film tells a children tale, but certainly not like the old fashioned one. The setting takes place in a German village; beautiful like you might expect from a postcard. But underneath this what might seem a harmonious, beautiful village, there is violence, jealousy, abuse, and revenge. And yes, it seems that children are actively involved in this. <br/><br/>These incidents involves beatings other children, making a trap for the doctor village to fall and seriously wounded. You are caught in a thriller with children as suspects, but there is no resolution: the film do not give away who done it. It only give clues and the audience can make his or her own conclusion. This kind of subtlety is also seen in many scenes and is a strong point of this film.<br/><br/>The story shows a religious , feudal village community, where powers are shared by few: baron, pastor, doctor. And the weak are suppressed: children women, and the poor. The violence is implicitly shown as a 'revenge' of the weak. And to think that children are the guilty ones makes this film provocative. <br/><br/>In spite of its darkness, there are some sweet and heartbreaking scenes: the love story of the narrator with the nanny and the young child of the pastor. The child offers his bird to his father as a replacement of his father's bird which is killed cruelly by his daughter. This is an act of revenge after she got punishment from his father and being humiliated. The bird, to which the father gave affection, was an object of her revenge, because she lacks exactly this affection from her father. The affection of the young child to his father make the father, who is usually controlled, touched. This scene shows that good souls exist, too. <br/><br/>From the cinematography point of view, the director made some brilliant choices. The story is told from an old man point of view on the strange incidents that happens long ago when he was a young teacher in a village in northern Germany. This form gives a fairy tale, old fashion feelings.<br/><br/>The choice to film in black and white produces some of most beautiful scenes. One is when the body of a wife of a farmer is cleaned in a room. The whole scene is shoot from one point only, and not all are shown. In spite of the subtlety, I feel the intense sadness of the farmer mourning, even I do not see his face, only his back, moving back and forth, crying. This scene looks like a painting from van Gogh in his early years. And there are more scenes like this.<br/><br/>The director points an intrigue theory that this film shows an origin of violence. Film the white ribbon is a story of the origin of evil: how children, suppressed by ideological idea, internalize the suppression by exercising violence on the weak. It was set in Germany, preceding the 1st ww, and it hints the origin of fascism that later on took on. However, it applies to all regions in the world where the young people are willing to sacrifice their life for an ideology. <br/><br/>Indeed the children in the film would grow up in Nazi Germany. Although you can be skeptical about this far reaching conclusions (because violence, I think, is universal, every where, in any cultural setting possible) I do believe that violence has more chance in a suppressed society, like the one shown in the film.<br/><br/>This film  is a master piece."

","According to the director the film is about the danger of elevating ideals of any sort into absolutes, which leads to terrorism. Cautioning the viewer to not simply equate the film with fascism because it is German, but to understand it more universally. <br/><br/>I am not certain if I grasp the film in the way the director apparently intended though. My original reaction was looking at the flaws under the surface of an ordinary village. The film then ends its story without closure, by plan, which left me a little empty at the end. <br/><br/>i thoroughly enjoyed the film. It was wonderfully acted, directed, with great photography, and art direction. There was nothing to dislike about the film. The European Protestant pastor/priest being an overbearing, dominating, relentless task master is becoming stereotypical but it so well done here (the pastor is given humanity. He loves his children, watching his facial expressions as one of his youngest displays sacrificial love to him, is touching. One wonders if the pastor has ever experienced such an act of kindness). <br/><br/>The White Ribbon will be a movie I'll keep thinking about. Highly recommended."

","It's an ordinary village in northern Germany in the year preceding the outbreak of World War I -- or so it seems -- until strange things begin happening. They're not supernatural in any way. A doctor's horse in deliberately tripped, severely injuring the rider. A woman falls through a rotting floor and is killed. A retarded child is tied to a tree and thoroughly beaten. People seem to be hiding things. People disappear.<br/><br/>But, unnerving as these events are, they seem to fit the frame of values in the village. We usually think of ""the doctor"" as the sensible person. ""The Reverend"", as a stock figure, is almost always for humanitarianism and forgiveness.<br/><br/>In this film, like everyone else, the ""good"" figures are possessed by destructive habits. The Pastor is taciturn and humorless and beats hell out of his many children for the slightest infraction, like being late for dinner. He forces one of his boys to admit to masturbation and chastises him. The doctor, victim of that horse fall, seems to be equally pitiless. He shows no sympathy, is schtupping the Midwife who is caring for his children, may have murdered his own wife, and is playing sex games with his own daughter.<br/><br/>There are two people -- neither of them a barrel of laughs -- who are less than repulsive. The Baron and his wife live in the Big House and hire the villagers are harvest time. The Baron is overbearing, but the wife, although not allowed to say much, wants to get out of the village because of the ""malice"" that is all around it. And the school teacher is a nice guy who is in love with the young Nanny in the Baron's employ. He comes to suspect the brutality is the result of a secret society among the children of the village, led by the Preacher's kids.<br/><br/>Before his hypothesis can be developed, before anything is resolved, war breaks out. Everyone left in the village crowds into the church. No one says anything. Fade to black. The End.<br/><br/>I don't know exactly what to make of it. It's a long, slow, black-and-white movie about a village gone sour. I've been trying to figure out how the war fits into it but I can't do it. The war seems adventitious. But it must be somehow connected to the transgressive events of the village otherwise why is it lurking there in the background? Maybe rotten people with bad habits cause war in some stochastic way? That doesn't work, because not only do the villagers have no politics or even any local allegiance, but Germany was sucked into the First World War just like all the other nations, as a result of a clumsy and sentimental arrangement of treaties and ethnic pride. Was the war a way of clearing up these bad habits, of getting rid of those strict rules and harsh punishments? Like hell. It led to a twenty-year truce, after which things got far worse than they had been.<br/><br/>It's a movie that gives us no one to root for -- except the teacher, an earnest and sober Schlub, who is narrating the tale in his old age. It's episodic too and sometimes a little hard to follow, never mind piecing it all together. But I was caught up in it after the first exhibition of pitiless punishment. I'm tempted to say it didn't turn out the way I expected, but it would be more accurate to say that I don't know HOW it turned out."

","Spoilers? Absolutely. Maybe even an explanation.<br/><br/>This (long, sorry) review is for people who have already seen The White Ribbon. If you haven't, you should. It's superb.<br/><br/>The pivotal scene in The White Ribbon is when the schoolteacher, the film's narrator, tentatively voices to the priest his suspicion that the priest's own children may be responsible for the series of horrific, random acts of violence that drive the story and provide its mystery. In a clever reflection of when the priest forces his son to confess to masturbating, the priest turns the tables and lets the schoolteacher know exactly where he stands in the social order. From that point, the schoolteacher is no longer in control of the story and the mystery must remain a mystery. The priest can live with mysteries; the schoolteacher and the audience find it less easy.<br/><br/>From the beginning, Haneke tells us that the story is the imperfect recollection of the schoolteacher, so no-one should expect resolution in the Hercule Poirot way. It's a subjective account by an unseen old man, not some sort of contrived detective story (though for my grey cells it was the midwife all along).<br/><br/>The first thing I wondered when the film ended was 'what happened to the doctor and his children?' - when he shut up shop and disappeared with no explanation. Of course, the doctor must have realised that now that the Down's syndrome child he probably fathered by the midwife was dead, he had no reason to remain, especially now that the woman herself was quite likely unhinged. This sense of obligations paid is reflected in the Baroness's earlier split-up scene with the Baron.<br/><br/>The second thought that occurred to me was that the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand was as much an inexplicable act of violence as any of the events in the village - it's just that the consequences would be global. Many of these people would be sent to war, like the cabbages being laid to waste by Death with his scythe. In the scene in church where the Baron calls on the whole village to watch out for and denounce the perpetrator of the latest atrocity, he might as well be calling on all Germany to avenge the death of the Archduke.<br/><br/>So the white ribbon (such as the priest wears round his neck) is a symbol and reminder of innocence; what happens in the film is that everyone loses their innocence, and no amount of repression, control or self-delusion can prevent that loss. Just as the little boy learns that 'everyone dies - and your mother didn't go on a trip', everyone in the village learns that the social order is a illusion, and neither the church nor the aristocracy is going to be there to hold their hands or provide a satisfactory explanation when they need it, and all the police can do is bully little girls. In time, the state will harness your self-hate and send you to kill people; in this sense The White Ribbon is like a prequel to All Quiet on the Western Front.<br/><br/>The acting, photography, costumes, sets and direction of The White Ribbon are up there with the best, and the use of black and white is absolutely right; it's like putting your eye to a magic box which transports you back to 1913. Of course there are times when nothing seems to be going on, or scenes seem to be pointlessly long, but not for a moment do you lose the illusion that your are witnessing reality, and the sense of mystery is strong enough to keep you guessing. It's just that you'll still be guessing after the film has ended, though not in a frustrated way because Haneke gives you so much to look at and think about. If nothing else, The White Ribbon has the best set of child actors I've ever seen.<br/><br/>There is no suggestion in The White Ribbon itself that Haneke is trying to 'explain Nazism' or anything like that, but it did strike me that the schoolteacher and his innocent Eva (a stunning performance by Leonie Benesch) were prime candidates to become leading lights of the local party later on - Eva, after all, is so perfectly Aryan.<br/><br/>If Spielberg had directed this, we would have had a scene in colour at the end where the 130-year-old schoolteacher, or maybe his and Eva's war criminal son, bashed it into our heads that the mystery was never solved, and he was sorry for any offence Germany caused during the 20th century. Unnecessary; if TWR has a message, it's that your innocence is between you and your conscience, not the responsibility of church, employer, or state.<br/><br/>Plot points: 1) Who strung the wire that brought the doctor down? Whoever had access to a long piece of strong wire, such as a farm labourer. Was it because the doctor might have been Jewish, I wonder?<br/><br/>2) If the children blinded (the only true innocent) Karli, who wrote the Biblical note? The priest's eldest daughter might have done, but surely this was an another attack on the doctor with racial/religious overtones, or the midwife by herself in a Munchhausen way - but plenty more people in the village than just the characters we met were capable of doing this. <br/><br/>3) Who fired the barn? Who birched and strung up Sigi? Anyone with a grievance. We know who destroyed the cabbages, but anyone we see in the final scene might have been evil enough to have done any of those things, that's the point. And in a way, it's a Poirot solution - they all did it. My money's still on the midwife though - she even stole a bike."

","One of the great losses for the cinema was the death of Claude Sautet. This loss now is substituted by the outstanding presence of Michael Henecke. ""The White Ribbon"" is another remarkable masterpiece. Observing closely the cinematography we can see how Henecke invites us with his camera movements. If the scene requires attention, is as if Henecke is trying to say to us: ""Come with me! Look at this character's expression! That's it! Now watch closely! Can you see the character's eyes? Can you see the impassivity in the character's face?"" So the camera gently moves till it closes in the character's expression. I am not going to quote all the scenes in which these occurs... All the others, I'll leave it to the expectators perspicacity... The one I am going to quote: The scene in which ""the minister"" gives communion to the congregation that in the case are his own children. As far as the story is a parable to the pre World War I society, with all its idiosyncrasies... Side by side with the disciplines, strict moral standarts, the debacle, the lies, the traison. This is one of the movies that must be watched, re-watched, and kept ""with fondness"" to be appreciated in those reflection moments, after we have been bombarded by the news journals (most of the times things that we would not like in absolute that they existed).

","This reminds me of Jorge Luis Borges' ability to misdirect his audience with facts, histories, that simply aren't true. I've read an adequate sample of the reviews and I find that many if not all draw conclusions (call them ""suspicions"") about the film using the backdrop of real history - the audience is necessary to conclude this film.<br/><br/>I don't think there is any lesson or allegory in this story whatsoever. The entire story and all that it insinuates about the future serves the art and philosophy of film, not history. The reason for my opinion is the Narrator. I don't want to pepper this review with spoilers, so I will just describe what the narrator is: an omniscient, omni-prescient that provides an early caveat that his memory is dim. The audience is NOT transported to some view outside of the narrator's own recollection or design. No scene plays out without breadcrumbs from the narrative. The ""evil"" in this story is the ambiguity of its source, the narrator. Worse, the narrator's ""dim"" memory may just be his way of NOT saying that he himself is the nemesis.<br/><br/>I find it especially wry that one of the last scenes discusses how the towns-people, the rumor-mongers, fall into fevered conjecture about the events that transpired, not unlike the reviewers of this film. This gives the film a palpable sense of Borges and my conviction that we have all been duped by Haneke. Haneke's own words: ""Every argument is powerless against feelings. But every interpretation is also correct, because it occurs in the mind of the recipient -- in your mind, in this case. In that sense, you have contributed to the film -- hopefully."" Everyone seems to project history on this story. Keep in mind that this film is even more fictional than, say, ""The Titanic"". At least the The Titanic was based on a real event in history. The White Ribbon is based on a completely fictional village. Even so... we all knew what was going to happen to the ship, but we didn't know what was going to happen to the village - not to worry; there's an archetype, Nazism, to ride like a hobby horse.<br/><br/>The Narrator is speaking to the audience. Whenever he fails in providing a fact it is not because he doesn't remember, but it doesn't suit the construction of the fable. The narrator is outside of the fable alongside each of us.<br/><br/>Who committed all these acts? Who withholds the answers? Who is telling the story? The nemesis.<br/><br/>Any allegory in the fable is complete misdirection; what matters is the psychology of projecting it on each viewer; every ambiguity, every unsolved (undisclosed) puzzle, propelling every individual to make sweeping statements, grasping. I know that I am correct... after all, Haneke says I am. Quotation taken from Der Spiegel interview."

","This is a movie that you need to let sink in for a while after you finish watching. At first the movie might feel like a bit of a redundant one, since it doesn't really tie things up by the end and it's a quite slow and long sit, though the movie in fact is just over 2 hours, end credits not included. However the more you start thinking about this movie afterward, the more you start to appreciate it and also start to see- and better understand the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>The movie can be seen as director and writer Michael Haneke's views on the origins or fascism, at the start of the 20th century, in Germany. Not saying that the small town depicted in this movie is supposed to be the source of all evil but what the movie does is slowly but above all things subtly showing how years of abuse and oppression can lead to dangerous thoughts and actions. I can't really say how realistic this all is, since honestly it seemed all a bit far fetched to me but then again, I'm not an expert of German history and was clearly also not around at the time. It's supposedly based on true events all, so there at least must be some truth behind it all.<br/><br/>But if you believe there be some truth in the story or not doesn't matter that much, since while watching this movie you'll still remain fascinated by it all and get sucked in by the movie its slow story-telling. What I really like about the story but especially its storytelling was that it never really wrapped up things or clarified just everything. It's a movie that probably leaves more questions than answers, which forces you to think about things and fill in all of the blanks for yourself. It makes ""Das weiße Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte"" a very thought provoking movie.<br/><br/>It's not the sort of movie you see an awful lot of now days. It's the sort of movie that reminds you of Ingmar Bergman's work and neorealistic movies from Italy, from the '40's and '50's. Movies that are like a random slice of life, with featuring everyday persons in it, doing everyday things, facing everyday's struggles and problems in life. Those movies are also often set in small towns or communities, just like this movie. I'm glad there are still persons doing movies like this and it makes me even happier that they are being appreciated and successful as well. This movie even received an Oscar nomination for best foreign picture of the year, as well as one for its cinematography.<br/><br/>And it's not hard to see really why Christian Berger's camera-work for this movie is so much praised. I have to say, I don't think I have ever seen a more beautiful shot modern black & white movie, at least not in recent years. Hard to say what it is but the black & white makes this movie so much more clear than color could had ever achieved.

","The story of The White Ribbon is narrated by The School Teacher (Ernst Jacobi) of the village many years after the events took place. He states in the opening moments of the film, that much of the story is based on hearsay and speculation. He even concludes; ""a lot of it remains obscure to me even today."" Set in a small Protestant village to the north of Germany, in the year building up to the First World War, a series of mysterious events, accidents, and seeming torture, occur that begin with the local doctor (Rainer Bock) being throw off the back of a horse in suspicious circumstances. The occurrences escalate through the village, bringing with it accusations, and divide, in an already hierarchically structured ""society"".<br/><br/>The tension builds throughout this masterfully structured narrative, with confidence of pace, and some beautifully composed black and white cinematography, by long time Haneke collaborator, Christian Berger. Haneke is a film maker at the top of his game. The intricate relationships throughout the village, the power struggles, and authoritarian menace, is perfectly acted by a strong cast.<br/><br/>It's no crime to reveal that nothing is resolved in the film. But, like in life, other more terrible events happen outside of the surroundings you dwell in, beyond your usual environment (the people for example), that evaporate the issue from memory. And, like history, we can read this as a fable about authoritarianism, and it's effects on the people around it. As allegory of war, it shows the utter contempt for humanity is lost in those who have been victim to this dictatorial rein of fear. In this village, we are only exposed to the corporal punishment that is dealt on a daily basis, to the children of the village.

There are deliberate ""accidents"", beatings, acts of revenge, abuse and cruelty. It is interspersed with unexpected romance and humor ( I thought the Doctor and the midwife were hilarious during their breakup).<br/><br/>Such an unusual matter of fact tale - horrible things happen but it isn't a horror movie. It's so great to see a horror without fright tactics. It's not chilling but more enlightening. Occasionally it's like a Continental high brow soap drama.

The cycle of cruelty is what is clear though - parents or children its for the viewer to decide who is worse.<br/><br/>It purposely doesn't have a conclusive ending leaving many questions unanswered.

","As I watched this film all I could think of was the psychological unrest that historically lead to the Third Reich in Germany. I can't believe there was another intention to the making of this sinister, clever, intelligent and harrowing cinematic experience. The movie is set in the 1916/1917 period (Second World War), when a series of murderous acts take place in a small German village, presumably perpetrated by children that by 1935 would be commanding Nazi battalions throughout Europe. This is what I was thinking during a movie that is shot in sublime black and white, that utilizes cinematic tension intelligently (it's slow for a reason), is well written (especially the voice-over narration) and is acted so superbly that you wonder why German cinema isn't more popular these days. I must say that I was completely blown away. In the end, Haneke always leaves certain unfinished business. In his movie Caché, I lost track of the mystery that he spent so much time elaborating and then ended up with a million unanswered questions here too, I secretly wish I knew how everything fits in in the end but this point may very well be a part of the effectiveness and overall quality of a somewhat ground-breaking movie, that says a lot about a people's descent into cruelty and into letting cruelty go unattended I find that is the overall premise of this mystery that remains a mystery this is a matter ""left unattended"", the story of these children is left as a hanging, foreboding mystery, and the sickness of their behaviour, as well as the behaviour of their families, a planted seed whose cure was never tracked or found (the already dubious doctor symbolically vanishes - which is moreover THE event that most confuses and remains unanswered), and it all seems a premonition of the even more harrowing and unexplainable reality to come. A great social commentary about the ""cruel white ribbon"", an intense movie that keeps you interested throughout, beautiful shots, the children are magnificent, every scene tells a well-crafted story within itself with the added balance of a good-hearted narrator in his old age that is as confused as he is distraught about the events he's witnessed."

","I haven't seen a more disturbing film in recent memory except perhaps ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"". Unfortunately, the film begs for, but does not achieve a resolution to the chain of horrors perpetrated by and on the citizens of Eichwald, Germany in the years prior to the outbreak of World War I. Told through the eyes of narrator Christian Friedel portraying the school teacher, the picture offers brief glimpses of the upright citizens of this small village, the Pastor, the Doctor, the Baron, the Steward, all outwardly stalwart men and models of behavior. However underneath, they harbor their own inner demons that find expression in such horrors as physical and verbal abuse, pedophilia, and corruption. What is even more disturbing is that their behaviors present a role model for their children, who turn their attention inward and are allowed no outlet for their own self expression. This is revealed early in the picture by the young Martin (Leonard Prohauf), son of the Pastor who traverses a railing atop a high bridge, to the chagrin of the Teacher. While courting death, the youngster seems to be inviting punishment for his own sins and failures as he reasons that God had a chance to kill him but declined for some other unknown purpose.<br/><br/>What's so agonizing about the picture is that the children may have learned all too well from their parents' behavior. The Pastor's daughter Klara, taking a pair of scissors to the parakeet was truly chilling. The off screen abuse of the Baron's son Sigi, and Mrs. Wagner's retarded son Karli, present untenable question marks in this drama, demanding a justice that is not forthcoming, and leading to more questions than answers. Just as you think you can qualify a reasonable guess as to who might be responsible for the trauma in the village, seemingly unrelated events occur to cloud your focus and divert attention. That is perhaps the picture's stunning achievement and corresponding failure at the same time.<br/><br/>To be sure, this is not an easy film to watch, and certainly not one to be enjoyed. Though I'm unfamiliar with the works of director Haneke, this film sets me on still another path to explore with the brooding approach he brings to to film making. I haltingly reserve further judgment until then."
"cmb_84","8","0","3","7 February 2011"," Haunting Echoes of Fascism
","The White Ribbon represents the latest addition to Haneke's increasingly formidable catalogue. It tells the story of a North-German village on the chronological cusp of WW1, where a series of strange events begin to unravel and disturb its serene moral exterior. Somehow involved are the young children of the village, although whether they are victims, perpetrators (or both) is left to interpretation, and becomes one of the main focal points through the course of the picture.<br/><br/>As with many films from Haneke, succinct summaries are doomed to fall short; their elliptical psychology forbids it. Indeed, to impose a fixed narrative arc captures only a fraction of the experience; to describe it – for instance – as a purely moral examination misses the point also. Just as a musical composition can be said to be produced out of the precise spaces and absences of sound, so Haneke's films rely upon a similar principle. The visual experience draws upon the peculiar texture of the blank space, demanding an active spectator to interpret its patterns accordingly. Suffice to say, The White Ribbon is a film where narrative threads are rarely succinctly tied.<br/><br/>Its core theme points toward the children and their chronological relation to history, positioned as the nascent fascist generation who would later permit Hitler's rise to power. Their dramatic charge is a significant one, and as subject matter demands respectful treatment. If the yoke of German fascism is cemented in popular history at the Treaty of Versailles, where the country's symbolic dignity was signed away from itself, then The White Ribbon seems to be rejecting such a blanket reading. True fascism, according to the picture, is naturalized at childhood, and its formative processes are just as perverse and morally destructive as its outward manifestations at psychological maturity. The source of this toxic development is located primarily within the community's repressive modes of punishment, where we see a series of disciplinary measures that are distinctly archaic in their perversity: organized spankings take on an almost ritualistic form; children's hands are tied to their beds to prevent pre-sexual experimentation, and a white ribbon is used as a kind of cleansing ritual by attaching it to a child who has previously transgressed.<br/><br/>It is unclear whether Haneke has chosen this generation and its simulacra to make a revised claim against history, or whether it is simply a locus for him to probe certain philosophical windows. One suspects the former, although its commitment at times appears slightly inconsistent. What one would expect, for example, to be drawn as a tragic arc of innocence lost is undercut by over-naturalizing the children as not simply unfortunate victims of historical circumstance, but as somehow inherently wicked prior to their moral abjection. The textual parallel with Village of the Damned feels too consciously drawn, and its presence within the film detracts from the dramatic charge of its subject matter.<br/><br/>Worthy of note is the picture's haunting use of mise-en-scene, which manages to captivate the screen with silent authority. It is unusual for a film of Haneke to be so heavily invested in the raw seductiveness of the image in quite this way; his oeuvre has always gravitated toward the opposite function: to resist the viewer and their sense of passive oneness with the screen. The White Ribbon, in contrast, maintains the vibrancy of the image in full; resulting in a precise visual collage of golden black and white hues that eminently bleed from the screen, accentuating a pastoral vision of life that has since faded from contemporary view.<br/><br/>Such pictural elegance contrasts sharply with the film's dark subject matter in a way that is notably disjunctive. One senses that this is intentional, and meant to serve a symbolic function. Indeed, the seductive imagery mirrors precisely historical fascism's own aestheticized seduction, where the pastoral scene is evoked as part of a unifying myth of Aryan supremacy. In one shot, the hypnotic coherence of a field of harvesters perfectly synchronized in labour immaculately references Nazi propaganda both in message and aesthetic. Shot from certain angles, the village itself betrays the architectural impression of Auschwitz; its inhabitants a timeless spectre wandering aimlessly through history. In The White Ribbon, fascist echoes haunt the screen space as phantasmagorical premonitions.<br/><br/>In an interview Haneke suggests that the rigid moral structures of the community (and their strict enforcement) condition the children into a perverse hyper-censorious state – compelling them towards violent and tortuous acts in response to any perceived infraction to their internalized moral code. The ritual of the white ribbon as a disciplining mechanism must be read within similar lines; where its cleansing function in childhood takes on a pathological dimension in adult life; a destructive fixation on 'whiteness' as a symbolic pathway toward moral purity. It sits as a malignant kernel of nascent fascism which the film takes as its central metaphor.<br/><br/>It's a bold position, and not one that the film is quite able to sell convincingly. However, as a filmic exploration one need not follow its esoteric logics to appreciate the overall force of its cinematic experience. It is a majestically shot window into a previous world and its peculiar rituals of being, and can be enjoyed entirely on such a level. For those who wish to journey deeper into the caverns of symbolism and subtext and attempt to psychologically map the film as a codified portrait of the fascist unconscious, your appetite will be well gorged."

","excerpt, full review at my location.<br/><br/>Michael Haneke is a master of suspense - a director whose focus has lay solely on his power over his character and his audience. His past successes, of which there are many, have all probed a little deeper than the horror at their surface, and his name has been made not just by his signature direction but by his ambition also. The award-winning, Oscar- nominated White Ribbon showcases another string to his bow.<br/><br/>Eichwald is one of cinema's most haunting locales, and the events there carried out between July 1913 and August 1914 (in Haneke's world at least) are some of the most thought provoking and chilling cinematics of the director's illustrious career. The talent on display from both cast and crew make this film not just a must see but Haneke's greatest vision to date."
"dipesh-parmar","9","0","3","12 January 2011"," A Masterpiece
","White Ribbon, directed by Michael Haneke, is set in a rural Protestant community in a German village on the eve of World War I. The village is run by an aristocratic estate in which everyone knows their place in the social order, from the doctor, pastor, teacher, to the migrant labourers.<br/><br/>The film begins with the locals being terrorised by a series of anonymous criminal acts: a doctor is hurt whilst on his horse which was tripped by a wire; a woman dies in a sawmill; a barn is set ablaze. The film is shaped by the children's perspective, we learn through their harsh experiences that none is without guilt just as none is quite without innocence. Haneke offers mere suggestions as to why people turn to antisocial behaviour, whether it's sabotaging a crop of cabbages, or assaulting a disabled child. Shame is ever-present in this film, the 'white ribbon' of the title is a band tied by the pastor around the arms of naughty children, sometimes for the most innocent and harmless mistakes. Apart from the Baron's son and a handicapped boy, there is no room for the children to be themselves and be loved, every last detail of non-conformity is inspected and punished.<br/><br/>This film may have begun with criminality but the tone set by this film is of utter viciousness. This film is about the damage which affects us all, the loss of innocence, the slow, creeping brutality of man, and spiritual myopia. Haneke pays particular attention to the violence inflicted by the higher echelons of the community, especially the pastor and the physical and mental abuse by the doctor not only on his children but also towards his occasional mistress. In one particularly vicious scene, the verbal abuse handed out to her is particularly merciless.<br/><br/>The photography is truly breathtaking, with superb acting throughout by the large cast. The sadistic undertones in this film are typical of Haneke. He hasn't lost the ability to shock with some very unsettling moments, but it's his least aggressive film. We are even treated to a tender romance resulting in a sublimely innocent kiss. In a village devoid of any love and affection, this romance seems the only sign of any optimism.<br/><br/>We don't know what sparked the birth of fascism, we can only speculate. There are of course parallels today with the many forms of hate and extremism disguised as religion, not just in Islam. The village may have showed us how much has changed in a hundred years, but perhaps the point of this film is that little has changed, and that man has forgotten his parental responsibilities and committed only to control and greed."

","Very lyrical use of black and white film, beautifully framed shots, and a stillness that first strikes the viewer as the peacefulness of a village, before gradually transforming into an unspoken dread of things that cannot be acknowledged or escaped. Like another film I reviewed, ""The White Ribbon"" investigates the negative repercussions in authority figures demanding nothing less than perfection and harmony from isolated individuals in an isolated community. In this film, however, the theme was more fully fleshed out, and shown from various character angles. The horror I felt as a viewer did not come from the use of the supernatural or from movie tricks, but from the recognition that the disturbing elements of this community were realistic, and that they thrived off of the relentless demand for correct behavior."

","Michael Haneke's Palme d'Or winning The White Ribbon is one of the great foreign language films of 2009. Shot in color but was desaturated to black-and-white during post-production, the film is very much the quintessential art film – slowly-paced, beautifully-shot, and thought-provoking. It is an admirable effort by the much respected director of Funny Games (1997), The Piano Teacher (2001), and Cache (2005). Haneke's intense interest in exploring the human condition, especially of its evil nature, in many of his films highlights his bleak view of humanity. In The White Ribbon, it is no different.<br/><br/>Very much a mystery-drama, Haneke's film is set during the days before the start of WWI in a small, picturesque German village that appears ordinary at first glance but is actually sinister within. Narrated by an old schoolteacher whom we don't see (we only see his young self), the film recalls the strange incidents that took place in this village back when he was young and still teaching there. The entire film is a record of what happened, and in black-and-white, it looks like a historical record. Many mistake this as a true story. It is not, but it could pave the way for us to understand how fascism rose to be a tyrannical force in Europe in the late 1930s.<br/><br/>Haneke only presents a factual account of these strange incidents, which are mostly deliberate acts of torture and violence. He doesn't give clues as to who the culprit is. The genius of Haneke is that all his characters (even supporting ones) are developed in such a way that invites both trust and suspicion. Even though the villagers and the rich baron's family form a close-knit community, there seems to be a cloud of mutual distrust. Even the children are curiously distanced from their authoritative parents.<br/><br/>Christian Berger's cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, and when accompanied by spells of silence (the film has no music score) that are interwoven with dialogue and ambient sounds, it becomes at times mystifying. Haneke's masterful grasp of editing and camera placement produce some very eerie moments such as a sequence shot in the dark showing a toddler at home trying to find his sister in the middle of the night, a prelude to a psychologically disturbing event that reveals a darker face of one of the film's key characters.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are uniformly excellent, with special mention going to Leonie Benesch, who plays Eva, a shy and sweet village girl whom the schoolteacher falls in love with. Haneke's handling of the numerous child actors is also remarkable not only because some of them are made to undergo a quite grueling experience, but also of the serious subject matter of the film, which straddles into adult territory. In the mould of the traditional whodunit, The White Ribbon offers plenty of mystery and the requisite suspense (in the mood-building sense). However, as any Haneke film would attest, it leaves us with no sense of closure and forces the viewer to react intellectually.<br/><br/>In The White Ribbon, Haneke has collectively and succinctly addressed issues of racism, class struggle, authoritarianism, sexual abuse, infidelity, incest, and violence, providing a foreshadowing of the evil that would come two decades later. While there is far from any causal link between the events that happened in this quiet village to Hitler's rise to power in Europe, Haneke's disconcerting portrait of a community whose children are raised in an uncomforting environment of hate and discrimination provides us with an understanding of how the seed of evil can easily take root in the most innocent of beings.

","""The White Ribbon"" begins with a series of mysterious happenings in a small northern German village before World War I to provide insight on the broader history of Germany and the rise of fascism. The director (Michael Haneke) holds back just enough information to prevent viewers from jumping to conclusions, feeling resolved about the story, and moving on to something else. If you want answers, you have to connect the dots and read the signs. It isn't difficult, just look for the gang of little angelic-demonic faces marching around like the cast of ""Village of the Damned"". But the controversial part is trying to explain how they become how they are.<br/><br/>The actors were chosen for their likeness to historical black and white photographs, and the film is presented in black and white (originally shot in color and then intentionally drained of color and modern elements later). The influence is a mixture of Ingmar Bergman black and white films and the mood of classic horror films. The camera slowly lingers on scenes. Most noticeably it pauses twice to merely let you listen to violent action that occurs off screen.<br/><br/>The story is told by the town school teacher (Christian Friedel) as an older narrator reflecting on the strange events (narration by Ernst Jacobi). Although the events occur in temporal order, the movie cuts sharply between events. A series of tragic events occur and receive no outward resolution: a doctor on his horse trips over a line intentionally tied around two trees, a woman falls through a rotten floor after being assigned to lighter work, a baby becomes sick after a window is left open, and two young kids are taken and found ritualistically beaten. Along with these is a young proletariat man who feels the bubbling of dissent and rebellion. He blames the Baron (who employs half the town) for his poverty and strikes back on a cabbage garden. These are only the mysterious public happenings. More happens in private.<br/><br/>The movie mixes benign acts of goodness and normalcy between the acts of horror, which all occur off camera as if the film itself adheres to secrecy like the culture it's observing. We know something is mysterious about the children. They start to act like a little collective, which amounts to every school age kid in the village, roaming around town together and appearing outside windows always with the excuse of being there to ""help"". The pastor's oldest daughter, Klara (Maria-Victoria Dragus), seems to be the leader of the kids. It's best to begin with the assumption that the children are a parable for something like a nascent Hitler's Youth and future Nazism. Then try to figure out why they act the way they do. What would cause people to become susceptible to such a deadly ideological movement? This is where the film becomes most mysterious, and where answers vary the most. The kids have troubled family issues for one. The town doctor (Rainer Bock) molests his daughter and humiliates the midwife, who serves as his assistant and long time lover. The town pastor is an authoritarian purist. After his kids are late to diner, he makes them go to bed hungry and sentences them to 10 strikes each with a cane in front of their siblings. He forces his oldest kids to wear white ribbons around their arms to remind them of the value of innocence and purity (or, that is, publicly humiliate them in front of the rest of the town). He also makes his oldest son, Martin (Leonard Proxauf), bind his hands at night to prevent him from destroying his nerves (from masturbating, that is).<br/><br/>Martin's reactions to his inquisitorial father are particularly compelling. The performances by the children are collectively subtle, patient, and psychologically convincing. Martin's face is pure anguish. We see him dangerously walk on the ledge of a bridge as a God-test. His test: if he doesn't lose his balance and avoids falling, then he knows God doesn't disapprove of his actions. Is he blaming himself for his father's extreme discipline? Is he a central perpetrator in the acts of violence?<br/><br/>Another important theme is the public intrusion on private life. Doors are rarely locked and windows rarely closed. Such inappropriate behavior would instantly raise suspicions, and then you would have a gang of blond headed angels staring at you outside your window as if they wondered off the set of ""Village of the Damned"". They act like good neighbors to each other, but they also lurk around corners spying on each other (as Nietzsche liked to phrase it).<br/><br/>The parents, especially the pastor, protect their honor and dignity by ignoring the truth of their children, and the children mimic this behavior. Just try to get the truth out of anyone in such an environment. Most of the mysterious acts of violence go unreported, except for the ramblings of a girl about her dreams. The only way to hint at the truth is to dream of it and pass along your dreams to a rare truth seeker, the local teacher, since only fraudulence is allowed in the public domain. <br/><br/>If the narrative has any historical plausibility, then it must implicate our dark side as humans or as a society. Otherwise it would be impossible to generalize from the events that take place in a mere single rural town to a whole nation. Something about our typical responses to mordant themes in the movie – humiliation, intolerance, abuse, collectivization, invasion of privacy, and public fraudulence – cause the local children to become susceptible to violence for whatever purpose they might secretly have. Most of these causes always exist to some extent. The best thing about the movie is that we can ask the same questions about any culture, and we can wonder whether these causes are becoming prevalent enough around us to nurture terrorism or worse."
"ddelamaide","Null","0","5","2 September 2010"," Bergmanesque
","Many stimulating comments about the content and meaning of this film have already been made, so I will just note the homage that Haneke pays to Bergman with this film. The cinematography is exactly like Bergman's earlier work, with the harsh north European landscape (who knew the sun shone so much up there?) and the repressed emotions. Even the sound, where every footstep on a wooden floor, every door closing seems amplified, is like Bergman.<br/><br/>The German is not as sing-song as the Swedish of Bergman's films but the characters are just as curt. The pastor is a clone of the dismal pastor in Winter Light (himself based on Bergman's father).<br/><br/>Many commenters see the repression of these children as paving the way for Nazism and perhaps that is what Haneke intended. But German children were raised in similarly repressed fashion before and after this particular generation, so I'm not sure this is the full explanation."
"Photon79","9","0","6","19 August 2010"," Puzzling in black and white
","It is about the persons in a German village around the year 1910 to 1914. It is in black white and has all that flair of the time. I think I have hardly ever seen something like that before in such meticulous detail. The action and reaction of people feels so real, you can hear them breathing and the mimics are simply superb acting at times. <br/><br/>Even if you do not get your head into the morals of these people, you get involved such that it feels so immediate and palpable as if you were there yourself as an invisible spectator. I could even imagine how it smells in these places since I have been to similar ones before. <br/><br/>The story is puzzling and has to do with hidden violence, abuse, acts of revenge, morality and in general about how these people interact and which secrets they hide. The movie does not disclose the villager's secrets thereby leaving you and the accompanying narrator left with possible but not confirmed speculations about what really happened in that village just before the First World War.<br/><br/>Highly recommendable for German speakers."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","5","21 May 2010"," An engaging and meaningful film
","On my first viewing of The White Ribbon I appreciated the film very much, but it did not always connect with me or engage me. However, like I predicted, this is one of those films that demands a rewatch and if you know what sort of film it is, you will not be disappointed. This was a problem I had the first time I was watching it, I expected a more physically thrilling film I guess, and since it is a very slow film, I did not like it as much as I thought I would. But this is a film that demands your full attention throughout, and this time I certainly was engaged throughout with no dull moments. <br/><br/>I have to start off by saying that the writing and directing by Haneke is certainly amazing. He is certainly a director of patience when he thinks his film needs it. What I think is most interesting of his film is the fact that there is so many characters (which I thought was the problem the first viewing but have come to realize that it's it's strongest aspect) and he gives so many of them importance that this is probably one of the best examples of an ensemble piece. Haneke is showing us the way the people in this village live and how their flawed actions are the cause of so much brutality and cruelty. Honestly, I am not comfortable saying that that is what Haneke is trying to show us. Most already know that Haneke intends to show how these type of children in this village are examples of their future Nazi roles, so say in a simpler way, but I feel that the film does not actually need to be explained in any way, which I think is why I love the ending so much- it gives no closure. We are always as clueless as the townspeople and we are never given any further insight as to who is committing the cruel acts. We are forced to experience what all of these villagers are experiencing, yet without any leads on anything. We see how the Pastor has a powerful sway over his children's' acts and what makes up their morality according to his own flawed beliefs, holding them up to higher standards only because they are his children. We glare at the way the Doctor so ruthlessly commits perverse sins, and how the Baron is dominated by anger and selfishness. <br/><br/>Technically, the film is outstanding. The cinematography is brilliant and is the main factor that gives Haneke's film it's engaging but subtle atmosphere. The lack of music just creates more dread in ever scene and forces you not to look away. The acting is brilliant. The children's' performances are all great and are probably some of the finest child actors I have seen in any film. Ultimately, this film demands a 2nd viewing, and just like Antichrist and A Serious Man from 2009 as well, does improve significantly just because you dwelve into it's brilliant film-making more than you ever did in first viewing."
"jpschapira","8","0","5","3 May 2010"," Oh, yes...It's like that
","Michael Haneke is still asking the same questions. The context, the people involved in the stories he tells, they don't matter; or at least not as much as what lies behind them. We can easily discover this if we try to read the script of ""The White Ribbon"", an original story by Haneke that is told, from the beginning, by the voice in off of a teacher. Eventually we learn that this teacher is a part of the story, but he doesn't even remember it well. We could imagine any other details if the images and the settings weren't the ones we see on screen and we were left only with the narrated dialogue. <br/><br/>There's a small village, apparently normal and functional, when suddenly strange accidents begin to happen. That's all we need to know about the plot of Haneke's latest adventure: an adventure for him, to shoot, an adventure for the viewer to experience; a very particular adventure that doesn't have any element we might identify with the word 'adventure' in cinema. But it's always nice to remember that cinema itself is an adventure; and that comes before any genre definitions. <br/><br/>With absolutely no music and with a beautiful, classic black and white cinematography (thank you Christian Berger, for providing a work that we don't need to detail in words because it's right there), Haneke deploys his cinematographic strategy. The strategy has to do, naturally, with the questions he's going to ask. What's important is that it is cinematographic. Viewers, critics, people in general have always been discussing the same thing: how filmmakers leave the viewer wondering, without being able to understand some things when a film is over. Why did this character do that? Why did that character say that? Why did the other one left that thing in that place?<br/><br/>There are directors who have always offered more questions than answers, providing a way of filming and a depiction of characters that justify not knowing. I think the Richard Kelly of ""Donnie Darko"", or most of David Lynch. These authors not only talk about many things; they also try to distort life, the nature of things as we know them. I mean, they are the guys we shouldn't ask ""why did you put the red rose in that drawer?"" or those types of questions that they probably can't answer. The eternal discussion mentioned above also has to do with the fact that we can't pretend a director to control every decision and visual aspect of a film.<br/><br/>However, and although this may not be true, Haneke always seems in control. This is related to the fact that the world he depicts can never make the viewer doubt what we call verisimilitude. The village in ""The White Ribbon"" is a possible place because its basic way of functioning and the people who make it function are the things that make any small village function, with a system that prevails in many places of the world today, whatever the technical development. There's a Baron (a landlord) and his wife, there's a Pastor and his wife, there's a Doctor and his family, there's a Farmer, there's a school and there's a Teacher. Yes, as I said and as it occurs with every story, things happen. But I leave the development for the viewer's enjoyment. <br/><br/>Let me just say I admire ""The White Ribbon"" for several reasons, all which have to do with the same thing. If we think for a minute, Haneke is talking to us about the most basic things and feelings in life, those that come from the core of human relationships and kids can understand and explain in an early stage of their lives (it's not casual that many of the characters –some very important- in the film are little kids). But he does this with such rigor and command of the cinematographic language that everything acquires a new dimension. <br/><br/>One can never question that ""The White Ribbon"" belongs to a high level of movies we tend to relate with art, or whatever...It's designed that way. And within that design, among the mysteries floating in every perfectly composed shot, we understand. The ending arrives and comprehension arrives with it in a magnified form; magnified by the experience of the (a) movie. Michael Haneke (whom I consider, as you may perceive, a very generous filmmaker) is still asking the same questions, never offering answers about a (our) world that sometimes finds its most complex representations entangled with what's most simple and pure.<br/><br/>The questions this time around sound a bit more like assertions. Not definite statements but warnings. And I believe (or I would be contradicting myself and this review) that these warnings are also in the level of the basic things, and they are only a few, maybe one. Yes, of course we had our suspicions, but learning about it like this makes it resonant, powerful...Utterly unbearable."
"tubby1","7","0","3","29 March 2010"," Haunting and disturbing
","The White Ribbon is a brooding and deeply disturbing piece of cinema, it is both powerful as it is unsettling. Although, it is rather extreme and disturbing,it manages to provide a stern voice.<br/><br/>The village in White Ribbon is hardly ever shown in a light that one could suggest was tranquil, vibrant or positive. There is always this underlying and potent misery languishing around the characters. The beautiful black and white cinematography, which is very exact provides I think this antonym of beauty and ugliness. At Haneke's most bleakest the black and white serves as a truly haunting presence.<br/><br/>The film assess the strict religious upbringing of the community, and within these environs Haneke proceeds to provide a deeply malignant underbelly of both moral corruption and repression. The disturbing events that askew the supposed peaceful and obedient community serve as almost a repost to those of the hierarchy, being those in the most respected positions being the Baron, The Pastor and The Doctor, as they are all affected somehow.<br/><br/>There are some strong scenes in the White Ribbon in particular when a young boy is learning the meaning of the word death and when the son of the Pastor provides a replacement bird for his father's newly deceased one (one of only a handful of pleasant moments in the film)are very emotive.<br/><br/>Haneke never provides answers to the events depicted although you can garner what you wish. In essence the disturbing events appear to be either rather unfortunate or the actions of the youth who are repressed by the community and wish to exact their revenge in the only way they know, or can.<br/><br/>The White Ribbon is a powerful film conveying how Haneke believes evil ferments. The village is used in essence as a microcosm for the state of Germany in 1918, and provides a possible reason for why Germany turned to fascism. Although I found it at times rather unpalatable, and it is not a film you will enjoy,it is undeniably potent in its delivery."

","'The White Ribbon', or 'Das Weisse Band' for you Germanians, is the latest product from the mind of Michael Haneke; who is up to his eye balls with festival awards and academy nominations. For those uneducated, he's one of the most acclaimed non-English language filmmakers working today. He won the Palm D'or last year and was nominated for the Best Cinematography and Best Foreign Film in the Oscars. <br/><br/>There is little argument to suggest 'The White Ribbon' didn't deserve the former of those nominations. Shot in stunning black and white for that pure cinematic look, it proves that you don't need colour to show off the great German countryside. If nothing else this is surely worth a rent just to look at. I don't necessarily have an issue with the latter nom (seeing as I haven't seen all of the films in that category) but I really can't recommend this for the average movie-goer, if there is such a thing.<br/><br/>Set in the few months before the First World War, 'The White Ribbon' tells the story of the residents of a very small village coping with a number of ""accidents"": one injured doctor, one dead woman and one dead horse. <br/><br/>There is the underlying mystery as to who perpetrates all of these shenanigans but what takes the main stage is the family drama in response. In the first 40 minutes there are a number of very sensitive and sometimes moving scenes, one of which has a young teen attempting to explain death to her younger brother. The raw style in which it is delivered makes it un-sentimental; it's just a shame that it in end it never amounts to much. I've always admired Haneke's 'epic theatre' style but this time, unlike the thriller 'Hidden', I don't believe the story was conclusive or emotionally satisfying.<br/><br/>What mars the first part is that I really struggled keeping up with all of the characters and who's children were who's. It seems kind of like trying to remember the names of everybody in your class but in a significantly shorter time. Ironically, it's a good thing the film is so damn long, otherwise I think I would have had to watch it again to understand what was going on. But the plot never seems to get active enough to excuse that sort of running time. I was unsure of what the priority was, seeing as the accidents keep coming but never seeming to be the main centre of interest until the final act. I wasn't bored, but I imagine a lot of people not used to this sort of thing will be.<br/><br/>I know some will instantly label this as pretentious. It's got all the hallmarks of pretentious film making, for example, with its attempted ""White/innoncence"" symbolism going on, I admit this much. But seeing as the acting, cinematography and editing are all so fine, I seriously think only slight tweaking with pacing and plot would make this film a great one.<br/><br/>So should you see it? I'm sure Haneke fans have all seen it by now, so they're out. All I can possibly say is that I, a foreign film fan, was underwhelmed. Make of that what you will. For those interested, I suggest renting it first."
"cliodhna2","8","0","4","16 March 2010"," Not for the mass market, but thought provoking.
","It's in German, and it's black-and-white. So we're not off to a good start in terms of mass popular appeal. At least it's not about The War. Or is it? War never seems to be very far away in German films, especially black-and-white ones. And this one doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>The White Ribbon is set in a small village in rural Germany before The War. Very specifically, in the year immediately preceding the start of the First World War. The story is narrated through the eyes of an elderly School Teacher, told as the events of his youth. The 31 year-old version of himself lives in the up-til-now, sleepy village where life is dominated by the harvest, and three men - the Baron, the Pastor, and the village Doctor.<br/><br/>The story opens when the Doctor, returning home, suffers a riding accident. But this is no ordinary riding accident. His horse trips over a wire deliberately strung between two trees. This incident marks the beginning of a year in which the village sees many more such mysterious and disturbing events. People and property are attacked, a man dies and before long, we have not one whodunit, but a whole collection. So who did do it? Was it the Baron's wife who suffers at the hands of her authoritarian and unsympathetic husband? Perhaps it was the Pastor's wife, who has to watch her husband beat and humiliate their children? Maybe it was the Midwife, the 40 year old neighbour, secretary, nanny and spurned lover to the Doctor? It could have been the children, fighting a war of attrition against their puritanical and domineering fathers. Or any one of a number of other villagers who have reason to carry a grudge. Who knows? That is one of the elements that make this film fascinating.<br/><br/>Director and writer Michael Haneke ('Funny Games', 'Caché') builds a world where on the surface, everyone has reason to be a happy camper. The harvest is good, there is food for everyone. However, behind closed doors, characters are slowly revealed who we have plenty of reason to hate. The Baron, the Pastor and the Doctor rule their wives, their children and the village with an iron hand. Each in his own way is supremely selfish, controlling and brutal. The women have little opportunity to protect themselves or their children, and the children, brutalised by their fathers, have to find their own way to thrive.<br/><br/>As a simple vengeance tale the film is excellent, but The White Ribbon also works on a whole other level. The film ends with the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand (for younger readers, the event that precipitated the beginning of the First World War). This, together with the fact that while the children are named, all of the adult characters are only identified by their roles (Chaucer-style) creates a powerful metaphor. The implication is clear. People like these, in a place like this, were amongst those that fought the war and created the history of Germany. Despotic authoritarianism on the village scale was recreated on the world scale by history.<br/><br/>Performances are excellent. In a cast made up largely of children, there aren't too many familiar faces. The only one I recognised is Pastor Burghart Klaussner as the Judge from 'The Reader'. The sixteen year old Maria-Victoria Dragus excels as the Pastor's eldest child and ringleader.<br/><br/>Despite being in German, in black-and-white, long, somewhat slow and a bit about The War, I recommend it. Although I kept stopping to do other things, I made sure I didn't miss a word. It will never appeal to the mass market, but to those who do watch it, it offers a lot of food for thought. It's also worth watching just for the amazing line the Pastor throws his soon-to-be-ex lover as he dumps her - ""My God, why don't you just die?"". Wow! That's definitely up there with ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"".<br/><br/>The White Ribbon was one of five contenders for the 2010 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Just to remind you, the other contenders were Ajami, A Prophet, The Secret of Their Eyes and The Milk of Sorrow. If you can only watch one, make it 'A Prophet', then this one."
"olga1403","7","0","3","14 March 2010"," Didn't love it as much as i should have
","Two years in a row films that win the Palme D'or have strong social and political messages. Both Haneke's ""White Ribbon"" and Cantet's ""The Class"" chose to deliver the message of how the society influences children and in turn it's future. It seems to me that the judges at Cannes are a bit inclined to give the award not to the better film but to a more important film. While Haneke's effort on ""The White Ribbon"" is evident: it's visually stunning, the structure of scenes are very much his signature objective style (that doesn't really stir me but i get what he is trying say). The children's performances are amazing, they truly steal the show. Now the problem for me with this film is that it's constantly trying to deliver the messages it's supposed to, it's overpowering and practically smothers every storyline in the film, the cinematic style stresses it again. It's an interesting study in Haneke's favorite subject the nature of violence. But to me it drags a bit more then it should i couldn't for some reason appreciate the slow burner pace, which I know many people loved. But for me it wasn't the best movie of the year, not even my favorite Haneke film. I'm not sure it will stand the test of time and become a classic that everybody predicts it will be."

","Director Michael Haneke's film 'The White Ribbon' is a brilliantly paced slow burn into the secrets of a small town somewhere in north Germany. Haneke also wrote the screenplay setting it just before 1914 and the run up to WWI. He shot his masterpiece in magnificent black and white, which places your imagination as close to this period of time as most would imagine. True to many of Haneke's recent films, we see the worst of human nature. Yet his ability to bring you so close to each character secures you to your seat motivating your internal desire to see how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Strange things are set in motion inside this tight community when someone plants a trap causing the town's doctor to take a fall from his horse causing him serious injuries. His two kids lost their mother in a mysterious death 5 years earlier, which resulted in the town's midwife looking after the children as the doctor spends months in recovery in an out-of- town hospital.<br/><br/>The spiritual leader of the community, a Protestant pastor is a strict, guilt-slinging father of 5 kids for which he provides severe punishment so they become 'pure' adults. You have the Baron and wife who are disliked by most as they employ about half the town. They too have dirty secrets. The Barons steward and his wife and kids struggle as he tries to keep his family in line.<br/><br/>Adults start dying, children are tortured, yet no one can find the culprits. The story is narrated by the schoolteacher, a new town resident, who recalls the story years after the war to the best of his recollection. <br/><br/>'The White Ribbon' won the Palm d'Or, the highest prize awarded at the Cannes Film Festival and a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. It's also nominated for 2 Oscars, Best Achievement in Cinematography and Best Foreign Language Film of the Year.<br/><br/>Seek this film out. Your taste in cinema will change forever."
"Monotreme02","8","0","4","27 February 2010"," Difficult to watch, but totally rewarding
","This is not an easy film to watch, and not only because some of its themes and ideas get so far under one's skin that it becomes quite an uncomfortable viewing. It's a long, dreary, slow-paced film that places almost no emphasis on plot and instead focuses almost exclusively on characters and how they go about their lives and react to certain events that unfold over a relatively extended period of time, for a film at least. It is also in a foreign language that, no matter what, does tend to create even the slightest bit of alienation from non-native-speaking audiences. What I think is interesting is how Haneke exploits this alienation from the audience and takes it a step forward in order to further emphasize his point. The film is shot in stark black-and-white, which automatically alienates the audience because it makes us aware that we are watching a film – after all, the real world we live in is in color. In addition, Haneke has the film accompanied by a dreary, deadpan voice-over narration that, although spoken by a character in the film that experienced them firsthand, is alarmingly detached from the events depicted in the film. All of these elements serve to create an alienated and sterile environment, which serves as the launching point for Haneke's deeper themes.<br/><br/>There have been numerous films made about the dark underbelly of a seemingly perfect and pastoral American life: films like Blue Velvet, The Ice Storm and American Beauty portray settings that seem to embody the perfect example of the American Dream and the pursuit of happiness, but these settings are revealed to have dark secrets and nothing is as pure and wonderful as it seems. Similarly, Haneke sets his film in a seemingly perfect environment: a picturesque small village in rural Germany, in which all the townsfolk are good Christians who do their jobs, go to Church and whom all know one another. And yet, as the film progresses, this village is struck by a series of tragedies, events that expose the darkness within all the town's characters. The good doctor who had an unfortunate accident with his horse turns out to not be a very good doctor at all – he verbally abuses his mistress and sexually molests his teenage daughter. The baron is a victim of numerous crimes, against his crops, his barn and eventually his son – but could he have deserved it? He seems to rule the entire town – everyone works for him and he controls everyone's fates with a wave of the hand, and if that's not the perfect embodiment of daunting totalitarianism, than what is? Even the good priest is seen to go to alarmingly extreme measures to educate and discipline his children. What is most notable about the film is that, unlike the film's American counterparts, Haneke's The White Ribbon is completely uninterested in plot. By the end of it, we never know for sure who committed the crimes that the townspeople find themselves subjected to. We hear multiple theories, but none of them are ever verified. Haneke places far more emphasis and importance on the characters and how they face these troubles; the fact that someone committed them is not as important as the fact that they transpired in the first place.<br/><br/>Although it is a heavily allegorical and character-driven piece, another very important element that must be mentioned when discussing this film is a technical one: the cinematography. Some people were surprised this little-seen foreign film managed to nab a much-coveted Academy Award nomination for Best Cinematography – but it whole-heartedly deserves it. The cinematography is nothing short of divine. Every frame is fastidiously staged, down to a T: the lighting, camera movement, composition and dynamics are pitch-perfect, and if there is one thing that must be said about the film is that it is absolutely stunningly beautiful to look at. The stark black-and-white photography lends it an air of otherworldliness; the lighting and delicate camera moves become almost ghost-like. It is certainly one of the most beautiful-looking films of 2009.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, it is not easy getting through this film. It progresses at a snail's pace, takes its time with every scene, is intentionally emotionally distant and requires a substantial intellectual investment from the viewer; but it also a tremendously rewarding film for those who do choose to make that investment. Haneke paints a harrowing portrait of a small and simple village that loses its innocence, so to speak, in the face of a rapidly changing Europe in the early 20th century. Secrets are revealed, dark secrets, and moral values are shaken to their foundations never to be the same again. But the worst part is that we witness the decline of the young generation, who represent the future – and it's not accidental that the film ends on the devastating news of the outbreak of World War I."
"druid333-2","10","0","4","25 February 2010"," Back (once again) In The ""Bad Old Days"" (homage a' R.W. Fassbinder)
","Back in the 1970's,German film maker,Rainer Werner Fassbinder directed a film adaptation of the novel,'Effi Briest' that was in every way a 19th century costume drama that some found a meditation into the human condition,and others found a crashing bore (the film clocks in at nearly two and a half hours,is in German with English subtitles,and is very slowly paced). Flash forward thirty plus years later (2009),and Austrian film maker,Michael Haneke (The Piano Teacher,Hidden)has gone and directed an absolutely glowing film dealing with events leading up to World War 1 (which,like Fassbinder's film,is nearly two & a half hours,mostly in German,and moves at a snails pace,which does not ruin the film one bit). That film is 'The White Ribbon' (known in Europe as 'Das Weisse Band-Eine Deutsche Kindergeschichte'). The film takes place in an un-named village in north Germany in 1913. When the local doctor is injured in an accident that seems to be deliberately planned,it leads to a series of one unfortunate event after another. The events are narrated from the perspective of a newly arrived school teacher (played by Christian Friedel,with a voice over by an obviously aged teacher,in later years by Ernst Jacobi). The teacher (as his name is never mentioned)takes a fancy to a local young lass,Eva (played by Leonie Benesch),but knows her father will never consent to his proposal of marriage,due to the fact that Eva is much younger than he. Other events unfold in this beautifully photographed drama (by cinematographer Christian Berger) that proposes that certain events & attitudes were responsible for the onset of World War I,and the rise of Nationalism,which would eventually lead to the formation of the Fascist party in the early days just after World War I,throughout Europe (acts of sadistic violence toward ethnic groups & the handicapped were not out of the question). Michael Haneke writes & directs this quiet,but powerful drama that (potentially)points accusing fingers at those who were responsible for darker times that were to come (religion is cited as a major catalyst for the troubles---as embodied by Burghant Klaussner's brilliant portrayal of The Pastor,a cold hearted,loveless father of a cadre of children who channeled a ""Village Of The Damned"" vibe---truly creepy). Other figures weave in and out of this well played out drama,for thinking persons who crave more than Hollywood eye candy (and get it). Spoken in German,Polish,Italian & Latin with English subtitles. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains some rather disturbing violence,muted sexual content & other adult content. Probably not a good choice for the little ones."
