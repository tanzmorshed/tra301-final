","Shattered. Yes, that's exactly how I felt. Unable to utter a word. Jonathan Banks creates one of the most hateful creatures I've ever seen on the screen and I've seen hateful creatures. I had a physical reaction to his recognizable monster, we saw him or one of his ilk marching down the streets of Charlottesville in 2017. Carey Mulligan is simply sublime. Garret Hedlund and Jason Mitchell have become two of my favorite actors. Their truth made of confusion, outrage and pain is pungently present in their eyes. Mary J Blige provides a powerful poster child for dignity and composure. A remarkable performance and Rob Morgan moved me so very deeply. A film experience that we all should confront. My gratitude and admiration to the extraordinary Dee Rees."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","93","118","17 November 2017"," One of the most beautiful final shots of the year
","A good and extremely well acted film. It is really the netflix film that could make the difference in terms of awards recognition. It is not your typical racism film as it tells another side of it. It is about two young men who would never be in any way friends if it wasn't for one thing they have in common. Both are war veterans and return home with a trauma. One is the son of a farm aid, the other is the brother of the owner of the farm. But it is not the only story this ensemble piece tells. The acting is the best reason to see the film. Rob Morgan was the MVP for me. It was a performance that worked way beneath his dialogue. A very deep and moving character and he managed it absolutely realistic. Jason Mitchell was great as well, especially towards the end. He has for sure the battiest role. Garrett Hedlund comes right after with a very controlled and intense turn. He surely is underrated for his acting, I also liked Mary J. Blige who had some great small moments, but after all the buzz I expected something more intense. Much of her performance works through her expressions which were great and real. Carey Mulligan and Jonathan Banks were great as well. Jason Clarke had his moments but was possibly the weakest of the bunch, but that was mostly because of his pale character, The film was extremely well shot, nicely directed and had a great screenplay. At the beginning it dragged a little bit but it is definitely worth to see and the ending is extremely intense, shocking and memorable. And the final scene has to be one of the most beautiful scenes of the year."
"ElMaruecan82","9","55","71","20 November 2017"," ""Mud"" happens... but it can also create the most unexpected and inspiring bonds...
","Racism, war, violence, female solidarity  however relevant these subjects are, they seem rather exhausted on a cinematic level especially when the Awards season starts.<br/><br/>Indeed, on the simple basis of its trailer, one would believe that ""Mudbound"" is simply Netflix making its ""Color Purple"", ""Mississippi Burning"" or ""12 Years a Slave"". Maybe. But there is something fresh and original in Dee Rees' adaptation of Hillary Jordan's novel and it's a considerable achievement that owes a lot to the writing, the directing and the unusual structure and patient pace of the film. Sure it is a companion to all the movies I mentioned but it has a sort of haunting quality, something that sticks to your mind and dwarfs a rather good film like ""The Help"".<br/><br/>What is ""Mudbound"" about? That's not an easy question to answer, a few negative critics pointed out the film's lack of focus because it's a multi-character story and there's no lead or supporting roles at first stance, just as they criticized the overuse of voice-over. I didn't mind the voice-over much, the story is so complex and multi-layered that I'd rather have a voice-over explaining things and make it my 'privilege' to pay or not pay attention to it. The lack of focus now is just a matter of half-empty or half-full glass. But here's a way to present the film in simpler terms. ""Mudbound"" is about two families, the McAllans (white) and the Jacksons (black) living in two neighboring farms in the Mississippi of the 40's.<br/><br/>Laura (Carey Mulligan) married Henry McAllan (Jason Clarke), less moved by love than a desire to escape from her ""old maid"" condition, and marital life made her feel relevant and important. Henry isn't the romantic type but no bad man either, and I was glad the movie didn't take one path I expected. No, it's not about that kind of abuse. The McAllans are a steady couple and the Jacksons form a united clan whose patriarch Hap (Rob Morgan) is the descendant of former slaves who worked on that same land, Hap's dreams is to own it in the future although he's not fooled by the worth of any act of property in that racist state. The Jacksons might strike as too 'virtuous' and taking very solemn poses but once you get drawn by the atmosphere and the hostility they constantly face, you realize that ""disunion"" couldn't be an option. Hap and his wife Florence (Oscar- worthy Mary J. Blige) can't afford the luxury of not being at least ""happy together"".<br/><br/>But the film doesn't venture yet in these unsafe territories; the tone is only set with the presence of Henry's father: Pappy McAllan, a bigoted racist played by Jonathan Banks and whom we suspect will act like a ticking bomb. Henry buys a farm and Laura follows him, circumstances of life will force Florence to work for the McAllans, but as long as these two families mind their own business, so to speak, nothing seem ready to create conflicts. Except for what sets up the second act of the film, the second World War. The merit of ""Mudbound"" is to paint notable differences at first until you realize that the two families have a lot more in common. This 'common denominator' is the core of ""Mudbound"": the bond between the two veterans of each family: Henry's brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) and Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell). Here are two men who've seen hell in Europe, the things we expect and that are not overplayed, but they also lived the exhilaration of liberating countries and discovering a fraternity that transcends racial barriers.<br/><br/>""Mudbound"" breaks a taboo seldom explored by the movies: the hypocritical treatment of Black soldiers. America takes pride for having liberated Europe but not to the point of questioning the internal ""prisons"", and this is the concealed wound the film tries to heal. Ronsel is the most complex of all the characters because he embraced his country's idealism and couldn't believe he wouldn't be rewarded for it. Jamie suffers from PTSD and finds in Ronsel the only man capable to understand him, ""Mudbound"" began like the stories of two women, Laura and Florence who were growing to understand each other, a sort of ""Color Purple"" of the 2010's, directed by a woman and with enough narrative to play like a feminist hymn, but no, this is a movie about two men, Ronsel and Jamie who grow to respect each other because they found in the mud of the battle-fight the universally human bond. You know what that movie truly reminded me of? ""The Defiant Ones"".<br/><br/>The image that immediately comes to mind from that Stanley Kramer's masterpiece of 1958 is Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier as two ex-convicts chained together and escaping from the police. They hate each other, they still carry some bits of racism but the first display of solidarity happens when they're stuck in a deep pool of mud and must climb their way to the ground. Mud isn't just about dirt or about ground but can be a powerful metaphor of something uniting two men, a metaphor for an even dirtier stuff, when ""natural enemies"" discover they're equally worthless when put in the same 'mud'... unless they try to overcome it. ""Mudbound"" carries this image but it's less about 'mud' than it is about a color-blind ""bound"". The mud is either literal in the film or represented by the trauma of war and also the suffering of women, while not the focus, ""Mudbound"" has a saying on that subject as well.<br/><br/>""Mudbound"" is a proof that Netflix is becoming a major contender in the years to come, I don't know whether the film will meet with Oscar recognition but there should be some love to the haunting cinematography, the screenplay and Mary J. Blige should be a lock if Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis won for what I believe are lesser movies."
"riorita-63879","10","76","109","3 November 2017"," One of the Best of This Year
","Wasn't going to go to this, but so very glad I did. Netflix has made a film worthy of the highest praise. If the book is better than this movie, this is a book for your library. The entire screening audience became engrossed in this movie, so quiet you could hear a pin drop on the carpet. The story unfolds necessarily slow and snares you. The narrations by different characters at different times, helps to pull the viewer in lightly forcing a personal touch to each story. The different perspectives of the storytellers is blatantly obvious while the movie spares little in realistic actions that make the viewer cringe at times, laugh at times and cry at times. it doesn't hold back The acting is top notch, even though I had only heard of a hand full of these players, one not even being an actor. The cinematography is up there, crisp and a great player in the mood of this movie. It had educational moments too, while not being preachy, it just shows and tells where we have been. It is also a movie for our times. People from the screening audience are still taking about this move 4 days later. An Oscar contender this should be."

It is refreshing to have a movie entertain you WITHOUT over the top action & coffee shop contrived dialogue. The story line unfolds in a way that keeps you captivated with nostalgia and wonder of what will happen next. This will definitely be nominated for an Oscar. It could be the first Best Picture win for Netflix! Garrett Hedlund & Dee Rees will have a great chance of winning awards as well. I would like to go into further detail about the movie but will refrain from spoiling anything.

"themadmovieman","7","71","122","17 November 2017"," At times astonishingly powerful, but incredibly boring at others
","If there were ever a film that sums up the phrase 'mixed bag', then Mudbound is surely it. Ranging from emotionally devastating and harrowing drama to downright tedious periods of nothingness, this is one of the most inconsistent films you'll ever see, and although its highest points prove utterly enthralling and truly memorable, its lowest offer next to nothing in terms of riveting drama. Its performances are strong and its directing confident, but that doesn't escape the fact that this film is just a real mixed bag.<br/><br/>Let's start with the film's opening act, which is one of the most boring and frustrating hours I've spent watching a film. Starting off with a confusing and poorly executed opening scene, the film really fails to pick itself up over the course of its whole first hour, doing little more than to establish some of the main characters and the hardships of the muddy, isolated rural community, things that could have surely been done just as effectively in a good ten minutes.<br/><br/>For the duration of the whole first act, it's pretty difficult to tell what the end game of the movie actually is. For one, you've got the story of a young woman whose marriage allowed her to escape her dull family, and who also is deeply frustrated with the muddiness and poverty-stricken nature of her current life. Then there's some detailing of the horrific levels of racism in 1940s Mississippi, with the family's grandfather being the main example for some nasty remarks throughout. There's also a young black man who goes off to war, who we occasionally check in with during his battles in Europe, while we also see the brother of the central white family flying in the Air Force during the war.<br/><br/>As you can tell by that very bungled description, the film's first act is an absolute mess. There's very little way to tell what the main story is, and what you should really be focusing on for the biggest emotional intrigue, and that, coupled with the fact that it moves at a deathly slow pace, makes it a very frustrating and extremely tedious first hour.<br/><br/>However, things really do pick up come the second act. Upon seeing the two men return to Mississippi from the war, the film's central focus finally comes to the forefront, and we immediately get a very tense exchange between the racist grandfather and the African-American war veteran. That's undoubtedly one of the film's highest points, and sets up the atmosphere of deep racial tensions well, finally giving the film at least a continuing and consistent tension under the surface, something that was completely absent from its first act.<br/><br/>The second act then goes into looking at how different generations respond to the institutionalised racism, while also shedding light on how horrifically unjust some of the hardships suffered by so many hard-working African-Americans were at the time, which proves for an interesting, albeit never quite powerful watch. The film's middle portion is a great insight into the time period, and holds your attention throughout, but it never quite manages to hit you hard enough as a film telling such a story should do.<br/><br/>And then comes the film's final act, which is exceptional. For the final thirty minutes or so, the devastating reality of racism in the past is brought brutally into focus, and it makes for a deeply disturbing and uncomfortable but powerfully moving watch. With the film's tension at its height, it doesn't hold back in displaying some truly horrifying scenes, some of which are easily the most intense and powerful I have ever seen in a film dealing with the topic.<br/><br/>The final act is directed brilliantly, being frank and brutally realistic in its depiction of injustice, and moving along at a slow but tense pace to emphasise some truly horrible acts, all the while maintaining a strong dignity that allows the deeper, emotional side of the sequences to shine through too, all of which makes it simply astonishing to see.<br/><br/>It's fair to say then, given the huge range of comments I have for this film, ranging from total boredom to transfixing and hard-hitting emotion, that Mudbound is a very inconsistent mixed bag, however there is one element to it that works well from start to finish: the performances.<br/><br/>The wide range of characters in the first act does make its story somewhat muddled, but each of the actors really shines in bringing their own character to life. Carey Mulligan is very strong and convincing as a young mother frustrated with her life in poverty, Garrett Hedlund and Jason Mitchell are both charismatic young men, meaning that their relationship really shines when it's on display, while Jonathan Banks is excellent as the terrifyingly racist old man, bringing a powerful tension into the film every time he walks into a room.<br/><br/>Overall, then, it's pretty clear that Mudbound isn't a resoundingly successful movie. At times an interesting insight into racism and injustice in the Deep South in the 40s, at others a tedious slog of randomly muddled drama and characters, and at others an astonishingly powerful, hard-hitting and truly memorable (dare I say it, even Oscar- worthy) drama, it's a very inconsistent and overall frustrating film. However, with its strong performances all the way through and exceptional drama at points, it is a memorable watch."

","Greetings again from the darkness. The Jim Crow South and WWII have each spawned many movies, and both play a crucial role in director Dee Rees' (BESSIE) adaptation (co-written with Virgil Williams) of Hillary Jordan's 2008 novel. It's the story of two families, the Jacksons and the McAllans, striving for daily survival in rural Mississippi during the 1940's. <br/><br/>The Jacksons are a black family tenant-farming on land owned by the white McAllans who transplanted from Memphis. This land is so remote and life so hard, that tractors are almost non-existent and mules are rare enough. There is such a bleakness to this existence that all seem oblivious to the always present mudhole leading to the front door of their shack. Elation comes in the form of a privacy wall constructed around the outdoor family shower, or the sweetness of a bar of chocolate. Soon after D-Day, Florence and Hap Jackson send their son Ronsel off to war. The same thing is happening across the 200 acre farm to Jamie McAllan, brother of Henry and son of Pappy. <br/><br/>A shifting of multiple narrators throughout allows us access to the perspectives of multiple characters. We get both black and white views on war and farming. Days in war bring injury, death and dirt  not so dissimilar to life on a Mississippi farm. When Ronsel and Jamie return from war, they are both suffering. Ronsel can't come to grips with how he was treated as a redeemer in Europe, but just another 'black man' being targeted by the KKK at home, while Jamie is shell-shocked into alcoholism and an inability to function in society. The parallels between the war experience of Ronsel and Jamie lead them to a friendship that ultimately can't be good for either. <br/><br/>Jason Clarke plays Henry and Carey Mulligan, his wife Laura. Jonathan Banks (""Breaking Bad"", ""Better Call Saul"") is the ultimate nasty racist Pappy, while Garrett Hedlund is Jamie. Rob Morgan and Mary J Blige are Hap and Florence Jackson, and Jason Mitchell (STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON) is Ronsel. While all perform well, it's Mitchell and Hedlund who are particular standouts, as is a radio reference of the great Lou Boudreau. Rachel Morrison's cinematography is terrific and captures both the hardscrabble life of Mississippi, but also the frantic and tragic abruptness of war (in just a couple of scenes). <br/><br/>Racism is always difficult to watch, and in that era, everyone had their place/plight in life. It was a structure built to ensure misery for most, and one guaranteed to collapse. The acting here is very strong and the film is well made. The story-telling is consistently disquieting and periodically unbearable. Still, we are all tired (or should be) of hatred. The somewhat hopeful ending caused an audible sigh of relief from an audience of viewers who had been angry and clinched for more than two hours. And though there is no joy in Mudville, we remain hopeful, even today."

","I can't remember the last time I watched a film that was so touching. Especially set more than a half century ago, The acting is exceptionally great. The narrative is as smooth as molasses. But what really caught in my soul was that some of these racial prejudices still exist.<br/><br/>I was fortunate to have grown up in Canada in the 1950s. My Dad started his dental practice with a Japanese partner. Most of his patients were Native or Metis, who would, often as nought, pay him with chickens or a side of venison.<br/><br/>As I said, this story was relaetable to me, not because I share the centuries of oppression suffered by many many millions of African Americans, But because I am a Jew. And in the decade that came after WWII, was, practically, in a small town.<br/><br/>There is hate out there always THOSE WHO HATE ARE INSECURE.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film is so important to where we were and where we've arrived, that it should have been given wider distribution beyond Netflix/s web. This story and its' storytellers should have been picked-up by a major studio.<br/><br/>Still, well done to all the tellers and actors - You have made my month!

","As an African American, who is 70 years old, it is difficult to watch these kinds of movies. I don't require movies to describe what the Jim Crow south was all about. this movie was well made, but at times it was boring.

"katish7","6","56","107","21 November 2017"," Unfocused and because of it clichéd, lost an opportunity to be better
","Gave it a 6 because it's very unfocused. I wonder if it's the fault of the screenplay or is the original book is that way too. It felt like big pieces were missing from the story or rather not needed there. By the end of the movie you realize that Carey Malligan's character wasn't really crucial to the main racism theme and two main characters involved in it, so it makes you wonder why the first part of the film actually focuses on her so much. It will be funny is she's nominated for this absolutely unnecessary role. I was more interested to find out more about 2 main characters, but because of the lack of the focus they both came up as cliché as well."
"rick_7","Null","77","153","9 October 2017"," A flat, self-important movie. I'm baffled by the critical bouquets.
","Ronsel quick-drying mud stain: it does exactly what it says on the tin – attempts to create a weighty, socially-conscious art movie from Hillary Jordan's plotty, slightly trashy but well-meaning page- turner.<br/><br/>Dee Rees's film spends more time in battle, fleshes out the Ronsel- Jamie relationship, and dwells on the minutiae of African-American life in the Deep South, but in a choppily uninvolving way, and at the expense of Laura's intriguing story of love, repression, sexual and racial guilt.<br/><br/>Critically, it never summons the book's sense of inexorable, fatalistic dread, nor knows what to do as it reaches its climax, which is first silly, then rushed and finally pointlessly and unconvincingly rose-tinted.<br/><br/>Mudbound has a few painterly images, good performances from Jason Mitchell and Carey Mulligan (who has one fantastic scene largely disconnected from the narrative and the worst pregnancy prop in decades) and an unvarnished understanding of the unglamorous, subservient pragmatism needed to survive as a black man in '40s Mississippi, but it isn't very compelling or convincing.<br/><br/>I say this as a middle-class white bloke, but... what promised to be a timely exploration of the African-American experience from an urgent and valuable contemporary voice is instead just a standard book adaptation: a mediocre melodrama that deals with big themes in a handsome but hackneyed way. Plus lots of Mary J. Blige staring out of windows."

It really captures how tough it was to be poor in the south and how difficult it was for the men who came home to that after WWII.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent and the scenery is sometimes beautiful and sometimes depressing.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have of the film is it portrays the relationship between Ronsel and the German woman in a romantic way. Nothing would have been further from the truth during and after the war. She would have been an outcast. The Germans referred to these women as ""sluts"" and ""Ami-lovers"" and their children were branded as ""bastards"". This would have been even worse for her as she gave birth to a black child. It would have been more believable if the woman had been French rather than German.<br/><br/>Other than that it's an incredibly good movie from beginning to end."

"PotassiumMan","5","33","65","26 November 2017"," Slog through this mud only if you have to
","I can best describe this Netflix film as highly uneven and frustrating to watch. Know this, you will feel the running time here because the film often loses its narrative grip and takes a while to get going again. Although handsomely shot, well-acted and possessing a powerful story at its core, this work nevertheless is too bloated and at times too aimless to leave a lasting impression. I've already forgotten the several stretches here in which seemingly nothing happened.<br/><br/>A melodrama about a white family and a black family on a Mississippi farm before, during and after the Second World War is a well-intended premise, but this film definitely could have used more editing. The characters are introduced quite well and there are some genuinely well-executed scenes, especially the heart-wrenching climax. But getting there takes so long and during these intervals I was wondering what the whole point of it was. Another sign that the story was not told very well: I actually forgot that the farm was struggling until one of the characters mentioned it. An important plot thread like that wound up feeling more like a footnote.<br/><br/>Some of the performances, although high quality, are wasted. Carey Mulligan is the best example of this. She starts out as a relatively central protagonist before fading into the background. In the end, she's an ill-defined character. Jason Clarke starts out strong, but he's also something of an afterthought by the end. On the plus side, Garrett Hedlund and Jason Mitchell play well off each other as two war veterans who come to grips with the institutional racism of 1940s Mississippi and who both realize that life was, in some ways, better in the military. Jonathan Banks gives a committed performance as the aging grandfather who deplores any indication of social change.<br/><br/>But despite the strong performances, this is a film I would only remember as one that took long to get through. To put it bluntly, I was snookered by the reviews. They praised this film as brilliant and I bought it, hook, line and sinker. Regrettably, I cannot recommend this film because then I would be joining them in that lie."

","'MUDBOUND': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A period drama about two former soldiers returning home from World War II, to work on a farm in Mississippi, and each having to deal with racism and life after war in their own ways. The film was directed by Dee Rees, and it was written by Rees and Virgil Williams. It stars Garrett Hedlund, Jason Mitchell, Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke, Rob Morgan, Mary J. Blige and Jonathan Banks. The movie was released by Netflix, through their streaming site, to almost unanimous rave reviews from critics. It's also been nominated for multiple prestigious awards as well (with Blige getting the most recognition so far). I agree with all the other positive praise. <br/><br/>The story begins in 1939 Memphis, Tennessee. Laura (Mulligan) is a 31-year-old virgin, that still lives with her parents. She's courted by her brother's boss, Henry McAllan (Clarke), and the two marry. They then have two children together, and move to a farm in Mississippi, that Henry bought. Henry's racist widowed father, Pappy (Banks), moves with them. There they meet Hap Jackson (Morgan), and his wife Florence (Blige), and the two begin working for the McAllan family. Henry's younger brother Jamie (Hedlund), and Hap's eldest son Ronsel (Mitchell), both enlist in the army, during World War II. When they return home they meet and become friends. They also both have to deal with their own personal issues, including racism and PTSD, which are enhanced by Pappy McAllan, and the other local white townspeople.<br/><br/>The film is a really well made and detailed story, that covers a lot of different characters, with completely different stories. It does a really good job of showing what racial relations were like, for both whites and blacks at that time, and of course not all whites were bad obviously. Rees's script and direction are both excellent, and there's a number of good performance from a more than decent ensemble cast. I'd also have a really hard time saying who the main character is; Mulligan gets top billing, but she's arguably the most famous. The heart of the movie revolves around the two soldiers, and their relationship, even though that's just a portion of the whole story. I think it's a really effective movie, because of all of these different great qualities.<br/><br/>Watch a new episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xsOj7IhB5us"

After the ending, I felt I needed to watch Mississippi Burning just to get a feeling of justice. What a lawless hole the south was. After seeing all the black children murdered in recent years, Roy Moore's base comments in Alabama, and juvenile actions of Trump, I ask myself where is the leadership in America to finally address the over incarceration of black men, lax gun laws, police brutality, white privilege in the justice system, etc?? <br/><br/>This film did not leave me with a sense of hope. After WWII, many black men moved to Europe where they were treated as equals. I realize the Mudbound story takes place in 1940s but do people actually think America is the land of the free today?

","Much of this movie (like so many recent movies) was filmed in natural light which for me basically ruined the viewing experience. From the opening scene on, I had a lot of problems trying to figure out who was who and what was happening. At some point, I couldn't tell who had died in the war and who had survived. While the story line and the acting were excellent, the directing (or perhaps the editing) also left a lot to be desired. Many scenes were rambling and seemed to serve little if no purpose. My guess is that the story was too thin to carry an entire movie so filler had to be added. If the director was trying to create the ambiance of a slow, southern lifestyle indicative of the era, then kudos, otherwise, they failed to keep the narrative moving at an appropriate pace. Since there were so may compelling issues addressed and the movie's heart was in the right place, I really wanted to like this movie a great deal more than I actually did."

","Mudbound stands as tall as it can, on its conviction and the quality of the performances, but its feet are sinking into the ground under the weight of too many clichés. The material is too familiar; kindness overwhelming racial tension, disgruntling aftermath of war and family feuding tied to a fallen American dream. It is heavily saturated in themes that are as rich as they are unoriginal, and the script is comprised of recycled lines like ""At least I looked 'em in the eye when I killed 'em"" and ""You're not a big war hero, you're a drunk.""<br/><br/>But the movie still gets by. It's a smoothly interwoven soap opera about two families the McAllens (white) and the Jackson's (Black) living on the same piece of Mississippi farmland, both with a son who has gone (and come back from) the war. The sons become friends. Together they wallow in self pity, but deep down they have a yearning to be back there, where they feel they belong, where they are seen as heroes, and where colour matters not.<br/><br/>The early scenes in the movie are cut fairly short to accommodate the exposition of an ensemble cast As a result, the opening act feels a bit rushed, but it succeeds in setting up a realized and sympathetic environment. <br/><br/>In so far as the movie has any breakthroughs, it showcases rising star Garrett Hedlund in best acting to date. He sports a Glarke Gable moustache that is so sexy its almost distracting in a film where everyone is covered in dirt. but the mud is the real star of the movie. It brings a reality to an otherwise dreamy landscape of warm sunsets and endless fields of green."

","MUDBOUND lives up to its name and is thereby a likely Oscar winner in the upcoming awards. Dreary and overly long by 30 minutes, this one details the story two WW II vets (one white, one black) who return to their mud farms in Mississippi only to find that while they fought for democracy nothing in the ""ol' south"" has changed at all. Racism and poverty and ignorance are still the hallmarks of the region and the vets cannot adapt. This one seems to be on the awards short list in several categories. After MOONLIGHT ridiculously won big last year, anything is possible. The actors are all OK but are nothing special. Carey Mulligan, Garrett Hedlund, Mary Blige, Jason Clarke, Jason Mitchell. Probably very exciting for those fascinated by watching mud."

"TheDonaldofDoom","9","10","21","23 November 2017"," The greatest thing Netflix has so far produced
","I see some of the criticisms of Mudbound saying that it's too slow, only ramps up near the end and lacks focus through much of its runtime. And it's true that for over the first hour, it's hard to know in which direction Mudbound is heading. It's also true that many of the scenes in its first half aren't necessary to the final product. But why is that a bad thing? It's nice to have a movie actually telling a story about people, exploring real, three-dimensional characters. Every scene tells you something about the characters it features, showing you why you should care about them, good or bad. Instead of rushing towards a conclusion, Mudbound actually takes care to absorb you in its world and empathise with characters suffering in realistic situations, facing realistic dilemmas and getting through them. This is what makes Mudbound's final scenes so much more powerful.<br/><br/>Instead of choosing just one theme to focus on, Mudbound focuses on many issues of the era, many of which are still relevant today. It's not just a racism film. It's about PTSD, family, ownership of land and relations between families. Even if you're sick of racism films, give this a watch. It also explores America's racist past in new ways: Ronsel, returning from the war, finds it hard to adapt back into America's racist system. He's just gone and fought for his country, and yet it still treats him as a second-class citizen because of his colour. Why didn't he stay in Europe, where racial equality exists, he must wonder.<br/><br/>Mudbound's major slip-up is that it waits too long to properly introduce its two main characters into the story. It gives small snippets of their time fighting in WW2 but little more than that. This makes it slightly jarring when the focus suddenly shifts to them about halfway through. And yet, it's hard to care about this flaw by the end. I was too swept away by the emotions to care."
"paulmcuomo","7","13","33","22 November 2017"," Yes, I'm going to be that guy. Sorry
","I've seen a lot of reviews of this movie, and all of them have been climbing over one another to say how much they love this film. It's pretty much been a case of this movie is the sole contender for bet picture this year. So, it is some shame that I come here and say that after watching it right now, it is a bit over-hyped. Obviously just my opinion.<br/><br/>Firstly, I want to mention the things I wasn't too keen on. The biggest one - BY FAR - is the fact that there are so many narrative voices, and the narration is so frequent and so invasive that it started to grate on my nerves a lot. It also doesn't help that the narration contains very anecdotal stories that don't serve too much of the plot, and is a case of ""show don't tell"" being ignored. There is a large portion of the film when the narration goes away, and I was happy, and then it came back and I was just annoyed all over again. The more constructive problem is that this constant infighting of narrative voice keeps the film from having a clear Protagonist, and so for the first hour and a bit before the focus moves to Jamie and Ronsel, you feel very pulled in all directions, and very disengaged sometimes.<br/><br/>Secondly, something that I will admit is both a blessing and a curse is that director Dee Rees has a very realistic style of directing in terms of the world's physics around it, so the light is all natural within scenes ala The Revenant so to speak. The drawback to a lot of this is that there are scenes shot at night that are so lowly lit that you can't see a f***ing thing that's going on. There's one scene this works fantastically, which is one of the best shots of the year, but aside from that, it's really hard. There's also some slight jarring from the film's score which is mostly absent and then comes in like a wrecking ball, and it's really abrupt and kind of kills the mood.<br/><br/>Thirdly, somewhat less importantly, is that the film has a very vague sense of time passing, to the point where I can only tell that 9 months has passed because someone has been born, but there's nothing else to indicate that in relation to everything else.<br/><br/>Lastly, whilst a lot of the cast do more than pull their weight, there are also some players that don't. Particularly, Carey Mulligan and Jason Clarke continue a trend with their work, which is that when they are not being passionate about the role, they kind of sleep it through. This is common with Mulligan, who will give performances like An Education, Suffragette, Shame and Drive, but then in a large amount of other roles, be bland as hell. Jason Clarke likewise, will be a charismatic confident leader in things like Lawless, Zero Dark Thirty and Everest, but then will do this when he is largely distant.<br/><br/>And now, this is when I point out that I do like this film, a lot. It is a long movie, but I did keep going with the elements I didn't like to see where they led, and they led to a fantastic final 45 minutes. Everything has led up to this point, and this culminates in one of the most uplifting final shots of a movie this year, and a haunting scene involving the KKK and a trio of amazing actors. This scene, led by Garrett Hedlund, Jonathan Banks and Jason Mitchell give it their all in a scene that reminded me a lot of the 12 Years a Slave soap scene. Mary J. Blige is also fantastic as well, and those 4 really hold the cast together, moreso with Jason Mitchell who is one of the most exciting new actors around, and who in this movie really makes a statement for Best Supporting Actor. So do Hedlund and Banks, but Mitchell is amazing.<br/><br/>So I don't regret watching this movie; just don't like it as much as others do, but I am very happy I saw it."
"jimmybigtime","3","13","34","5 March 2018"," No effort
","This is one of those movies that revolves/bases it's entire story around a single theme, which will never show a story based in reality, because everything that happens happens exactly how the theme wants it to happen. Basically every single white person is a lazy, whining racist or someone who absolutely hates those evil, racist people, while every single black person is a moral, hard working hero. Yes, these types of people did exist back then, but they weren't every single human that lived and showing caricatures like this in movies today are doing nothing to help race relations. This movie could have been so much better if it had shown real stories from real people from back then instead of just going for more race baiting, Oscar begging repetition. You wonder why there are race riots in 2017 when there weren't in 2010? Ask Hollywood and everyone else that can profit off of conflict."

In Europe where he is not segregated he falls in love with a white woman, but has to come home from the war. Jonathan Banks is brilliant as ever, creating a truly awful racist! His sons having vastly different upbringings one on the farm and the other as a bomber pilot in the Second World War are in complete opposition. His friendship with Jason Mitchell's character is understandable as their shared war experiences.

"carlos37andre","6","5","14","21 February 2018"," A tough one to grade
","This was one of the most difficult grades that I ever gave on IMDb. It's really hard to rate the movie, and I'll try to say why here.<br/><br/>Let's start from the top, I really love the overall message that the movie wants to pass, the prejudice, the bad things that humankind it's willing to do sometimes, but also, that there are good people out there, into the mud and the durst. <br/><br/>Anyway, this is what I love about the movie, I love the way that it approaches the subject, you fell for all the color characters that are on screen, you want to step up, and fight for them, you fell rage for the KKK a-holes, and a lot of other feelings. In this subject (the message one) the movie is great, thrilling, and engaging. However...<br/><br/>In my opinion the biggest flaw of the movie is his need to give everyone a voice (littery a voice, they have narration moments), and does not work. <br/><br/>Look, I'm not a hater of narration on movies, I think that if they are used in the right way, they work, but here they overuse this style, and with half away of the runtime you're just tired to hear someone pop up and talking about their feeling every 5 minutes. And is also confusing at times, the pacing of the editing.<br/><br/>The movie is also really boring at times, mainly when Jason Clarke's character is on screen, you just don't care about him, his family or anything like that. And this happens probably because they don't do anything special when they are on screen.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the acting here is amazing, everyone is great on the roles especially Jonathan Banks (you truly hate the character), Garrett Hedlund and Rob Morgan. The score is very good also.<br/><br/>In short, Mudbound is a movie that worth see it, approaches a tough subject, that we must not forget that happened, and change our mindset, in order to ensure that this behavior stops (because this continues to happen, in other forms, till this day). The movie fails on some editing, pacing and screenplay perspective, but, the overall message stills strong."

","This movie has a slow start - in fact after the first hour we decided to take a break and come back to it. In the opening hour we meet most of the eventual main protagonists, but it takes some time and I found the character of Henry not quite believable - a man dressed in a smart suit, who marries an intelligent woman and lives in a nice house - who decides to try his hand at farming in Mississippi. Just seemed to be a strange thing to do, because the motivation was not clear. In this half we clearly see the main themes - the repugnant racism of the USA in that period, the limited chances for educated and intelligent women to do anything other than get married and breed and the grinding existence of being a farmer in Mississippi.<br/><br/>In the second half the pace picks up largely due to the interaction of the two returning war veterans - one black, one white. Both have had terrible wartime experiences and are suffering from them. The white man resorts to alcohol and the black man becomes withdrawn. Of course the racism still applies even to war veterans and when the local KKK take exception to our black war veterans he pays the price.<br/><br/>The film's resolution is optimistic, perhaps too much so but then much of life does not end in disaster.<br/><br/>No new themes explored here but overall a story well told - especially in the second hour.<br/><br/>We did struggle with some of the mumbled dialogue."

","You can practically hear the gears grinding as ""Mudbound"" attempts to add a relevant voice to the current troubled conversation surrounding race in America. Nothing wrong with relevancy, and I hope other filmmakers continue to bring stories to the screen that place minorities front and center and make people uncomfortable by forcing them to confront unpleasant truths. I just wish ""Mudbound"" was a better movie. Don't get me wrong; it's a good movie. I thoroughly liked it while I was watching it, but it didn't resonate with me, and it didn't linger in my mind the way the some of the best and most troubling films do.<br/><br/>Set in World War II era Mississippi, ""Mudbound"" tells the story of a white family that takes over a farm and becomes the new employer of a family of black tenant farmers. World War II then intervenes and sees a slew of young men, white and black, go off to fight. When they come back, they find themselves having trouble acclimating back to a world so rigidly defined in terms of race. <br/><br/>""Mudbound"" more than anything tries to be fair, which I guess is a valiant ambition and probably a needed one when we have social media hectoring us day and night and telling us we're either entirely right or entirely wrong. The movie shows us the worst of white racism in the character of a repellent patriarch who borders on caricature and rounds up the local chapter of the KKK to teach a young black man a lesson. But it also gives us white characters who are understanding and willing to forget about racial differences when faced with trials that seem far more important. One of those white characters is played by Carey Mulligan, whose dependence on the wife and mother of the tenant family (Mary J. Blige), first when her children are sick with whooping cough and then later when she miscarriages, is the catalyst for a tenuous bond to form between the two women. The other white character is played by Garrett Hedlund, whose PTSD leads him to the son of the tenant family, who also went to war and is one of the only people he feels can understand him.<br/><br/>I have a feeling ""Mudbound"" will be largely ignored come awards season, and I have to admit that I will agree if it is. Much of it is good, but little of it is good enough. No doubt when it is passed over, we will have to endure another uproar over how white Hollywood is and how black actors and stories never get nominated. God knows Hollywood does need to give us more black stories and, while ""Mudbound"" is not the movie upon which to hang that particular argument, I do hope filmmakers keep trying.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

A story of war, trauma, survival, division, ignorance, submission, and redemption can give us all types of lessons about acceptance and belonging. Mudbound is exactly that; a story of two families that face all those challenges and even despite their similarities they follow a convergent course into collision. It is more than anything a story of two characters that wander beyond their sensibilities and concomitantly change in a way that makes them impossible for them to remain bounded by the rigid, prejudice, and hate of the decadent Jim Crow south.<br/><br/>A black family, the Jacksons, rent a piece of land owned by a white family, the McAllans, in 1940's rural Mississippi. The behavioral contrast and dynamic of the two families is really instructive and detailed if one wants to understand social hierarchies and maxims of that era. The movie also does a good job in displaying the friction of racist and non-racist mentalities within the white family. The unity and religiosity of the black family was also a protagonist in the film, even more symbolical when Hap (Rob Morgan) recites a prayer in the burying of Pappy McAllan (Jonathan Banks). Covertly Henry (Jason Clarke) and Jamie McAllan (Garret Hedlund) apologize to Hap with the gestures that both demonstrate in a redemptive form.<br/><br/>The friendship that Henry and Ronsel (Jason Mitchell) build is the light at the end of the tunnel for a story filled with hardship and scarcity. Jaime, in an effort to reminisce and cleanse himself from the traumas of his wartime, befriends Ronsel and it serves both to recognize their purpose and life decisions post-WWII. The symbol of acceptance and prosperity in an unlikely friendship on rural Mississippi is the hope that even on the bleakest circumstances a person can change and create something extraordinary."

"hunter-friesen","6","4","13","16 February 2018"," Mudbound boasts good performances and beautiful photography, but that's about it.
","Mudbound is one of those films that I can never wrap my head around. It's definitely not a bad film, but definitely not a good one. The things it does right are too small to make up for the things it does wrong. The story isn't really that groundbreaking, but it's still serviceable enough to sustain mild interest. Mudbound is a film that is just fine on its own, but when comparing to other movies in its genre, or even other awards movies, there's nothing special to make it stand out. 
 
The film is set before, during, and immediately after WWII, tracking two families in the deep south, one white and one black. Both families endure struggles such as raising children in harsh environments and the threat of crop failure. However, the most important thing the film follows are the connections that the racially divided families make with each other. We see the fathers, mothers, and sons all bond together, each dealing with their differences in unique ways. <br/><br/>The film flirts with trying to be an epic examination of racism in America, but also an indie that looks at two different families in the same situation. Both go over alright, but neither stands out in the end. The film also falls into an endless cycle of repetition of trying to explain what life was like back then. Characters go through so much pain and setbacks that it gets tiresome by the end. We get it, life is hard. <br/><br/>There is also a storyline about the white mother, Laura, and her feelings about how her life has changed. While Carey Mulligan does a great job portraying a woman whose life is continuously getting worse as times goes on, she doesn't get enough time to make the story feel fledged out. This comes as a surprise for a long film such as this. Most parts dragged on for a while, almost feeling like the director needed more material to try and make this film different from similar stories that have been told before. <br/><br/>The cinematography here is exceptionally done by Rachel Morrison. She captures the vastness of the Mississippi plains, but also the dirty and putrid conditions of those same plains. The cramped houses of both the families are shown well, dirt and muck everywhere the eye can see. Natural lighting is used the majority of the time, which works to benefit the film since the sun is almost a villain itself, endlessly beating down on the characters. We see nature captured as both a giver of life and a harbinger of death, offering people just enough to keep them around while also punishing them relentlessly.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan gives the standout performance as the wife of a man whom she loves less as the days go on. She struggles to remain loyal to him even though his actions are the sole reason why she is miserable in the first place. She's quiet on the outside, but on the inside, we can tell there is a battle going on inside her head of what she should do. It's perfectly balanced by Mulligan, who deserved more awards attention for her work.<br/><br/>Both Garrett Hedlund and Jason Mitchell do a great job as Jamie and Ronsel, respectively. They share a common connection through the war that is powerful enough to bring them together despite their racial differences. They both make their characters whole as they try to learn how to live a normal life back home after the war. <br/><br/>Mary J. Blige also does well as Florence, the mother of Ronsel and the matriarch of her family. She's a woman who is able to give compassion, but also ready to fight and hold her own when the time comes. She goes especially well with Mulligan and Rob Morgan as her husband, Hap. <br/><br/>Finally, Jason Clarke and Jonathan Banks are alright as father and son. Clarke is Henry, husband to Laura, and Banks is Pappy, an old WWI veteran who still believes the south should return back to times of slavery. They both give rather one-note performances that are easily overshadowed by everyone else.<br/><br/>There is a lot to live up to when you're attempting to make a film about race relations in America. Many have failed to reach the heights of films such as The Color Purple and most recently, Selma. Unfortunately for Mudbound, it too joins the club of those who have tried and failed.

","Firstly, the scene of US soldiers in Europe are false, the American armed forces were segregated until Truman desegregated them in 1948, so African soldiers ""fighting"" and ""marching"" along side white soldiers is a joke.<br/><br/>As fore the political elements that surround this film, take a look at one such review: ""This celluloid masterpiece sums up Ch 1 'Reconstructing Reconstruction' of Carol Anderson's ""White Rage"", SPECTACULARLY! ""White Rage — The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide"" ""...the trigger for white rage, invariably, is black advancement. It is not the mere presence of black people that is the problem; rather it is blackness with ambition, with drive, with purpose, with aspirations and with demands for full and equal citizenship. It is blackness that refuses to accept subjugation, to give up."" No, it's not black advancement that is the problem with white people, it's that blacks expect to ""advance"" within WHITE society rather than their own. In other words, stop expecting white people to gear their lives and society around the wants of black people. Do it for yourselves.<br/><br/>Another review got my attention: ""This film did not leave me with a sense of hope. After WWII, many black men moved to Europe where they were treated as equals. I realize the Mudbound story takes place in 1940s but do people actually think America is the land of the free today? I don't think so. And seeing Americans vote someone like Trump into power only makes those of us on the outside wonder ... what is the fate of this country?"" So black Americans moved to Europe where they were treated as ""equals"" eh? Well considering Europe is the indigenous land of, well Europeans, you know, those evil white skinned people, and did not have any population of blacks, and no racial problems or situations as a result of this demographic fact, is it any wonder blacks were viewed as a curiosity rather than has a hostile group? Believe me, in Europe today, full of third world migrants from Africa and the Mideast, those days are long gone. And while we're on the subject, Why do blacks complain about white racism, and then go live in the continent indigenous to and full of white people? Why not go to live in a nation and a part of the world far away from Europeans and our civilization if it's so ""racist"" and bad? All in all, this film is, unsurprisingly, leftist propaganda. Garrett Hedlund grows a cool mo, though."

","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5) <br/><br/>GRADE: B+ <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A powerful film about bigotry with an exemplary ensemble.<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: in 1940's, two families struggle to survive in the Deep South.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: It is a small patch of earth that brings together two Southern families in rural 1940's Mississippi in Dee Rees' powerful saga, Mudbound. Based on Hillary Jordan's epic novel, the film shows all the hardships and obstacles that follow these tenant farmers in the bigoted Deep South during the World War II era. Streaming on Netflix and opening in select theaters this weekend, this film is one of the better movies of the year. One hopes the film will gather more critical responses during award season, especially for its strong ensemble.<br/><br/>We meet two dissimilar families: the McAllans, a white, semi-privileged clan who own the cherished land and the Jacksons, a black family who till the parched soil with hopes of buying and owning the property in the future. Their lives intersect as the story progresses. It does take a while for the set- up to begin, but it is well worth the wait. Laura, a well-to-do city girl with a sense of culture and pride marries Henry McAllan and is forced to settle on his family's farm, with his bigoted father named Pappy, a stereotyped hater if there ever was one, and Henry's handsome younger brother, Jamie,. (Yes another stereotype, and too obviously a plot device to create a melodramatic triangle.) Their neighbors are the proud and stoic Florence Jackson, her hard-working husband Hap, and their many children, including their eldest son, Ronsel. Both Jamie and Ronsel go off to war and come back emotionally damaged, unable to face the prejudice of townsfolk as these two become friends.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Virgil Williams and the director covers much territory and creates characters that resonate in their humanity, or lack thereof. Their script has some flaws in its storytelling. The over indulgence of the voice-over narration becomes a bit tiresome, even though the words have a poetic lilt to them. This approach provides multiple perspectives from all of the characters, but it hinders their development at times. One wishes those words would have become part of the dialog and provide its glorious cast with more dramatic acting opportunities. The film also becomes too melodramatic in its subject, but it is handled with such emotional clarity and nuance that one can easily overlook those flourishes. Its complicated story and the scope of its material allows a subplot about an abused wife (though well played by Kerry Cahill) to intrude upon the central story. This does little to advance the narrative, except to provide a haunting image of blood-soaked land. That said, these are minor missteps that cannot diminish the film's overall impact.<br/><br/>In fact, there are many memorable images in this film due to Rachel Morrison's photography (a a child pointing a brook handle at a white man pretending to shoot him dead, contrasting scenes of a woman washing herself clean of the dirt and shame, a harrowing sequence of a black soldier being told to use the rear door, etc.). Mako Kamitsuna's taut editing seamlessly interweaves war time scenes with the farm life sequences and transitions both with masterful skill. Ms. Dee's direction creates moments of undeniable beauty and unsettling tension. Her vision of the ongoing prejudice that permeated this town is palpable and makes the moviegoer sit up and take notice about the injustice and hatred (sadly still a part of America's fabric today). Particularly disturbing is the film's most graphic scene involving the Klan that is riveting and honestly depicts these heinous acts of violence. <br/><br/>The cast is exceptional and work as a cohesive whole. Carey Mulligan as Laura brings an underlying sadness and strength to her part as the despairing Laura. Her female counterpart, an unrecognizable Mary J. Blige, is riveting as she helplessly watches her son make some questionable choices that she knows will have consequences. Jonathan Banks takes on the evil and loveless Pappy with such deep-seeded venom. Although the patriarch roles of both houses are somewhat underwritten, both Jason Clarke and Rob Morgan add the missing depth to their sketchy characters. Perhaps the most effective portrayals are given by Garrett Hedlund and Jason Mitchell as the two friends. Mr. Hedlund gives his best performance to date as the alcoholic PTSD victim and Mr. Mitchell is a revelation, conveying all of the anger and confusion that many African- American soldiers faced returning from duty. His one speech comparing his acceptance of his blackness in Europe to his demeaning role as second-class citizen in America upon his returned is heartbreaking.<br/><br/>In Mudbound, one character says, ""I dreamed in brown."" That statement conveys the heartbreak and power that is this thought-provoking film."
"ardentayu","8","2","5","6 February 2019"," Well done
","This movie does a great job of capturing the difficulties of the post World War II world in America - the struggle to make a living as a farmer and the problems that the deeply embedded racism brought to families, black and white. Set in rural Mississippi, the story follows two families (one white and in ownership of the land) and the other black (and working the land). It shows the intersection and power balance between the families, all leading to tragic circumstances. I thought it was well done and its one of the better ""Netflix Originals"" that I've seen. Not sure it's worthy of an Oscar nom, but I don't like many Oscar noms anyway, and I liked this one much better than most of the other 2018 nominated films."

","There are at least three ways to take this film:<br/><br/> One is for the message: Yeah, this is the way it was! Don't hide it; take it in! It's not too late, America! We CAN fix this - with understanding and love.<br/><br/>Second, is for the production: it's really amazing what a team of women can do, and this film is proof. And its also amazing what a team led by African-Americans can do.<br/><br/>And finally, there is the story. Here, in my opinion, is where it falls short.<br/><br/>This film takes its time ""setting the table."" Like a guest at a feast, the viewer doesn't know what to make of the scenes. Is this an appetizer or the main course; a side dish or the pièce-de-resistance?<br/><br/>About one hour into watching this on Netflix, I turned to my viewing companion with the query, ""When is this going to take off?"" Plenty of powerful scenes but they refused to coalesce into a narrative. Come to the point, already! Much more effective, to my mind, if this material could have been cut and the story rewritten, incorporating this material either by reference or in flashback.<br/><br/>Part of the problem is that there's just too much material for a film of this length to handle satisfactorily. Consequently, it falls uncomfortably between two stools. It deserves to be either a multi-episode TV series or to be pared and concentrated down to one person's story.<br/><br/>But also it's the almost insurmountable difficulty of adapting to film a novel written with each chapter a Point of View from successive characters. <br/><br/>So many characters to follow., and, thanks to the actors, each and every one of them fascinating. I wanted to spend more time with them. But what the film must content us with is a sketch - a suggestive sketch, but a only sketch.<br/><br/>Another symptom of the need to squeeze the material down to fit the time constraints of a feature film, was the voice-overs. Necessary short cuts, no doubt, but they took me out of the film.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the interludes of gospel music provided some of the most satisfying moments: then the film simply soars. <br/><br/>Eventually, as it concentrates on the relationship between the two young men, the film picks up and gathers momentum for the shattering climax. Though here, too, it left me dissatisfied. Attempting to strike a balance between redemptive love on the one hand, and violence on the other, it pulled its punches, ending up once again on a queasy, sentimental note."
"gensbill","9","2","6","18 March 2018"," Wipe Your Feet
","I refused to watch this movie for some time. It seemed too political and as a cinephile, I didn't want the indoctrination -- I get enough of that reading the papers. Brain-washing, after all, is a young man's game.<br/><br/>Once I realized the star of Mudbound was Carey Mulligan, I was obligated to at the very least, give it a cursory view. I owe her for Never Let Me Go, and am currently watching with more than just a little disappointment, Collateral, a British miniseries for the same reason. <br/><br/>Yet, one of the movies I will ever cherish is Carey Mulligan's Never Let Me Go. That is why we watch the stuff Hollywood foists upon us, to feel something, to understand something about our lives, about ourselves. <br/><br/>Never Let Me Go took me, and it never let me go.<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan gets at least a glance from me, for whatever, and for however long, and in this, she is worth the look. Her face says everything and her reading of the character tells you about her and the character.<br/><br/>Yet, she didn't need me. This film is excellent. In my opinion, it should have won the 2017 Best Film Oscar. It's sad and sweet, and at the risk of sounding like a take-out food menu, it is more than a little sour, for it illuminates what happens to people who are good with no options, and those who could do much better if not for societal restrictions. <br/><br/>It is about life, and the way we live it -- how we have no other option but to compromise between what we believe in and know is right, and what we realize what will give us one more day.<br/><br/>It is not something I will ever forget.<br/><br/>With this, and the afore mentioned film, Carey owns me. At least, I will always watch her stuff. <br/><br/>And, I will not be so kind to Collateral.<br/><br/>Yet, if you are given the opportunity to watch this, ignore the hype. It is not about oppression and the trickling sorrow of slavery's injustice, although that is surely there. <br/><br/>It is about family, hope, friendship, and love -- just as all great movies are."
"alihandemiral","9","2","6","10 March 2018"," Great title, great cast, great acting, and a great way of storytelling; ""Mudbound"" has it all!
","I can't help but think that Mudbound did not return from The Academy Awards with a few Oscars just because The Academy's sensibility to African Americans was long gone (12 Years a Slave, Moonlight etc.). They decided to aim for films that are concerned with the problems of the white people - once again - as we see with Call Me By Your Name. I'd argue that along with Dunkirk and Shape of Water, Mudbound was a frontrunner for both Best Picture and Best Director as well as for Best Supporting Actress with Mary J. Blige's stellar performance.<br/><br/>Mudbound features a great cast, the portrayal of the characters are amazing. The way the story is told through different layers combines with these amazing performances and establishes the film as one of the best pictures of the last year.<br/><br/>I especially believe that Garrett Hedlund, Rob Morgan and Jason Mitchell's performances were heavily undermined by the critics."

Possibly mandatory MUDBOUND sensitivity training sessions would have made these 1900s Southern Racists too self-conscious and ashamed to reproduce, solving the USA's ""Race Problem"" once and for all. (As an added benefit, this would have allowed all of the folks speaking normal American dialects to spread out Down South, giving all of us more ""elbow room."") Unfortunately, releasing MUDBOUND three generations too late could well do more harm than good.

"demented_peruvian","7","2","6","9 December 2017"," A good movie hidden within a larger rambling story
","""Mudbound"" clearly aspires to be a cross of ""Days of Heaven"" and ""Sounder"" with a TV movie of a woman who has to endure harsh conditions in a historical setting. It has very little new to say or show. It goes through the motions, showing us a montage of clichéd scenes during the first half, as it goes between different characters and plot lines. Fortunately it is edited at a quick pace, and the characters are engaging enough, that it is watchable.<br/><br/>Then by 1 hr 10 minutes it feels like the writers or director realized that it would be best to settle on the two most interesting characters, and progressively ditches all of the rest (and their story lines), to focus on them. There we get a buddy movie of two WW2 veterans who bond together as they struggle in life after war: one dealing with PTSD with alcohol, and the other dealing with racism at home after fighting the Nazis and leaving a romance behind. This is a better, more satisfying, fresher tale, and engages more.<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed watching Ronsell and Jamie's story, it all feels odd when the movie ends, as I wondered why I had to watch the first half of the movie. One family's tale has a conclusion, but I felt disconnected as the plot was so removed from them by then. The other family's tale is left not so much unresolved as flat out abandoned, despite their characters being the ones who started the story and dominate the first half of the movie. And the next-to-last scene has notable continuity errors with the opening scene, which depict the same event.<br/><br/>An aside note on the cinematography: I don't understand the accolades. There is one impressive shot of field workers at sunrise, and about two other pleasant but easy shots of sunsets. The rest is quite standard, using the same lighting and filters that are used in most historical dramas nowadays, being especially similar to that of ""12 Years a Slave"". Unfortunately, in an effort to be Mallick-like, the camera is quite often hand-held and moving around, but unlike Mallick, with no apparent reason, perspective, or art. Instead it at times feels jerkier than ""The Blair Witch Project""."
"kjproulx","9","2","6","21 November 2017"," A Powerful Drama
","Netflix hasn't had the best track record when it comes to original feature films, but there's always been that rare occasion each year with films like Beasts of No Nation or Tallulah (at least in my opinion), and I truly believe that they've just released their greatest feature film to date. Premiering in film festivals around the world, this film has been highly anticipated for film lovers and it didn't disappoint. Mudbound tackles many issues that have been explored throughout countless movies in the past or even in recent memory, but when a movie can captivate you with its characters and truly make you care when things begin to happen to them, then you've made a real gem of a film. Mudbound is no exception to that notion and here's why I believe it deserves all the attention it's getting.<br/><br/>Although I'd say I loved every second of this film in retrospect, it does take a while to win you over throughout its first act. After returning home from World War II, a few men have to deal with the racism in their hometown that was absolutely absent while they fought overseas. Dealing with racism isn't anything new in terms of film exploration, but it's sold very well here. It's done in such a way that feels fresh and old at the same time. Many instances filled my eyes with tears at how brutal some of the imagery was, leaving me speechless. Yes, this film can feel a little long, but that's where the cast comes into play, giving the movie a much greater pace.<br/><br/>Although casting talent like Garrett Hedlund, Jason Clarke, Carey Mulligan, and Jonathan Banks only added to the depth between characters here, Jason Mitchell is the true standout and I believe people will be talking about him for awards in the coming months. His portrayal of Ronsel literally had me in tears upon each climactic moment he was involved in. Watching his particular journey from war hero to being immediately degraded for having done absolutely nothing wrong, except for being a different color was quite awful to experience, but the arc that his character goes through is well worth the wait.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, the first act of this film can feel very slow and I was pretty bored, to be honest, but trust me, it's only that way so that it can take its precious time to give the audience a lay-up and have them settle into this world and care about the characters in it. By the time the third act kicks in, there are some truly emotional moments between characters and one standout scene that I'll be remembering for quite some time between Hedlund and Mitchell. Their chemistry was out of this world to me and their scenes had me completely forget that I was watching a movie.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a well-shot, very well-scored, and wonderfully acted period drama that had me in tears by the time the credits started to roll. While it doesn't necessarily do anything new in terms of the emotional impact of racism back in the day, it finds a way to put a new spin on it and make you feel all kinds of emotions that even movies like 12 Years a Slave didn't. Yes, I know that's a bold statement, but Mudbound is exactly the movie I've been looking for in terms of this particular storyline. While the slow pace may not be for everyone, if you can invest yourself in a somewhat lengthy drama, Mudbound is now streaming on Netflix and I can't recommend it more."

","I don't know how to feel about this. There's so much to admire, the biggest being its cast. It's some great work by an incredibly talented cast, with Jason Mitchell and Garrett Hedlund being the best in show. They both deliver some truly fantastic work. The biggest shame is that the film is quite messy. It tries to juggle so much, or maybe in theory it could have worked, but it's brought down so many times by some really questionable directorial choices. The film's music is sometimes overused, the editing jumpy and sometimes prevents you from getting too invested, and the cinematography quite messy. Technically, the film is incredibly flawed. It seems to lack a real sense of rhythm and consistent pacing the more it goes on, even if weirdly the character story lines also become a lot more investing. The main plot summary or premise of the film, or what all sites had it as being, doesn't really kick into gear until the second half, which makes the thing even more confusing. However, the different perspectives through which the film is shown was a great artistic choice (definitely gotten from the novel, and sometimes it does feel very rushed as well). Overall, I'm going to have to sit a bit on this one. I want to like it a lot, but as it is it's a big ol' mess. The final scenes also seem to come out of nowhere, as if the film was in a hurry to end."

","An engrossing tale filled with tragedy and hope, ""Mudbound"" takes us back to the mid-1940s Mississippi, where two families (one white, one black) struggle to make a living at farm work. The black family is at a disadvantage because they are poor; and the color of their skin automatically makes them targets for many angry, prejudiced, white males of the South. But hope blossoms everywhere, and it comes in the form of two men who come back to Mississippi after World War II is over.<br/><br/>Jason Mitchell plays one of the sons of the black farming family; and Garrett Hedlund plays the brother of the white, farming family patriarch. Both have seen the grotesque nature of combat, and both have experienced a bigger part of the world — changes that will have the power to bridge the huge gap between white and black, but can also destroy both men and their families. Customs and certain ways of thinking of an entire region doesn't easily bend or break to the dreams of a few people.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Mudbound"" is the scene when **SPOILER ALERT** Hedlund tries to rescue Mitchell from the KKK. It is a brutal, indelible part of the story that begs the question ""Where does all this hate come from?""<br/><br/>""Mudbound"" takes its time to tell its story in the first act, laying the groundwork for what is to come next. Many scenes are somewhat Gothic in nature; and the transitions from one scene to the next can sometimes be jarring and may be construed as incompetent editing by those who are not paying attention.

","A slow-burning character centric drama, that's powerful themes of race and acceptance are just as resonate today as they were in the time in which Dee Ree's impressive film is set, Mudbound is one of the finest films yet released through Netflix's streaming service and a potential player at the upcoming awards season that is soon to be upon us.<br/><br/>Adapted from Hillary Jordan's sprawling novel of the same name, Mudbound tells the seemingly simple story of two families of different circumstance and race, living their lives in the harsh farming surrounds of Mississippi during the war torn era of the late 1930's and 1940's.<br/><br/>Featuring an array of voiceovers and inner voice monologues of both the white McAllan family, wannabe farmers who've in many ways gone into a venture that is beyond their capabilities and the black Jackson family, who are hardworking and knowledgeable farm hands determined to make the most of their lot in life, Mudbound offers an insightful and emotionally resonate look at American culture of the time.<br/><br/>The McAllan's, led by Jason Clarke's one-eyed Henry and featuring Carey Mulligan's kind spirited Laura, Henry's racist father Pappy (played wonderfully despicable by Breaking Bad's Jonathan Banks) and Henry's war pilot and PTSD suffering brother Jamie, which acts as Garret's Hedlund's best big screen performance to date, showcase a family struggling to coming to grips with who and what they are.<br/><br/>The opposite then to the Jackson family, led brilliantly by Rob Morgan and Mary J. Blige's father/mom duo Hap and Florence who are fighting through their trials with both the McAllan's, the land and the absence of Jason Mitchell as their oldest son Ronsel, who has enlisted in the war, are a family who know exactly what they are in the eyes of the country they live in and are a family who have a clear goal on what they want out of their landscape.<br/><br/>There's a lot of character's and movements for Ree's to juggle as she flies between both various timelines, countries and a sprawling collection of personal but she handles it all with aplomb.<br/><br/>Employing almost a Malick like sensibility of visual palettes, voice-over and construction, Ree's film is big in scheme and scope but is most importantly an intimate character exploration of both these human beings and a country that may've been at war overseas but was also at war within itself and this powerful expose is brought powerfully to life by the young filmmaker and her on-song cast.<br/><br/>Ending up being one of the years strongest ensembles, Mudbound's recognisable cast are all as good as each other, even though standouts include Hedlund, the increasingly impressive Jason Mitchell and Rob Morgan's Jackson family patriarch, while the likely key awards player Blige showcases a previously untapped ability as an actress that will likely see the music star feature more prominently in films to come.<br/><br/>Each actor displays a care and nuance for the material at play and as this slowly paced drama proceeds on a path of certain confrontation, bubbling racial tensions and character motivations coming to the forefront, Mudbound's final segments will pack a powerful punch to viewers who've becoming entrenched in the dirt and grain of the film and will make this an experience that sticks with you after the credits have rolled.<br/><br/>Final Say – <br/><br/>Not a perfect film and one that unquestionably has been told before, Mudbound is still an undeniably effective and brilliantly acted epic that touches upon some highly volatile and important themes. Anchored by all-round award worthy turns and a career defining directional effort by Rees film is one of the year's top films and easily one of Netflix's best release's yet.<br/><br/>4 ½ mud filled crops out of 5"
"leightharrell","10","2","8","18 August 2018"," Very well written and acted.
","I just finished watching Mudbound. <br/><br/>It shook me to my core.<br/><br/>I know that stories like these were more common than some people today would have the general public realize, but I also know that many of us (as in good ol' southern white folk as my PawPaw would say) have never ever felt hatred in our hearts towards any group of people. I am not speaking for anyone but myself here. The internet has become a breeding ground for hatred and trolls who seek out the worst possible parts of our society and exploit them to make them seem probably far more extreme than they really are on a daily basis.<br/><br/>I just spent over two hours watching a heartwrenching movie about one of the most horrible and wonderful times in our American history. We won that war. Not all of our troops came home and some of the ones that did probably felt much like the guys in that movie. The movie wasn't about the war. It was about us as people.<br/><br/>We have the ability every day to hold someone up or to tear someone down with our words and our actions and even with our mannerisms and facial expressions. That saying my granny taught me of ""Pretty is, as pretty does"" still rings true today. Treating people how we want to be treated seems to be happening less and less every time we turn on the tv and watch the news. <br/><br/>I don't really know why I'm even typing this honestly. Maybe just to get it off of my chest or because writing is absolutely cathartic for me and I really do feel better once I'm done. So this is no act of altruism, I assure you. <br/><br/>If you have the time and want to watch a very good, but very heartwrenching film AND if you have a Netflix account, you should watch Mudbound. I'm glad I watched it. I may have to watch it again."

","I am not sure I quite understand this movie. It seems to start out from one perspective, but in the end we don't even really know what happens to the characters it started out with, because the story completely shifted to other characters. It kind of left me wondering what happened to the woman we started out with.<br/><br/>I am of the opinion that movies should never last longer than 90 minutes, and I know many disagree with me, but this film is definitely too long. It kind of drags on at times. Fortunately, it's beautifully filmed and the acting is good and it touches on interesting themes.<br/><br/>Anyway, I would still recommend."
"Jithindurden","10","2","8","21 November 2017"," One of the best films of the year
","This is the kind of film where each character gets enough space and each of the actors gives such astonishing performance that you can't just choose who was the best among them. Carey Mulligan, Garrett Hedlund and Jason Mitchell lead the film where Mulligan is proving her caliber once again and the latter two shows they can carry a film on their own. Showing racism through a white housewife who never has known true freedom and 2 IInd World War soldiers one black and one white who returns to their farm after the war, soaked in blood and mud have created one of the best films of the year. Jason Clarke's character essentially represents how racism can be passed through generations without being outright violent about it and how a lot of people needs to be so cautious about their every single action just to simply live peacefully. Even though depicting a bygone era it was relatable on so many levels. The best film of the year so far for me."

The biggest issue I had with the movie itself was the overabundance of different issues trying to be brought into the light. And some of them were just glossed over and underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Trying to take on racial issues, PTSD for soldiers, new technologies vs. traditions, and family issues including overworking, affairs and other issues as well. I feel the movie spent too much time trying to bring these to life and could have done much better and made a better impact if they concentrated on one or two of these issues.<br/><br/>That being said, the actual development of this movie was very well done. All of the actors did a fine job and really portrayed all of the desired ideal presented by the writers and the director. There was a great chemistry between the actors of the Jackson family and their evolution through the story.<br/><br/>The best part about this film had to be the portrayal of Laura McAllen by Carey Mulligan. While her part may not have been the main part of the story she played an integral role in moving the story along. She also showed great skill in character development from the beginning of the film, to creating a family, to the hardships faced throughout the majority of the latter part of this film.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good film but not very entertaining.

","The story takes place less than 100 years ago in the American South. Segregated, inhumanized ... silenced. The palpable oppression of almost all characters is claustrophobic and disheartening. To imagine this time is a memory for some - a parent or grandparent's story to others, is almost unbelievable - which is exactly why this movie should be seen. <br/><br/>Lest we forget. Not just what these men did for our freedom, but what happened when their 'hero's journey' ended. Coming home only to fight a new battle of prejudice, ignorance, and extreme maliciousness. <br/><br/>The internal, eternal, battle of right and wrong. So yeah. I cried. A lot.<br/><br/>On a visual note, the colours and narrative are heart wrenchingly poetic. The Mississippi landscape is beautiful and surprisingly unforgiving. Visually it's dirty, and brown, juxtaposed against the lush greens and kaleidoscopic skies is a respite for all the heartache - which I think the characters themselves might agree. <br/><br/>They are each simply searching for home, for peace, for humanity. Aren't we all."
"marajuniper","7","1","3","24 January 2018"," Vivid, slow but absorbing, with a dramatic final half hour
","Mudbound (2017)<br/><br/> A striking, smart, beautiful movie, a straight up drama directed from the increasingly appreciated African-American director, Dee Rees
 The main feeling of the movie is careful realism, for sure. It starts in 1939 and the Depression is ending, and then two main characters go to war and their experiences figure in on the overall behavior. Set in rural, isolated Mississippi, the hard times and earthy philosophy of ordinary folk give it all a beautiful, slow feeling. 
 Yes, it's slow, though you might easily get absorbed in the recreation of the times and the life of those times. It's never actually boring. And it's as vivid as you'd ever expect. Until the last third of the movie there lacks a narrative thrust, so you are meant to just sink into the world created and get to know the characters. It's not quite enough, by itself, partly because some of the acting is very good without rising above into memorable. But I appreciated the serious, deeply felt intentions. 
 In a sense, this had the makings of being a great movie. With better writing-not the dialog, which works, but the plot itself-it might have taken on real stature. For that potential, I recommend giving it a go. I also think the filming-the look and feel of the movie, including the photography and also the editing-is first rate. 
 One point has to be made: there are some moments and one particular scene that are really difficult to watch. The vivid, unsparing recreation of hatred and violence, of racial hatred and physical mutilation in particular, is not my idea of an inspired content for a movie. It's powerful, it's disturbing, it's terrible to watch and consider. Lay over some gospel blues singing, film it with oscar-nominated intimacy, and you, too, are victim. I don't need to relive a movie version of some of the horrors of life to understand them.
 I say all this first because to some people this graphic realism is exactly what makes a great movie. It is really well done, and the acting, even by the racist white dudes who inflict their violence, is not clichéd. There is nuance and restraint, even. But a heads up on that.
 And listen, if you make it to the last third of the film, stick it out. The ending is deeply moving."
"scottyent","7","1","3","27 December 2017"," Important, but extremely depressing
","This is one of the hardest types of movies for me to review, because I think it succeeded in what it wanted to do - making an unsettling movie to bring attention to an important situation. In that, it succeeded, but in being a movie I would ever recommend or watch again? I certainly wouldn't.<br/><br/>This is a very real depiction of a depressing life situation in Mississippi which heavily focuses on racism. Like many other serious but devastating situations, I of course am aware of them and think they're important to address, but would not volunteer to watch it take place. This movie was very hard to watch as you just truly felt the dread and the pain of the black family from beginning to end. The amount of times that the father has to just say yes and go along simply because he's black is just stomach turning.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there really isn't any hero here. It's a hard watch with a hard ending. Where you will crave justice for the mistreated black family (like in Django Unchained), you simply get a mildly satisfactory murder of the racist grandfather who was asking for it the whole time. I think this would have been a lot more satisfying had ""pappy"" been the only one to attack Ronsel and cut out his tongue, but alas it was a group of racist people in KKK outfits. So at the end are you happy that he died? Of course. However it feels hollow because they made it so blatantly obvious that there is so much more hatred out there and that their lives didn't change at all. It also could have just as easily been an angry son murdering a horrible father. <br/><br/>I know this is history, and not fiction, so it's not like I expected some switch to be flipped and everyone accepts everyone else. Just be warned if you're sitting down excited for a good movie, this is good in that it succeeds in being disturbing. I did walk away from it with a deeper understanding of the pain of living in those times, and it compels me to do more now. This is obviously good. But as a movie, it's a really rough experience - if you know that going in hopefully you'll be prepared."

","""Over there, I was a liberator. People lined up in the streets waiting for us. Throwing flowers and cheering. And here, I'm just another nigger pushing a plow."" Ronsel (Jason Mitchell)<br/><br/>In the memorable Mudbound, WWII serves as background for the war going on at home, where whites still beat up on blacks like Nazis on prisoners. Two unlikely friends, Jami (Garret Hedlund) and Ronsel ,white and black, go over the pond to war, come back as heroes, but fight again against the white scourge of the KKK and hidebound Mississippi prejudice.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, although the land is brown and the crops a challenge (The Grapes of Wrath hovers over the entire film), the black folk can sing about a better time while they fight for survival in the white man's world. Writer/director, Dee Rees, along with writer Virgil Williams, makes the blacks dignified not in a condescending way but one which allows them to act with humanity more encompassing and compassionate than the more clichéd characterizations of African Americans in recent years.<br/><br/>A darkly photographed film, Mudbound keeps the titular color throughout, brown and subdued, just as Laura (Carey Mulligan) said in the always lyrical voiceover, ""I dreamed in brown."" A few characters give poetic impressions as an antidote to the harsh lives playing out in front of the camera.<br/><br/>No less lyrical is the Searchers-like love between brother in law Jami and Laura. Although it's love from a distance because Jami lives in his brother Henry's (Jason Clarke) house, the two are isolated from each other like the whites and the blacks, with no encouragement even from their hearts to cross into love. This little world is just as confounded as the big one.<br/><br/>As frequently happens in dramas about warring factions, a break occurs where the sides can meet even in the smallest way. While the film has been a downbeat testimony to race relations still explosive after the war, it also poses a hope in the end, where the big war nemesis, love, conquers, as it always will.<br/><br/>Mudbound is a powerful evocation of the poisonous nature of slavery and racism and a testimonial to the intrepid salvation of love."

"michael-young-585","8","1","4","30 November 2018"," Tightly Crafted and Emotionally Powerful
","Part of what makes this movie special is that it is a moving picture about black history in America. There have been several of them in recent movie Oscar history. But perhaps what makes Mudbound extra unique is that it is a movie made by and with black women. Dee Rees, who both directed and co-wrote the screenplay (with Virgil Williams), is the first black woman to receive an Oscar nomination for Adapted Screenplay. Rachel Morrison is the first woman to be nominated in the Cinematography category and went on after this movie to film Black Panther, which might very well earn her another nomination. And finally, Mary J. Blige, is the first black female American to win nominations in two Oscar categories in the same year. In Mudbound, Blige played the lead black female character and also sang and wrote ""Mighty River"". She credibly demonstrates both her acting and singing abilities in this movie.<br/><br/>None of these talented women won the Oscar in their respective categories, but, still, Mudbound is an impressive movie and deserves to be seen not just for these skills, but for the acting talents of Carey Mulligan (An Education and Suffragette) and an ample cast of lesser known, but very talented supporting actors. This movie is tightly constructed and doesn't waste the viewers time, but is filled with the raw emotion that derives from difficult struggles born of poverty, race, war, and gender boundaries. The movie shows very clearly how racism blossoms when groups of people are struggling just to make ends meet and, to somehow justify their own net worth, end up denying that of others.<br/><br/>I was especially impressed with the numerous dualities that the movie sets up and then maintains throughout the movie. It seems that everything operates in pairs and the story is one of how each of the pairs solve similar problems in similar, but different ways. There are two families, one black and one white. They both have sons who go to war. (WWII). Both sons come back struggling with different kinds of legacies from their war experience, one with PTSD from the war itself, the other from the misplaced conception he learned of his role in society as a black man. They both attempt to make a living from the muddy land of Mississippi, one as a struggling white farmer, the other as his black sharecropper. They both suffer terrible physical tragedies, one a miscarriage, the other a broken leg.<br/><br/>Both families pay substantially for 'mistakes' that weren't their creation, and neither family emerges unscathed. Life isn't easy, and Mudbound makes sure we understand that. This movie is a raw, emotional experience, but it works very well. I give it 8 stars (out of 10)."

","Mudbound (2017)<br/><br/> A beautifully filmed movie, and with an important if simple message of being good-and about not being racist. Set in the deep South, the movie has an entrenched racism that some would call a normal segregated world around the time of WWII. As the inequality (and brutality) of the times is driven home, suddenly the war comes along, and a white man and a black man are each sent to fight in different units.
 The rest of life continues (and it's all rather vivid and realistic). But when the two men come home and they realize the have in common the experience of the war, and that this trumps any racial hatred they had been brainwashed with, the story makes some dramatic and moving turns.
 The cinematography is by Academy Award nominee Rachel Morrison (the first woman ever nominated), and I actually think she should have won. (The winner in 2017 was the man who shot the new ""Blade Runner"" and for me the visuals were more to do with set design and special effects than actual photography. But that's me.) The style was a modified cinema verité, with some handheld camerawork and generally in the middle of things kind of shooting that really works. 
 The acting is great throughout, including by the women who are main characters without being designated that way (the men are officially running the story). What sometimes holds the movie back is the simple and even predictable manner that the story is told. There is room here for more than the obvious and the dramatic (which you will see a lot of)-the nuances of character, and of motivation and meaning, are not exploited a bit. And that's what would have made it a great movie instead of merely a very good and well-intentioned movie.
 Director Dee Rees deserves due credit for pulling this off in a way that is important and sincere. I'm not sure how big her role was in the screenplay, but maybe someone needs to figure out how movies can really soar above the big themes that are shouting for attention and find the little nuances that make us really laugh and weep."

","""Mudbound"" is a highly overrated film and is deeply disappointing. Coming from a weak script that doesn't allow us to emphasize or truly understand any of the characters enough, the film has a promising plot that fizzles from its inception. While the last half-hour or so of the film is gripping and moving at times, the overall film struggles to identify itself and fire out what it strives to do. Coming from underused performances and lacking enough pure drama to hit home, director Dee Rees fails at directing a major drama. Mostly boring, this film is also technically weaker, not using the landscapes and setting to the cinematography's

"classicsoncall","9","1","4","1 February 2018"," ""When I think of the farm, I think of mud.""
","Overlooked for an Academy Award nomination as Best Picture is a regrettable decision. The film draws you in with it's characters and doesn't let go, even if the subject of racism is an uncomfortable one. The compelling perspective offered by two of the principal characters returning from World War II are almost like two sides of the same coin. Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell), a black man who became a tank commander in the war, is dismayed to find that he's still treated as a non-entity back home after being considered a liberator by people he came across in Europe. His white counterpart, Jamie McAllan (Garrett Hedlund), shell shocked by his near death experience manning a fighter bomber, would have been a dead man if not for a black pilot who came to his rescue in mid air during a German attack. The experience enables Jamie to see the plight of blacks in a new light and allows him to strike up a friendly relationship with Ronsel back home. In so doing, Jamie winds up on the receiving end of treatment almost as vile as that displayed toward Ronsel. <br/><br/>The picture plays out against a backdrop of unrelenting deep South poverty, endured for generations by the Jackson and McAllan families. Interacting with each other as circumstances evolve, the underlying racist sentiment of Jamie's older brother (Jason Clarke) is palpable, while their father Pappy's (Jonathan Banks) hatred constantly roils with bitter disrespect. Tender moments intervene when Ronsel's mother (Mary J. Blige) offers needed aid to the distressed wife (Carey Mulligan) of Henry McAllan, but it's not enough to soften the hearts of men conditioned to a life of racist hatred. The tension builds to a stunning conclusion that forces Jamie to look into the eyes of a man he intends to kill.<br/><br/>Excellent performances are turned in all the way around by the principal cast members, and as an ensemble, their work has created a stunning motion picture. At least Ms. Blige earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work here, a worthy performance in a film that will some day be considered an overlooked gem."
"latinfineart","9","1","4","28 January 2018"," An outstanding depiction of white fear, racism, and hatred. And black dignity.
","This is not an easy film to sit through. The characters who portray the most ignorant among men, are very well played, especially by the venerable Jonathan Banks, who plays a man of such ignorance, it boggles the mind. He is the kind of father it is impossible to love. <br/><br/>The uneasy contradictions of the time period cut through skin and hit bone. During Jim Crow, a black man could go to war, liberating nations from Nazis in the name of the American ideal, and return home in uniform to find his flag-waving countrymen now shoving him out the back door of the general store. This happens in Mudbound, with the defiant yet vulnerable Jason Mitchell at its center as the WWII veteran Ronsel Jackson, and the stark hypocrisy depicted in the scene hits you in your gut. It foreshadows actual violence in the story, the kind that recalls Ronsel's real-life parallel Isaac Woodard, and that still reverberates today through Charlottesville and as far as the White House, where a man of such profound ignorance now leads the nation. <br/><br/>Mudbound makes its point by taking its time. You have to be patient with it. There's no drama in Mudbound. This is no 12 Years A Slave or Django Unchained. This is a quiet depiction of family life, about daily endurance and survival. And it is powerful in its mundanity. During the film's first hour, we observe strands of love and hatred thicken between the two families. Across their shared land grows a bond between the two mothers, Laura and Florence, played by Mulligan and Blige; a friendship between two sons home from the Second World War, Ronsel and Jamie, played by Mitchell and Hedlund; and a hatred for Ronsel boiling in the cruel heart of Jamie's father, Pappy (played by a formidable Banks), the senseless white supremacist who ultimately finds no logic beneath his bigotry.<br/><br/>The action, what there is of it, revolves around the elements: the sun, rain and flies, which are so oppressive they become characters in themselves. As does the mud. The families work on it every day. The mud is their livelihood. They are mudbound. The heavy sludge of the earth weighs upon the narrative and eventually becomes symbolic. The mud is suffocating, just like family; just like love; just like hate; just like racism. The mud, and Pappy's hate, bookends the film, which begins with Pappy digging a grave, and ends with workers lowering Pappy into his own grave. Into the mud."

","Here comes the definite film about racial discrimination in the southern states of USA during the 20th century; a film so vary of every aspect and every human emotion that anyone inclined to draw quick and simple conclusions are brushed aside and urged by the filmmakers to think again. Mudbound is the film that succeeds wonderfully at what films ranging from The Color Purple to The Help couldn't quite.<br/><br/>And the key to success is layers and understanding. Director and co-writer Dee Rees not only uses her camera brilliantly to capture the human side of her characters (even when it comes to Jonathan Banks as the racist ""Pappy""), but she realises that the only way to get to the bottom of the problem and understand all the mechanisms at play is to illuminate every aspect, right down to the fact that it takes generations to reverse a rotten attitude.<br/><br/>Still, the best part of Mudbound is not how Rees sheds light on the very inflamed issue of racism, but rather how she's most interested in the inherent goodness in people, illustrated through the friendship between Ronsel (Jason Mitchell) and Jamie (Garrett Hedlund). The paradox, of course, is that it was war that brought these two together and made them realize the meaninglessness of not viewing all humans as equal. Theirs is one of the most beautiful friendships captured on film in quite a while, and Mitchell and Hedlund play out their parts brilliantly, as their masculine guard slowly is lowered to open up for friendship.<br/><br/>Mudbound is a beautiful film from beginning to end. Through Rachel Morrison's magnificent cinematography, it is a tribute to the soil we live off of and the timelessness of farming upon which we all depend. The story, which is based on a novel by Hillary Jordan, is an exploration of close to every human emotion, from boiling hate to all-embracing love."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","4","24 January 2018"," A deeply affected depiction of the post-WWII American South with powerful friendship story at its core
","A racially tense southern-set period drama, ""Mudbound"" has a familiar tone and perspective, a vibe reminiscent of a more traditional era of cinematic storytelling. Yet that's not to diminish the work of Dee Rees, whose feature follow-up to 2011's ""Pariah"" is beautifully shot and firmly grounded in honest reality and modest hope.<br/><br/>Based on a novel by Hillary Jordan, ""Mudbound"" follows a white family and black family living on a farm on the Mississippi Delta preceding, during and immediately following World War II. The white family, Henry (Jason Clarke) and Laura McAllen (Carey Mulligan) buy the farm to fulfill Henry's dream and inherent tenants in the Jackson family who do much of the labor. Both families have a soldier in the war, the Jacksons' oldest son Ronsel (Jason Mitchell) and Henry's brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund). When the men come home, preexisting tensions between the families flare up, especially as the two young men become friends despite the racial animosity in the town, especially the attitude of McAllen's grandfather.<br/><br/>Rees and co-writer Virgil Williams give us the McAllens' backstory and some interesting scenes in which they use (perhaps unknowingly) the privilege and upper hand they have in their dealings with the Jacksons, but the return of Ronsel and Jamie herald the coming of the film's most compelling storyline and what ultimately gives the film purpose.<br/><br/>Everything about the film clicks when you see these two men, who are struggling to adapt to life back in America, bond over their traumatic experiences that their families and neighbors cannot understand. Jamie's time as a fighter pilot helped him to see past prejudice, and Ronsel's time on the front lines and being seen as an equal in Europe made him less willing to put up with the same racist divides and provocations in the South. The script's use of narration tethers us to their experiences and makes their companionship meaningful, even as we sense something will surely go wrong.<br/><br/>Other characters get narration voiceovers as well, but even though Laura has a fairly compelling story and Hap (Rob Morgan) and Florence (Mary J. Blige) Jackson earn our sympathies with ease, the film comes alive when it focuses on Jamie and Ronsel. All the effort the script spends to tell the other characters' stories fades into the periphery. After you've seen the film, it feels as though all these subplots were merely distractions. Fortunately, the way those two characters are handled and the way the story smartly wraps itself around them in the second half is enough to carry the film. Undoubtedly, when people think back on this movie in the future, that relationship will be what they recall.<br/><br/>This ""Fox and the Hound"" type story has some old archetypes engrained in its narrative bones, but Rees approaches it in earnest. Maybe it's just the way she and cinematographer Rachel Morrison capture the dirt and grit of these characters' circumstances. Or it could be the way the script avoids gravitating toward any conventions of good and evil. Yes, some characters are good and some bad, but some are in between - the bystanders who don't want to cause any trouble, the victims who do not stand up for themselves. This spectrum reflects the reality of pre-Civil Rights America and ""Mudbound"" gets that context right.<br/><br/>Yet even amidst the stark realities, the film shows moments of humanity and kindness and is remarkably hopeful. When we think about the South in the first half the 20th century, we often think about Jim Crow and the systems and attitudes that divided us and oppressed black people. We assume this tension was pervasive and don't give a though to the surely many instances of cooperation, unity and brotherhood. ""Mudbound"" depicts a confluence of both these forces in a profound way. Much fat could be trimmed off, but the core of it is great filmmaking and storytelling.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
"marcus-11687","9","1","4","18 January 2018"," An honest look at everything that is still wrong in White America
","If there are few 'must see' movies with a believable Black American experience at its centre then Mudbound tops that list. Set just after World War 2, it is an honest look at everything that was, and still is, wrong about White America, but without the over-the-top indignation or pretence that change or hope is somewhere on the horizon.
Director Dee Rees does a sterling job in breathing life and lending voice into its few characters and weaving the narrative around them, the immediacy of their hopes and aspirations battling against a relentlessly grim and pointless present. 
No cardboard characters or caricatures were hurt or created during this production. Jonathan Banks is a more than believable full-blooded hateful racist redneck and Jason Mitchell the returning Black war veteran desperately clinging to the faintest possibility of a brighter tomorrow in amongst grim, poverty inducing share-cropping of his parent's and family's existence.
Despite finding a friend, comrade and confident in fellow war returnee Xxxxxx it's this relationship and subsequent revelations that brings the events in this slow-burning narrative to a head and sad more bitter than sweet conclusion.
With so few meaningful 'Black people related' tales coming out of Hollywood, the Netflix vehicle should make a fair bit on milage on Mudbound and not without reason."
"mrshev","9","1","4","13 January 2018"," Grim tale of racism and agricultural life
","My favourite thing about this movie is tone. At every stage this movie just manages to get the tone right. Whether that is the dialogue, the framing or the audio. Because of this the film pulls you right in and the running time flies by because I felt completely immersed in wartime Mississippi and the struggles of the two families. Their faults and mistakes are laid bare with no real exposition from the actors to lead you to think or make a judgement, that is left to you. I found that the entire ensemble were excellent, showing real restraint and giving their characters real heft.<br/><br/>Overall, a great movie and one that should not be missing. Well done, Netflix, more of the this!"
"Quinoa1984","7","1","4","26 December 2017"," A rural drama that packs a punch but takes a while to get there
","With Mudbound, a tale of two families in good(terrible) ol' Mississippi in the 1940s and the daily struggles for the men and women getting by in the most rural elements imaginable, I wanted to like it more, even love it. The period feel and authenticity Rees and her team have makes an impression and it's all surely lived in to where you feel the pain and literal dirt for white and blacks (so, in other words, a brief mention of 'A Tale of Two Cities' has textual resonance). <br/><br/> But the first half is rough going with way overdone narration, with too much that gives more information and dictating character beats than near necessary, robbing moments of poetry and grace. It almost gives the impression of a tougher/rougher shot yet far less eloquent version of The Southerner by Renoir. Not bad but not... Cinematic enough. It feels too literal a translation of a book (and it is an adaptation of one, unread by me). <br/><br/>Yet, once Hedlund and Mitchell, who don't get too developed before they go off to war and only get some in the scenes when they're in battle (all done in brutal and brief bites), come home from the war, the drama all around gets intensified. The narration gives way to emotional scenes between characters - or just conversations showing an understanding that wouldn't have happened if not ironically for the horrors of war- and all the acting by everyone goes to 100 (Jonathan Banks shows a much... ""Poppy"" kind of side to his talents). <br/><br/>It may be more of a history lesson than anything else, but the intimacy Rees has with her performers gets the material to its peak too. If you aren't sure of where it's going, or want Rees to stick to the farm scenes and not cut back to the war, just wait and the patience will pay off."
"bkrauser-81-311064","9","1","4","5 December 2017"," A Melancholic Masters-Class in Filmmaking
","Mudbound is an old-fashioned epic drama based on the penetrating novel of the same name by Hillary Jordan. The film follows a pair of families (one black and one white) who live and work on a tenement farm circa 1940. The McAllan's (the white family) were swindled out of a quaint antebellum home and forced to live in a hobble without water or electricity. The Jackson's on the other hand have lived on the plantation for generations and have acclimated to the harsh work and conditions – so much so that family patriarch Hap (Morgan) optimistically hopes to buy his small plot of land right out. But with the specter of WWII threatening to take away eligible family members the downwardly mobile McAllans and the upwardly mobile Jacksons are put on a path towards conflict and mutual destruction.<br/><br/>The film begins with the two McAllan brothers Henry (Clarke) and Jamie (Hedlund), at the end of their revelations, burying their dead father (Banks) amid the grime and the mud. The Jackson's, pulling all their worldly possessions on a mule-drawn cart are stopped in their tracks and asked by Henry to help in the burial. They oblige, though it is obvious from the context that if Hap and the scorned, hurt Florence (Blige) had their way, they'd be spitting in that grave instead of performing the eulogy.<br/><br/>The film then flashes back; juggling its sprawling, melancholic tale with a jumble of voiceovers starting with Henry's wife Laura (Mulligan), ending with Hap's son Ronsel (Mitchell). But what stands out in Mudbound is not so much the tale (though it is well written and realized) but the tone. Gone are the ambitious romanticisms of Gone with the Wind (1939) as well as the blunt moralizing of Hurry Sundown (1967). Instead we're pulled straight through into the languishing muck - harsh living, sweltering heat, putrid racism that's soaked into the skin like salty brine. These are the things that exist in the world of Mudbound.<br/><br/>The racism in this film comes in multiple forms though thankfully never in the form of an anachronism or a simple attitude in need of correction. Some facets are overt such as when Pappy McAllan sneers at the prospect of sitting next to Hap in a beat-up truck. Other times, the racism is more mundane, more insidious such as when Laura feels entitled to beckon Florence the middle of a storm to take care of one of her sick children. The bigotry and the entitlement blanket the film like a rolling fog. It's not an attitude but a state of being, a purposeful social stratification that's based on fear, resentment and hatred.<br/><br/>Rather than pouring a few spoonfuls of sugar in her deliberately paced drama, Director Dee Rees forces the audience to commit to her interrogation of history. This is not an easy movie to watch, not because it's particularly harrowing but because it lets you stew in its internal anguish. We're transported to a place in time, feel the sweat beading down the characters' back, hear the grackles mock their efforts on the farm and undergo the hunger pangs of families in need.<br/><br/>To further the misery en scene, Rees and cinematographer Rachel Morrison composed the frame so the digital high contrasts would reveal every pockmark in the light while shrouding every edge in darkness. The result feels like a colored, restrained version of a Dorothea Lange photo: earthy tones, undeniable humanism and a sad dignity eroded by the baser instincts of Jim Crow.<br/><br/>It is only at the hour mark that we see divergent perspectives via boys coming home from war. The color saturation changes ever so slightly as Ronsel and Jamie start to form a bond based on their mutual war experiences. By then the inner voices of our various narrators gel in an achingly poetic marriage of mood and mission. We begin to think there is light after all – a grimacing stoicism to the things that cannot be changed and cautious optimism going the other direction. Sadly it doesn't last.<br/><br/>Mudbound does a lot of things right including casting, directing and book-to-film adaptation. But what it does best is instill in its audience a sense of perspective. Come to think of it, the events of the film only took place seventy short years ago give or take. And while it's a work of fiction, none of the elements of the story deviate from the cold, harsh truths of the time. The film frames, contextualizes and investigates with only the deepest of emotional truths. Perhaps Laura says it best when she opines, ""Beginnings are elusive things. Just when you think you have hold of one, you look back and see another, earlier beginning, and an earlier one before thatyou still have the problem of antecedents, of cause and effect."""
"ThomasDrufke","8","1","4","4 December 2017"," A Timeless Moment in Time
","The most disheartening thing about watching films revolve around slavery during the Civil War is that ultimately racism and discrimination didn't end when that war was over. In fact, they are still very prominent subjects in today's world. Which is why Mudbound works very well as a World War II period piece in the south. The same sort of racism and vastly unfair treatment people of color received back during slavery times happened during the civil rights era and are pretty much happening again now. All within varying degrees of severity, but still very much an issue in the public eye. The point being that Mudbound is a depressingly timeless story about two soldiers (one white, one black) coming home from World War II and not getting the best of welcomes from the townsmen and their opposing families.<br/><br/>Mudbound is one of those films that doesn't necessarily push the boundaries of historical fiction or even films based around inequality. However, it does provide an intriguing story about two people who form an unlikely bond, which is tested when racism floods their world in Mississippi. When the characters are written well, the direction is on point, and the performances are impeccably good, some of the minor issues can be swept under the rug.<br/><br/>Those performances include turns from Jason Clarke, Garrett Hedlund, Jason Mitchell, Carey Mulligan, Mary J. Blige, Rob Morgan, and Jonathan Banks. All of which are equally effective. I've always believed the best compliment you can give an actor is that they blend so much into their characters that you think you're watching a documentary where the people don't know they are being filmed. It almost felt like these were particular moments in these families lives and I was just there to witness things unfold. And to that point, I'm sure that a story this dark and this haunting happened, especially when you consider how secluded the families are to the rest of civilization being on a farm. Overall, Mudbound is a gritty, devastating, and most of all important film that is sure to be up for some awards this winter.<br/><br/>8.4/10"

"gerald-koh99","9","1","5","16 September 2018"," Deeply affecting and real look at prejudice, family and lowly members of society
","Mudbound is not a feel-good film filled with laughs or thrills, rather is defined by its somber tone and grim look at the lives of two families of farmers living in rural Mississippi during the WWII era, one white and one black. The lives of all the characters are impacted by war, trauma, prejudice, impoverishment and tragedy- all themes that ordinary people are able to relate to. So to witness these things play out in their lives, and see how it affects them and how they deal with it, makes for a fervently compelling and relatable story, even helping you empathise with people who are in similar situations. And ultimately, this is the greatest strength of the film; even though on the surface, the story seems to be mainly about the historical backdrop of World War II and the racial tensions of that era, it really is primarily a look those downtrodden, impoverished, lowly members in our society and the struggles that have to deal with. That is what makes this film so beautiful and moving, and it never comes across as preachy or formulaic. It goes beyond a typical historical drama, as the arc of this film never becomes overly entrapped in its historical setting or wallows too much in its anti-racism message.<br/><br/>The acting in this film, from every character, is top class. The cinematography and production design of this film is also gorgeous- the movie is a very good-looking one. And the script fleshes out the characters seamlessly, giving each character enough time and drawing out their backstories. The narrative manages to hold itself together well. Different aspects within the story- Laura and Henry's struggles within their marriage, the friendship forged between Jamie (a white man) and Ronsel (a black man), the sickening bigotry of the white family's patriarch- they all add different dimensions to the story so as to make it layered and multi-dimensional. The film seems to go slowly at moments but fortunately not too much to make it boring. I believe this is one of the best movies of 2017, and its a shame that this didn't get a Best Picture nomination when it certainly is superior to some of the ones that were nominated (such as Darkest Hour and The Post, which I feel are pretty formulaic historical dramas that lack Mudbound's cutting edge). It's a Netflix original, so for anyone on that site and hasn't watched this, I really recommend you check it out."

","I am born free, and we are all born free. Why do we form biases and why do we have to think ourselves superior than others because of the color of theirs and our skin, or because of having money and worldly possessions give some people a self-entitlement and think the lives of others don't matter? Sadly, slavery is a part of history and we can not hide the fact that even the present generation still bear some ignorance towards this subject. Set before the second world war in rural America, this is a film about two families, one White, the other black. Both families had sons who served and survived and coincidentally formed a friendship in a small town laden with folks who are members of the KKK. Needless to say, there are complications and later on a tragic event occurred . The opening scène is a flashback, the story unfolded then back to that moment of flashback crucial to the survival of those involved. Depressing and painful, but bear in mind, slavery is never a joking matter. Well acted and realistic shots, the viewer gets transported back in time. Sometimes dragging but worth watching."

","This is the kind of movie people who read books love. Although the plot spans less than 10 years, it has an epic feel. Family relationships, racism, poverty and combat trauma are intertwined in the story of two families and the Deep South culture in which they live in the early to mid 1940s. <br/><br/>A white land-owning family and a black tenant-farmer family are interdependent on each other, both poor, the black family only more so. Despite trauma and brutality (one scene is especially violent), the movie was not depressing. The reality of the dependence of farmers on the weather, the land and luck is a subtle theme in the background of this film about characters. The ironic experience of black soldiers who fought for a still-segregated home country returning to that culture is the films' dramatic crux. There are probably many historical lessons for younger people in this film."

","Saw 'Mudbound' due to being intrigued by the subject matter and the cast, being someone who is trying to see as many 2017 films as possible (particularly those that garnered Oscar nominations, in to me actually one of the better Oscar years in recent years) and who wanted to see if it lived up to the hype.<br/><br/>While not one of the best films of the year 'Mudbound' was still very impressive indeed, with a lot of emotional power and with so much deserving of being lauded highly, also really admired how it handled its brave themes. It is though an uneven film too which is a shame, and does suffer from its ambition getting the better of it so that at times it becomes over-ambitious.<br/><br/>Starting with 'Mudbound's' faults, it does get off to a somewhat erratically paced (both rushed and draggy) and meandering start where it can get confusing as to which direction it's going to go and where it's heading. <br/><br/>Also was distracted by the multiple-character voice-over, which tended to ramble and over-explain and could have done with being used less, particularly in parts where it wasn't really needed. <br/><br/>The script too is not without its rambling, repetitive and derivative parts. Overall, it is not a bad script by any stretch, but personally do question its Oscar nomination (the film's other nominees were deserved though) in an otherwise strong category where the right film ('Call Me By Your Name') won and one of not many questionable nominees this year (that last claim is not going to be a popular opinion though). <br/><br/>'Mudbound' however has pros that far outweigh the cons. It looks fantastic with some of the best cinematography of the year and dreamy and atmospheric landscapes and scenery. It is not often where mud is like a character of its own in a film, that is the case with 'Mudbound' and juxtaposes beautifully with the otherwise idyllic look. The music is hauntingly beautiful, and cannot get enough of ""Mighty River"", wonderfully performed by Mary J. Blige herself, my pick for the Oscar was between it and ""Remember Me"" from 'Coco', another song that resonated with me. <br/><br/>While the script is uneven, much of it is thought-provoking, well-meaning, affecting and sincere. Things really pick up in the story after a shaky start, especially in a sweeping second half that is truly powerful and poignant culminating in a shocking, gut-wrenching and emotionally devastating climax. Really admired how it explored and addressed the brave and sadly still relevant themes of poverty, racism and the aftermath of war and executing it in a way that was confident and just as ballsy and relevant. Have little to fault the direction either.<br/><br/>Other than the production values the other star is the superb acting, with Carey Mulligan giving her best performance since perhaps 'An Education' and was not expecting a performance as powerful and moving as the one Mary J. Blige gave. The film completely re-assessed my opinion of Garrett Hedlund, who was awful in 'Pan' but was absolutely brilliant here. Jason Mitchell is suitably controlled and can't fault Jonathan Banks and Jason Clarke either.<br/><br/>In conclusion, uneven and over-ambitious but very moving, superbly made and acted and brave. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","Dee Rees' adaptation of Hillary Jordan's novel tells the tale of two families (One white, one black) in WWII Mississippi. Garrett Hedlund Jason Clarke (as Henry)and Carey Mulligan (Laura) head a family who buys a farm, but, through a mistake end up not in the landowner's house, but on the farm. Mary J. Blige (Florence) and Rob Morgan (Hap) are the parents of a family who already lives and work on the farm.<br/><br/>While there is a cordial enough relationship between the families, there is no question as to who are the bosses. And, the day to day struggles to survive are brutal and difficult for both families. A deeper bond is shared between Henry's brother Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) and Ronsel (Jason Mitchell) - returning veterans from the war (we see them in battle). The segregation in the military is nothing compared to what they find back 'home'. Further complicating matters is that the Partiarch of the white family Pappy (Jonathan Banks) is as rabid a racist as any of the Mississippi locals.<br/><br/>In outline, MUDBOUND sounds like it plays as a relatively straightforward drama. But, Rees (and co-screenwriter Virgil Williams) use narration - and a lot of it - to structure their screenplay. And, the narration floats through several of the performers. Some of the passages certainly deepen our understanding of the characters but, too often, fall into Joe The Explainer mode. This not only clutters the proceedings, but keeps the viewer from fully investing themselves into reading one's own interpretation of the events. Further, it emphasizes the already episodic nature of the movie. The acting is, for the most part, excellent. Mulligan and Blige seem a bit removed at times (and Blige's sunglasses don't help). Banks (one of my fave character actors) is frighteningly chilling as the bigoted father, while Morgan brings a low key intensity to Hap. Mitchell and Hedlund strike up a warm friendship even it feels a bit too modern at times.<br/><br/>There is no doubting the power of the tragic climax and the gentle mercies of the epilogue. Still, MUDBOUND needed a stronger structure to overcome some of its more melodramatic passages. It's a solid production even it promised more.<br/><br/>P.S. Some controversy has been generated by its Netflix release. Pushed as an Awards contender, Netflix's decision to release the movie straight to streaming while giving it a same day very limited release (17 theaters - where I saw it) doesn't help create separation from what feels like a TV production (it was independently produced as a feature). Ironically, MUDBOUND may have worked better had it been a Netflix mini-series, where the episodic nature could have been better fleshed out."

Racism is an act of cruelty & inhumanity & IT MUST be condemned to this day, be it threw movies, books, speeches or protests, it needs to end.<br/><br/>Dee Rees & Virgil Williams' Oscar-Nominated Adapted Screenplay (based on the novel of the same name by Hillary Jordan) offers some powerful moments as well as a truly harrowing end, but it also fumbles in parts. The sub-plots aren't very impressive & the first-hour, in particular, lacks aim. Its only when the war-heroes return, is when 'Mudbound' takes flight, before that, its a slow-moving slog that's headed to nowhere. Dee Rees' Direction is impressive, though. Rachel Morrison's Cinematography is the highpoint of 'Mudbound'. Morrison, the first woman ever Nominated for Best Cinematography in Oscar History, gives us visual poetry. Each & Every Frame of 'Mudbound' has a story to say. Her work is simply flawless! Mako Kamitsuna's Editing is also nicely done.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Carey Mulligan, Garrett Hedlund, Jason Clarke, Jason Mitchell, and Mary J. Blige, all are in top-form. Mulligan is extraordinary as a woman torn apart between two men, delivering a richly realized performance from start to end. Hedlund is excellent as a War-Hero who returns home unsettled. Clarke does a fine job too as a man who dedicates his life to his family. Mitchell is wonderfully controlled, also as a war-hero, whose return to his hometown reminds him the color of his skin & his limitations in life. J. Blige, in an Oscar-Nominated Performance, uses her eyes to convey an array of emotions. The rest lend very good support.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Mudbound' isn't entirely compelling, but when it works, it really does."

"lasttimeisaw","8","1","6","7 February 2018"," MUDBOUND officially establishes Dee Rees as an unstoppable force to be reckoned with
","Topical epithets like ""African-American"", ""female"", ""lesbian"" can immediately boost filmmaker Dee Rees as a shoo-in of any awards consideration to validate the industry's all-inclusivity dedication, but when MUDBOUND, her stirring second feature, misses both BEST PICTURE and BEST DIRECTOR nominations in the Oscar race, we can impute it to its bad luck, but never to the movie's artistry, as both Jordan Peele and Greta Gerwig overshadow her with the same politically correct cards (race/gender) in the directorial category, and labelled as a Netflix movie, the film may have reached more audience but is also predisposed to be brushed aside by the old guards among the Academy members on the strength of safeguarding silver-screen's sacrosanct purity, albeit changing of the form is inexorable. <br/><br/>Located in Mississippi during the 1940s, MUDBOUND traces relations between two families, the McAllans, two brothers Henry (Clarke) and Jamie (Hedlund), with Henry's wife Laura (Mulligan), their two young daughters and the brothers' father Pappy (Banks), who own a farm and the Jacksons, headed by Hap (Morgan), their tenant farmer, with wife Florence (J. Blige) and a brood of four. Both Jamie and Ronsel (Mitchell), Jackson's eldest son are recruited in the army to fight Nazis, the former is a bomber pilot and the latter on the ground, commands a tank in the Continent. It is their experiences in the war that brings them closer, after both are lucky enough to return home alive and kicking but find themselves beset by PTSD and wanting an aim in their post-war existence, their camaraderie will be tested in a nefarious lynch mob commotion in the climax, but salvation is well-earned with Dee Rees' conscientious endeavor, not least in her sterling aptitude of honing up an arresting narrative: horror and anguish are produced with frenetic editing in the under-lit condition, but never overstay their welcome, tendresse and pathos are dished out in apposite quotient without ever overstating their connotations. <br/><br/>Told intermittently through 6 main characters' voice-overs, this tack refreshingly fleshes out each player to constitute a fantastic ensemble, every adult in the McAllans, represents one particular mindset towards the entrenched racism, from Pappy's Ku Klux Klan-infused abomination, Banks, who can chill you to the bone with just a glance, is one's worst nightmare in living embodiment, which should be taken as a sincere compliment; to Henry's matter-of-fact treatment and congenital superiority, being considerably less unbearable makes it a more insidious barrier to overtake; then there is Laura's moderate kindness and Jamie's genuine friendship, which regrettably are not out of sheer truism or sense of justice, but on the condition of reciprocation (Florence tends to Laura's daughters when they are sick, and Jamie's life is saved by a black fellow pilot), this faintly retrograde narrow-mindedness has become this reviewer's pet peeve whenever racism is tackled in a fictitious creation. <br/><br/>Among its dramatis personae, R&B diva Mary J. Blige is the sole recipient of an Oscar nomination, her portrayal of Florence is palpably nuanced, composedly resilient and utterly lifelike (her proficiency of dispatching a rooster is very under-praised), not to mention with a puissant theme song MIGHT RIVER to render addition empathy during the closing credits (a double Oscar nominee this year). Carey Mulligan, on the other hand, is unfairly overlooked with her pitch-perfect incarnation of a neglected wife who is mired in a hopeless situation (her husband doesn't even ask her opinion about their life-changing relocation), not just by debasing her appearance, Laura is ""mud-bound"" in the most literal way (ablutions conduces to her unsatisfied desire and liberation), like many women, she seizes her marriage as an escape of her spinsterhood, and has to live with the consequence to the boiling point, that incestuous impulse, it is not an easily legible role but Mulligan glows with assurance and true grit. <br/><br/>On the masculine front, Jason Mitchell is the unequivocal one who rallies our sympathy and investment, which he runs way with in steadfast strides. Rob Morgan, also rounds out with a memorable impression as the undeterred paterfamilias, sticking to his guns within sagacious boundaries, as for Garrett Hedlund, who is tasked with the most thrilling retaliation in the form of patricide, is much as good as you want him to be, which leaves Jason Clarke takes the short end of the stick with a less showier part. <br/><br/>It will be a great remiss to not mention that DP Rachel Morrison has become the first ever female Oscar nominee in that branch owing to her finesse of designing its period-saturated, umber-hued landscape, and grabbing 4 tickets to the Kodak theater, odds are not exactly favorable to MUDBOUND, but at the very least it competently establishes Dee Rees as an unstoppable force to be reckoned with, and spearheads a belatedly surge of (black) female filmmakers on the horizon."
"iNickR","8","1","6","6 February 2018"," Friendship Bound In Mud
","Mudbound, in short, is the story of two men, strangers from the same small Mississippi town, who return from WWII and find that things haven't changed much since they left.<br/><br/>Still interested? Read on. Ronsel (Jason Mitchell) is black, and a former Army sergeant who fought under General Patton on the front lines. Ronsel was respected, not only by his fellow soldiers but by the various communities in Europe he helped liberate. Jamie (Garrett Hedlund) is white, and a former captain in the Air Force who flew bombing missions over Germany. He too was respected by nearly everyone, but his own Pappy (Jonathan Banks), your typical racist, crusty old man.<br/><br/>Post war, Ronsel and Jamie return to a poor, muddy community they called home prior to WWII. Ronsel goes back to living with his mid-wife mother, Florence (Mary J. Blige), his father, Hap (Rob Morgan), and his brothers and sisters. Hap farms the land he lives on, and rents from, Jamie's brother, Henry (Jason Clarke). Jamie moves in with his brother Henry, his wife Laura (Carey Mulligan) and the racist old b****r, Pappy.<br/><br/>Ronsel and Jamie, though strangers before and during the war, eventually meet (as strangers in a small town usually do) and bond over their mutual military background. Raised by a racist father, Jamie is anything but and is willing to risk breaking rules and laws to protect his new friend Ronsel. As the two men soon find out, war heroes or not, their friendship is not welcome in 1945 Mississippi.<br/><br/>Mudbound, IMHO, is about a lot more than just what I wrote above but I really don't want to rehash everything everyone has already said. I'm not a critic, I'm just a fan of movies. I like that it is told from the perspective of more than one person. I like that the oppressed fight back. I like that I felt anger, happiness and sadness in all the right places, that's what a good movie is supposed to do to the viewer. I like that it's not predictable, even up to the very end I was surprised.<br/><br/>I like the cinematography. It's beautifully shot, something that's quite difficult when one's set is hatred, poverty and despair. I like that Rachel Morrison is responsible for that and she's being recognized by an Academy that has always ignored female DP's. I like the script (based on a novel), and the directing. This movie is watchable more than once."
"lee_eisenberg","10","1","6","6 February 2018"," the serious ""Hurry Sundown""
","When I heard that ""Mudbound"" is about a white family and black family that befriend each other in the south in the 1940s, I thought that it sounded similar to Otto Preminger's notorious ""Hurry Sundown"". Well, this is more like the serious version of the story. The main point that it makes is that the poor black family and poor white family have more in common with each other than they realize. The issue of race remains every prominent, namely how the blacks serving in the armed forces get treated as heroes, but once they return home they get treated as subhuman.<br/><br/>The title can refer to the actual mud on the land where the families live, or to an impediment, or to a feeling of unity between the families. But no matter what happens, the McAllans and Jacksons will have to support each other, although the McAllans will have an advantage thanks to their skin color.<br/><br/>It's a fine piece of work in every way. Mary J. Blige is particularly impressive in the role of the black mother, a woman trying to keep her family together amid all sorts of tragedies (she's received an Oscar nod for the performance, as well as the movie's song). This movie and ""Stranger Things"" show that Netflix is turning out some good work. I recommend it."

","There's a beautiful grunginess in this WWII movie, full of muddy visuals and muddier characters, about a black soldier and a white soldier returning to their hierarchical hometown. Unfortunately, it spends way too much of its runtime reaching past that central narrative into things that aren't pertinent. Nonetheless, it looks great and the performances are on point...and the last 20 minutes really put the previous 2 hours in a proper light."

""The Dirt Line"" digs up the painful dirt of the apartheid era and breaks the boundaries of our fixed thinking, showing us not only the divisions and contradictions that lie beneath the dirt, but also the struggles of humanity. The text of the play is not perfect, it still has defects. But it has to be said that several of the actors in ""Dirt"" give excellent performances.

","It's been 2 years since I watched this movie and the impression remains. It views like a Steinbeck reads, epic. The land rules the tale with beautiful cinematography; the facts of life (the struggle) is depicted harshly but very really in this rural world. With a perfect balance of performances, where it'd be easy for the men to be stereotypes of bitter hicks or victims, the pairing of superbly human performances by the ladies, Mulligan and Blige put the entire narrative grounded in a muddy reality where every character's actions are understood as it's motivated by the maintenance of their lifeline, their land. They are working constantly, drudge drudge drudge, and the relentlessness of these women balance the actions of the men who also drudge along but in the sticky heat let racial tensions and greed surmount, driving the plot. This movie will provide fodder to any conversation of social justice and American History. A must watch in the cannon of truly gritty Americana (think No Country for Old Men)"
"Andres-Camara","6","0","6","6 February 2018"," Too much voice in off
","I'm watching this movie and I do not think it's a bad movie. The problem is that to me, personally, the voiceover takes me out of the movies. Normally the voice in off is of the protagonist, who tells you his story. The director does not know how to tell it and he does so, which in itself is bad. In this case, it is not that there is a narrator, it is that there are several, which brings me out of the whole, it is not decided by a path but it takes several roads, nothing ends.<br/><br/>We see another film of this fashion that has come to make anti-racist movies that of course will be nominated to the Oscars for that very reason. For me, this film would not have to be nominated. It's not a bad movie, but it's not good enough to be nominated, if it's not a year that we've had.<br/><br/>The actors are fine, in general they are all credible. Otherwise the film would not stand.<br/><br/>It is well set. You think you are at that moment in that place. Makeup and hairdressing help a lot.<br/><br/>Photography when it is night, it is too dark. You do not see anything By day it's pretty good. And in the interiors too. Join the story.<br/><br/>The director for my taste, does not get to do it well. He does not know with what story to stay. He does not know how to put the camera most of the time, he agrees to make simple plans. But when there is a sequence of action, it escapes from your hands, I explain it in the spoiler zone. It does not get boring, but if the voice tones off.<br/><br/>It's a movie that I do not think anyone remembers in a while.<br/><br/>Spoiler:<br/><br/>When the kkk acts, the director does not know at any time how to direct it. You do not know what happens in no time. You have to wait until the end to see what happened. I do not think he does it because he does not show and not bother, but because he does not know where to put the camera.<br/><br/>If there is a moment that makes me happy. When the woman sleeps with the brother-in-law. While it is wrong, I think it will be the only pleasant time in your life with a man."
"bankofmarquis","7","0","3","5 February 2018"," Interesting...with long stretches of ""nothing""
","One of the reasons that I seek out the films that are nominated in the major Oscar categories, is that it drives me to see films that I, otherwise, probably would not be seeking out.<br/><br/>Such is the case with MUDBOUND, not because it is not a film I'm interested in, it is because it is a NETFLIX film that had a short theatrical run to qualify for the Oscars. With all the films that are available to stream on Netflix, I'm afraid MUDBOUND has gotten lost in the shuffle. I am glad, then, that the OSCAR nomination for Mary J. Blige (Best Supporting Actress) brought this film to the top of my Netflix queue - for it is worthwhile to see.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Hillary Jordan, MUDBOUND follows two sets of sharecropping families (one white, one black) in Mississippi in the 1940's. This film follows their trials and tribulations through weather disasters, illness and injury. When World War II starts, 1 male from each family goes off to fight as brothers-in-arms, when they return, enlightened, they encounter a still unenlightened Mississippi.<br/><br/>Directed by Dee Rees from a screenplay written by her and Virgil Williams, this film is earnest in it's intentions, beautifully shot, well acted and doesn't flinch in the face of violence and racism that is depicted. There are long, lovely shots and long, well acted scenes with long stretches of silence as the characters take in what is going on around them.<br/><br/>Did I mention that this film is long? Clocking in at 134 minutes, it certainly shouldn't feel long, but it feels much, much longer than it's running time. And that's the trouble. Watching it on Netflix, I frequently found myself distracted by things around me (my phone, my kids, the laundry, getting a snack, shuffling in my chair) all signs of non-attention (read: boredom) on my part. I think if I was in a movie theater I would have forced myself to be more attentive to the stretches of long scenes where nothing really happens.<br/><br/>And that's too bad, for there is a fine (important) story and some really good acting going on in this film. Garret Hedlund and Jason Mitchell were terrific as the two young men who go off to war and then come back to Mississippi. Both have demons to conquer and obstacles to overcome - and they portray it well. Jason Clarke, Carey Mulligan, Jonathan Banks and Rob Morgan were all strong as well. And then there is the Oscar nominated turn by Mary J. Blige. She exudes quiet dignity as the matriarch of the African-American family and (as I said) her nomination was what drew me to this film - which is good. But...I kept waiting for the ""Academy Award"" scene by her and it just wasn't there. Don't get me wrong, she is VERY good in this film...but Academy Award worthy? I just don't see it.<br/><br/>If you get a chance, I would encourage you to see MUDBOUND, just barricade yourself away from distractions, you're going to need it.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B<br/><br/>7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

","I cannot deny that the movie ""Mudbound"" is a sentimental and thought-provoking period drama. But at the same time, I have to point out that the buildup, or the first act is really overlong, lasting for more than an hour. The central figures in the film are Jamie and Ronsel, who served in the US military and are against racism. But their story only starts after the one hour mark, at which point the audience get bored and tired. The film would be much improved if the buildup were shortened."
"sddavis63","5","0","5","16 December 2017"," After A Tedious First Hour This Movie Finally Get Going
","I have to admit that ""Mudbound"" almost lost me during its first hour. The story sounded good - an account of two farm families (one black, the Jacksons; one white, the McAllans) dealing with racism and various other challenges during and immediately after World War II. The McAllans owned the farm and the Jacksons were sharecroppers. But to be blunt that first hour or so was pretty dull. There didn't seem to be a great deal of tension between the two families. Yes, the Jacksons wanted off the farm - and the reality of the sharecropper system (that basically the sharecropper could never earn enough to pay off their debt so that they could never leave) was pointed out. But what we basically saw was the everyday life of the two families. There wasn't really any drama involved with it. The movie seemed to jump back and forth. Eventually, Japan attacks Pearl Harbor, and Ronsel Jackson and Jaime McAllan join up. Ronsel becomes a tank commander and Jaime a bomber pilot. So in addition to various scenes from the families' home life, we sometimes cut to war scenes. But none of it seemed well connected; the movie didn't seem to be going in any particular direction. It portrayed everyday life - at peace and at war - and everyday life just isn't really that exciting, I'm sad to say. It was rather tedious.<br/><br/>The movie does take a sudden turn for the better in the second half though. Ronsel and Jaime return home - and they're changed. The shared experience of war (even though they weren't together in Europe) has broken down a lot of barriers, and they become friends. But Ronsel - having experienced a more racially friendly atmosphere in Europe - has trouble adjusting to the racial realities of the American south, and Jaime just has trouble getting his feet back on to the ground, so to speak. He's traumatized by some of his war experiences, begins drinking - and over it all is his father, who is a completely unpleasant character; a racist who demeans Jaime's war experience. As Ronsel and Jaime become closer you know there's trouble coming, and eventually it arrives, and a movie that had been muddled and tedious all of a sudden becomes focused and riveting.<br/><br/>Ronsel is involved in a racist confrontation with Jaime's father almost immediately upon returning home. He might be returning home in uniform as a sergeant after serving his country, but in the south he's still a - well, insert the ""n"" word, which - be aware - is liberally (but appropriately given the historical setting) used in this movie. Everything leads to a very brutal scene involving the KKK (and an ultimate confrontation between Jaime and his father) but without giving much away let's just say that the KKK scene could have let the movie end on a very sombre note, but instead the movie ends on an incredibly beautiful and hopeful note. <br/><br/>""Mudbound"" almost seems to be two completely different movies - one very good; the other - well, not so much. Throw them together and I have to give this a 5/10."
