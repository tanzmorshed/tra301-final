"moonspinner55","8","100","117","28 September 2002"," Has a crazy rhythm all its own
","It may take two or three viewings to warm up to ""Beetlejuice"". It has a kooky, cockeyed sensibility and a rhythm that is by turns easy, lazy and frenetic. A charming couple in New England die and come back to their beloved home as ghosts, determined to rid the place of the horrendous new tenants. Possibly the most benign and engaging performance ever by Alec Baldwin; Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Sylvia Sidney are also very appealing. The new couple from New York who take over the house (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) aren't as well written or thought-out as the other characters and some of their bemused, dry-ice comic lines take a few seconds to reach you. Of course, there's Michael Keaton, wildly comic as Betelgeuse. I recall hearing comments back in 1988 that Keaton wasn't around enough to make the picture worthwhile, but that's only if you watch the film for the fast quips and sight-gags. Keaton is truly wonderful, but he's also bombastic, and I felt there was just enough of him to satisfy--it's really not his story anyway, it belongs to Baldwin and Davis; Betelgeuse is used as a horny, vulgar punchline. Director Tim Burton is very careful not to overload the movie with raunch; he is surprisingly careful in setting up this story, and he works magic within a dubious scenario: a comic fantasy about dead folks which ultimately celebrates life. ***1/2 from ****"

","Once again I'm not sure exactly how to start this comment other than to praise Tim Burton, Beetlejuice is a movie that was based on his idea and is still remembered to this very day. He picked a great leading male, Michael Keaton as well as to pick a very strong cast that turned into what could have been a total flop into a cult classic that will be remembered for ages to come. Beetlejuice is a very strange movie that explores life after death, turning into a ghost and having to accept that you died, now move on. But what if there was one ghost who maybe had too much fun and just wanted to rock the living world? That's what Beetlejuice is about, the one zombie that you'd love to party with once but then ignore at the next party he's invited too.<br/><br/>Barbara and Adam Maitland decide to spend their vacation decorating their idyllic New England country home. Upon returning from the trip to town, however, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog wandering the roadway. The couple's vehicle crashes through a covered bridge and plunges into the river below, killing Barbara and Adam. The couple soon returns home in spirit form and quickly come to the conclusion that they are dead. A book entitled Handbook for the Recently Deceased confirms the couple's suspicion that they are, in fact, dead. Barbara and Adam's peace is soon shattered when their house is sold and the new residents arrive from New York City. Charles Deetz, aspiring sculptor and Charles' second wife Delia, and Charles' goth daughter Lydia from his first marriage, move into the home. Juno, who informs Barbara and Adam that they must remain in the house for 125 years. If they want the Deetzes out, it is up to them to scare them away. Although the Maitlands remain invisible to Charles and Delia, their daughter Lydia can see Adam and Barbara and becomes their friend. Against the advice of Juno, the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse, a freelance ""bio-exorcist"", to scare away the Deetzes, but they have their hands full now with this crazy psycho.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is an awesome movie, it's one of the funniest movies you'll see. I will be honest, it's a strange humor as it's a dark comedy, but it's all good. Seriously Michael Keaton is such a great comedic actor, he was the perfect choice, he brought the right amount of cockiness and comedy to the role. Also Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin had great chemistry as well as the perfect Leave it to Beaver-esquire type of couple that has a hard time accepting their world as the afterlife. Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder were perfect as the Deetzes, quite disturbing and awkward. I highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, it's a great comedy classic.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Quinoa1984","10","89","113","27 September 2000"," AND IT KEEPS GETTING FUNNIER, EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE IT! (that's not just a quote)
","This is one of Tim Burton's best films. His sophomore effort shows the story of a married couple (the Maitlands played with good degree by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who die accidentally off a bridge and wind up the target for a upper-class family (including a young yet well played Winona Ryder) and a weird yet scary ghost (with the most) named Beetleguise (or Beetlejuice in a scene of laughs) played to immense complexity by Michael Keaton. Sure this plot may sound a little anti-climactic being mainly gags and not really a focused story, but so what? In a film where you see sandworms from saturn, shrimps that attach after calypso and a nut who has seen the exorcist 167 time (insert quote here), why bother with a plot. Great fun every time I watch. Reccomendable to anyone."
"lee_eisenberg","10","82","105","20 September 2005"," Now this is life after death!
","You gotta figure that only Tim Burton could come up with this! An ultra-zany story of rural couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis), who accidentally get killed and witness a tasteless couple moving into their house, forcing them to hire ""bio-exorcist"" Beetle Juice (Michael Keaton), is truly something else. With a new joke almost every minute, the movie never gets dull. And how about that soundtrack? ""Day-O"" in the most morbid comedy ever? Yep, it's all here. Great support from Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones as the tasteless couple, Winona Ryder as their disaffected daughter Lydia, and Sylvia Sidney as afterlife counselor Juno, make this one of the coolest movies of 1988!"
"Infofreak","Null","104","139","7 December 2001"," Burton's true masterpiece, and one of the ten best 80s movies.
","Watching this one more time on TV yesterday reminded me of the first time I saw it all those years ago at the movies when Tim Burton was just the guy who had directed that funny Pee-wee Herman movie. Walking into 'Beetlejuice' then, without knowing anything about it, was an amazing experience. Along with 'Blade Runner', 'Blue Velvet', 'Videodrome', 'Brazil', 'Paris, Texas', 'The Terminator' and 'Repo Man' it was one of the most astonishing and memorable  movies of the 1980s, an era dominated by Hollywood dreck like 'Flashdance', 'Top Gun', and 'Footloose'. The whole Bruckheimer/Simpson/Spielberg/Hughes zeitgeist that dumbed down popular movies as never before. Movies like 'Beetlejuice' were a glimmer of hope in a truly awful period.<br/><br/>The big question is - how does it stand up today? The answer is better than ever! In fact I would argue that 'Beetlejuice' is Tim Burton's most successful and least compromised film. Everything about it is perfect. A great cast lead by the very appealing and likable Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the newly dead Maitlands, a star turn by Michael Keaton as the gonzo ""bio-exorcist"" title character, and strong support from Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and especially Winona Ryder (a performance that really put her on the map), as the new occupants of the Maitlands house. 'Beetlejuice' juggles gruesome, trippy and genuinely witty sequences, and ends up becoming one of the freshest and surreal movies to find a mainstream audience since the heyday of 60s/70s ""head"" movies. Forget Burton's more recent hit and miss big budget efforts, and try this for the real deal, Luis Bunuel meets Tex Avery meets George Romero, and then some! 'Beetlejuice' is a blast!"
"AvinashPatalay","Null","50","70","21 April 2005"," Creativity at its best
","With ghosts and the dead, one would normally anticipate a horror movie loaded with screams and gory figures. But in Beetlejuice, we see a new dimension humour being experimented with.<br/><br/>Taking into the account that the movie was made in 1988 with limited special effects, Beetlejuice could be simply labelled as ""creativity at its best"".<br/><br/>Tim Burton is a pure visionary and with this movie you cannot help but appreciate the amount of creativity he has and his ability to translate it to screen.<br/><br/>Acting is top-rate from all fronts. One can't help but admire promising young Winona Ryder - a flower ready to bloom.<br/><br/>It would take a couple of viewings to be appreciate the movie in totality."
"ccthemovieman-1","Null","35","52","24 June 2006"," Unique Characters & Story, To Say The Least
","This movie always was: 1 - very popular; 2 - very different; 3 - very entertaining; 4 - a very fast-moving hour-and-a-half of a film.<br/><br/>Several characters in here - mainly Michael Keaton's unique and sometimes- revolting title character ""Beetlejuice""- are always fascinating to watch. With him - and the whole movie - you also get a lot of humor and scary special-effects..<br/><br/>It was odd to see Alec Baldwin in such a low-key role. In the '90s, he played very few of these type of guys. Davis looks and acts like...well, Davis, who has almost always played nice, cute people that viewers like. It took me four viewings before I finally appreciated Catharine O'Hara's comedic talents in this movie. Now, she's my favorite and someone I find absolutely hilarious as the messed-up wife/mother of a family who moves into a ""haunted house"" inhabited by Baldwin and Davis.<br/><br/>Keaton made himself a name as an actor with this whacked-out Robin Williams-type role, although he never really followed up with anything that was as popular as this film. Winona Rider is cute as the teenage daughter and we get other fun supporting roles from diverse people as talk show host Dick Cavett, singer Robert Goulet and actor Jeffrey Jones. All of them are good.<br/><br/>Tim Burton directed the film and so I wasn't surprised there were the typical occult themes with ghosts and the like, and no heaven or hell but some other strange existence being touted where dead people go....a ridiculous picture of the afterlife. However, I just chalk it up to someone just trying to make a fun, entertaining picture and on that, it succeeds.<br/><br/>Overall, a unique and entertaining film. It's different, to say the least!"
"denis888","10","13","18","21 June 2014"," A Bit Dated But Still Awesome
","Many older movies date not so gracefully, and when you watch them after awhile, crappy video effects, or bad montage and cutting are so obvious that the whole movie turns sour or very silly. Beetlejuice aged gracefully, thanks to a huge injection of healthy humor, spellbinding star cast, excellent calypso songs, awesome plot and very cynical twists in the story. You saw it, you know it. What else can be added to this great film? Winona Ryder is very cool choice here, she is dark, moody and way way out there, but her deep sense of humor helps her get through all the initial sadness. Great work by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin also add much to the whole crazy vertigo of gags, jokes and laughs. Good camera work also helps, and even old-fashioned video effects do not spoil the party and do not steal the infectious joyousness of the story. Highly recommended"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I revisited this film for a specific project. IMDB comment-writing has given me an excuse to resee and think about what films were important (or good in some way) and why. Now after almost two years, I'm developing a list of filmmakers and a few actors worth following. Should Tim Burton be on the list?<br/><br/>Tim has at least one rare quality of an effective filmmaker: he has the ability to shape some critical mass of the elements of his work to adhere to a coherent vision. A Burton film is pretty recognizable. But have any of his films struck me in a particularly strong way? Have any been life-altering (some by others have) or even remembered particularly fondly? The strongest candidate was this one. It is also of passing interest for Geena and Winona history.<br/><br/>There are only two things in this film to recommend it: Keaton's slapstick performance. But his three or four frenetic appearances alone are not enough to justify sitting front of the screen. The other element is remarkable: Efman's score. Our old Boingo man I think has literally helped Burton define himself, so the sonic texture here is more than perfect.<br/><br/>Burton does not go on my list of greats. But I think I'll start a list of film score composers.<br/><br/>A remark on the architecture. I have a special interest in how films handle space, and a part of that is the architecture. What Otho supposedly did to the outside of the house is pretty good actually, very apt for the notion of the film itself: what you see is some distance removed from reality."
"MeMyselfAndTheBeard","8","4","5","10 April 2020"," Keaton the ghost with the most.
","Considering he's not in the film that much and the film is named after his character he steals the whole show when he appears front and centre. He is so good you're amazed by him I wouldn't be surprised if Jim Carrey didnt use Michael Keaton's performance as Beetlejuice as a template for his fantastical cartoon character Stanley Ipkiss in the The Mask.
Love the B Movie special fx and the Shake Senora dance scene.
Little peave though was Betelgeuse/Beetlejuice dilemma. Wish they explained it a bit better thought I was having a dyslexic turn kept checking after all these years in was reading the name of the film wrong, kept stopping the film to check the title. The only downfall.
All in all funny and out there film. I'd just watch it for Keaton's performance."
"Qanqor","6","19","37","12 July 2009"," Okay.
","This is one of the best Tim Burton movies I've ever seen!<br/><br/>But that's not saying much, since I despise Tim Burton. In fact, I didn't actually *know* this was a Tim Burton film, and when I popped it in my DVD player and saw his name on the opening credits, I nearly threw up a little into my mouth. I seriously considered turning the thing off right then and there, because I had already vowed never to see another Burton film.<br/><br/>But I'd heard a lot of good things about this movie, so I decided to give it a chance.<br/><br/>And in truth, I'm kind of glad I did, because it wasn't too bad. The premise was interesting and original. It was certainly a *different* take on the afterlife, and it definitely had me at times thinking ""What would I do in this situation?"" Which is a good thing. I liked the protagonist couple and was rooting for them. Also a good thing.<br/><br/>But in typical Burton fashion, it ends up trading coherence for oddity. This occurs as soon as the title character comes in. Betelgeuse the character makes no sense. His motivations, his situation, what it exactly *means* to say his name three times, none of this ever really makes sense in any coherent, consistent way. And Burton obviously doesn't care. He just wants to make things weird and over-the-top. So in the end, the plot really degrades into making no sense and going nowhere. How exactly is Betelgeuse apparently trapped in the model? No explanation offered. Why do the ghosts suddenly turn all old and dried up during the séance? No reason offered. It just makes things weird and over the top. What would have happened if the good guys *had* managed to say his name thrice during the wedding scene? No clue, Burton can't be bothered to think through his premise in any consistent way.<br/><br/>The result is a flashy, busy, climax, full of sound and fury and signifying NOTHING. In a movie where the whole plot was set up to be about a ghost couple trying to drive the living out of their house, the climax ends up being about stopping this *other* ghost from marrying one of the living. The plot has Officially Gone Nowhere.<br/><br/>And it's a shame, really, because this started out being a pretty good movie, and really could've been much, much better than it was. Step one would've been entirely removing Betelgeuse from Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>Jeez, they couldn't even manage to spell the title correctly."
"sblair80","8","5","7","17 December 2007"," Great Dark Comedy
","This is a classic example of Tim Burton's macabre humor and fantastic mind. Beetlejuice puts you into a world where both the ""Living and the Dead"" come together. The Maitland's (Baldwin and Davis) are a happy married couple living in a sleepy Conneticut town and who are getting nestled in for their vacation together at home. The peace and quiet comes to a tragic end when they meet their deaths in a car accident. Now as ghosts, they witness their beloved home being taken over buy New York yuppies and make an unlikely alliance with the families daughter (Ryder). To make sense of what to do in the after life, the Maitland's look to seek the aid of Beetlejuice! The ""Ghost with the Most"". From there, everything turns into a hilarious and horrific adventure where Micheal Keaton shines with his comedic talents. This movie is a must for any horror and comedy fan, and a no brainier for Tim Burton fans out there."
"BA_Harrison","4","13","26","22 December 2013"," This film's popularity perplexes me.
","When their attempts to scare away the obnoxious new owners of their home prove less than successful, recently deceased couple Barbara and Adam Maitland (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) turn to outrageous 'bio-exorcist' Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) for help.<br/><br/>They played Harry Belafonte's 'Jump in the Line (Shake, Senora)' at my work's Xmas 'do' this year, which made me realise that it's been a whopping 25 years since I last saw Beetlejuice (as well as making me painfully aware that dancing the conga when sober isn't anywhere near as much fun as it is while plastered—next year, I drink!). Sadly, a quarter of a century later, the film isn't anywhere near as much fun as I remembered it to be <br/><br/>There are plenty of creative ideas and director Tim Burton's morbid style is much in evidence, but the film as a whole proves to be far less than the sum of its parts—a series of quirky, macabre, but not very funny gags with little in the way of a decent story to tie it all together. Keaton is also rather irritating as the 'ghost with the most'; thankfully he gets precious little screen-time (despite the film being named after his character), but Winona Ryder, an actress that I simply cannot abide, is sadly present throughout."
"NateWatchesCoolMovies","10","6","10","26 October 2015"," Loony surrealist classic!
","Tim Burton's Beetlejuice was not marketed as a surrealist film when it came out, and as such no one remembers it for the batshit crazy journey into the absurd that it treats you to. It's touted as a slightly subversive, yet also vaguely family friendly ghost romp, and yes, that's the jist of it, yet hidden beneath the lines that people can read between if they are keen enough, is a completely organic stream of nonsensical, almost dreamlike events, threaded together by a shaky theme of life after death. Michael Keaton portrays rambunctious zombie bio exorcist Betelgeuse in a face smacking, loony toon of a performance that's the best of his interesting and varied career. He's a whackjob wonder, a perverted pile of silliness with a mean streak a mile long and a penchant for all kinds of bizarre paranormal mischief. He's called to action when a quaint, naive New England couple (gorgeous Geena Davis and an oh so young Alec Baldwin) perish in an auto accident and are looking to rid their home of its insufferable new inhabitants. They arrive in the form of gag inducing trendy NYC interior designer Otho (Glenn Shadix RIP) who acts like he walked right out of a satirical episode of South Park), Charles (Jeffrey Jones the lovable bugger) and Delia Deetz (a spastic Catherine O Hara) and their cutie daughter Lydia (an emo Winona Ryder, one of my first movie crushes ♡♡). They walk right in like they own the place (well.. they kinda do) with dastardly plans to remodel it to their eyebrow raising yuppie fashion fanaticism. Baldwin and Davis see no other option but to summon Keaton, by saying his odd name three times. After that, all bets are off as Betelgeuse leers right out of the astral plane to cause no end of trouble for literally everyone, including himself. Keaton soars like he hasn't since then, giving a performance that makes the Joker, the Mask and Bugs Bunny seem like introverts. There's a constant cascade of phenomenal practical effects and gooey makeup on display, as well. When Davis and Baldwin venture into the afterlife beyond their home into the cluttered bureaucracy of the spirit world, we're treated to all sorts of sights, sounds and an out of this world creative aesthetic that honestly seems like Burton entered someone's dreams on the night before Halloween and pulled out all kinds of wonder for the viewer to behold. From a DMV like waiting room for deceased souls, to a football team that doesn't realize they're dead yet, to a massive snake with Keaton's ugly mug on the end of it, there's just no stop to the jaw dropping spectacle on display. Sylvia Sydney is dryly hilarious as an otherworld-weary afterlife caseworker, and there's fun bits from Robert Goulet, Dick Cavett and more as well. For something truly unexpected, endlessly creative and undefinable, check it out. Although I assume that anyone reading this has at least seen this five times, if not more. I've lost count."
"pfgpowell-1","6","13","27","9 April 2009"," Am I missing something? Because . . .
","Beetlejuice is one of those films you feel guilty about not liking more. Sounds daft, I know, but it's a bit like not liking as much an aunt everyone else insists is a real sweetie, but with the best will in the world you just can't see it. I mean, Beetlejuice is by Tim Burton, right, and an early masterpiece, right; and Michael Keaton in the title role, delivers a barnstorming performance, right; and it's full of examples of Tim Burton's celebrated off-the-wall, wacky humour right, with loads of imaginative special effects, right. And anyway, everyone, and I mean everyone thinks it's really, really good and really, really cool and just, you know, brilliant, I mean really, really brilliant, right. So if you disagree and, you know, you don't get it, it's your problem, man, because everyone else thinks it's really, really cool and really, really brilliant. But unfortunately I don't think it is really, really good and really, really brilliant. The real problem is that I don't think I even have a problem — I just don't think Beetlejuice is quite as good as everyone, and I mean, everyone, right, says. It's rather like Robert De Niro's performance in Mean Streets: everyone says it's pure genius, then you see it, and you think: aren't they exaggerating just a little, I mean, just a little? It's good, yes, but . . . Beetlejuice is this film I had heard so much about, which was truly original and with which Tim Burton first made his name (or something). But I had never seen it because somehow I didn't when it first came out, and then it was never in a cinema near me or else when it was shown on TV, I didn't get to hear about it until it was too late. But I also made a mental note that I simply must see it and when I found that one of our local supermarkets was selling a copy for £4, which is my sort of price, in it went into the shopping basket. In the event, I didn't get to slip it into my DVD player (i.e. my iBook) until a few weeks later, but when I did, I couldn't get rid of the niggling suspicion that I was in for something of a disappointment. Now, it would be pointless to go into chapter and verse pointing out a flaw here and a flaw there, because, quite truthfully Tim Burton does have a rather extraordinary imagination and in many respects Beetlejuice is streets ahead of the competition. You might even say that Burton re-wrote the rules for making films in a certain kind of genre, although I would be hard-pushed to give that genre a name. But let me give just one example: the Maitland's are in so many ways such caricatures that you assume such characterisation will be part of the plot. But it isn't. Then we are presented with the Deetz family and their camp interior designer and again the characterisation is so broadbrush that you wonder just at what level the whole thing is being pitched. Well, actually, it doesn't matter. This is cartoon stuff, except that it doesn't feature animation but acting. OK, fair enough. Then we get to Keaton giving an undoubted tour de force but in an odd sort of way it never really takes off. We are informed that at one point he was someone's assistant but his behaviour became so extreme that he had to be let go. Well, perhaps I'm being a little over-pernickety here, but I want some sort of back story which would help flesh out Beetlejuice. But all we are led to believe is that he should, on no account, be invoked. Naturally, he is invoked, but oddly the film finishes quite soon afterwards (in an ending which involved a deus ex machina of such obviousness that I would bet my shirt the writer simply did not know how to end his story. In fact, apart from the fact that one could dies and wants to scare another couple out of their home, what was the story. When the film came, I was even taken by surprise: was that it? I thought, for although by now Beetlejuice had already been running for 90 minutes odd, in a sense it was only just getting going. But no, that was it, like it or lump it. Perhaps, I am expecting too much. Perhaps I am being too serious. Perhaps I should just relax and get into the spirit of the film (and no silly pun intended there). The trouble is that Beetlejuice could have been so much more. We often say that so-and-so was more than just the sum of its parts, and hope to indicate that it included an x factor which raised it above the rest. Well, for me Beetlejuice is, in a sense, less the sum of its parts. It seemingly has everything, but . . . Oh well, I'll just have to firm a sub-group of those who don't think this is the best thing since sliced bread."
"JamesHitchcock","4","20","46","25 June 2004"," Special Effects in Search of a Plot
","When I recently reviewed his 'Big Fish' on this board, I stated that Tim Burton is generally at his best directing quirky, offbeat films such as 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Ed Wood' or 'Big Fish' itself, and less entertaining when he moves into the mainstream. Having since then seen 'Beetlejuice' for the first time, I realize that there are exceptions to that general rule. 'Beetlejuice', a black comedy about the afterlife, is hardly mainstream Hollywood fare, but I also found it far from entertaining.<br/><br/>The central characters, Adam and Barbara Maitland, are a nice-but-wet young couple, who live just outside an idyllic small New England town in one of those huge, rambling weather boarded mansions that looks as though it has been taken straight from an Edward Hopper painting. After they are killed in a road accident, they return to their house as ghosts. The view of life after death in this film is an unusual one, which has little in common with Christian eschatology or with traditional ghost stories. The dead are compelled to return to the house where they lived during their lifetimes; if they attempt to go outside they find themselves in a desert landscape populated by monstrous worms. (This imagery was presumably derived from Frank Herbert's science-fiction novel 'Dune' and the film that was made from it a few years before 'Beetlejuice'). They can, however, contact other departed spirits who can help them cope with the trials of the afterlife by, for example, leaving them a copy of the 'Handbook for the Recently Deceased'. <br/><br/>The Maitlands' main trial takes the form of Charles and Delia Deitz, the pretentious yuppie couple who buy their house. Irritated beyond endurance by this tasteless pair, the Maitlands, attempt to scare them away, but their efforts prove ineffectual because the only member of the family who can see them is their daughter Lydia who, far from being frightened by Adam and Barbara, takes a liking to them and befriends them. <br/><br/>Like another reviewer, I was struck by the thematic similarity to Oscar Wilde's 'The Canterville Ghost', which deals with the attempts of a ghost to frighten away an American family living in his ancestral home. (In that story too the only person to befriend the ghost is the young daughter of the newcomers). Wilde's story, although it has moments of pathos, is also a satire directed against both the traditionalism and snobbery of the British aristocracy (represented by the ghost) and the materialism and brashness of the American nouveaux-riches. 'Beetlejuice' also contains some satirical material, chiefly at the expense of the pretentiously bohemian Deitzes, who redecorate the Maitlands' house in a garish modernistic style and fill it with Delia's abstract sculptures. (It is never explained why a couple with such radically contemporary tastes would actually want to buy a Victorian mansion in the first place). Modern art, however, is a notoriously difficult subject to satirize, largely because it is impossible for the satirist to come up with a concept which is more extreme and exaggerated than the artists' own ideas. Delia's sculptures might look like pretentious tat, but one can see aesthetically similar items in established museums or in galleries bearing price-tags marked in thousands of pounds. Lydia, a follower of the then-fashionable 'Goth' cult, claims that she can see ghosts because she is 'strange and unusual'. The film loses the chance to make the point that the Goth movement, like most teenage cults from the Teddy Boys to grunge, was not so much strange and unusual as an alternative way to be conformist. <br/><br/>Satire, however, is largely abandoned when the title character enters. Despairing of their own ability to scare away the intruders, the Maitlands engage the services of Betelgeuse, a 'bio-exorcist' who specializes in helping ghosts rid their properties of the unwanted living. (Although the film is called 'Beetlejuice' the name of the character is spelt 'Betelgeuse'; I can only presume that the producers wanted to change the spelling to something more user-friendly and failed to realize that we actually see the name written down several times in the film).<br/><br/> From this point on the film becomes an ever-more frantic slapstick comedy as Betelgeuse makes increasingly manic attempts to get rid of the Deitzes. Betelgeuse is played (in bizarre makeup) by Michael Keaton, in one of the most frenetic, over-the-top pieces of acting in the modern cinema. (Even some of Jim Carrey's efforts look restrained by comparison). The other characters fade into the background, and any attempt at a plot degenerates into a series of stunts and gimmicky special effects. The film certainly shows evidence of Tim Burton's vivid visual imagination, but he seems unable bring any discipline to his talents. 'Beetlejuice' is an inventive but disappointing film, even when viewed as a pure comedy, and lacking the wisdom and philosophical insight that Burton was able to bring to 'Edward Scissorhands' or 'Big Fish'. 4/10"

","Just an absolute comedy-horror classic and there's not been anything to replicate it since. Happily married couple Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) live in a perfect house in a quiet town (apart from some nosey neighbours!) Very early on in the film, they die from a car accident and find themselves as ghosts in limbo. When they get a new family move into their abode, they hire a troublesome spirit named Betelgeuse, the afterlife's leading bio-exorcist, to come and get rid of them. If you haven't seen it, it's an essential! The cast are perfect; Michael Keaton just steals the show in his transformative performance as Beetlejuice and is such an iconic mischievous character. Winona Ryder is fantastic as Lydia; a gothic teenager who has more interest in the dead than the living. Everybody from Davis and Baldwin to Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones are all brilliant and the film has a unique tone all on its own which is beautiful to behold! Fantastically written by Warren Skaaren (Batman, Beverly Hills Cop) and Michael McDowell (The Nightmare Before Christmas, Thinner) it's consistently funny and nuanced with care and affection for the characters. Danny Elfman's score is stunning, creating one of the most memorable title sequences of all time! It's one that I can't sing it's praises enough and is one of Burton's masterpieces"

","Hyperbolic as it may sound, there has never quite been another film like Beetlejuice. Vomited from the maniacal mind of Tim Burton, before his name became tantamount to an adjective, the film is such a flurry of paradoxes that it really shouldn't work. But work it does, not so much bending genres as warping and distorting them like the monstrous pantomime faces scrunched by its ghostly protagonists – a ghoulishly zany live action cartoon filled with wonderful weirdness, and an unequivocal 80s classic. <br/><br/>Only Burton could transmogrify the horror of life after death into a rambunctiously mischievous fairy tale, but the snarkily cheerful Leave it to Beaver New England introduction proves a perfect setup to the ensuing punchline of the afterlife. Naturally, in the hands of dear Tim, the true horror of death lies not in the exquisitely realized, gruesomely surreal Dune-like wasteland of horrific stop motion leviathans, but in purgatory ultimately functioning as a garish, never-ending bureaucratic waiting room, with drawling receptionists thumbing copies of pedantic instruction manuals. The horror the horror! <br/><br/>Indeed, for all its zaniness and Tex Avery-style slapstick, Beetlejuice is a film brimming with surprising heart and cleverness. Burton has always been at his pitch-black, satirical best ripping apart ideologies of 'normal life', and he has a ball equally taking jabs at our goodhearted ghostly protagonists (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, both charmingly flustered), who are tickled pink by the prospect of a 'staycation' cooped up refurbishing their home, or the house's posthumous inhabitants (the deliciously demented Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara), who tastelessly claw at postmodern décor or oafishly Machiavellian capitalism, goaded on by their preening design consultant Otho (the note-perfect Glen Shadix). By contrast, it's pretty easy to sympathize with their goth daughter (Winona Ryder at her surly, adorable best), who cheerfully pens suicide notes beginning with ""I am *utterly* alone"" before it was cool. <br/><br/>This all goes without mentioning the film's star attraction: Michael Keaton, as the titular sh*t- disturbing Bio-Exorcist. Keaton's career-defining performance is truly on another level of comedic genius, as he roars through the film like a Tasmanian devil Rumplestiltskin, riffing, swearing, crotch-honking, and guzzling scenery like the demonic snake he eventually transforms into. It's a tantamount to Keaton's wacky, manic charisma that he's barely in his own movie, and yet provides one of the most unforgettable filmic characters of all time from essentially an extended cameo. <br/><br/>And yet, the film's most bizarrely impressive accolade is, in spite of this cauldron of seething, seemingly antithetical weirdness, Burton has managed to stir up a strangely, unprecedentedly feel-good film. Somehow, in its mad tornado of satire, gorgeously oddball visuals, and adventurously eccentric performances, seasoned with Danny Elfman at his infectiously bouncy best, and sprinkled with a couple of Harry Belafonte Calypso dance numbers for good measure (naturally), Burton's Gothic ode to the afterlife couldn't surge with more life and vibrancy. Beautifully grotesque and morbidly heartfelt, for audiences familiar or inexperienced, it's unquestionably worth reciting the name three times, and uncorking the spectacular insanity of Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>(It's show time!) <br/><br/>-9.5/10"

","BEETLE JUICE is one of the funniest and most odd ""family"" films ever to have been made.

Danny Elfman, as usual, makes the film sound just right, and Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat Song"" is used perfectly. Twice.<br/><br/>There's some blood and some creepy stuff going around: plenty of dead bodies(mostly doing and saying funny stuff) with all sorts of ailments, constant talk of the afterlife, some risqué jokes that will most likely go over the brow of your ten year old, and one of the best usages of the ""F"" word in cinema history.<br/><br/>Everything about the film is exceptional, and if you like your horror with some humor, look no further."

","An absurd and tasteless comedy. I felt embarrassed for Alec Baldwin. The initial idea was interesting, and could turn into a very funny movie: a couple of nice ghosts got scared of a bunch of obnoxious alive people. Also it could be quite amusing to spoof the modern bureaucracy, showing it in its ""afterlife"". And Keaton's character could be something more than just incoherent ghost-clown. But the development of those ideas got lost in the dense woods of director's mind and his perverted sense of humor. Or better to say, total absence of good sense of humor. I am completely bewildered by the success of this film. It made the list of 1,000 best (according to the last edition of New York Time's movie critics)?! Excuse me!

","A surreal , grotesque farce with continual surprises about an ultra-nice couple (Alec Baldwin , Geena Davis) of recently deceased ghosts who contract the services of a ""bio-exorcist"" called Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton, the title character is named for a bright red star in the constellation of Orion, Betelgeusein) in order to remove the obnoxious new owners of their house , and they contract him to rid of all trespassers for a price . The fantastique exorcist only be contacted when his name is correctly pronounced three consecutive times . Among those who feel the need to hire are a couple of newly-dead who are confined to a living hell in their own home which is being invaded by obnoxious new inhabitants , a family of post-modern art-lovers , formed by a marriage (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara who was a replacement for an ill Anjelica Huston as Delia, on the set she met her future husband, production designer Bo Welch who created the inventive set design) and their rare daughter named Lydia (Winona Ryder ; though also auditioned for the role Juliette Lewis , Diane Lane, Sarah Jessica Parker, Brooke Shields, Molly Ringwald and Jennifer Connelly all turned down the same role) . But the things go wrong when the maniacal BeetleJuice works his own magic . <br/><br/>Bemusing film plenty of humor , easy fun , cheesy scenes , special effects galore and strange situations . Michael Keaton steals the show as the repulsive and raucous Bio-exorcist , he spent only two weeks filming his part in the film , which lasts 17.5 minutes out of the 92-minute running time . The highlights of the film are the unforgettable Calypso scenes that result to be priceless images . The original script was a horror film , and featured Beetlejuice as a winged, reptilian demon who transformed into a small Middle Eastern man , subsequent script rewrites turned the film into a comedy and toned down Beetlejuice's character into the ghost of an wise cracking con-artist rather than a demon. Winona Ryder is astounding as the Gothic adolescent with a death complex and majoring in weirdness , while Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones are amusing as the yuppie marriage . The picture packs eye-popping and colorful cinematography by Thomas Ackerman . Lively and amusing musical score by Danny Elffman , Tim Burton's usual .<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the movie's impressive box-office success created plans for a sequel: Beetlejuice Goes Hawaiian. A script was commissioned and Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder both signed on to reprise their respective roles, but Tim Burton lost interest in the project and went on to direct Batman and Batman Returns instead. As late as 1996, Warner Bros. was still trying to get the original sequel concept into production but a finished film has yet to materialize.<br/><br/>The motion picture was well realized by Tim Burton , giving a quirky vision of the afterlife and showing his usual weird touches . This unstructured but habitually delightful live action cartoon will appeal to Tim Burton fans . The supernatural comedy was a huge and surprising box-office hit, which in turn led to Burton being entrusted with the reins on the hugely expensive Batman (1989). Although his least personal film, it was one of the most successful movies of all time, and gave him unprecedented power in Hollywood considering the originality and adventurousness of his work thus far. ¨Edward Scissorhands¨ (1990), another hit, saw him at the peak of his creative powers and established a fruitful working relationship with actor Johnny Depp. ¨Batman returns¨ (1992) was a far darker and quirkier film than the original, a reflection of how much creative freedom Burton had won . And although Ed Wood (1994), his loving tribute to the life and work of the legendary Worst Director of All Time, Edward D. Wood Jr., was a box-office disaster, it garnered some of the best reviews of Burton's career ."

"talarisw","9","3","5","15 September 2012"," A newly deceased couple hate the new family that moved in their old house, so they call upon a deranged ghost named Beetlejuice to scare them off .
","Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors of all time. You can say he's Hollywood's ""goth"" director because he's known for his dark, macabre and surreal style. This is one of his best known films, possibly his signature film next to Edward scissor-hands and The nightmare before Christmas. Even though this is one of the most unique, creative and imaginative films ever, it does have one major flaw, much of the story simply dosen't make sense. Let me start by saying this film is a unique take on ghost comedies. Even though the movie's titled Beetlejuice, the main characters are really the Maitlands, played by great actors Alec Baldwin as Adam and Gena Davis as Barbra, who are an old fashioned couple who drowns in the start of the film. Davis and Baldwin are great in their roles in playing an un-hip, boring and naive couple, which perfectly clashes with the more unconventional Deetz family and you understand their motives. Burton has a fascination with the dead and I love his unique take on the afterlife. Here the afterlife is run like a bureaucratic business, the Maitlands are given ""The handbook for the recently deceased"" which is a thick boring book about instructions for living in the afterlife. And later they go to the main office of the afterlife, where they have to take a number and wait to be called and then there'll meet their caseworker Juno. The Maitlands find out that their trapped in their own house as ghost, if they try to leave the house they go to a bizarre place call Saturn and meet a giant sand-worm. I love how Tim gave a memorable twist to your average ghost comedy with the ghost being the one haunted by the living. I love how Tim created the Deetz family who moved in the old Maitland's home. The step-mom is Delia played wonderfully by Catherine O'Hara who dominates the family. I love her Gothic art work and she looks kinda sexy here. I love Jeffery Jones as the ""I don't want to get involved"" dad. And there's Winona Ryder as the depressed, suicidal teenager Lydia, who dresses like everyday's a funeral. This is one of Ryder's best performances and Lydia is interesting as she's the only person who can see ghost and would rather be friends with the dead then the living. And last but not least there's Micheal Keaton as Beetlejuice. Tim's a good story teller but unconventional. The title character dosen't appear until well after 40 minutes into the movie. I think he has only a total of 17 minutes of screen time in this movie, which sounds bad for a title character but like in Batman(also stared Keaton as the title character),where the title character dosen't appear a lot, Tim makes it work well. In a way everything is a much needed build up to introducing Beetlejuice. Keaton gives his best & most manic comedic performance. Beetlejuice is one of the most unique and memorable characters of all time. He's a deranged, erratic acting, gross and perverted ghost. But the bad thing is that he's such an interesting character but Tim never really explains anything about him. Juno explains he use to be her assistant but then became a bio-exorcist, claiming he can ""get rid of the living"". But that's all he explains about him. Why do you have to say his name three times before he can appear? Why is he trapped in the model Adam created? What kind of a name is Beetlejuice? Why does he spell his name Beetlegeise?, Why couldn't he tell Lydia his name?, What's his cause of death?, How old is he? Who was he before he died?, Why does he have to marry Lydia in order to be free? and Why is he more powerful then other ghost we see? Unfortunley none of these questions are answered. In fact a lot of the story dosen't make sense, like Juno telling the Maitlands that the living can't see the dead but later she tells them to scare the Deetz by creating scary faces and Lydia can see them. It's also unclear weather Beetlejuice is supposed to be a villain or some anti-hero. I personally look at him as a bad guy. But if you overlook the fact that a lot of the plot is incoherent this is a very enjoyable film. The film is visually great! Tim's surreal visual are some of the best of surrealism's I ever seen. The calypso songs works well into the movie. Danny Elfman's score is great, it sounds like a manic circus. I also like the cheesy looking special effects. One of the highlights are seeing the other dead people and their look mirroring their death, like the receptionist who slit her wrist, the sexy woman cut in half and Juno who's throat's slit. Tim is able to make humor out of a grim subject like death. He even makes Lydia's attempt at suicide humorous. Warner Bros. really missed an opportunity to do a sequel to this film, maybe they could've explain more about Beetlejuice. Never the less a ghost comedy classic."

Ironically, he's a very talented actor, who was outstanding in Mask and Man on the Moon and even Grinch. His potty humor, however, leaves me flat. Lots of people like Carey comedies.

So instead of liking the guy from one film, I researched his other works, and Beetlejuice always interested me the most. So I waited and waited, then finally watched it as soon as it started to record. And I'm sad to say that I didn't like Beetlejuice at all..<br/><br/>Now the film doesn't deserve the one rating, but that was given from all my expectations and the fact that Tim Burton made it. It was new and unique, but something about it just gave off the wrong vibe.. The material was just so stupid in my opinion. The afterlife premise was unique, sure, but I thought it was just executed in the wrong way. Tim Burton adds in a little comic effect, which in my opinion, wasn't funny at all.. And the film is straight-up gimmicky. It relies on special effects, not funny jokes, and a bizarre atmosphere that you don't even want to be in. The characters were one-dimensional and the character of Beetlejuice (or should I say Betelgeuse?) wasn't crazy, funny, or unique. Instead he came off rude, stupid, and annoying. The way the film is based off his character alone, especially how he shows up halfway through the film, makes it bad alone.. This film was riveting. It surely hit me as a clever-WRITTEN film, but execution matters. And yes, style over substance is all here. That's a bad thing.<br/><br/>I may be bashed and hated for this review, because I'm the only person on this planet that hated Beetlejuice. Maybe I was expecting too much, but the film just didn't do anything new for me, and the whole thing was too over done.

Yet it has a real artsy-goth appeal. I have thought about the movie on and off for years, then wrote what my version would be as a sequel installment on the original and expanded on the characters with a few new ones. <br/><br/>The only real problem with this is, I am not contracted to write for Warner Bros., or Mr.Burton. But would it not be great to see a whole other chapter in the BeEtLeJuicE library, the original writers (Both late) would have probably wanted another as well.<br/><br/>I would love to see, Keaton reprise his role as the royal, ghostly pain in the afterlife.

","It is always amazing to think about our childhood as a different era. We like to think of our infant years as living life as a different person. After recently watching this film, I found this to be inevitably true.<br/><br/>At a much younger age I had the privilege of watching Tim Burtons 'Beetlejuice' and was taken aback by this wonderment of fiction versus reality. Ghosts, ghouls, a freaky child, a scary woman and a clown-like rogue who everyone can't help but love - Beetlejuice. Sounds like the perfect recipe for a good comedy, well not if you're over the age of ten.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice - revisited was a disappointment. I was alarmed at the wooden performance given by Alec Baldwin as Adam, a man who is recently deceased and has to face life as an immortal along with his wife Barbara - Geena Davis. Now I do understand that it is a family comedy and brilliant acting is not essential but I was alarmed that he actually agreed to star in this film.<br/><br/>The story is pretty straight forward. Adam and Barbara become the undead, and a new, obnoxious family move into their home. Adam and Barbara still live there, but as they are dead they cannot be seen, except by the family's goth-like daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder.) The couple take a liking to Lydia and she begins to help the couple in their distress. They are unable to come to terms with their new selves and are drawn into dealings with the great 'Beetlejuice,' a helper of the recently deceased. However, as time passes Beetlejuice's antics as a troublesome rogue become too much for everyone.<br/><br/>Overall it is a good film for children, it has the impish comedy seen in films like 'Home Alone,' and it would most definitely occupy a younger viewer. An advantage is that it stars Michael Keaton as the indelible 'Beetlejuice' and his performance is worthy of a look., as always."

","Over 30 years since this films release and it still astounds. The creativity, the humor, the performances, the darkness and the camp all add up to create something we just don't see these days. Beetlejuice is the kind of movie that would never get made today, it's too weird, too crazy and too original to make it to the big screen.<br/><br/>All that said, this kind of film is likely to be divisive. It will either work for you or it won't. It'll be your kind of weird or it'll be way too out there or too campy. Regardless it's worth a shot. After all, Beetlejuice is the ghost with the most!"

","Beetlejuice is a different family movie, that requires a pretty much grown up family or those ones that are into horror films. Its quick, its unique and above all its hilarious and lovable as hell!<br/><br/>Tim Burton's stop motion is extraordinary yet again (surprising no-one) and the overall performances are from pretty good to great! The Sylvia Sidney cameos are probably the best parts of the movie. She has by far the best lines. Also, Michael Keaton is great, but Alec Baldwin and young Winona Ryder have a more normal role and managed to be memorable as well!"
"filipemanuelneto","9","2","3","31 August 2018"," An amazing trip to the afterlife.
","In this film, we will visit the afterlife through the experience of a newly deceased couple who, to their own despair, sees the home of their dreams invaded by a new family. Thus, to evict them and regain possession of their home, they decide to scare and haunt the newcomers, which can be challenging for a rookie ghost. To do this, they have the help of experienced ghosts and two unusual allies: the daughter of the new house owners and another ghost, deeply unorthodox and expert in the art of scaring the living.<br/><br/>The film is a classic comedy of black humor, which plays with death and life in the beyond, just as it makes a great mockery to the pseudo-intellectuals of American society. The movie is very funny. I confess I had never seen or heard of him until I found him, by chance. Directed by Tim Burton, there are a lot of elements that we associate, almost instinctively, with this director: an unusual plot with offbeat themes, a comedy difficult to please everyone, out of the box sets and costumes and a refined, fun and contagious soundtrack.<br/><br/>The cast did a great job. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin have done well in the role of the ghost couple. They interact very well with each other and have created a positive and credible romantic chemistry. Besides, they're funny. Michael Keaton has the most difficult and original character here: the spiritual de-worzler Betelgeuse (Beetle Juice), an irreverent, talkative and daring ghost who loves to scare humans and promises to be truly difficult to control when he's released. Winona Ryder, once a regular in Burton's films (remember ""Scissorhands""), is quite good at playing the rebellious daughter of the new owners of the house, which, for a reason the film never explains, has the ability to see and speak with them, as if she were a medium.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was a pleasant surprise. Very funny, contagious and cheerful, it will surely drive anyone to laughing laughter."

Beetlejuice helped demonstrate Burton's ability to make dark and somber set-ups into funny romps that can still make for some spectacular stuff on the big screen.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is dark fun and great pop-cinema for everyone to enjoy. Watch this classic if you haven't already."

","I grew up watching 80's and 90's movies on TV, and to be honest I've never seen Beetlejuice until recently. This is a movie that knows what it is and uses it properly. I like most of the Tim Burton movies and this one surely is one of them. The story starts as warm as 80's fantasy/family movies with a charming couple and it's followed by entertaining wtf moments. When Keaton joins the party it becomes wild with crazy tempo. I try to avoid reading plots and watching trailers as much as I can, and this time not knowing what's going to happen paid off. <br/><br/>Adorable simplicity and short runtime makes Beetlejuice more and more re-watchable.

","Tim Burton certainly has the most unusual way of bringing his films across. Either that is his artistic style or he has to based on the screenplays he chooses to direct. Either way, he does an outstanding job and this film really enhances what talent he possesses. Burton certainly is known for his weird visions of what he puts on screen. Beetlejuice also stands out by the performance by the main stars like Alec Baldwin in a breakout performance that launched his film career, and Geena Davis for her charming feminine characteristic. But the one that stands out the most is Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse. In a masterful portrayal and brilliantly acted despite being underneath all that make-up and costume. This is a true tour-De-force for Keaton with his best performance of his monumental career. The negatives I have for it is the story is not well understood at least for me. And the other performers didn't deliver all that much. Ryder was good, Jeffrey Jones was good in a Ferris Bueller-type role which fits him well. But O'Hara was a little flat, and certainly saw someone else playing that character. Everyone else was eh, OK I guess. But other then that this film is a work of art by a real artistic genius known as Tim Burton. Now to grade.

","With all the buzz about a potential – or real now? – sequel to this nearly 30 year old classic, I had to revisit this for only the second time in more than two decades. And wowwhat an incredible movie this was.<br/><br/>My only grip, and this can't be held against Burton as it shows he did EVERYTHING he could with what he was given and entrusted with, was the poor animation trying to trick us as ""real."" Thisis another reason (from above) that I am truly looking forward to a sequel with a large budget and perfected CGI, if necessary. (Actually, I'm against most CGI – I like real heart and efforts from what I see in film, but some is necessary to showcase a larger world, à la Lord of the Rings.)<br/><br/>But, beyond the beyond cartoons, the movie was brilliant. Absolutely hilarious, extraordinarily original, tight, with great music and a nearly flawless and memorable score. But all that is not to discount the performances<br/><br/>Every single person in this film owned their parts and not once did I not feel one actor out of place. Some stood out, of course, like Ryder's Lydia, Shadix's Otho, Sidney's Juno and obviously, Keaton's dazzling ""Beetlegeuse."" But, unlike most movies, everyone still worked together wonderfully without having one or a couple steal scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, it's the story, comedic pieces, imagination and characters that drove this very basic haunted house movie into greatness. I'm always willing to put aside my normal distain for such basic movies (far too many haunted house movies have plagued us these last few years) when it gives me something new and fresheven from almost three decades ago."
"antagonist117","9","2","3","7 February 2015"," So much fun, and over too soon, ""Beetlejuice"" provides a character, a scene, and a world for the ages
","""Beetlejuice"" is a fantastically creative movie featuring some of the best-looking sets and most interesting worldbuilding in Tim Burton's filmography. Maybe in anyone's. And yet it also has a charmingly offhanded feel, like something jotted down after a strange dream as it was fading. Nobody seems to have been trying too hard, a common problem in later Burton projects. It builds slowly, one of those movies where the central figure doesn't really appear until deep into the runtime. Like the shark in ""Jaws"" or E.T. in ""E.T.,"" we want to see Beetlejuice, but the movie smartly holds him back, showing only teasers before the big show.<br/><br/>There's plenty to focus on in the meantime. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are likable guides to the world of the dead, a wry bureaucracy that's also playground for Burton's creature creation and makeup departments. The movie could work as satire if it wanted to, something like Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" set in H.P. Lovecraft's New England. There are waiting rooms and labyrinthine corridors of the dead civil service and a manual for the newly deceased. To go between worlds, Baldwin's character must take a shovel to the foam grass and plywood ground of his scale model of his town, and it's tempting to search this for parallels to the tacky redevelopment going on in the dead couple's home. But really, the whole conceit is too intriguing and lighthearted to serve as earnest commentary or sharp-edged ridicule. The movie speculates that, really, being dead isn't so bad if you can just learn to work the system and get along with people. Being alive isn't so bad either, as long as you don't trample heedlessly over the dead. Having seen the fun that Baldwin and Davis's characters are having after death, it's easy to relate to Winona Ryder's goth girl character, who can see them and decides she prefers them to her snobbish and striving parental units.<br/><br/>A fair amount of plot is squeezed into the movie's 90 minutes, but it all boils down to the question of when somebody is going to say ""Beetlejuice"" three times and bring Michael Keaton's fast-talking con man out of the scale model and into the real world. Even if you can't catch everything he says—he speaks in clipped grunts with a highly variable cadence—you'll walk away impersonating him. This character, from his clothes to his growl to his lurching and reeling body movements, is a touchstone of movies not unlike the the Tramp in the 1910s and Jack Sparrow in the 2000s. Beetlejuice is a villain, but that's just a slight tweak. There's a line of evolution (not to say improvement, since they're all great) through these male, clownish, unlucky, gregarious, vagabond immortals (it is not to be thought that the Tramp aged between 1914 and 1936.) Keaton is so in tune with his creation that he doesn't need a lot of screen time to make a lasting mark on the culture, but the movie is smart enough not to cheat him out of a grand sequence in the final act anyway.<br/><br/>Oddly though, by the time the finale comes around, the high point has already been reached. And it doesn't involve Beetlejuice at all. It's the scene where the living characters become possessed and dance around a dinner table lip-syncing Harry Belafonte's calypso song ""Day-O."" Catherine O'Hara shines here, acting with every face muscle and every body muscle but keeping them totally separate. The glamorous costume clothes, the blue lighting in the room, the bizarre sculptures in the background—this scene is an ingenious fusion of styles held together by Burton's pop-art sensibility. If this were all the movie had, it would be worth watching. But ""Beetlejuice"" is a series of original moments like this. It is so much fun, and over too soon."
"zombiefan89","10","2","3","14 November 2013"," Stop motion animation at it's finest!
","By far my favorite Tim Burton movie as a kid! You can really see the effort and creativity that went into the making Beetlejuice! Few companies even use stop-motion animation anymore in favor of bad CGI! I have to say, I quite surprise that the stoic Batman, Michael Keaton portrayed, was the zany Beetlejuice just one year prior! Keaton definitely has a very broad acting range! Beetlejuice is like one of those fast-talking salesman stereotypes, but it really works! This is also one Geena Davis's best movies, although I found Davis and Baldwin to be rather bland. Honestly, you could switch Baldwin out with David Yost, and Davis with Andie MacDowell, and I don't think anyone would've noticed. Wynona Ryder is very believable teenager with an insufferable family, as intended. Overall, it was a great cast. The story is very straight forward ghosts want humans out of their house."
"Tweekums","9","2","3","13 September 2012"," Dead funny
","When Adam and Barbara Maitland crash their car into the river they don't know how they got back home at first; then they realise they did not survive the crash! Being dead is rather confusing even when you have the handbook. They soon figure out they can't leave the house and that doesn't seem too bad until the house is sold to the Deetz family. The Maitlands take an instant disliking to Delia Deetz in particular as she sets about deciding what alterations she must have done to make the house habitable. They attempt to scare her and her husband but they can't see them. The only person who can see them is their daughter Lydia Deetz. She tells her parents about the ghosts but obviously they don't believe her... until they put on a show during the middle of a dinner party; far from scaring them off though they think having a haunted house might be an opportunity! The Maitlands seek help, first from their afterlife case worker Juno then from Bio-Exorcist Betelgeuse (pronounced Beetle Juice). He seems more of a danger to them than the Deetz family though!<br/><br/>This film is a lot of fun in the slightly dark way one would expect from a Tom Burton film. Michael Keaton puts in a delightfully over the top performance in the title role; having seen this I'm surprised that Burton didn't cast him as The Joker in his 'Batman' film! Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are good as the Maitlands although playing ordinary people (how just happen to be dead) they get less opportunities to show what they can do. Winona Ryder is great as Lydia; one of her earliest roles and probably the one that got her noticed by the film going public. Other notable performances come from Catherine O'Hara and Jeffery Jones as Delia and Charles Deetz and Glenn Shadix who plays Delia's strange decorator/guru Otho. The film is full of great special effects; no CGI here; just great make-up, stop go animation and puppetry. Burton's regular collaborator Danny Elfman's music fits the film perfectly. The film is definitely a comedy but there are some scary moments and a little bit of swearing that means it might not be suitable for younger children... the film may be rated '15' here in the UK but I suspect if it gets re-certificated one day it will be lowered to '12' given that it is much tamer than many '12' rated films."
"Steffi_P","9","2","3","4 April 2011"," ""The strange and unusual""
","It's difficult to make a truly scary horror these days, simply because the staples of the genre have become so familiar culturally. A Dracula in a dinner jacket or Frankenstein's monster with a bolt through his neck nowadays appear more comical than creepy. And there's always been a fine line between what frightens us and what makes us laugh – in both cases it's the twisted and the offbeat. Perhaps this is why horror spoofs have the potential to be so rich and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice takes a cunning idea for its story, with similarities to classic afterlife fantasy pictures like Here Comes Mr Jordan, but with an Addams Family slant thrown into the mix. The development of this plot was not a straightforward one. Michael McDowell's original script was much darker and more violent, and somewhat more complex. As well as adding a good-natured comedic tone, the Warren Skaaren rewrite is incredibly succinct in its storytelling. The Maitlands are introduced with expert brevity – in just a couple of minutes and a few lines of dialogue we know all about their idyllic lifestyle, and their only regret being that they don't have children. The narrative then wastes no time in killing them off and getting the real story going. How many lesser pictures would have faffed around for ten or fifteen minutes before getting to this crucial plot point? Integral to the overall look of Beetlejuice is its having been directed by Tim Burton. Credits may go to various individuals for production design and visual effects, but it's fairly clear they are all working from Burton's own sketches. In interviews Burton often claims to have little formal knowledge of classic cinema, but his tribute to German expressionism is especially clear in this picture, although for Burton it is largely employed for his own bizarre aesthetics. Incidentally I also spy a nod towards the work of Dutch painter Vermeer in the shot where Lydia writes her would-be suicide note. And there's much more to Burton's visual scheme than simple design. He often begins a scene with close-ups or mid-shots, rather than a wide, establishing shot, so that we don't really get a proper impression of the space in which the action is taking place. Another ace director Milos Forman (One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, Amadeus) uses a similar tactic, but whereas Forman does it to focus us more on the performances, Burton's aim seems to be largely to disconcert and disorientate the viewer. After all, Burton does emphasise the settings, throwing in bizarrely angled outdoor shots and props overhanging the foreground. Again it's all calculated to make the movie's world as weird as possible. But none of this is ever exaggerated enough to distract us from story and character.<br/><br/>Not that we are likely to lose sight of characters when the acting performances are so attention-grabbing. At the heart of it all is Michael Keaton's wild portrayal of the titular antagonist. There's so much going on in his performance – look at the range of facial twitches he goes through in the few seconds after Adam says he has a few questions. Keaton is also a great improviser, and thought up with a lot of his own material here. You can tell when he's improvising, because he comes out with stuff you just couldn't script – example: ""Now that is why I never do two shows in a night. I just won't do it, I won't."" It wouldn't work on paper but it's hilarious coming out of Keaton's mouth. The other stand out is Sylvia Sidney who gets a small cameo. Not many modern viewers know Sidney, but she was a lead actress back in the 1930s, usually a warm-hearted romantic figure and quite the opposite of this grouchy old lady. Still, she brings the necessary memorable impact to her small but important role. Honourable mentions also go to jolly character actor Jeffrey Jones and the appropriately oddball Glenn Shadix, who sadly died last year.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake is that Beetlejuice is filled with inspired touches that make it stand out from the crowd, little ideas that are not strictly required by the story but elevate it from some wacky spoof into a horror-comedy classic. There's the use of stop-motion animation, which Burton has long championed. Stop-motion doesn't look especially realistic, but compared to CGI it has a kind of life to it (if you'll excuse the metaphor). Then there's the complete non-sequitur use of Harry Belafonte songs. There's nothing remotely horror-themed about Day-O or Jump in the Line (apart from the tenuous link between Afro-Caribbean culture and zombies) but it doesn't really matter. Beetlejuice is a horror-comedy let loose, in which anything can happen, and frequently does. And that's what makes it so fine."

"RhapsodyReviews","9","1","1","7 October 2019"," Great Halloween Movie.
","Review:
'Beetlejuice' is an American comedy-horror film directed by Tim Burton. These types of movie are what I wish Tim Burton would have stuck to and wish he did more of. This movie hit right home with me with the creepy Halloween feel, but also being a comedy that you could watch with the family. Yes, it has some moments of coarse language and some overly creepy scenes, but overall, I would say it's a holiday classic for the family to enjoy.
The plot revolves around a recently deceased young couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who become ghosts haunting their former home, and an obnoxious, devious poltergeist named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) from the Netherworld who tries to scare away the new inhabitants (Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, and Winona Ryder) permanently.
The acting may take some getting used to when watching a Tim Burton movie like this. It's well done in the case that the actors don't take you out of the movie and play all of there characters very well. But it's done in a way that is structure to the story that Tim Burton specifically wants to tell and it's original to its stories. The acting in this movie wasn't as play-like as some others are, but it sill didn't feel like I was watching a typical movie. I'm not trying to make this out to be a bad thing at all, I love the way I feel when watching these movies, it makes it feel more personal that the director wants to be different and have his characters stand out. My personal favorite in the film has to be Michael Keaton's portrayal of Betelgeuse, which I suppose is a good thing considering the name of the film. The way he can come off to be a complete dick, but also being super charismatic when trying to get what he wants to fantastic. Also, not to give anything away, but there is a wedding scene at the end of the movie and is amazing.
One thing that could have been turned into a negative and made this movie out to be called dated it the fact that they use stop motion when trying to do CGI, but I love it. Not only was it because of the age of this film, but it's Tim Burton M.O. All it did was turn a Tim Burton movie and make it feel more like his.
Overall, this is a Halloween movie that is on my list to watch every year. I think anyone can enjoy this movie for what it really is.

","Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's best movie in my opinion, it's a funny-crazy & totally inventive supernatural comedy,
This is one of those 80's CLASSIC's i grew up on along with the likes of Ghostbusters 1&2 & Death Becomes Her, among others, these were fun, spooky comedies full of fantastic special effects that were great for it's time well before c.g.i completely took over & the fx back then actually were special!!!
Tim Burton crafted a beautifully designed fantasy Horror comedy, the visual look is fantastic with it's big gothic cartoony style & colourful sets & incredible creature designs, this is Burton at his creative best in my opinion!!!
The atmosphere is nightmare weird & cartoony strange but not in a threatening way, it's more a fun fantasy feel to the film with many creative bits popping out at you.
The cast is great fun & so memorable.
Especially BeetleJuice himself!!!
Michael Keaton is excellent in his most iconic role as the crazy-menacing & hilarious evil spirit ""BeetleJuice"" his performance is legendary now & he's full of life for a dead guy lol, he's great fun.<br/><br/>BeetleJuice is a pure 80's CLASSIC movie, i grew up loving this on video & also collected all the Awesome action figures from the movie, great nostalgia for this fun, gothic Horror-comedy.
This is Director Tim Burton at his absolute best in my opinion!!!
The big haunted house is a beautiful set peice & the production design of the supernatural otherworldly sets are incredible!!!
Also the music is BEAUTIFUL, especially the opening scenes it's just beautifully done.
This film makes me long for that lovely lost era of the 80's & early 90's my favourite times as i grew up in those simpler times with these CLASSIC movies.
There's some absolute classic scenes in this film such as the waiting room scene full of freaky spirits & the big scary BeetleJuice snake scene, superb moments in a a superb movie.
This is one my favourite movies of all time from Childhood & it gets better with age!!!"

","How can anyone who has seen this movie not like it. Michael Keaton is perfect perverted creepazoid Beetlejuice who lives in the attic of a house along with a heap of other ghosts who have difficulty adjusting to the fact that they are dead. <br/><br/>Beetlejuice is one of those characters in film you are either going to love or hate.<br/><br/>I've long been a fan of Tim Burton. His movies are almost always weird, but there is almost always something endearing about his work. His films are almost always entertaining, and Beetlejuice is probably one of the more obvious examples.<br/><br/>If you really think about it absolutely nothing happens in this movie. For those of you who've seen it, think about it. <br/><br/>If you haven't yet seen it, just watch it for Tim Burton's really weird and wonderful imagination. It really is what makes the whole movie. <br/><br/>This movie is a big departure for Michael Keaton. I found it really hard to believe he was actually a comic actor, but he is hilarious here and he is another thing that makes it worth watching.<br/><br/>Just be aware this movie's story is almost nonexistent."

Not a boring moment to be had while he was on camera. I had no idea, he could act like that! His body language, delivery, his eccentricity! Whoever did his makeup did a great job.<br/><br/>The only thing better than Keaton was the Dinner Party scene. That if nothing else gets an 4 on 5 from me. The actors acting out that scene stayed in character so darn well, I watched it twice. Watch the movie for that bizarre and hilarious scene if for nothing else!"
"AmyJenson1995","8","1","1","1 January 2017"," If you loved The Mask, you gotta love Beetlejuice
","When I watched for the very first time Beetlejuice, I was still a young child whose only reference to the After Life World was the TV show cartoon Casper, that young ghost whose only wish is to become a little boy once again.<br/><br/>So when my parents showed me that movie for the first time and tried to comfort me, assuring that it's not as scary as it looks, I was spooked anyway (the pun is intended).<br/><br/>But I loved it even if I was scared a couple of times. I don't know maybe it's because that movie reminds me a lot of one of my favorite childhood picture ever: The Mask.<br/><br/>Even if the two stories are way different from each other, The Mask and Beetlejuice share a lot of similarities. Their main characters share the same craziness, the same power to do what they want without any limit, the same way to modify their body shape as well. They are both carefree and seem to get out straight from a cartoon. Maybe Michael Keaton has been one of the model Jim Carrey took the inspiration from to play such an eccentric character as The Mask.<br/><br/>The secondary roles are greatly played too starting with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis. They have a great chemistry together and they are so sweet impersonating that young couple who suddenly dies in a tragic car crash and are forced to watch what was their home being taken over by a very obnoxious family they want out. They are not particularly being gifted into scaring this family away but that what's making them so attaching.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder, Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones and Glenn Shadix are also so good playing the new owners. My favorite is Winona by far. She's such a treat playing this young lonely goth girl who befriends Baldwin and Davis as they are the only ones who seems to care about her.<br/><br/>Even Juno and her footballers alongside the dead staff are so hilarious to watch. The only two scenes in which they appears are so fun to watch. There's absolutely nothing to throw away about the cast performance, it's perfect.<br/><br/>Just as this movie!"
"Horror-yo","7","1","1","20 May 2016"," Not as great as it could've been but special
","Tim Burton directs Beetlejuice. This film is a totally wacky ride from start to finish that all in all achieves a quite complex plot with the main story of the protagonists with their own existential struggles colliding with the introduction of the sort of villain/anti-hero whose name is hilariously spelled ""Betelgeuse"", played by Michael Keaton, an actor difficult to quite squeeze into a category, his performances are so eclectic and varied. He does a fine job, for a character very difficult to incarnate, but just like the film as a whole, it really does feel like missed opportunity, seeing the potential of such a unique character, with such a unique design/concept and humor, that even later became the object of a (fairly good) cartoon series. It's funny, very good in places, very developed and creative visually, quite entertaining, but it seems to lack on a certain level of depth and the elements at hand. Like they didn't make the best of what they had."

","Beetlejuice is an awesome movie, it's one of the funniest movies you'll see. I will be honest, it's a strange humor as it's a dark comedy, but it's all good.<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly how to start this comment other than to praise Tim Burton, Beetlejuice is a movie that was based on his idea and is still remembered to this very day. He picked a great leading male, Michael Keaton as well as to pick a very strong cast that turned into what could have been a total flop into a cult classic that will be remembered for ages to come. Beetlejuice is a very strange movie that explores life after death, turning into a ghost and having to accept that you died, now move on. But what if there was one ghost who maybe had too much fun and just wanted to rock the living world? That's what Beetlejuice is about, the one zombie that you'd love to party with once but then ignore at the next party he's invited too.<br/><br/>Barbara and Adam Maitland decide to spend their vacation decorating their idyllic New England country home. Upon returning from the trip to town, however, Barbara swerves to avoid a dog wandering the roadway. The couple's vehicle crashes through a covered bridge and plunges into the river below, killing Barbara and Adam. The couple soon returns home in spirit form and quickly come to the conclusion that they are dead. A book entitled Handbook for the Recently Deceased confirms the couple's suspicion that they are, in fact, dead. Barbara and Adam's peace is soon shattered when their house is sold and the new residents arrive from New York City. Charles Deetz, aspiring sculptor and Charles' second wife Delia, and Charles' goth daughter Lydia from his first marriage, move into the home. Juno, who informs Barbara and Adam that they must remain in the house for 125 years. If they want the Deetzes out, it is up to them to scare them away. Although the Maitlands remain invisible to Charles and Delia, their daughter Lydia can see Adam and Barbara and becomes their friend. Against the advice of Juno, the Maitlands contact the miscreant Betelgeuse, a freelance ""bio- exorcist"", to scare away the Deetzes, but they have their hands full now with this crazy psycho.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is such a great comedic actor, he was the perfect choice, he brought the right amount of cockiness and comedy to the role. Also Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin had great chemistry as well as the perfect Leave it to Beaver-esquire type of couple that has a hard time accepting their world as the afterlife. Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder were perfect as the Deetzes, quite disturbing and awkward. I highly recommend this movie if you get the chance to see it, it's a great comedy classic.<br/><br/>10/10"
"brchthethird","8","1","1","2 April 2016"," The first true film from ""Tim Burton, auteur"" -- and a very entertaining one, too
","I don't remember ever seeing this movie when I was a kid, but I did watch some episodes of the animated series around that time. BEETLEJUICE is an important film for at least one reason: It established Tim Burton's style and featured a lot of the people, behind and in front of the camera, who he would collaborate with over the next 20 years or so. It also has a fairly entertaining story with plenty of visual inventiveness and some manic touches, courtesy of Michael Keaton as the titular character. However, similar to Silence of the Lambs, the most important character in the movie isn't in it for a long time. He gets hinted about at first and shown from behind, making you curious as to what could make the dead so scared of him, but then he finally makes his grand appearance and it all makes sense. For so grating a character, the small doses you get of him actually work in the film's favor. A little bit goes a long way. What makes the film engaging and relatable are the couple who die barely ten minutes in (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) and the daughter of the couple who move in afterwards and start remodeling (Winona Ryder). To a degree, you can understand the plight of these two people who, cut down in their prime, see the house they worked so hard to get be changed beyond recognition by a family with no regard for the past (albeit, hilariously so). One thing I didn't expect was the way in which the film straddles the line between horror and comedy, having expected something a little more straightforwardly funny. What I got was still quite good, with plenty of sight-gags and situational humor instead of verbal punchlines. The film also has a great sense of style (courtesy of production designer, Bo Welch), and Tim Burton's love of German Expressionist cinema becomes more apparent in his realization of the limbo world of the dead, with its long hallways and angled, off-kilter doors and windows. There was also brilliant use of stop-motion animation and models, which are still more involving than CGI will ever be. All of the performances were great, and the characters well-written enough as to be likable even while occasionally doing annoying things. The only thing that works against the film are perhaps the rushed beginning and a slightly forced (and equally rushed) ending. I can understand wanting to get to the good stuff, but a little more time with the protagonists could have only benefited the film overall. So, for not quite delivering the riotous comedy I expected, BEETLEJUICE is still a highly entertaining showcase for special effects and Michael Keaton's manic energy, as well as being Tim Burton's first true film (or at least emblematic of his style)."

","Tim Burton built his name on his macabre style but ""Beetlejuice"" is one odd movie (in a good way). But some of the stuff that goes on in this is just bananas, and that speaks to the movie's inherent personality. There some serious imagination at work here, not just the title character, but in the Salvador Dali netherworld images (complete with giant sandworm), grotesque makeup and its playful take on the afterlife. It's also got Winona Ryder at her most charming, and Catherine O'Hara's a B on wheels in this movie; oh, man. And then the unforgettable Danny Elfman score. It all adds up to something pretty great.<br/><br/>But that's all before we even get to the crown jewel, the pièce de ré·sis·tance: Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice. It'd be weak to say he steals the movie; he owns it lock, stock and barrel. He's a comic performer at the top of his game; lewd, profane and utterly without boundaries.

"The-Sarkologist","8","1","1","14 October 2011"," Classic Tim Burton
","What does one expect from a Tim Burton movie? Well, I expect the strange, bizarre, and slightly horrific that also pokes fun at society. These concepts made up Edward Scissorhands, and in a way, Mars Attacks. What one does expect is very good filmmaking with well developed characters, which is what we get in Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>I remember when it was first released, the commentators said that the movie was quite difficult to understand and that it was really weird. I agree in part. It is different but I understood what happened in it. The movie begins in an idyllic setting where a loving couple are about to have a holiday when they are killed in a tragic car accident and discover that they are dead and trapped in their old style house. Then some posers from New York move in and they decide to try to get rid of them, but have a hard time doing it.<br/><br/>First they simply try to scare them, but are ignored, and when they get the art of haunting developed, they are ten welcomed by the family who wants to use them as a show piece. All this time, a mischievous demon named Beetlejuice is attempting to get into the ghost's good books so that he might help remove these people.<br/><br/>This movie is quite different from your traditional horror movie, not only do we see the ghost's point of view and feel for them as they love the house as it is being butchered, we also perceive them as being an innocent party. In fact, the movie twists on the traditional haunted house theme where the people living in the house are good and the ghosts are bad. Here we actually become acquainted with the ghosts and perceive things from their point of view. As such we end up sympathising with the ghosts and detesting the humans, but the movie continues to twist for as the ghosts begin to accept these humans, so do we.<br/><br/>This is a very clever film from a masterful filmmaker. I enjoyed it, and see that it seems to try to explore the nature of humanity, and warp our understanding of good and evil. It looks at the human condition, and uses death to show the pointlessness of many conflicts that can occur."
"KnightsofNi11","7","1","1","22 December 2010"," Morbid fun
","Tim Burton is quite the visionary. He has a knack for the dark, strange, and off-kilter. He also has the ability to creatively combine such elements with comedy, and yet also leave behind an aura of existential reflection. His films often create some sort of deeper emotion in the viewer, making a lot of his films dramas disguised as comedies. However, put all that to the wayside because Beetle Juice is just Mr. Burton having fun. The movie is about two people who die before going on vacation. Their ghosts remain in there house, where they must live for eternity. The problem arises when a family of nutty art freaks move into their house and start to take it apart and give it their own ""artistic"" flare. In order to get rid of these people they call upon the undead conman Beetleguese (pronounced beetle-juice like the title of the film). Wacky and grotesque situations occur from here, taking us on a bizarre ride.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's true artistic form comes through most of all in this film. The design of the characters and settings in this film are very cool. Particularly the spirit world, which is set up as a busy public office, reminding me a lot of a DPS office or a post office. Of course everything has some sort of ghostly flare to it and everything is very fun to look at and admire the work put into designing these aspects of the film. Then of course the people in this spirit world are equally crazy. The rule of thumb is that the way you look in the spirit world is the way you looked when you died. So I'm sure you can guess that there are some interesting looking people in this world. There's everything from a shrunken head victim to zombified football players who evidently died in some sort of crash. All of the main characters, especially Beetleguese himself, look very strange and off the wall, giving the film its consistently morbid yet humorous feel.<br/><br/>That tone is one of my favorite things about the film. Obviously, the whole film deals with death. But this morbid idea is made into something very fun and different. The film is never depressing or overtly morbid, instead it's a sarcastic kind of morbid that makes you laugh at the irony of the whole situation these characters get themselves into. It also helps when the characters are the same kind of satirical oddness. All of the characters are very unique and very fun and the cast does a great job portraying it.<br/><br/>Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin play the two leads, Adam and Barbara. They do a great job as the quiet newlyweds who don't want a lot out of life, but end up getting mixed up in so much more than they bargain for. They open the film very well, but it really gets nutty when the new family moves into their house after they die. This new family of three consists of two bizarre parents played by Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara. Jones plays Charles, the short tempered father who wants nothing more to relax in his new country home. Catherine O'Hara is the mother of the family, Delia, who is an aspiring ""artist."" Her character makes a lot of fun of the artists in this world who take abstract art way to far, so much that it just looks silly and makes no sense at all. She is neurotic and high strung, making her a hilarious character throughout the film. A young and beautiful Winona Ryder plays Lydia, the Gothic daughter of the family who is very into self-expression through bizarre and overzealous clothing. Then of course there's Michael Keaton as Beetleguese who is so grotesquely entertaining from start to finish.<br/><br/>I can't say a whole lot about this movie other than it simply being fun. It isn't a life changing film. It is brilliant and it is far from one of the best movies ever made. But it is definitely fun and holds plenty of entertainment. I got plenty of laughs from the film which is carried very well by a funny cast playing great characters. Tim Burton creates a fun visual experience in Beetle Juice so I wouldn't recommend missing this film. It's well worth the watch."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","1","24 November 2010"," Unpredictable ""Beetlejuice"" is effectively odd enough to be a classic
","What a peculiar film. Tim Burton's first major film was and still is anything but typical. Although his imagination only gets the credit for bringing this strange concept to life, not conceiving it, it's clear why Burton has gone on to have the career he's had. ""Beetlejuice"" blends the supernatural world with the real one and does it with a wry sense of humor the entire time. Nothing about ""Beetlejuice"" is predictable, yet it goes off without a hitch, rarely missing. That's what any truly innovative classic does.<br/><br/>Like very few but many great characters in cinema history, Beetlejuice steals the show despite a glaring lack of screen time. ""Beetlejuice"" in reality should probably not be titled as such. The film focuses on The Maitlands, a married couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who die in a car accident and find themselves living as ghosts in their large former home even after the pretentious and dysfunctional Deetz family has moved in. Finding that whenever they try and leave their house they enter a bizarre sand world full of carnivorous worms, the couple desperately attempts to scare the Deetzes away, but to no avail. They soon learn Lydia, the daughter (Winona Ryder), can actually see them.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) comes into the picture as a ghost who claims to be able to scare the living better than anyone. Full of gusto, Beetlejuice is an inappropriate, obnoxious, outspoken and not to mention decaying figure who can only be called into the world of the living when someone says his name thrice. Keaton makes him out to be the awful creature he is, but you're definitely left wanting him more on screen anyway.<br/><br/>""Beetlejuice"" has an amusing way of walking the line between supernatural and real. Burton gives the film a very realistic tone, in part by basing much of the action in the real world but mostly by portraying the Maitlands as normal people coping with being ghosts. The fantastical and bizarre moments are lightening fast and all the more humorous for it. As the Maitlands try initially to scare the Deetzes, suddenly a closet will open and we'll see Davis hanging and ripping her face off, but the Deetzes can't see her. The ""aw, shucks"" mentality upon failure makes it all the more amusing. <br/><br/>Basically, what normally would be used as scare tactics are embraced as opportunities for humor. Burton decides that simply because it's the afterlife doesn't mean the tone has to fit the scary pagan image or the heaven/hell image. A bit into the story already, Baldwin's character asks out in the open, ""is this heaven?"" and the comment receives no legitimate consideration. For Burton and writers Michael McDowell and Larry Wilson, it's whatever they darn well want it to be.<br/><br/>Then there's the random factor. After establishing ""Beetlejuice"" as a spontaneous and expectation-breaking film, the living characters all break out into Harry Belafonte's ""Day O"" at the dinner table as part of the Maitlands' plan. The unforgettable scene has no rhyme or reason, something would likely fail in most other films, but Burton sets the tone so well for ""Beetlejuice"" that we embrace the random musical outburst.<br/><br/>The pervasive strangeness of ""Beetlejuice"" and its inability to stick to any kind of sensible or effective plot structure for its short running time make the story itself so-so. It's the tone of ""Beetlejuice"" and the memorable scenes and images it creates that makes Burton's first significant directing achievement a classic.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","The plot of this movie is definitely a unique one that has never been done before, that is for sure. The Maitland couple dies and starts their afterlife but are confined the their house that they previously owned. But as they are just ghosts, a new family moves in which is made up of a money scheming father, a artistic greedy stepmother, and a lonely daughter. The ghost couple make friends with the daughter, but it is their goal to make this obnoxious nuisance of a family and their cronies to leave the premises and themselves in peace. While they attempt to go through with their plans and figure out this new strange existence, they run into and seek the help of a ""bio-exorcist"" or scarer-of-the-living named Beetlejuice. He turns out to be crude unconventional rebel rouser and a real problem.<br/><br/>With a story as zany and morbidly themed as this, Tim Burton was the only logical choice, naturally the man for the job. This film also brought us one of many wonderful collaborations with the musical genius Danny Elfman. A side to Michael Keaton that I had never seen before was revealed through his character, it added a new depth to his skill in acting. While I did enjoy the overall idea of the strange and unusual film, it was far from perfect. The makeup was exquisite which it deservingly won an Academy Award for, but some of the other effects looked straight out of fake looking theme park attraction. It had the meticulously detailed diorama and the up close version that was even more fascinating when they switch over to that world, yet they also had ridiculously cheesy characters that brought the overall appearance down. I thoroughly enjoy stop motion animation but it's presence in much of the film seemed out of place and unnecessary.<br/><br/>To be honest, I am surprised that this film is so popular. It seems like a film that would appeal to very few, yet it draws people in. This movie made it on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest Comedies. While I did find some parts amusing, a lot of the humor was really corny. The singing scenes were simply awful and I found Beetlejuice more offensive and annoying than comedic. The story also seemed to not be very focused. We had about seven main characters and no sense of direction. While I did love some aspects of it, I found more of it to just be disappointing."

","This movie is well worth watching, though I think the problem more often is accomplishing NOT watching it during one of its 30-40 showings a week on Comedy Central, WGN, TBS, TNT, or the Disney Channel.<br/><br/>I find myself watching Beetlejuice every now and then when it comes on, but have noticed that I always turn it off half-way through.  The opening of this movie, with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the daffy and clueless Maitlands, then the fun advent of Catherine O'Hara as the ditzy artist without a clue and Jeffrey Jones as her suffering and pretentious husband is an absolute riot.  As the Maitlands try to run these flakes out of their home we get a thoroughly wacky view of the afterlife.  I must admit I'm not that thrilled with the stereotypically Goth character in Winona Ryder (she is capable of much better).  But, this stuff is darn fun.  The scenes in the afterlife office are particularly fun.<br/><br/>Then Michael Keaton positively steals the show.  And, he should be arrested for it.  Keaton plays ""the ghost with the most"", an obvious stand-up act that takes over the remainder of the movie.  Any possibilities for interesting scenes are robbed by an endless tirade of ""I'm gross"" jokes. He's not that bad at it, but it's BORING.  You rapidly get fatigued and tune it out.  It's like they decided to take several strong actors and turn them all into props.  It ruins the entire second half of the movie."

","Beetlejuice was the second big budget film from visionary Tim Burton and is the first film were you see some of his later trademarks come in. The film is packed with dark comedy, comical horror, offbeat performances and Gothic visuals that have become a mainstay in most of his movies. It has a lot going for it, but the execution holds the film back. <br/><br/>The story focuses on young couple Adam and Barbara Maitland who are killed in a car crash, yet they live on as ghosts in their home. Problems arise when a strange family move into the house and any attempts to get rid of them prove to be useless. The only solace the Maitland's get is with the young daughter who happens to be able to see them. The Maitland's are left with no choice but to hire crazy 'Bio- Exorcist' Beetlejuice who guarantees to get rid of the family. The premise is an extremely inventive one, the idea of ghosts expelling humans does sound very funny and starts off well here. The problem lies within how it's told as the film loses focus the longer it goes on. The film lacks coherence as a lot of things come from nowhere and aren't explained well.<br/><br/>The cast all do solid jobs. Alec Baldwin is very good in a reserved and very naturalistic performance as Adam, he comes off as a likable everyday person which means the ghost scenario genuinely confuses him. Geena Davis also puts in a very good turn as the laid-back and sweet natured Barbara. She too has a real sense of likability to her and the chemistry between her and Baldwin comes off as sincere. Winona Ryder is good as the goth inspired daughter Lydia. Ryder does have a good screen presence and comes across as innocently charming. Catharine O'Hara is excellent as the eccentric and obsessive Delia, she has a great sense of comic timing that is put to good use. Jeffery Jones is also great as calm Charles. However Michael Keaton steals the show as the equally bizarre, wacky and hilarious title character. His energetic expressions, exuberant delivery and knack for physical comedy work brilliantly here.<br/><br/>Visually the film is a typical Burton one with bright designs mixed in with the Gothic styling he usually goes for. The ghost world that is created is really imaginative and the colour scheme used adds to the supernatural theme nicely. The humour is a problem with the film. At times it doesn't go as far with the comedy as it should do which means that most of the comic sequences are wasted while when does go comically over-the-top, the calypso scene, it just feels forced. The scenes in the afterlife offices and the ones involving Beetlejuice were the only ones that had the ability to draw the laughs naturally. The comic horror aspects are used effectively and balance out with the straight up comedy well. The special effects are very weak too. They are extremely dated and the usage of Claymation looks very fake these days. The music from Danny Elfman is quite good and carries that quirky dark sound that works perfectly well with in the film. <br/><br/>On the whole Beetlejuice does have a fun premise and a brilliant Keaton performance, yet it lacks a fluid structure and truly funny moments to become anything great."

","What interested me about beetlejuice was the highly innovative concept. However, after the innitial ohhing and ahhing about it, I got a little bored. I really didn't get into this movie like the majority did although I thought the whole conception of the idea was brillient. When I think of Beetlejuice now, I think of a cute innovative film with great acting that in spite of it all, bored me silly at times."
"ben-1047","8","3","6","9 June 2009"," Keaton - Oscar?
","His performance is one of the greatest, yet under rated, ever to grace the screen - <br/><br/>a Scene stealing, manically energetic, wonderfully over the top performance - a startling mix of German Expressionism and a bloated pervert at a porn expo. <br/><br/>The great thing about Keaton here is that though playing the villain, he is characteristically slimy, however, incredibly lovable. Keaton creates a character that is incredibly mad, and attractive because of this.<br/><br/>His performance is the truest epitome of what Tim Burton has been trying to capture on screen ever since. This Burton's best film and Keaton's most awe inspiring performance.<br/><br/>Even though it was made in the late 80's, the performance still manages to thrill."

"oldsaurora","1","8","26","3 August 2003"," A stupid, stupid movie
","This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The concept is quite original and could have been interesting if done well, but it wasn't.  The story went no where even though they could have done some interesting stuff with it.  As it is the film degenerated, as Roger Ebert pointed out in his review, into a series of gimmicks.  It was supposed to be funny but I laughed maybe once or twice.  Actually it was more like a chuckle.  Most of the time I was in agony and bored out of my mind.<br/><br/>The characters were all uninteresting and I really didn't care what happened to any of them.  There was no character development. The couple that moved into the house were annoying yuppies, and the bubbly giddiness at the start of the film followed by their stupidity later on made the Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin couple almost insufferable.  Only Winona Ryder's character was tolerable.  Beetlejuice inexplicably seemed like an afterthought, which is probably a good thing since he was more annoying than anything else. Pretty much every character was stupid, especially the married couple who couldn't find a way to scare anyone despite the fact that they were ghosts - their attempts were just pathetic, but I guess they had to be in order to keep the story going.  What?  Scare them right and the movie ends?  Oh, how I wish! If the movie went one hour instead of two I would double my rating. Furthermore, the way characters reacted to the situations they were in was illogical to say the least.<br/><br/>**Possible Spoiler**<br/><br/>Late in the movie when the married couple speaks to the case worker at her desk, they show her what they plan to do to once and for all scare the new family away.  They mutilate their faces, but why should we believe that will work, and better yet why did the case worker say ""not bad""?  At that point the new family was already not taking the ghosts seriously, despite the fact that they had tried something even more radical already (the dinner scene with the dancing and hands coming out of the table).<br/><br/>**End of Spoiler**<br/><br/>So this is all supposed to signify Tim Burton's genius?  Umm, yeah, okay. I guess if you do something unique it will automatically be labeled as genius by a lot of people.  Unique?  Yes.  Interesting?  No.  Genius?  Definitely not.<br/><br/>The only redeeming quality of the film was Winona Ryder.  Not for her performance mind you - not her fault, she had little to work with - but only because I think she's stunning.<br/><br/>A truly bad film - 1/10"
"son_of_cheese_messiah","4","3","7","9 July 2011"," Beetlejuice
","This starts very well with an original and interesting take on the afterlife. The prospect of two naive but likable ghosts having to learn their haunting skills on the job was delightful. As was the depiction of a monstrous bureaucracy behind the scenes, not far removed from Terry Gilliam's Brazil.<br/><br/>Had the second half proceeded along these lines, this would have been a true classic.<br/><br/>Alas, things start to go downhill with the appearance of the title character, one of the most annoy characters in cinematic history, not made any better by Michael Keaton's mannered performance. One is grateful that he does not put in much of an appearance.<br/><br/>The film then abandons any attempt at intelligence to instead go in for a lot of gimmickry. The reaction of the family to the dinner table haunting could have been made plausible if the haunting had not been so wildly over the top. Nor is it clear where Baldwin and Davies acquire the ability to control humans and create disembodied hands. They do not demonstrate this skill anywhere else.<br/><br/>More overblown (but unfunny) scenes kill any willing suspension of disbelief leading to the rushed and clunking finale."

"croutonsofdeath","9","2","4","14 September 2009"," Surreal and ingenious black comedy, one of the best!
","Tim Burton is a man to be commended for his imagination, and Beetlejuice, his second ""mainstream"" theatrical film, is pure undiluted Burton. All the imagination comes out in this wonderful film. It's a black comedy, although not too dark to be called ""bleak."" In a way, it's actually very cartoonish, thanks to Burton's brilliant direction that leads to many surreal scenes. Beetlejuice himself is a marker of insanity, his contrasts to the main characters are visible from a mile away. While Beetlejuice is a filthy, loudmouthed, perverted, and ultimately quite twisted, the Maitland's are calm and down to Earth, acting much like they would had they never even died. Each character in this film has their own unique quirk, even the ""extras"" that appear in the afterlife. Many nameless characters are memorable just by their looks.<br/><br/>With all of Burton's madness running amok, it's hard not to laugh or delight over the exquisite detail put into the films finer work. While the special effects may not ""wow,"" the stop motion is great and represents Burton's style in a very refined way, and the makeup is still impressive years later, especially the scene where Adam and Barbara are briefly resurrected. No wonder it won an Oscar for it.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with Beetlejuice is that I felt if they had added a little more time on, some ideas hinted at could be realized in a better way. There are many ideas that are called attention to, but ultimately ignoured. Even the malevolent sandworms and their nameless homeland are mentioned and shown, but their purpose or origin are never explained. Beetlejuice himself raises some questions as well, where he's from, how he got into the Maitland's house, and there are some plot holes considering how to resurrect him; by saying his name Three Times, yet they never explain why *he* can't say his name, and if saying it three times resurrects him or gives him power, why does saying it again banish him? It deserves a little more explanation.<br/><br/>Despite that, Beetlejuice is a very fun watch, and if you haven't seen it even 21 years after it's release, go out and find a copy right now!"

","The Maitlands and The Dietzes: two families who have nothing in common except the house they both live in. So what's the twist? Well, actually...the Dietzes are a family you'd probably WANT to see dead. The Maitlands? They already are.<br/><br/>Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) and her husband, Adam (Alec Baldwin), have just moved into a sweet little country house, when the unthinkable happens...thanks to a freak car accident, the whole line about ""till Death do us part"" has actually taken on a whole new meaning for them. But they've been parted from life, not from each other. And if you're thinking that death is all that different from the life they just left behind, think again. The Afterlife can be just as fraught with complications and peril, not the least of which finds the poor couple stranded in an 'alternative universe'-version of their house.<br/><br/>Enter the Dietzes. Pretentious, social-status fixated richies Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and Delia (Catherine O'Hara) and their Goth-obsessed daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder), who proceed to turn the Maitlands' quaint little cottage into an avant-garde nightmare that only Hieronymus Bosch - or Salvador Dali - could love. <br/><br/>What are two frustrated, spatially-stranded spooks to do? There's actually a sort of ""Health and Haunted Services"" system in the Great Beyond that provides assistance in the form of caseworkers (who are about as helpful in death as they are in life), and Adam and Barbara's ""help"" comes in the form of the cynical and cancerous Juno, (the great Sylvia Sidney), who goes completely by the book...but does tip the deceased darlings off to one dangerously unpredictable possibility for a resolution of their problem.<br/><br/>His name, as you know by now, is Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) - or as more commonly known - ""Beetlejuice."" He's a caseworker turned ""independent contractor"", which means he's bad news for the Maitlands, worse news for the Dietzes, and the best thing to happen to horror-comedies since three guys named Venkman, Spengler and Stanz. Say his name three times, and let the mirthful mayhem begin!<br/><br/>Audiences couldn't get enough of Tim Burton's uniquely twisted perspective on the world after his first major movie, PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE exploded onto movie screens, and no one knew what to expect for his follow-up. Good thing, too, because there was no way to anticipate or explain this screwy and satisfying story of ghosts being haunted by a living family more scary than they are, and the outrageous entity out to fleece them both for his own purposes, (not the least of which is to get a little cuddle time in with the languishingly lovely Lydia.)<br/><br/>How a literal army of writers managed to put together a script this good is beyond me, but after multiple viewings, this is still Number One for the title of Funniest Frightfest around.<br/><br/>Burton was laying the groundwork for his revolving company of players with BEETLEJUICE as well. Besides Jeffrey Jones as the nerd-alert of a husband, there's Glenn Shadix as the fey Otho, Delia's co-designer/co-conspirator in making over the Maitlands' house and the ""exorcism"" that follows, and Ryder, of course, in her breakout role which would be followed by her turn in HEATHERS, guaranteeing her status as the Eighties' ""It "" girl.<br/><br/>And besides the trademark hallucinogenic visuals and blackly funny sense of humor, there was that casting. Bringing Davis, Baldwin and the manic Keaton together was a masterstroke of both luck and genius, and who else could take Sylvia Sidney, Robert Goulet and DICK CAVETT, put them in the same movie and actually make them ""cool?"" It certainly wouldn't be the last time he would make that feat happen, but the timing and the end result would arguably never be more perfect.<br/><br/>BEETLEJUICE is a must-have for any movie library, whether you collect comedy OR horror. It can exist easily in both worlds...kind of like the Maitlands and the Dietzes."

","After they die, Adam (Baldwin) and Barbara (Davis) come back to their house as ghosts and find a family is moving in and the couple try to scare them away with help from bio-exorcist Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>Tim Burton's reputation as the darkest and most Gothic director started here with a bizarre but wonderfully different tale of the dead and is both funny, and yet psychological scary, and brings a niche to the market in a strange and sophisticated way.<br/><br/>The film has a terrific opening with Danny Elfman's score exquisite to the bird's eye view of the town going past and the upbeat music plays right into our hands and will gear you up ready for the horror and excitement to begin.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) impresses as ambitious Adam and has good on screen chemistry with Geena Davis (Thelma and Louise) and the pair create many laughs and are a joy to watch, especially when playing around with the sheets.<br/><br/>Winona Ryder (Girl, interrupted) gives a great performance as Lydia, the weird and wonderful teenager, who gives the film a more serious and realistic feel against Keaton's comic Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>The star of the show is Keaton (Batman) who plays bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, a crazed man who is evil, eccentric and enjoyable to watch, because he is weird and different, one of Tim Burton's finest creations, right up there with Edward Scissorhands. Beetlejuice is just so weird that he is almost lovable. What makes these characters work is the writing.<br/><br/>The plot is very consistent, if seeming a bit weird and far fetched to begin, with plenty of dark humour and amazing characters. There is plenty of physical comedy and some slapstick which spreads the humour through different characters. The dialogue is pitched well, also giving some cheesy but really likable puns on the dead.<br/><br/>The ideology of ghosts is covered well, playing on human interpretations and putting twists and turns on this idea, and making it funny through a book for the dead.<br/><br/>The settings make this different to, with a different look upon heaven and hell, and the model of the town plays a great small yet significant setting. The colour and lighting hep achieve the dark and sinister feel of the narrative, as does the Oscar winning make up.<br/><br/>Tim Burton has created some wonderful films in his directing career, and whereas this film isn't as powerful as Sweeney Todd or Edward Scissorhands, it is easily the funniest and a joy to watch"

","Michael Keaton is hilarious in this wonderfully bizarre tale of life after death.  One of the best things about the story is that it develops well with its central characters, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as they try to figure out what is going on and what to do about the new people moving in.  In Beetlejuice, the title character played by Keaton is a supporting character. In fact he doesn't make his first full appearance until an hour into the movie, by then its highly anticipated and I guarantee it won't disappoint you.  In this way, the movie doesn't beat you to death with one character's antics the entire time like Ace Ventura.  Instead it has a great plot and solid execution, so when Keaton's Betelgeuse comes onto the screen its extra special and tons and tons of fun. Burton's directing is solid, Danny Elfman's score is marvelous, and Keaton simply turns in the performance of a lifetime."

","Betelgeuse, Betelgeuse, Betelge... dare I say it? Director Tim Burton would follow-up his directorial oddball debut (""PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE"") with another ambitious comedy, this time something very zany, grotesque and surreal in the shape of a riotous supernatural dark spoof. As a kid I grew up watching this film, hey, I even liked the cartoon series. So re-watching it again was a sheer delight. Something I would never tire of.<br/><br/>Burton would bring his signature visual gothic flair and live-action cartoon mannerisms to enliven the shallow, dressed up lifestyles in ""BEETLEJUICE"", but what really makes the feature is the very loose performance of Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse. Keaton is outstanding in bringing this outrageously rotten character to life, from being menacing, charming the ladies, or simply exorcising a wise-crack. He's truly a head-spin. While he provides a huge impact, the Beetlejuice character doesn't really get a whole lot of screen time, despite his importance to the plot's progression. It's measured in bursts, as his character is virtually a punch-line with legs. But with that in mind, I think it works because Burton never overplays his hand, which makes Keaton's conman persona effective than say overbearing. I don't know if Burton would do the same thing these days.<br/><br/>Anyway the narrative was always about Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin's recently deceased young rural couple adapting to the afterlife, while at the same time doing their best to frighten the house's new city-folk occupants that have ideas of changing their new home to meet their own trendy needs. So in a last ditch effort to scare them off they seek help from a freelance bio-exorcist ghost known as Betelgeuse. The compulsive plotting won't surprise (even though Burton throws up an interesting view of the afterlife), but what stands out is the wonderful set-pieces (how can you not grove along to the dinner party sequence as The Banana Boat Song plays), eccentric practical effects (loved the clay-animation), inspired pastel set-designs and wrapping it all together is Danny Elfman's enchantingly whimsical music score. One colorful dimension after another, but even with its comic flourishes it still demonstrates a nasty wickedness.<br/><br/>Add to that an amusing cast, peppered with character actors and zesty interplays. Davis and Baldwin were likably good. Jeffery Jones is enjoyably clueless and Catherine O'Hara makes a great ice queen. Winona Ryder is fittingly deadpan as the very aware gothic teenage daughter and Glen Shadix entertains as the family's psychic friend. Also showing up in a memorable part is Silva Sidney as an afterlife caseworker.<br/><br/>""BEETLEJUICE"" is a decorative haunted house fun ride and one of Burton's best."

","Is this another musical? Ha no not really, but there are a couple of songs and a lot more grotesque stuff than I recall. The music is courtesy of Danny Elfman of course, as with most of Tim Burtons films, they must really like each other. Burton has an odd view of the world, creating his own with a weird mix of cookie-cutter America, small towns, with dark under-bellies. Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davies) are a young couple living... for a short while in a typically quirky Burtonesque house. Within 5 minutes they're dead, having taken their car for a swim off a nearby bridge and wind up living an afterlife in their house, now covered with dust sheets. Not for long though, the house has new owners, the mum from Home Alone, Ed Rooney from Ferris Bueller and their daughter Winona Ryder, the only one who can see Adam and Barbara, who are trapped in the house, failing in their ghostly attempts to scare off the new occupants ruining their home. So far, it's okay, but things really are a bit slow, despite a couple of quirky scenes involving sand worms and the waiting room from hell. Until the arrival of Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice, who they call upon as a Bio-exorcist to get back their home. They're warned not to enlist his help, from a chain-smoking lady with a cut throat, who tells them they ought to learn to haunt the house themselves. Which they do, but it turns out The Deets like being haunted, having poltergeists is cool, an asset, especially after possessing their dinner guests in the hilarious 'Day O' scene. Once they've unleashed Beetlejuice through, there's no going back and from here on in, it's an utterly bonkers, off the wall, surreal trip... at least in its design at least, plot-wise it's pretty mundane. Beetlejuice is loud, ugly, filthy in several senses of the word, loud, angry, unhinged, creepy, loud, annoying, perverted, loathsome, lecherous and loud. Totally at odds with Adam and Barbara's preferred way of haunting, y'know, nicely. He's the villain and as the story unfolds, it turns out he's quite pointless too. It's a mix of silly and inappropriate. It might've worked in 1988, but I'm afraid it's dated really badly. The story is simplistic, the characters universally a bit irritating, the special effects, well they're of their day and there's something to be said for that at least. It's heavy on in camera effects and trickery. The make-up department must've had a lot of fun, but I found myself having very little. I know it's much loved and it's not without it's charms. One of Burton's first outings, it's ambitious, creative and stamps his mark, there's a lot to be said for that. It now feels very much the cult film, those who remember and loved it in the 80s, will probably still enjoy it for it's stand out nature, but otherwise revisiting it can be a bit disappointing."

","This film is one that I remember watching all of the time growing up. My father bought it on VHS and it was one that I always just remember having. The funny thing is, I don't really remember watching it from the beginning so it must have been a recorded VHS. This was definitely a staple of my sister and my childhood. The synopsis is the spirits of a deceased couple are harassed by an unbearable family that moved into their home. They hire a malicious spirit to drive them out.<br/><br/>We start off getting the lay of the land for a small town in Connecticut. We go to a big house where the married couple of Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) live. They are currently taking a vacation at home for two weeks and that starts today. They're bothered by their friend Jane Butterfield (Annie McEnroe) who's a realtor and trying to get them to sell the house as it is too big for them. There's a touchy moment where the couple wants children, it just hasn't yet.<br/><br/>They go into town to get some supplies for Adam's model of the town, but on the way back they avoid hitting a dog and crash into the river. They return home, sopping wet. A fire has started in their fireplace on its own and they use it to warm up. As they do, Barbara's fingers catch on fire, but she doesn't feel it. They then realize they're dead. There's a handbook entitled 'Handbook for the Recently Deceased' that appears in their house. Baldwin tries to read through it, but he states that it reads like stereo instructions. When he goes outside of the door, he is transported to a desert where there are these giant sand worms patrolling.<br/><br/>We then get a quick cut to a man reading a newspaper, his name we will learn is Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton). He goes to the obituary page which he calls the classifieds. He sees the welcoming to the afterlife for Adam and Barbara.<br/><br/>Their plan is to live a nice quiet life as dead people, when a family starts to move in. They are from New York. The father is Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and his wife is a sculptor and loves art, Delia (Catherine O'Hara). Charles has an odd and gothic daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). Delia's friend also joins them, who's an interior decorator and later claims to be a paranormal expert Otho (Glenn Shadix). These two go about the rooms deciding what to do to it to renovate. This angers Adam and Barbara who try to scare them. The problem is they don't see the things they try to do. They try to go into the attic, but Adam's body runs past to lock the door. While they're up there, Lydia notices them from the window.<br/><br/>As this couple tries to figure out what to do, a commercial comes on their television from Betelgeuse. He offers to get rid of the family and they consider it. Adam did read in the manual that if they need help to draw a door. This takes them to a different world where it is like going to a social worker. It is there they meet their case manager Juno (Sylvia Sidney). They need to decide to scare them out or to learn to co-exist. She tells them not use Betelgeuse whatever they do and she tells them the truth of him. Adam and Barbara befriend Lydia and have to decide what to do.<br/><br/>Now I've already kind of said this, but growing up, I loved watching this film and it's even more enjoyable now. There were a lot of jokes in this film that went over my head that now cracked me up this time around. I will lead off that there I used to work for a company that was for profit as we did social work for the county. It is interesting that Otho makes an off the cuff comment that if you kill yourself, you become a civil servant in the afterlife. He's exactly right because Juno and all of her staff seemed to have committed suicide. I never caught on and that's an interesting punishment.<br/><br/>We also get the issue of clashing lifestyles. Adam and Barbara live a modest lifestyle. He owns the local hardware store and they really have simple things they enjoy. Jane feels their house is too big and wants to sell it. Charles had a breakdown at work, but it seems like he was ruthless and great at what he did. Delia doesn't want to leave the city, but she will for her husband who was the breadwinner. It is interesting that he wants to relax, yet he can't turn it off when he thinks he has a gold mine in this new town. He even pitches things to his former boss, Maxie Dean (Robert Goulet).<br/><br/>Going back to the afterlife, there's just a huge world here. They have a manual, rules and regulations as well as different workers that can help for different things. Since they're dead, there's also a lot of waiting. It is funny that Betelgeuse is kind of like a conman we would see in injury lawyers or the like. The amount of back-story here is great.<br/><br/>That will move me to the pacing, which I'm not going to lie, I've seen this so many times I thought it was longer. I was shocked to see that it runs 92 minutes. It was through this last viewing I realized there isn't much filler. We get introduced to our main couple and their tragedy happens pretty quickly. The new family then moves in and it shows Adam and Barbara not only trying to get a hang on being dead, but what to do with them. There's some really good comedy here, which hurts the overall tension, but it does add to the enjoyment for sure. The ending is cute and actually works for the overall feel the movie is going for.<br/><br/>Which takes me to the acting for this film, which is also really good. Baldwin and Davis work so well together. They're on similar wave lengths and they really seem like a loving couple. It's interesting to see in life they don't really play by the norms and it is fitting for them in death as well. Keaton is absolutely great in this role. It is iconic and he adds his own quirkiness to the role. O'Hara is great as the pretentious art person from New York as well as Shadix. I went through a phase that was similar to Ryder and I think she does a good job here as well. Jones and the rest of the cast work well together to round out this movie as well.<br/><br/>As for the effects, I'm surprised to see how well they still hold up from the late 80's. We really don't get much blood, but it isn't that type of movie. Everything I'm assuming was done practically and it shows. The snake version of Betelgeuse is quite creepy and we really get that Tim Burton feel as he incorporates German Expressionism into real life. The office in the afterlife is great and feels like a distorted version of an office I used to work in. I think the look that Adam and Barbara take on when they think they're just going to scare the family out as well. It is also shot very well and no complaints there.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. Danny Elfman was in charge and he definitely killed this one. It is funny is that a podcast I listen to used to use the beginning song and I never put it together. It really mixes the creepy vibe into it and it fits for what we are seeing for sure. I actually revisit songs from this film pretty regularly while I'm writing.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this is a film that I have a lot of nostalgia for, but after this last viewing I actually realize there's a lot of depth I didn't notice. I think this has a great idea of clashing lifestyles with these two different families and seeing if they can co-exist despite it. It is interesting concept of the afterlife not being too different from what we live in now. It doesn't waste any time getting into this and the running time flies by. The acting is really good after across the board. There's not a lot in the way of effects, but what we get is practical and there's a lot in just the aesthetic to the movie. The soundtrack is also great and really fits the feel of the film. I think this is a really good film that you can watch to introduce kids into the genre. There are some things that will go over their head and adults can enjoy for sure. I highly recommend giving this a viewing for sure."

","Barbara and Adam are a perfectly cute couple together, and enjoying their nice new home. Things are going great, until an accident behind the wheel claims both of their lives. They quickly catch on to the fact that they are dead, but they haven't moved on, they are still living in the house...as ghosts. Upon finding a book in the house, which is a handbook for the recently deceased, they have everything they need to know to live their lives in the land of the dead, which includes haunting and scaring people if needed. There's only one problem: Neither one understands the book. And the time to haunt and scare is now, because new people have arrived in their home. This family is unacceptably weird. The only one in the family who can carry on a decent and intelligent conversation with is Lydia, who Barbara quickly becomes fond of, but the rest? Not so much. A few haunts and scares go unnoticed, and Adam and Barbara are becoming annoyed by living with this insane household at breakneck speed. Desperate for help, they call for an emergency, which requests them to ""draw"" a door. Unaware of the fact that they are going to be spending over 100 years in this house, and unaware that these emergency calls are very limited, they learn that they have a case worker who may be able to help them. Their case worker, a cranky but likable old woman, doesn't see that they need any help, that they just need to read and understand the handbook that was provided for them. Frustrated by the book because they can't understand it, they become extremely desperate to rid this family. How? This family is just too weird to scare away. Late one night, an ad for a bio exorcist appears, an unsettling but energetic guy who calls himself Beetleguise ( Beetlejuice is easier to say), they are both intrigued, but hesitant of asking for help, especially since he's exposed just how wacky he is. When Barbara asks about him to Juno, their case worker, she strongly warns and suggests that they do not want his help, that they need to get the family out themselves. She explains briefly about him being problematic, that he used to work for her. Desperate for help, however, they turn to Beetlejuice by calling upon his name three times. Beetlejuice appears, very hyper, very unorthodox, but very eager to do something destructive. Thinking that this is the solution to their problems was a bad move. Now released, and with no way of knowing how to put him back where he came from, Adam and Barbara have unleashed a new problem to their list. Beetlejuice is good at what he does, but he does what he wants, not what's asked of him. And Beetlejuice is after Lydia, who Barbara has become very protective over. What does Beetlejuice REALLY have planned for this little girl, and can Barbara and Adam figure out a way to stop him. With an imaginative and creative story, and mind blowing special effects ( back then), and a strong cast of characters, Beetlejuice is a perfect escapade from reality for the entire family to enjoy."

","Im gonna be real careful here not to summon the deviant in this picture so here goes
I think the film Beetlejuice is one of Tim Burton's best films and certainly shatters the PG rating and murders it hand in hand
Micheal Keaton is fantastic as Beetlejuice and i did not recognize the actor in the character at all
The animation looks fantastic
Would have loved this film a lot more as a kid but for now I can just say its great due to some of the characters (father and mother of the daughter) being a little too annoying and the lack of Keaton's character in the film.
Will definitely watch again someday."

","Wildly imaginative from the get-go, Tim Burton's original creation is still just as charming and entertaining as it was upon first release. Michael Keaton is perfect in the title role, while Burton has him surrounded by top-notch leading and supporting talent, including a typically hilarious Catherine O'Hara and a star-making turn by Winona Ryder as Lydia Deetz. The movie itself moves at breakneck speed and Burton is in complete command of the medium here, gleefully showing off his funhouse of a movie and its practical effects like a kid in a candy store. Danny Elfman's score has aged particularly well, and remains one of the most identifiable aspects of the movie."

"Screen_Blitz","8","0","0","11 October 2017"," Tim Burton's spooky tongue-in-cheek vision effectively sells this Gothic horror comedy in life
","Mixing elements of Gothic horror and comedy can be a tricky stunt to pull off. Director Tim Burton however, manages to do just that in more than ways one. And if you know the director well enough, you'd know that resorting to usual Hollywood conventions isn't part of his norm. We are talking about a director takes his quirky vision and places it full-throttle to create an entertaining horror-comedy feast that supplements both laughs and scares. His vision is what makes this quirky, yet effectively engaging Gothic horror piece work. Imagine a world where Michael Keaton played a goofy green- haired lunatic that made The Joker look like a cute little snuggle doll by comparison. This concept is brought to life in this infectiously bizarre comedy- horror salad that see Burton exercising his signature style to full extent, pushing the boundaries of youngsters' dark imaginations, but not without having his tongue in his cheek. This film follows Adam (played by Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (played by Geena Davis), a married couple who are driving on a bridge when they swerve off-course while dodging a poor little dog. When the fall ends up killing them, they wake up in the afterlife where their house is being a sold by a family consisting couple Charles and Delia Deetz (played by Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara respectively) and their emo teen daughter Lydia (played by Winona Ryder). Since they (Adam and Barbara) are ghosts, Charles and Deila can't see or hear them. However, it is Lydia who has the mysterious ability to communicate with them. In an effort they scare the family out of there house, the couple must cross paths with an erratic, fast-talking clown only known as Beetlejuice (played by Michael Keaton). It is only too bad that the clown has a more devious plan they do more harm than good. <br/><br/>Wacky and peculiar are the most suitable words to describe what kind of ride you are in for. But as this is Tim Burton, bizarre is what most people should expect. This features Michael Keaton in a role that defies against the usual good guy tapestry that he would resort to later on his career. Keaton exercises the role of the quirky clown-being with appropriate over-the-topness and macabre-type comedic energy that lends plenty of humor to leave audiences snickering beneath the dark Gothic nature of his character and the film itself. The movie has moments of laughter, but most certainly not in the way that will leave you busting your gut with guffaws. After all, it is dark humor that defines the underlining comedic tone while the spooky imagery triumphs over the absurd wackiness. To be more specific, the vast portion of the imagery lies within the world of the afterlife where Adam and Barbara encounter deceased victims who have faced very unpleasant deaths such as a man who has been burnt to meat, an elderly lady who smokes and exhales through the slit in her throat, a headless man, and a later sequence when one of the characters is tasked to pop her eyes out of her skull. And yet this film somehow managed to pass with a PG-rating in an era that introduced the PG-13 rating by the release of the war film 'Red Dawn', not to mention that Keaton also drops an F-bomb in one scene. Nonetheless, Tim Burton brings an expert hand at keeping things moving, and Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis sell themselves in their roles just fine. If there is any detriment to Burton's vision, it is, of course, time as the special effects he incorporates some sequences such as the lead couple being chased by a giant sandworm has grown hideously outdated. And the musical number at the end feels somewhat out of place. But whether Burton is trying to frighten us with his nightmarish imagery or amuse us with the quirky nature of the characters, particularly the eponymous character, he is always inviting us in for the laughs.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is an entertaining piece that mixes comedy and horror in an eccentric fashion that truly works. With all grotesqueness that showers the film, some may question whether it makes for an appropriate children's movie. For my answer, probably not without parental guidance unless the youngsters who dare to watch this are immune to nightmares induced from Tim Burton's campy visual imagery. But with the macabre humor injected into the film's veins, there is enough camp to make for a nice treat for both adults and preteen children alike."

Boy did I have a good time seeing this movie again, being invested with these wonderful characters, and being both in love, disgusted and creeped out by Betelgeuse (Yes, this is how you spell his name). I just love this movie and can't get enough from it. I now agree with me from the past that gave it a 10. This movie deserves a 10, for delivery of pure entertainment full of interesting world building, fun characters (even the Deetz's which you love to hate) and well thought out designs.

You have to haunt a house for a hundred years, your assigned a case worker and receive a handbook for the recently deceased which shows the world building invested in the script. It really enriches the experience and shows that anything can happen yet still make sense by the rules set up.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton playing the title character only appears for thirteen minutes and still remains a screen presence.

","This film is a delightfully nutty ""horror"" movie. Looking back on it from this distance, it was clearly a beginning or near beginning of many a career. Geena Davis was probably the most established star, save, I guess for Michael Keaton, who chewed the scenery relentlessly. Ms. Davis was so cute. This seems to be Tim Burton's first real movie, which set the dark tone for many of his future projects. I'm thinking that this was likely the last time that Alec Baldwin was in any way charming. And this also seemed to have really started Winona Ryder along her career path. As I recall it also re-ignited some interest in the calypso tunes of the long-forgotten Harry Belafonte. The effects seem quaint these days, but were just fine back in the day. Surely just about everyone has seen this one, but if not, check it out."

","1980s Burton/Keaton combo you can't go wrong! Deals with a family haunted by a recently deceased young couple (Baldwin and Davis)—yes, it certainly sounds like a cliché horror movie, but the talented cast and the memorable scenes make it anything but, especially with Keaton in the titular role as an obnoxious ghost trying to permanently scare away the new inhabitants. As with many Burton films, the movie relies heavily on visuals (that were impressive for its time, but are now a tad dated), leaving the audience with a fun ride that is worth revisiting once every few years, but lacks any iconic characters or dialogue worth reciting.<br/><br/>**½ (out of four)"

","Beetlejuice is an extremely morbid but creative and funny movie made by Tim Burton and staring Winona Ryder and Micheal Keaton. It's definitely not for everyone, and a vast majority of its fans are emo and goth teenagers who like it just because it is weird without paying much thought to the story itself, but it has some great acting and soundtrack, a good use of film techniques, and a good script. <br/><br/>Adam and Barbra are a happy couple living in a charming if not creepy house in the country. While driving home one day they swerve to avoid a dog and their car falls off a covered bridge and into a river, and it isn't long before they discover that they're ghosts. After a while the ghost life is alright, and they also discover the Neitherworld, a strange but surprisingly professional land of the dead. However, soon the Deetz family moves in and wants to change everything. The only one who can see Adam and Barbra is the Deetz' goth daughter, Lydia. Adam and Barbra soon find themselves relying on a ""bio-exorcist"" to be rid of the humans, but is he helpful, or harmful? I saw this as a kid and have viewed it once or twice a year; the soundtrack is wonderful, the acting is great, and, let's face it, this certainly is an original story, albeit very dark at times.<br/><br/>My problem with the movie was Lydia's stereotypical goth personality. It is way overdone, to the point where it's annoying and fake and you want to shout, ""okay, she's a goth, she likes weird stuff, we get the point, can we move on with the film?"" Winona Ryder does do a very good acting job, but her character was just another spoiled, angst-ridden kid who think her life is worse off than everybody else's. Her parents offer to build her a darkroom for crying out loud! I wish I had one so that I could stop having to send my photos off to Wal-Mart's inept photo lab. Her reply to her parents' offer is, ""my whole life is a dark room, one big dark room"". They buy her Cantonese food - ""I'm planning to have a stroke from the MSG"". She's spoiled, self-entitled, self-pitying, whiny and annoying. Though her character improves slightly as the film goes on, she still continues to spout gothy lines left and right, and it's just ridiculous. I mean come on, wearing a black lace veil like the ones that widows wear to funerals, to the dinner table? Saying that her goth attitude is the reason she can see ghosts? It's not cool, it's not funny, it's not cute, it's just silly and stupid. It's too bad, because it nearly overclouds Ryder's excellent acting job. <br/><br/>Beetlejuice's character was played very well, as was the role of well-meaning but annoying Delia Deetz. It's a Tim Burton movie so you'll recognize his style within the first fifteen minutes or so.<br/><br/>Check out Beetlejuice, it's pretty good (although my favorite Tim Burton film is Edward Scissorhands). It was also adapted to a cartoon TV series for kids that you might want to see as well."

The movie itself is nothing that special, but it has some good stuff.<br/><br/>I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some.

","There are very few directors currently working in Hollywood today that you will describe as unequivocal auteur of their own films. The few examples you could point to would be Martin Scorsese and Wes Anderson, whose every film almost seems to have been single handily sculpted by their own very bare hands, adorning each with their signature and flare. But as good as those two are, for me the grandmaster of auteur directors in our modern day world of film is indisputably Tim Burton; known for such classics as Edward Scissor Hands and Alice in Wonderland, is the very godfather of black comedies, quirky characters and zany plot lines, three characteristics that I could also use to describe Beetle Juice. An imaginative, eccentric macabre extravaganza that paradoxically inspires both fear and humour in its audience as they sit down entranced by every outlandish, skittle coloured nightmarish frame that Tim Burton wonders us with. <br/><br/>Beetle Juice tells of unfortunate tale of a newlywed couple Barbara and Adam Maitland, (Alex Bald and Geena Davis) find themselves trapped amongst the dead after a fateful accident involving a dog, a river and a bridge. But the mere fact that they are dead, which is quiet hard for them to come to terms with it at first. But that just the good news, the actual worst bit of their predicament is that they find themselves trapped in their house with the excruciatingly irritating Delia Deetz wonderfully played by Catherine O'Hara, who is so annoying she makes all younger brothers and sister the world over look like delightful saints. Delia comes accompanied by her husband Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and their eccentric daughter Lydia, who looks like she could be queen of the Goths as well as a long lost relative of the Adams family all at once, but she turns out to be an actually nice person - I guess you should never judge a book by its cover. But after a lot of failed attempts to scare the Deetz family out of the house, involving such pathetic fêtes as using a bed sheet with eye holes cut out, something that even Casper the friendly ghost would be embarrassed by. The couple admit defeat and turn to the foul mouthed, belching, farting and idiotic self proclaimed ""bio-exorcist"" known as ""Beetle Juice"" played expertly, hilariously and with ferocious abandon by Michael Keaton (Batman). But unlucky for everyone, the deceitful and rotten Beetle Juice is not a person to be trusted... <br/><br/>Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell screenplay is full of laugh out loud moments brought upon by dastardly, demonic one liners that always promise to pack a punch, couple that with Tim Burtons ingeniously choreographed special effects, set designs and make up and styling which they rightly earned Beetle Juice a Oscar for and topped of with perfectly crafted offbeat, wacky performances from the entire cast, all of which help make Beetle Juice a electrifying, exhilaratingly fantastic watch best served with the lights switched off and the volume turned up."

","Love him or hate him, Burton is brilliant in his own wonderful eccentric way and his movies show this.<br/><br/>So without further adu, I present to you my lookback on the 1988 classic Beetlejuice (which is spelled Betelgeuse sometimes after the star) Our protagonists are a newly deceased couple named Adam and Barbara Maitland, played by a young Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis.<br/><br/>While I normally find Alec Baldwin to be creepy especially seeing as in he got cast in bad guy type roles throughout the 90's and not to mention those Hulu adverts where he's an alien, he's actually very likable in this movie.<br/><br/>Both he and Geena do rather well in their performances in this movie and they have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Adam and Barbara get involved in an accident and drown, only to come back as ghosts and to find out that some rather unwanted visitors are moving in.<br/><br/>The so called visitors in this are the eccentric artist Delia Deetz, her husband Charles, their lovely goth daughter Lydia and of course my personal favorite non BJ character - Otho.<br/><br/>Otho (played by Glenn Shadix) is an interior designer/fashion guru and 'paranormal expert' and he has some of the funniest lines in the movie even though he's a bit of a snob.<br/><br/>Delia and Otho plan on redesigning the Maitland's house into what I could best describe as a ""modern art nightmare crossed with Salvador Dali"" and this upsets our two ghostly heroes.<br/><br/>The way ghosts are represented in this movie is very intriguing especially seeing what the afterlife is like, it's like a work office with a room you have to wait in.<br/><br/>Also on an interesting sidenote, you can see a cameo in shadow by Jake and Elwood Blues of the Blues Brothers during the waiting room scene.<br/><br/>Lydia is the only one who can see the ghostly couple, and she forms a bond with them - as they treat her like she's their own child which is very endearing. Live people cannot see them because they ignore the strange and unusual...and she is by definition ""strange and unusual"".<br/><br/>The movie is full of really fun moments as well as scary moments, including some brilliant special effects - no CGI required at all, in fact this is pre-cgi.<br/><br/>This includes when Adam and Barbara pull their faces to make them into their ""Scary/Creature"" forms, the sandworms, and not to mention Beetlejuice himself.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the title character Beetlejuice, who is played by Michael Keaton - and he is fantastic in the role, bringing the right amount of ghoulish grossness and mischief to the role.<br/><br/>He is a blast to watch on screen and his pranks are ingenious, including what does at the end when he turns into a carousell (with might I add....a very early prototype for Jack Skellington on it).<br/><br/>And it's still funny seeing what he did to poor old Otho, changing his outfit to a blue suit. There's nothing scarier to this guy than clothes that are out of style. Am I the only one who feels sorry for poor Otho? Surely i'm not the only one.<br/><br/>This movie was really entertaining when I was little and it still is to this day, and it spawned a theme park attraction and an animated cartoon series. There was also a planned sequel in the works but it didn't come to fruitition.<br/><br/>There were also two action figure lines, one by Kenner based off the movie and another line based off the cartoon. As well as some figures by Neca including ""Stretch-Faced Adam"" and ""Stretched Faced Barbara"" and Beetlejuice with spikes coming out of his body.<br/><br/>The Kenner line had some interesting figures in it with their action figures, why they even had one of Otho! Imagine that...Otho getting an action figure. (note to self: Search on ebay for Otho action figure to go with my Mayor of Halloweentown plush).<br/><br/>The cast is all wonderful, I already mentioned how great Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis were along with Michael Keaton but it's time to mention the other wonderful cast members.<br/><br/>Catharine O Hara (who also starred in SCTV, Canada's answer to SNL alongside my favorite comedian John Candy, as well as being in Home Alone, and the voice of the villainess in Bartok the Magnificent), Jeffrey Jones (who plays Delia's husband, and the year after this movie came out was in Who's Harry Crumb, one of my favorite John Candy movies), Winona Ryder as the lovely Lydia Deetz and of course the late great Glenn Shadix as Otho Fenlock.<br/><br/>I love Shadix's performance in this and I know it's weird but I still tend to quote Otho's lines once and a while (I can actually do a sort of impression of him as well).<br/><br/>The score is beautiful and also very spooky with my favorite piece being the theme tune as well as the Harry Belafonte songs Bananana Boat song and Jump In The Line (okay, I believe you!).<br/><br/>Speaking of the theme tune, I heard it in an episode of the 2002 revival of the Basil Brush show, it was in the episode where Basil and Stephen become mad scientists.<br/><br/>Providing you with laughs from here to the Neitherworld, Beetlejuice is sure to make you scream and laugh at the same time all at once."

","Every Tim Burton picture is capable of inducing many uncontrollable laughs from the audience. On the other hand, it's also able to hypnotize through this specific Burton-y tone and visual style that characterizes all of his productions.<br/><br/>And Beetlejuice is definitely that one picture, which actually started a sudden Burton-mania and put him on the spot as one of the most eccentric and original directors of the 20th century. <br/><br/>When a light-hearted couple, Barbara (Geena Davis) and Adam (Alec Baldwin) Maitland, unexpectedly die one day, they realize that they will be trapped in their own house for another 'couple' of years without any chances of getting out. And this wouldn't be a bad thing, if it weren't for one irritating family, which bought the home, moved in, and wants to make a few changes inside. Being two regular ghosts, the prime residents understand that the only way to get rid of the annoying new homeowners is to scare them away. Unfortunately, all this doesn't seem to be too easy, as they quickly become a sort of attraction for the Deetz clan. The only person that is able to actually see and bond with the unhappy couple is the overly weird and gloomy Lydia (Winona Ryder). She wants to help her new and lifeless friends. Yet, as things still don't go as planned, it appears that the only creature that may be of any guidance is the aberrant, obnoxious, and very impetuous Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton)<br/><br/>Calling himself a 'bio-exorcist', he promises to scare away the Deetzes with a couple of his frightening tricks. However, there is something else on his wild mind – he wants to force Lydia into becoming his lovely bride. And this doesn't seem to suit anyone in particular.<br/><br/>The movie has plenty of fantastically humorous gags, applied in a rather macabre and dark manner, so typical of a film created by Tim Burton. What's more, all of the creatures that appear in the otherworld scenery are hilarious and look like they were taken straight out of a cartoon (also, look for the group of dead football players - a reference to a tragic plane crash that really happened).<br/><br/>Michael Keaton gives an incredible performance as the preposterous, ludicrous, and totally ridiculous deceased exterminator, who happens to look for some love in the human world. From the moment when we see him for the first time the movie gets on a totally different, much faster pace. He soon becomes the brightest star of the movie, with all that he says and does, and in a most amusing way.<br/><br/>It's funny to watch Alec Baldwin in such an untypical role. I must say that even though we are accustomed to seeing him in more of action-hero-type movies, he still gives a decent performance. His character seems fairly likable, and combined with Geena Davis as his wife, the two create a couple that everyone can adore.<br/><br/>All in all, if you are looking for some fun time with a movie that won't bore you for a second, give Beetlejuice a try. It's a Burton creation that is as heart-warming, as it is crazy and bizarre."

This is a universe of engaging, interesting characters - a lonely teenage girl, a wholesome Norman Rockwell couple, a frustrated would-be artist - but also a film where dead citizens need to find the right office to process their claim to the afterlife, bad sculptures start moving and attack people, and the groom at a climactic wedding scene removes a severed finger from the ring in his pocket with assurances to his bride-to-be that, ""She meant nothing to me !"". Burton has an almost unique knack of combining his wacky ideas and insane visuals with solid entertainment values; homespun humour, agreeable drama and wry observations. Even if the messages in his movies are as simple as it's good to listen to some Harry Belafonte once in a while, they're delivered with panache and are more profound than a lot of so-called grown-up films aspire to be. The whole cast here are obviously having a ball, and Keaton is motormouth hilarious in the showstopping part, but for me the two best players are sixteen-year-old Ryder in the pivotal role of Lydia, who manages to be both hilarious (""I, myself, am strange and unusual."") and tender, and O'Hara as the wicked stepmom whose rendition of Day-O alone is worth seeing the whole movie for. Speaking of music, this is also composer Danny Elfman's calling card film - starting with a delicious brass-thumping main theme, it's shot through with outstanding musical moments which get progressively weirder and more operatic as the mayhem surges. A note about the title of this film, which I must confess I don't quite understand. According to IMDb, it's formally Beetle Juice (two words), despite the fact that the title card for the movie has it written as one word, and it surely comes from the character, whose name is not only definitely one word, but is also spelled Betelgeuse (as in the star in the constellation of Orion). I smell the stench of movie executives who can't even read let alone spell. Brilliantly written by Larry Wilson, Warren Skaaren and Michael McDowell (a great horror scribbler, who also worked on George A. Romero's Tales From The Darkside movie / TV show, adapted The Nightmare Before Christmas and scripted Stephen King's novel Thinner), this is a fabulously funny feelgood spook story."
"aram81","5","3","8","15 April 2020"," Beetlejuice is not a story, it's a gimmick. The film is only interesting whenever Keaton and Ryder are on the screen.
","Tim Burton's wacky, supernatural tale takes a while to get going. It's not until Beetlejuice arrives on the scene that the film comes alive. And even though the film forgoes genuine character development and is actually not a story but a gimmick with some eye-catching (albeit somewhat dated now) visuals, it still has its moments thanks to Michael Keaton. He is at his manic best as the titular character. In fact, outside of Winona Ryder's gothic Lydia, he is the only other interesting character. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are less than stellar as Adam and Barbara, the two friendly ghosts who try to scare away the new inhabitants of their house. (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) Beetlejuice is yet another example of Tim Burton's shortcomings. While he is without a doubt a master of visual filmmaking, he is sorely lacking in the storytelling and character department."

","This is a movie that's talked about so much that you practically know it, even if you haven't seen it; it's a pop culture phenomenon. Well, I never saw this movie when it came out in the theaters, don't really know why, just hadn't made the time to see it. I finally saw it (1/25/17) and... man, was it boring. Yes, boring.<br/><br/>The pacing is slow, the acting is mediocre (the mother and father) and some of the jokes don't land. I love the actors in this movie, but it just seems to drag along. The special effects are dated, but rather enjoyable, so I didn't mind that at all. My biggest gripe about this movie was with Beetlejuice himself. For a movie that carries his name in the title and is acted with great gusto by Michael Keaton, you'd think Beetlejuice would be in the movie a lot more. The movie is 1 1/2 hours long and Beetlejuice is on screen for about 15 minutes! His character is not fleshed out all that well, as oftentimes we are left to wonder about his motivation. Is he a good guy, a bad guy, who's he trying to help or hurt? Beetlejuice just acts quirky and rambles on, probably in the hopes that we as the audience won't notice that he's not really doing anything. But again, it's the story itself that fails; it has bad pacing, not enough of the main title character, and ultimately it becomes a boring mess <br/><br/>This is a movie that had great actors, a decent outline for a story and terrific potential, unfortunately it doesn't deliver on any of them. I think I would have liked this movie if I had seen it when it came out and I would remember it fondly and with a nostalgic sense of wonder. But no, I just recently saw it and nope, can't recommend it. As an 80's kid, I hate saying this, but this movie is just badly executed. Sad, it could have really been something, if they had only made Beetlejuice the main character in the movie and fleshed out the story."

","Some may say that you can't watch a 1988 film and expect it to be of the caliber of film that has been produced in the twenty first century. I would beg to differ, given that there are some 80's films (e.g. Dead Poets Society, Ferris Bueller's Day Off) that don't seem a bit outdated watching them in 2013. Despite the occasionally piece of quality film in the 80's, there were hundreds of horrendous movies produced in the decade, and Beetle Juice is no exception.<br/><br/>This early Tim Burton film has a talent for making any actor that steps on screen look like an idiot. Everybody seems to have a part that doesn't suit their styles. They either overly ham it up or are completely flat.<br/><br/>Also, there is almost no plot, and the whole movie makes absolutely no sense. I didn't even care what happened to the characters due to the fact that all the scenes prior to any moment that attempted to call itself climactic didn't have an ounce of logic to it. It was just plot-developing mayhem.<br/><br/>Alas, the special effects. What a joke. I caught myself periodically chuckling thinking that they must not be serious. One moment, we're inside a house, and the next we are outside in a world where painted cardboard marionette puppets fly through the air. Seriously? The effects in Star Wars were better than this.

","BEETLE JUICE is the tale of Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis), a couple who die but don't really know it until they discover a new family moving into their house. This family consists of dad Charles (Jeffrey Jones), stepmom Delia (Catherine O'Hara), and daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). Since Adam and Barbara are confined to their old house by the powers of the afterlife, they call upon ""bio-exorcist"" Beetle Juice (Michael Keaton) to try to get the new family to move out. However, the spirits simply appeal to the family and hence, they don't want to leave. Does Beetle Juice succeed in his mission?<br/><br/>This movie is probably considered by many to be Tim Burton's best. It's certainly one of the most popular. But I have to disagree. Though Burton is a master director and is very stylish, BEETLE JUICE just doesn't sit well with me. It's supposed to be a dark comedy, and it is indeed dark, but I definitely don't find it to be very funny. It's not that the idea of making fun of death offends me or anything (actually, quite the contrary); I just don't find the jokes, for the most part, to be humorous.<br/><br/>
Also, the special effects are incredibly cheesy by today's standards. The Claymation scenes are almost ridiculous, but add a certain charming campiness to the whole film. Burton does set up many classic imageries, however (i.e., the snake, the faces Adam and Barbara put on to try to scare the family, the entire waiting room and its occupants). And there are a few timelessly classic scenes as well--namely, the wedding, the ""Day-oh"" dinner party, and the dancing sequence at the end.<br/><br/>The acting is decent. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are both good, if miscast. Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara are also good and occasionally funny as the parents of the family, while Winona Ryder puts in a solid and humorous performance as the depressed Lydia, in one of her first acting roles. But I think it was Michael Keaton, in the title role, that completely ruined the film for me. He was certainly charismatic, but I found him to be rather annoying. I also think he got the brunt of the jokes that were supposed to be funny, but aren't. Or maybe it's because of him that they aren't funny.<br/><br/>I thought BEETLE JUICE would be a pretty enjoyable dark comedy, but I didn't like it much. A lot of the jokes fail, and Michael Keaton puts in an extremely irritating performance. But, Tim Burton is an excellent director and manages to execute many memorable scenes and visuals. 6/10."

","Tim Burton could do no wrong after risking twice, first to make this movie and secondly, casting Michael Keaton in this most unlikely role.

"ElMaruecan82","8","1","2","22 March 2020"," Wacky Horror Picture Show...
","A wacky Tim Burton at a time when his muse Johnny Depp was still the thug-arresting hearthrob of ""21 Jump Street"", a sweet Geena Davis, a boyish Alec Baldwin and practical Gremlins-like special effects... well, if ""Beetlejuice"" doesn't scream 80s, I don't know what it does. This is a little gem of horror mixed with comedy that might delight every member of the family though I suspect kids who've grown up after the 2000s might find the film a bit too silly and childish... a complain they'd share with eminent critics of that era such as Ebert and Siskel. Both deplored that the titular character brought too much obnoxiousness to an already loaded story and they got rapidly tired of his antics, but didn't they think the same of ""Ace Ventura""?<br/><br/>I think ""Beetlejuice"" is a film that might disorient the first-time viewer because of its constant swinging between fantasy and horror and naughty comedy, but I suspect this is the kind of experience that grows on you if you give it a chance. Michael Keaton as ""Beetlejuice"" might be a tad too prankish and annoying but thankfully he only appears midway through the film and meanwhile, the main characters had already won our hearts. I agree that the relationship between Baldwin and Davis brings a certain sweetness to the film sometimes at the expenses of the plot. I couldn't really accept that such lovely persons would indulge to scare the new occupants on their residence just because of some disturbance... especially since they aren't played by the least likable actors either.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Jones aka Emperor Joseph aka Ferris' archenemy Rooney is a serene father who wants to contemplate birds and enjoy his nest of serenity, Catherine O'Hara, aka Kevin's mom is the lady of the house eccentric sculptor who won't have any intruders disrupt her oasis of artistic creativity and finally, Winona Ryder is the emo malcontent adolescent who grows an interest on the former residents, if not a liking.<br/><br/>In fact, if we except the nasty decorator Otho, the character who comes the closest to an antagonist is Beetlejuice himself, though his main purpose is to get the house rid of the family by operating let's say an exorcism from the other side. The premise is interesting but the film is filled with so many enchanting special effects and funny scenes that a new character popping up near the end wasn't a necessity. As hard as it is to imagine the film without Beetlejuice, it's funny that the film's most memorable moments don't feature him. But I won't get too nitpicky, Keaton is obviously playing a career-defining role and I suspect if it wasn't for his performance, he might not have caught the attention of Burton for his next project (a clue: it's another special effect movie with a one-word title starting with ""B"").<br/><br/>Keaton is certainly as wacky and crazy as his cartoon adaptation but his performance is too straight-forward and doesn't call for subtlety, a pity for a film that contains so many inspiring moments such as the afterlife bureaucracy and the memorable case-worker played by a chain-smoking and scene-stealing Sylvia Sidney.<br/><br/>At the peak of its creativity, ""Beetlejuice"" is a fantastic and spectacular fantasy entertainment filled with hilarious moments: a great twist at the end of the opening credits, a hilarious choregraphy with the ""Banana-Boat Song"" and a funny waiting room sequence involving a silly-looking creature with a shrunk head. The film won an Oscar for Best Make-up but oddly enough, it didn't garner any Golden Globe nomination for Best Comedic Actor to Keaton. I must admit his performance never really bothered me except for one moment that carried a lot of gravitas (when the couple's ghosts started to age and their bodies turning into skeletons), the scene hit a really sensitive chord and it did so well that I really wanted someone to get rid of Beetlejuice instead of the humans. For that scene in particular I would agree with Ebert's criticism.<br/><br/>But with some perspective, ""Beetlejuice"" is a fun product of its time, with a right balance of humor (mostly visual), heart and special effects, and these aspects work so much that the cynicism brought by the titular character might feel like the real intrusion. There are moments where the house looks overcrowded and the humor overdone but ""Beetlejuice"" is still one of these little classics of the 80s, and time did justice to the little films of that glorious and extravagant decade."

","I've discovered that it's a risky proposition to go back and rewatch the films you liked as a kid through adult eyes. Plot holes seem more apparent, your sense of humour may have evolved, your life experience can change your outlook. So I was very happy to rewatch ""Beetlejuice"" and find myself not only finding new things about the film I hadn't noticed before - but that so much of the film, from a visual effects standpoint if nothing else, still holds up.<br/><br/>Young married couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland(Geena Davies) are tragically drowned on their way back to their Idyllic small town house. Returning as ghosts, they're horrified when a new family, The Deetz buy their house and move in. New York developer Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and his wife Delia (Catherine O Hara) arrive and she has big interior design plans for the house. Desperate, the Maitlands call on the help of bioexorcist Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) to scare the living away, but they soon discover that the solution is much worse than the problem.<br/><br/>I mention the visual effects in the opening because they're one of the most striking aspects of the film, rewatching it today. Mostly practical or stop-motion, they haven't aged like some computer visual effects of the time (or even later) have and they're so unusual, so directly from their director's twisted mind, that they remain memorable. It's not all the film has going for it though, the script is funny and the performances are very strong too. Alec Baldwin looks impossibly young, Catherine O' Hara is a comic genius and Winona Ryder's Lydia is the prototype movie Goth girl. Michael Keaton is great too, apparently adlibbing for his life whenever his character gets a chance on screen. Some other reviews have suggested Betelgeuse's limited screen time as a bad thing, I think that's one of the films strengths. Fun as though he is, he would become a bit much if he was on screen longer.<br/><br/>Funny, scary and brilliant ""Beetlejuice"" is a classic. (Maybe don't let your younger kids watch it though.)"

Having said that, I give it a number of stars for the enjoyable performances of Alec Baldwin and Gina Davis in the title roles, and of course especially the absolutely outstanding portrayal of the used car salesman like poltergeist ""Beetlejuice"" by the extremely talented Michael Keaton. I have literally watched only that part of this movie again a number of times just to watch him say his memorable lines like ""Hey, you're workin' with a professional here!"" or ""Now, where does a guy like me, just a regular Joe, go when he's feeling kinda 'anxious'. . .? Still hilarious now many years later (perhaps they could develop another film just around that character). Also, I have definitely liked much of Tim Burton's other work, and he's impressive in his ability to do both sweet, deeply humane movies like ""Edward Scissorhands"" and very dark, haunting films like ""Sweeny Todd"". So see ""Beetlejuice"" for Michael Keaton's amazing performance, but see Burton's other films to see Burton at his best."

","You're probably already aware that 'Beetlejuice' is considered a 'classic' when it comes to modern cinema and I don't really disagree. However, upon re-watching the eighties horror/comedy today I still level the same criticism â€“ not enough of the titular character, aka Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>The story follows a young couple who find themselves dead after an unfortunate road accident. Now they're forced to spend the afterlife haunting their own dream home, now infested with the (annoying) living. And, in an effort to drive out these fleshy interlopers, they enlist the help of one particularly unhinged fellow spirit, known as Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>It was directed by Tim Burton as (arguably) the height of his career. It's wonderfully Gothic with all his best trademarks all over the place (not counting the lack of Johnny Depp). The only aspect of the film that rivals Keaton's performance are the (completely non-CGI) special effects which add to the atmosphere perfectly.<br/><br/>Maybe today the film is looking a little dated, but it's one that you have to suspend your disbelief and enjoy it for what it was at the time, rather than compared to today's filmic offerings. I wait for the (depressing) day when I hear it's going to be remade with all CGI environments. That will probably happen, but no matter how much computer trickery they employ, they'll never be able to CGI another performance as good as Keaton's. And that's why the original will always stand out (and not just as an excuse to laugh at how unbelievably young Alec Baldwin looked back then!)."

It's a dark, quirky comedy featuring some fine performances and great lines. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are perfectly cast as the ever so nice couple who meet an untimely end and find their house taken over by new occupants. Winona Ryder is great as the 1980's version of a teen goth, and Catherine O'Hara is excellent as the neurotic mother with artistic leanings. However, the real show-stealer is Michael Keaton, who delivers a riotously OTT performance as Betelgeuse, the bio- exorcist. He's just brilliant in this role. <br/><br/>On paper it doesn't look like it should be, but it is actually a real feel-good movie.

Alec Baldwin and Genna Davis play the hapless couple who don't realize that they are dead and have to call ""Betelgeuse"" (pronounced ""Beetlejuice"") to exorcise the living from their own house. We all know who that is going to be. Michael Keaton has a field day dancing around and playing his devilishly dead self. Winona Ryder is the young ""creepy"" daughter of the new owners of the house. At first, she is the only one that will see the ""ghostly inhabitants"" who are really just nice friendly ""spirits"". Curious mis-casting with Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet in terrible, minor roles. It's fun, slow in spots, and yet seems way too short at the end. I love the witch doctor, the guy with the shrunken head, and the 2-piece (she is sawed in half) magician's assistant, all siting there in the afterlife waiting room, for their ""social worker"" to help them. Everyone appears there exactly as they died. The man with the tire-treads on him looks a bit flat. The girl with green make-up. Not for little kids, due to the great make-up/effects and cuss word. Danny Elfman's haunting musical score is the best! Don't ya just hate sandworms?"

","Tim Burtons' hilarious, visually impressive follow-up to ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" is pure 1980s fun, with fantastic special effects, superbly flamboyant design, a willing cast, and plenty of good, solid laughs. It holds up quite well today, a quarter century later, with a generous dose of Harry Belafonte tunes to add to its ultimately upbeat spirit. It gets down to business in fairly quick fashion, and populates its story with great and memorable characters, not the least of which is our scenery devouring title character.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton delivers a delicious comedy performance to rival his Billy Blaze from ""Night Shift"". He's having a ball, and most of his co-stars do a fine job of playing ""straight man"" (or woman) and reacting to his antics. He plays the obnoxious, fun loving spirit of Beetle Juice to perfection. His speech when he's asked about his ""qualifications"" is particularly priceless stuff.<br/><br/>He's called in when newly deceased couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) find adjusting to the afterlife to be just too hard, especially when an intolerable pair played by Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara move into their old house. Eventually, they find that dealing with him is even harder as he creates a ruckus, and sets his sights on Jones's Goth-type daughter Winona Ryder.<br/><br/>Working from a screenplay by Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren (based on a story by McDowell and Larry Wilson), Burton is definitely in his element, crafting a blessedly wacky and unpredictable comedy that, much like the Pee-wee Herman movie, plays like a cartoon come to life. Burton also has great fun with his casting choices; in addition to those actors mentioned, veteran actress Sylvia Sidney provides a special treat by playing weary afterlife case worker Juno; also appearing are Robert Goulet, Dick Cavett, and a very funny Glenn Shadix as interior designer Otho.<br/><br/>It's all set to a delightful Danny Elfman score and there are some great set pieces revolving around Belafontes' ""Day-O"" and ""Jump in the Line"".<br/><br/>This film does know how to send you off with a smile on your face.

","Tim Burton's second feature film after Pee Wee's Big Adventure (1985) and made one year before he became a household name with Batman (1989), Beetlejuice is one of the Director's quintessential movies.<br/><br/>It is a dementia of style that permeates all his work and is never more evident than in this unbridled, unique presentation of pure underground art.<br/><br/>There is nothing to compare this film too because it is a singularly novel piece of work. Burton's animated features also present his quirky vision and the work is probably most at home in that venue. Although Edward Scissorhands (1990) might be his masterpiece.<br/><br/>All art is a matter of taste and the art of Tim Burton, love it or not, is fully exposed in every frame of this film.

","I'm a kid from the 80's, this is once again another timeless relics from my favorite decade of movies. This film was Tim Burton's first film on the silver screen and it was a great start from him most of the time first movies from first timers tend to disappoint me; and I personally think it's still one of his best. It stands out because it was something different that you haven't seen before and you have to just see to believe; from it's style but most importantly the content and manic energy which is the reason this film just like the ghosts are timeless to me.<br/><br/>The music score by one of my favorite composers Danny Elfman is great, it's a strange lighthearted Gothic tune. The production value is great was obviously inspired by artist ""Salvador Dali"" with that desert as well as the hallways and doorways of the spirit realm. This also helps create that really odd surrealistic fantasy world tone from the real world that looks like a typical boring ""Norman Rockwell"" like enviorment it feels too strange to be true, some of the interior and exterior of the Dieetz's home, down to the spirit realm itself. Along with the special effects which I think still look great today, there is no CGI which make it all the better, from stop motion effects like the Sand Worms which are comical and nasty looking down to the make up effects. This is another reason as to how special this film is film I feel is one of the best prime examples of the use of special effects in a comedy that works because their used for the right reasons and not mere gimmicks.<br/><br/>But most important is the humor, the humor is great mixing in horror with comedy which I always think is a beautiful mix, but also just the mixture of verbal and visual humor that make it memorable, which is just done to perfection here I can't say that about many others out there. From the antics of Bettlejuice which I already mentioned down to others without him, from the infamous Day-O dinner scene, but my favorite no doubt is with the dead Football players one of them says something and the case worker Juno (played with brilliant dry charisma by Sylvia Sidney)replies back, I don't want to give it away but trust me one you hear it you'll crack up. But also just the logic or illogic of the spirit realm that is created, it's funny because of how strange it is but also fills you with wonder I can't help but wonder if there really is a lot more to that spirit realm I still don't know about.<br/><br/>The characters are great through the two that really stick out for me the most are Beetlejuice and Lydia Deetz, no surprise there.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is played by one of my favorite actor's Michael Keaton to me this actually is my favorite role from him. Beetlejuice is one of my favorite fictional villains that I don't hate, he's pretty much a dirty insane amoral butt head that just wants to create/cause havoc for no reason, I like some of the tricks he pulls which are fun but many just his charisma some of the things he says and the way he delivers them are just hilarious; like the commercial he did which was obviously a parody on those car commercial which always had that country western vibe for some weird reason.<br/><br/>And of course one of the protagonists Lydia Deetz played by one of my favorite actresses Wynoma Rider is great and this was the role that put her on the map. I remember as a kid having a crush on this actress she's just fraking hot, made me wonder why the hell couldn't I find any goth girls in my high school not just looked that hot but had the persona to boot. Anyway, Lydia is just great because she's a character I can emphasize with a bit, I wasn't a goth but like her I was an outsider. Like the fact that she is always wearing funerary or goth , she just looks so good no matter what she wears. But I just love her persona she has dry charisma and I like the fact she's fascinated with the supernatural, I also am fascinated with unexplained phenomena of ghosts, UFOs, and other things. I also find her kinda a character of sympathy because she is lonely and feels sort of out of place, clearly her character really don't fit the superficial reality she's been forced to live with, another thing I can emphasize with because even I've had those feelings; and we pretty much see her struggling to find her place in the world but it really is closer than she thinks.<br/><br/>Well, that's all I have to say, this film has the juice.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","This is a perfect movie because it combines everything: <br/><br/>First, the idea of Death as a public administration is original and inventive and it's just delicious to have laughs in such dramatic times. The thematic of the haunted house is also well played because the movie brings a fresh air to this classic tale.<br/><br/>Then, the production is visually stunning: it's colorful, playful, weird, modern and once again, we never expected such things with the thematic. As always, Danny's score really complements Tim's filming and is among his best. A mention about the two songs of Belafonte: once again, totally unexpected, totally crazy thus excellent picks for the movie.<br/><br/>The cast is really good: for one time, Baldwin appears like a kind guy, O'Hara and Jones are sympathetic parents and Winona makes a groundbreaking debut. Keaton shows he can be a truly funny guy: compared to his brooding batman, Beetlejuice is over excited and he can delivers all his crazy lines being alone most of the time.<br/><br/>In conclusion, nothing is dead here. It's a surprising and funny vision of horror classics and it's always good when Tim makes us laugh like this!"
"spotatoes","10","1","2","28 January 2012"," Beetlejuice made me a Burton fan
","Tim Burton is my favourite director, no question. His movies have a distinctive look and sensibility, which is peculiarly his; you only have to look at a film to see if he had a hand in it.<br/><br/>His work is original, quirky, imaginative and very highly stylised. His eye for detail is extremely finely tuned and he is still one of the most visionary cinematic geniuses working today.<br/><br/>I find it hard to believe now that there was once a time when I hadn't heard the name Tim Burton, but there was. It was before the release of a little movie called Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>I was about eight when I first saw the film, and it was a revelation. I'd never seen anything like it. It was gaudy, Gothic, grotesque and great!<br/><br/>The score and feel of the film - that of weird askew Gothic-horror carnival - are set, in accordance with Burton's vision, by fellow genii, composer, Danny Elfman and production designer, Bo Welch, who are both so on the money here, it's impossible to imagine a more perfect team. Yes, it looks a bit dated now, thanks to it's stop-motion animation, but that adds to the film's charm and is better for it, in my opinion<br/><br/>The script, written, first by Michael McDowell (from his original idea) then re-written by script doctor, Warren Skaaren, is magnificent and hilarious. All the characters are well-observed, fun caricatures; that's not a negative criticism - you get the impression that this is wholly deliberate.<br/><br/>The acting from all cast members is very fine, and strike just the right note. The movie belongs, however, to Michael Keaton, whose ill-mannered, foul-mouthed, lecherous, disgusting, but somehow charming and charismatic 'Ghost with the Most' is nothing short of brilliant.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is one of the most fun movies you will ever see, and is a delight with its great premise, hilarious dialogue, inspired visuals and wonderful score. It's a must-see movie."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","10","1","2","10 December 2011"," Michael Keaton's Best
","Never have I seen a horror comedy like Beetlejuice before. I'm not quite sure if it's because of the PG rating or just how director Tim Burton made the character of Beetlejuice so lovable. Alec Baldwin (Adam Maitland) and Geena Davis (Barbara Maitland) play a married couple who end up dying within the first 15 minutes of the movie. They soon realize that they indeed are dead and can't escape their house. To make matters worse, their house is intruded by a new family called the Deetz who start rearranging all their personal things. When the Maitlands try to spook the family, they realize they're not recognized. So what's their solution - calling on Beetlejuice, played by Michael Keaton.<br/><br/>What is Michael Keaton when it comes to this character? To start off, he is filthy, vulgar, and has a bad case of gingivitis; but no termites like the Grinch. Although all of these aspects are unappealing, there is something to love about Beetlejuice. What to love is the personality. Beetlejuice's personality is funny and crude because what would you do if you've lived through the black plague and seen the exorcist about 167 times? If I was him, I'd be bored with myself by now but somehow Keaton puts life into this character like he just died yesterday. Just like The Mask (1994) who wear's a banana yellow suit to a dance club, Beetlejuice's signature wardrobe clothing is a striped black and white tux; pretty attractive for a dead guy.<br/><br/>Some other great parts from this movie are the make-up effects. Many times during this movie you will see other dead specters. What's funny about these ghosts is that the way they died is they way they're portrayed so you know exactly how they died. A man wearing a chicken- eating bib has a chicken leg stuck in his throat. A man is flat as a poster board because along his front side is a tire track. That's one of the fun parts of this movie.<br/><br/>Another great element in this film is the score composed and conducted by Danny Elfman. Just Beetlejuice's theme song is enough to get the goosebumps going. It's not a haunting melody but it's so catchy that you're bound to start jumping around. And that's exactly what Beetlejuice does; he's always hopping around on screen.<br/><br/>Director Tim Burton has definitely created a movie that is not like any other horror flick. With comedy coming first before horror, Beetlejuice will definitely deliver the laughs and some chills along the way."

","Tim Burton has crafted a number of clever films that have touched audiences in strange ways. His eccentric art form began in this quirky film. This is an artful piece of storytelling full of bizarre scenes and filled with typical Burton fun. Keaton gives his best performance to date here as the demon and Ryder is good in her role as a Gothic teen. Overall, Burton manges to keep a quirky and often humorous atmosphere over his picture and refuses to go mainstream with it. His original ideas are what helps the movie when it starts to grow unappealing to the audience. It's always got one more trick up it's sleeve and avoids self-indulgence for the most part."

","A nugget of precise mayhem that never seems to get old. Tim Burton and Danny Elfman's partnership is at or near its peak at this point in their careers, delivering a perfect blend of wildly original visuals and unusually appropriate musical cues, and they get plenty of extra help from the cast. Mixing and matching bit players from dozens of sources, it's a true ensemble piece without a true focal point. Even Michael Keaton's unrestrained performance as the film's namesake can't claim center stage for long due to constant pressure from Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and a borderline-unrecognizable Alec Baldwin. A genuinely hilarious script dances in awkward beauty from comedy to horror and back again, leaving plenty of room for scalding improvisation and keeping even the most tenured viewer guessing about what's around the next corner. I loved it growing up, when I didn't quite get every joke, and I adore it even more today."
"flyingamon","9","1","2","13 April 2011"," Really weird movie but I really loved it
","Although there are so many ghost stories floating around you can hardly find any of them as funny and bizarre as Beetle Juice. Besides that this movie also has an interesting plot and ditto characters. Needless to say that I found this one very original and entertaining. Although I wouldn't directly think that putting Harry Belafonte (great singer) songs in a movie about ghosts would be a good idea, it worked wonderfully well. The character of Beetle Juice made me think Of Jim Carey as the Mask in behavior, only that I thought of Beetle Juice to be funnier. This is truly one of the better Burton movies. The dark humor works in my opinion better than in the Addams Family movies. It's maybe not perfect but it comes close."

","Whenever I get annoyed at Tim Burton's propensity for hacking the work of others to pieces with blithe disregard, in order to build something with his own stamp (Batman, Sleepy Hollow, Alice In Wonderland et al), I remember Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is a work of fierce originality. Telling the story of freshly deceased ordinary couple Adam and Barbara, forced to share the house they love (and are restricted to) with the family from hell, it is savagely original in concept and execution. Nominally centring on the bio-exorcist Beetlejuice, it spreads its favours far and wide - Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the dead couple, Jeffrey Jones and the exquisitely funny Catherine O'Hara as the new residents, Winona Rider as their terminally depressed daughter and Glenn Shadix as their appalling interior designer, and Michael Keaton in a career establishing turn as the over-the-top Beetlejuice himself.<br/><br/>The special effects are great, as is production design, but the real star here is the story and script. Any film which can deliver a sequence so brilliantly conceived, staged, and performed (just watch the faces of the dinner guests!) as the Banana Boat Song sequence is a classic."

","Bringing an usual concept to a movie, Tim Burton has his ideal romantic leads killed-off in the first 5 minutes. Both go to town alive, and arrive home as ghosts. They are slow to realise this. Worse still, their perfect country home is rapidly sold on to the couple from hell. These are a pair of freaky-fashionable stiff-necked city snobs. He is recovering from a nervous breakdown and would be happy to leave things as they are, but his neurotic wife has artistic delusions and means to gut the place. To the ghosts, that won't do.<br/><br/>They mean to haunt 'em out. But, being novices, they're not sure how. Enter an unrecognisable Micheal Keaton as the titular 'Beetle Juice'. He is a free spirit with a wicked turn, and a freelance exorciser of humans. The couple are torn between his anarchic services and more conventional haunting; to this end, they seek counsel with the spirit world.<br/><br/>The movie is showing its age in terms of special-effects (but at least they are not CGI); even so, a lot of ingenuity was employed in bringing this work to life, and for the most part they still work. There are some very imaginative and comic touches - especially in the after-life, where victims of a variety of grisly deaths await their turn with necromantic bureaucracy. Sight gags and comic lines abound.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis adequately play the short-lived couple and other players give a decent turn for their paycheques. But this is Keaton's movie. His performance is so over-the-top as to match Jack Nicholson's Joker in 'Batman'. He is hilarious and demonstrates great comic timing. The music and sound effects are in general well suited, but I thought numbers like the Banana Boat Song a little jarring.<br/><br/>This is a ghost story movie like no other. Despite the slightly outdated effects, it is well worth a watch. In fact, I am beginning to find CGI a little passe these days, and prefer well-crafted 'old fashioned' effects. You at least know lots of people have really burnt the midnight oil to bring their ideas to fruition, instead of just a team of nerds churning them out on computers."

The visuals, as we know they will be, when Tim is helming it, are invariably well-done. The effects are perhaps outdated today, but they still work and do so well. And honestly, as I watched this, I was far too entertained to care if I could tell how they did this or that. The dialog is well-written, with several clever lines. The designs are rich.

","It's only his second movie, and yet it is obvious Beetle Juice is pure, unmistakable Tim Burton: macabre, darkly comic and crammed with weirdos, not least Michael Keaton's career-best performance as the perverted titular ""bio-exorcist"".<br/><br/>But what does a creature like that actually do? Well, it depends on who requires his services: in the case of Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis), a recently deceased married couple, he is supposed to get rid of the ""terrible people"" (Jeffrey Jones and Helen O' Hara) who have taken over their house. As his employers will soon discover, though, Beetlejuice doesn't exactly play by the rules and has an agenda of his own, a fact that could cause more damage than expected. Unless the new owner's daughter, the death-obsessed Lydia (Winona Ryder), finds a way to stop him, that is.<br/><br/>Burton was famously accused for favoring style over content in his two Batman films (fair assessment, but they're still awesome), something that can't be said of this black comedy: the visual element may be incredibly strong, especially in the fantasy sequences, but the director never loses track of the wonderfully witty script, taking the audience with him on a trip that, similarly to his later work Corpse Bride, paints a merrier portrait of the afterlife than we are used to imagine, albeit with the occasional grotesque scenarios and people.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the extravagant imagery is also where the film shows its biggest limit, as some of the special effects have dated quite badly, most notably a stop-motion animated snake that attacks Adam and Barbara in an early nightmare scene. Such shortcomings, however, are compensated by the consistent twisted humor and a committed cast: Baldwin and Davis are amusing in roles few people would imagine them playing, Burton-regular Jones is a reliable source of laughs and Ryder's ""troubled"" teenager (not like her Heathers character, though) is a neat and charming counterpoint to her heartbreaking turn in Edward Scissorhands, also directed by Burton. But it is the underused Keaton (about 18 minutes of screen time in an almost two-hour long movie) who deserves the hot spot in the audience's memory: he is twitchy, rude, dirty and VERY naughty - nearly too much for a PG feature. And if that isn't enough, consider this: Burton wanted him and no one else to play Batman because of his work in this picture, and the result was the finest celluloid Dark Knight until Christian Bale took over the suit. That's gotta mean something, right?"

But second, because Robert Goulet had passed on a few days before, and I felt it would only be right and proper to honor the man who had made such an impression in my life after seeing him sing live in 2002.<br/><br/>As far as I know, this film marks the first Tim Burton and Michael Keaton collaboration, before they both went on to make the two best Batman films in history (at least until Chris Nolan came around). We also have Jeffrey Jones, another regular and the music by Danny Elfman from Oingo Boingo. Winona Ryder (from Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"") is here, and this is by far her greatest role. Maybe her only truly great role, in fact, as this is the way I like to remember her... not so much as Spock's mother.<br/><br/>Tim Burton was perfect to direct this film, giving him a range of weird and grotesque things to work with, weird clay stuff and wild architecture. It's like the peak of his career because it's as strange as ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" and as dark as any of his films... all of which were perfect until he picked ""Planet of the Apes"" and his career died a brutal death (with the post-Apes exception of ""Big Fish"" and perhaps ""Big Eyes"").<br/><br/>That is what you get here, though: comedy and the macabre, mixed together... a world where suicide victims get to spend the afterlife as civil servants... and your death wound stays visible forever. (Drowning seems to have been a good choice to avoid looking awful.) Michael Keaton at his dirtiest (think ""Night Shift"" and not ""Mr. Mom""). Oh, and Harry Belafonte's ""Banana Boat Song""... you need that.<br/><br/>So, should you see it? The real question is why haven't you already? Any horror fan will appreciate this, as will any Tim Burton fan. The feel of this film is fun and fresh even two decades later. There is a special edition 20th anniversary DVD, which also offers a few episodes of the cartoon for some reason. It isn't great... maybe next time?"
"ZookGuy","8","1","2","16 August 2007"," One of the Most Imaginative Movies Ever Made
","There are few films to exceed the imagination of Beetlejuice, King Kong, maybe Wizard of Oz, but then we must remember that this film is much darker than Wizard of Oz. It's here and Batman that Micheal Keaton is at his finest, his (or at least IMDb trivia states) eighteen minute appearance is not bad by horror-comedy standards. And black humor is very relevant throughout, and the ending, where we have a creepy Beetlejuice and a non-dead dying couple is suspense-loaded. And the other ghouls are some of the most imaginative things in film to date.<br/><br/>It's not the greatest movie ever, but it's certainly the most imaginative."
"Howlin Wolf","8","1","2","19 July 2007"," 'What's my Name?'
","Whatever the story he's telling, Tim Burton - along with his collaborators - has the precise ability to create incredibly detailed universes and transport us to them at once, so that they feel like home for the duration of his tale. ""Beetlejuice"" is no different. Within what feels like no time at all, we're taken inside a scale-model, before being whisked from there and placed right in the heart of quaint rural America, complete with white-picket fences and all. Our last stop on this magical mystery tour finally takes us to the afterlife, where we encounter various forms of the undead. It almost seems like an overload of imagination for one movie, but we're soon to discover that 'restraint' is far from what Beetlejuice is about...<br/><br/>Both the production design and makeup are excellent tools with regard to making us believe totally in this assortment of landscapes. It's a sign of how much fun the movie has experimenting that when the titular character gets so little screen-time, we aren't complaining much, and it forces you to think just how many other movies would have been irreparably damaged by a similar decision. Michael Keaton is riotous, but there are laughs to be had from plenty of other sources too. All of the supporting cast are Burton favourites, and it's a telling indicator that here is where they do some of their best work.<br/><br/>If you want spooky laughs, then get your mitts on ""Beetlejuice"" and settle down to watch the exploits, because 'it's show time'... He truly is The Name In Laughter From The Hereafter!"
"OllieSuave-007","9","1","2","6 June 2007"," Fun and Terrific Ghoul Film.
","This is fun and terrific film to watch from Tim Burton, a story about a happily married couple, Adam and Barbara Maitland, played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, who were killed in a car crash. They turn into ghosts and are trapped in their beloved farmhouse. Soon, the house was inhabited by the Deetzs, who has completely odd taste in decoration and personality and turns their home into a modern museum-like house. Unable to drive them away, the ghosts summon Beetle Juice, the Ghost with the Most, by calling his name three times. He gave the family a good haunting, but wants the family's daughter, who befriended the Maitlands. So, the movie goes on-don't want to spoil the ending. <br/><br/>The acting is superb, and Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice is simply hilarious, with endless tricks up his sleeves. Winona Ryder as Lydia gave a hands-down performance, eerie and somber, yet passionate and haunting. The scenes involving the ""other side"" brings your imagination to a whole new level, everything you would expect in a ghost world-moving skeletons, lost souls, a moving hangman, unorganized and chaotic-looking offices (papers everywhere), a lady with her body cut in half, uneven rooms and a football team who was unaware they were dead, just to name a few. And, one of my favorite scenes is the dinner party, where the ghosts tried to drive away the family by controlling their actions and making them sing a Harry Belafonte song. Danny Elfman gave us a fabulous music score-haunting, exciting and refreshing.<br/><br/>This is just a great movie that I could watch again and again. <br/><br/>So, go say his name three times and watch Beetle Juice.<br/><br/>Grade A"
"klas0031","9","1","2","3 June 2007"," My two cents on Beetlejuice
","I really love this movie, as many do. So I just wanted to add two thoughts I haven't seen much if at all:<br/><br/>1. I love this movie because of all the handmade touches. Although I like computer animation fine, there's something so satisfying about papier-mache, claymation, puppets, and all the other art that is made by hand in this movie. I was in Mexico once and saw a wooden sculpture of a red creature with spikes all over it that were tree thorns. It was so crude and yet so captivating. My friend saw it first, so she got to buy it, but she agreed with me that it was Tim-Burton-y. I later found a quote by Tim Burton that suggested he was a fan of folk art. The crudeness of some of the effects in this movie is endearing, to the point of transcending a ""cheesy"" effect and becoming an ""arty"" effect.<br/><br/>2. Although the connection is a little loose, I think that all great works of fiction are based on something real, and in this case, it could be argued that the plight of the Maitlands could be an allegory for the story of Native Americans. People are living in a place that they are familiar with and that makes sense to them, but then visitors from far away come and start ""viciously rearranging their environment"", to the point that the original inhabitants are nearly destroyed. I'm not a Native American studies major, so don't read too much into it, but I saw a similarity."

"Aaron1375","8","1","2","21 March 2007"," A rather unique and funny look at the afterlife...
","This movie is a rather differing look on what the afterlife might be like, and I have to say it isn't pretty. Our couple drowns and struggles to adjust to being dead, however, they seem to refuse to read the book that explains just how to go about it. If being dead were not bad enough, they have some new home owners moving into the house where they must spend the first years of their afterlife and they are not a very good match with our deceased couple. What are they to do...well there seems to be a solution, a ghost named Beetle Juice who advertises himself as a type of reverse exorcist. This of course sets up some really funny scenes. This movie I do believe is effective because its somewhat limited use of the funniest character, Beetle Juice...this just makes his scenes even more funny and over the top. Not that it is bad when he is not in it, it still has some funny stuff such as the dinner scene and the waiting room scene. Still, when Beetle Juice is in it, the comedy ramps up a couple of notches. All the cast do a rather good job, of course Keaton kind of steals the show. This movie is kind of dark, however it works as Tim Burton always can create a good dark atmosphere so if you want to see a rather humorous take on the afterlife this is the movie for you."
"standardmetal","9","1","2","8 March 2007"," An original!
","Whatever it's genesis, the film ""Beetle Juice"" is a startlingly original concept and is perhaps unique among ghost films in its darkly comic approach.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play the ""recently deceased"" couple, the Maitlands, as a nice couple who meet their deaths in an automobile-drowning accident and find themselves back in their home as ghosts. When an obnoxious family moves in, they are forced to try to scare them off.<br/><br/>There are many inconsistencies in the abilities of these ghosts: Though they can apparently walk through doors in true ghostly fashion, when they are escaping from the giant sandworm, they have to get the door to their home opened as they can't otherwise enter. They can move articles and completely interact with the strange daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder in her star-making role.) by handing her items but cannot cast a reflection in a mirror (though I suppose this was also true of Bela Lugosi in his most famous role of Dracula!). Michael Keaton has a perfect role as the ""bio-exorcist"" Betelgeuse (the ""Beetle Juice"" of the title.) whom he portrays as an obnoxious ne'er-do-well. (I can't help thinking that Jim Carrey learned a great deal from him for his role in ""The Mask"".) Betelgeuse appears, they say, in only 17.5 minutes but these are, pretty much, the most crucial moments in the film.<br/><br/>Alec and Geena are excellent as the Maitlands and perhaps the most horrific image in the film is where Adam (Alec) is holding his separated head (He puts it back eventually.) But these special effects are mostly more cartoonish than really scary, in my opinion. Even so, this film is not for impressionable young children to whom it's guaranteed to give nightmares.<br/><br/>Jeffrey Jones is excellent as Charles, the man who buys the house as is Catherine O'Hara as his sculptress wife, Delia. Glenn Shadix is a standout as the gay-stereotyped interior decorator Otho and Winona almost steals the picture from the other actors. (Oops! I guess I shouldn't have used that expression!! ;-)) Sylvia Sidney, (a star of the early talkies) is quite funny as the Maitland's ""social worker"" Juno and her scene with the ghostly football players reminds me of Whoopi's scene with the crowd of ghosts in the film ""Ghost""which appeared 2 years later in which she similarly ""throws them out""!.<br/><br/>The DVD has some extras and is two-sided which is a bad idea. One side is the original wide-screened (letter-boxed) version and the other side fits the standard screen and unless the owner of the DVD is extra careful, one side or the other is apt to get damaged as did my library copy. Since the cost of an extra DVD blank is pretty negligible, I can't understand why the manufacturers go for the double-sided format. (Perhaps to save money on the ""jewel box""?)"
"vip_ebriega","8","1","2","9 February 2007"," Death never felt so... alive.
","My Take: Burton's wild imagination is painted all over the screen in this outlandish near-classic. <br/><br/>Say it once, say it twice, say it thrice. ""Beetlejuice"" is really one hilarious ghost comedy from director Tim Burton, it's also one of his funniest. It's full of laughs, jolts, weirdness and everything you want in one hilarious comedy of this kind. More? Well, just see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis stars a as typical Connecticut-living couple who die in a car accident and great trapped inside their house during the afterlife. But when their home is bought by a family of gimmicky New Yorkers, they mistakenly aid the help of ""bio-exorcist"" Beetleguese to scare their uninvited guest away.<br/><br/>It's both funny and scary, mainly because of Michael Keaton, who throws a lot of guffaws and jolts all in one package. Danny Elfman's weird music is fine and the lavish (and ghoulish) look at the afterlife is well-imagined and really ""to die for"".<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."
"gothicgoblin1334","8","1","2","22 November 2006"," The rise and fall of Michael Keaten
","Hello moviegoers! I must give the master of macabre, Tim Burton, for developing his style in cinema of humorous and yet creepily Gothic and adult orientated fairy tales. To me I consider it to be his second ""real"" film (Vincent being the first, Pee Wee's for kicks) in which he has a trio of actors, writers, and producers. At the time this idea was hatched Larry Wilson (originally to write Roman Dirge's ""Lenore"") with the basic half-a'd plot and Michael McDowell (suprisingly no relation to Malcolm) with the screenplay, looking for the right visionary to direct it. Of course, this was before Tim Burton re-invented Beetle Juice and perhaps even re-creating or resurrecting him. They tried Wes Craven, who at the time was in the process of writing (but not directing) another crappy Nightmare on elm street sequel, so he was out of the picture there. Though even if Wes Craven had done the film there would be bleakness and not fun like Burton made it (however, I would have liked to see this film have a solid R rating including violence, language and sexuality) creative differences also struck and Burton was given the idea. Reading the script it perhaps possessed him to take it. Thus, his brilliance came through and made Beetle Juice look a bit less oh, I don't know, ""sheety"". The plot (taken from IMDb): <br/><br/>This is the story of Adam and Barbara who live in a beautiful house in New England. One day while driving home they are involved in a terrible auto accident. They manage to walk home only to discover later that they have died and now haunt their house. When their house is purchased by an out of state family, they feel their home is threatened by the over-the-top artists wife and real-estate idea-man husband. Their only relief is the Gothic daughter of the family. Their attempts at scaring the family out of the house are ignored or laughed at. Finally they fall to the temptation to use the people-exorcist Beetle Juice. When they find his tactics too dangerous, they attempt to contain him and save the family they were trying to boot. <br/><br/>It cannot be explained truly well but that is what it is, the storyline is good and eccentric and the script may as well be the same. The direction looks, well, 'darkly colourful' and intriguing.<br/><br/>---------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>Let's skip to the actual review, shall we? Well the plot is great but the screenplay is seemingly half-written with no beginning and no ending, just bits and pieces between that make a film. It's dark, fun, but I'd like to discuss the ending. The ending, which involves the family (of ghosts) with Winona Ryder, who seems to be ""happy"" and dramatically changed. Though it's not dramatic, but crappy and just there to anger certain people such as myself off, however, Burton did mention that that wasn't the intention. Beetle Juice also has his head shrunken once he's in the IRS-like waiting room in the land of the dead (which, I'd like to mention, the underworld resembling an IRS office was quite brilliant) and there happens to be a half-naked cannibal sitting next to him. Then the 'perfect' family are possessed by music and have to sing calypso. I know, it sounds f***** up but I'm not kidding. The ending is one of the worst in cinematic history and if there is EVER an alternate ending I'd buy it faster then it would take me to get to the store in general. Do not have this turn you down, for Tim Burton mentioned in the book ""Burton on Burton"" that it had no ending at all. I'm not saying it's a terrible film, but the execution of it didn't make the movie. Despite this, I think this film should be remembered for what it did to Burton's career, showing his style of Gothic and twisted fairy tales with macabre elements or how it launched its own great animated television series (along with The Addams Family) and merchandise as well as its cult status, instead of having such a disappointing ending. So I recommend this film truly and even if you have not seen a Burton film at all I think you should see this, despite the ending this is one of my favourite films and Tim Burton is one of my personal favourite directors. Oh yes, and as for the title: this marked the only notably good role of Michael Keaton (besides Batman) everything else in his career was a waste."
"Arlis","10","1","2","7 November 2006"," Movies this great don't come very often. Tim Burton rules.
","People tell me Im too friendly about giving out 10 stars, but thats not true. If a movie is perfect, then its perfect and BEETLE JUICE is flawless.<br/><br/>I watched this movie over and over as a kid and it never got old, there was just something about it that I loved. The weird characters, the scenery, the songs it was just great.<br/><br/>I never thought much about anything like actors, direction, production, sets and such as a kid - everything was taken at face value and that was enough.<br/><br/>These days I am very much in to the directors and writers and every aspect of a film. Directors can just point a camera and film a scene and its OK when that happens,but then there are guys like Tim Burton. He is a director but hes more part of the scene than any actor is, his style is unique and no one can do what he does.<br/><br/>This was his second real film following PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE and that movie he didn't really show much of who he was, it was a good movie but it wasn't a Tim Burton movie. In BEETLE JUICE we see amazing colorful sets and weird characters and it's just a movie you can not take your eyes off of.<br/><br/>It's fun and the actors are absolutely perfect. The house and the other worlds are amazing. The songs and the scenes involving them are impossible to ever forget.<br/><br/>This movie is a comedy, but its perfect for the whole family. It has a few scenes where the language might not agree with some parents but it isn't bad. It has elements of horror too which is great and I do not know how anyone could not love it or appreciate it. One thing is for sure, any who watches it will never forget it."
"DavidSim240183","9","1","2","25 August 2006"," A Burtonesque view of the afterlife
","Back in 1988, Tim Burton wasn't quite as well known as he is today. But he was starting to make a name for himself. He'd kicked off his career with the delightfully oddball Pee-wee's Big Adventure in 1985. And it was with that film he showed audiences his flair for unique visuals and madcap surrealism. Before he hit the big time with Batman, in the middle was the wacky afterlife comedy Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is a film that's not really about anything. Truthfully when you get down to it, it has no plot whatsoever. But this was the film that introduced me to the world of Tim Burton, and despite the wafer thin plot, Burton ties it all together through fantastic performances, eye popping effects, and a continual stream of inventive sight gags.<br/><br/>Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are a happily married couple. Until Burton throws a spanner in the works and their lives are cut short when their car goes off the road. They wind up dead, and prisoners in their own home.<br/><br/>With barely enough time to accept their situation, a new family moves in. The quite horrid Deetzes. Charles and Delia Deetze (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) are a yuppie couple with ideas of their own on how to turn their home into a dream house. Their daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) is the only one who can see the Maitlands while the rest of the family fill the house with grotesque modern art and bizarre furniture.<br/><br/>Desperate to be rid of the Deetzes, Adam and Barbara call upon the manic bio-exorcist Beetle Juice (Michael Keaton on fine deranged form). A ghost who specialises in ridding houses of pesky humans, his sick sense of humour leads to all kinds of trouble for all involved. But it proves to be easier said than done putting the genie back in the bottle.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is one of the craziest, bizarre, insane motion pictures ever to grace cinema screens. The fact that it works at all is down to Burton's keen eye for surreal madness and eccentric set design. Although the film becomes an endless series of sight gags, they're always welcome because of Burton's fantastic imagination.<br/><br/>He gets in some hilarious satirical jabs about the bureaucracy of the afterlife. Waiting rooms, civil servants, mounds of red tape, not to mention the dead people who populate these places like people with shrunken heads, others with obvious slit necks and wrists, and even people who are blackened all over. Burton's creativity knows no bounds.<br/><br/>And then we have stop-motion sandworms, the rings of Saturn, hand-crafted models that become life-size environments, I could go on all day. Beetlejuice is certainly a dizzying film that quite takes one aback.<br/><br/>But fortunately the actors are not buried under all the craziness. Baldwin and Davis make quite a nice couple with an infectious happiness, and Catherine O'Hara has never been better. She is downright hilarious as the so-called avant-garde artist who still believes being a yuppie is a trend. I'm especially partial to the scene where she is exploring the house for the first time balking at what she sees as a hellhole. She opens a cupboard with a hanged Geena Davis inside who pulls her face off. O'Hara recoils in shock...at how small the cupboard is. And who could forget her leading the family to Day-O?<br/><br/>Winona Ryder makes an impression at this early stage in her career. Her greatest scene as Lydia is when she writes a surprisingly amusing suicide note. Substituting words for even more depressing statements.<br/><br/>But naturally it's Michael Keaton who steals the show. And it's all the more impressive since he gets such short screen time. Shouting out phrases faster than his mouth can accommodate and practically bouncing off the walls, Keaton is a one-man variety show: ""I attended Julliard, I'm a graduate of the Harvard business school and I travel quite extensively I lived through the Black plague and I had a pretty good time during that I've seen the Exorcist about 167 times and IT KEEPS GETTING FUNNIER EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE IT. NOT TO MENTION THE FACT YOU'RE TALKING TO A DEAD GUY WHAT DO YOU THINK?! Do you think I'm qualified?""<br/><br/>As it gets to the end, it has to be said, things start to pile up on top of each other. The effects, what to do with Beetlejuice, the gags, even a wedding to Lydia. It's all quite a mess really. But a wonderfully nutty, ingenious mess.<br/><br/>This will always be a favourite with me, because it dares to do something different with classic ghost stories, and with the fantastic score from Danny Elfman to help things along, it's hard not to get caught up in the whole dizzying whirlpool of madness that is Beetlejuice."
"fullonrobotchubby","8","1","2","15 August 2006"," ""It keeps getting funnier every single time I see it!""
","How can a film not intrigue an audience's curiosity with a title like that? Beetlejuice is a necessary element to anyone who wants to learn the trademarked style of a Tim Burton film, as it is definitely one of his strangest and funniest. A young and happily married couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) bite the dust in a car wreck and gradually discover they are ghosts. Before they can get a grasp of their new surroundings and abilities, a far more annoying family (with the exception of dark but well-grounded daughter Lydia, played by Winona Ryder), complete with an equally annoying interior decorator, barge into the deceased couple's house up for grabs and put their own finishing touches to the place. Clearly, the spirits want the house to themselves, but how? To make the situation more difficult, they are egged on by a sleazy, sinister poltergeist named Beetlegeuse (Michael Keaton) to scare the pests away, always at the most desperate times. My favorite scene should go without saying... Well okay, one word: DAAAY-O! Despite the mostly dated visual effects and glaring continuity errors (especially the climax with the sandworm), there's a big pile of reasons to see this classic comedy, including the best score of Danny Elfman's career, Robert Goulet, and most of all, Keaton's performance. If you've ever wondered how anything can be hammed up to perfection, look no further than the man who would be Batman."

The only person willing to help them get rid of the family is bio-exorcist, Beetle Juice. Asking for his help turns out to be a very bad move indeed.<br/><br/>This movie is by far a cult classic.

The whole film has that great Burton style that we all know and love, only perhaps a touch more macabre than usual. Keaton completely steals the show in a relatively small role as the title character, a rude, crude, self-proclaimed ""Bio-Exorcist"". The effects are amazing, the various hauntings looked great! Baldwin and Davis both did great in their roles, especially near the end. All the creatures and characters from the afterlife were very cool. My only gripe with this movie is how long they waited to introduce the title character. Not a huge problem, but I would have liked to see more of Keaton.

Though compared to the special effects we have today, it seems a bit low key, it still seems to amaze me every time I watch it. The characters are enchanting, the sets are alluring, and the acting is off the charts. This film has had a faithful watcher for the past 12 years, and it's going to keep having one for many years to come."

","A remarkable work of entertainment. Just the idea of a ""bio-exorcist"" to remove annoying and pretentious people from one's former home is a great idea, taking the ghost's side of argument. Michael Keaton is perfect in what, I think, is his most indispensable, if not greatest, screen performance to date. This is probably the most entertaining 92 minutes with nothing to say I have ever watched. I mean it as a compliment. One absurd turn after another without any hidden message, sappy preachment, drippy love stories, horror clichÃ©s or trite moral-of-the-story at the end. Well balanced use of both verbal wit, broad humor (e.g. the run up to ""Nice f---- model""), really off the wall segments (""Day-O"" into the dinner and they LIKE it) and the refreshing absence of gratuitous shots to the crotch, body functions etc that pollute so much current comedy. And at the end, Lydia can drop her goth act (sort of silly when you know real dead people) and everybody just gets along, except maybe Otho even after he's burnt and buried the polyester and decontaminated himself from the exposure."

","Michael Keaton is a great ,but sadly , underrated actor ,as his fans always say - everyone's fans say things like this. Alright. First i saw Keaton in ""The Dream Team"", a really great film , and this psycho image stuck in my mind. Once i watched the Beetlejuice cartoons, and found they were based on a film, and when it turned out that the film had Keaton as a main character , i felt it couldn't be bad! And of course it wasn't. It is madly funny and sometimes a bit idiotic, casting is great - such roles suit Keaton much more than for instance Batman (yes , i really don't like Batman , but don't blame me cause this review ain't about it :)) - and decoration and design is incredible."

","I was reading some of the posts here and had to post my own. Some people tend to over analyze, like the poster from England who left an unbelievably lengthy analysis of the film (so long, I fell asleep!). <br/><br/>Lighten up folks! It's a comedy - a dark, satirical, FICTIONAL comedy. Forget the facts and reality! They don't apply here - particularly when Tim Burton is directing! And for those of you who have already seen it, let's face it, it's hysterically funny! I have seen this film so many times, I've lost count and ""it keeps getting' funnier every single time I see it!"" It really does. Michael Keaton is a hoot in the title role and absolutely steals this film! <br/><br/>If you enjoy Tim Burton films, you will recognize his style. Angled camera work and sets with obtuse, geometric shapes, not to mention the dark, murky mood with something bright and colorful hidden beneath it all. If you're into Tim Burton and basically any kind of satirical humor, you will love Beetlejuice. If you're a nun, you'll probably need to recite a few Hail Mary's after seeing this! Either way, it's worth the viewing for all the laughs it brings!"

","SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>I often ask myself what Johnny Depp would have been like as Beetlejuice, and whether he could have pulled it off at such a young age. Keaton, coming from a comedy background however, is perfect for the role, and I find difficulty in seeing who could have done a better job. While some of the effects look dated, ie. The sand snake, others still look pretty good. I'm sure most of you know the story, so I'll skip that, and say why this is a great film. It is very surreal, with some excellent dark comedy, and winning performances from Keaton and Ryder, and special mention going to Glenn Shadix as Otho. Davies is good as always, and Baldwin is ok, but watching Keaton skip about is the high point. Every line he has is gold, and delivered to perfection, and the most memorable scenes usually revolve around him. My favourite is probably the final, head-shrinking scene. The score, by Danny Elfman is also worthy of mentioning, and the make up team won an Oscar. Another rare treat.<br/><br/>8 OUT OF 10"

","The film's main heroes are two borderline weirdos, which is, in a politico-philosophical way, very refreshing (at least we're over with the always-good-in-everything-heroes like John Wayne or Charlton Heston). All the characters close to the common way of life (and not only the American way of life, I can assure you that) are boring while the freaks are really funny (I mean you laugh with them, not against).

","He's a character from the ghost world - if you repeat his name, he will come, and then you'll have the problem of getting rid of him.  He is not Candyman.  He is Michael Keaton, in perhaps the most bizarre performance of his life.  Can you believe someone put this actor and this director in charge of their Batman franchise?  It's an insane riot from the moment Keaton is introduced, and the smorgasboard stretches from ghosts dressed up as ghosts to Keaton's head on a snake to the famous ""Day-O"" sequence."
"timefreezer7","9","1","2","10 December 2003"," After 10 or so times I watched it , still engaging - every fantasy fan should see it
","Directed by Tim Burton<br/><br/> Written by Michael McDowell and Warren Skaaren<br/><br/> Starring: Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Michael Keaton<br/><br/>A brilliant, fascinating and imaginative black comedy by Tim Burton, who proved unambiguously his great talents and went on to direct Batman . Beetlejuice is a satire dealing with the supernatural and is a modern fairy tale. Simultaneously it has a good share of hilarious moments and creepy scenes (like the snake scene).<br/><br/>Although the basic plot may be regarded as quite original and funny, I am somehow compelled to point out that the basic concept seems to be loosely influenced by Oscar Wilde's ""The Canterville Ghost,"" a rather dark fairy tale for kids (in precisely the same      tradition of Roald Dahl's creepy books like  ""The Witches,"" ""Matilda,"" ""James and the Giant Peach"" etc.) . It contains the hopeless attempts of an undead British lord who haunts his castle for centuries and callously scares off or even murders in gruesome ways all the subsequent habitants of the castle (including his very own descendants) only to fail to boot out a wacky American family of Republicans , who have bought the castle and have taken over his residence. Failed efforts to show them his presence include post-midnight roaming in the hallways hauling a rusty creaking metal chain and breaking the tea set in the living room. Sounds familiar?<br/><br/>The film starts out as your typical romantic sitcom with your happy couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara Maitland (Geena Davis) being the ideal young husband and wife, full of love for each other and dreams. They live in a big house on an idyllic grassland near a cute little American hometown. The first plot twist comes 3 minutes later when Adam and Barbara are killed in a peculiar ironic sequence (which seems to have be taken by a Wile E. Coyote cartoon). Their spirits return in the house without remembering what happened. After a short period of research they realize that they are now ghosts and they have to endure a transitional state during which they are stuck in the house for good. As if there weren't enough problems already, a typical American yuppie called Charles Deitz (Jeffrey Jones) buys the house and sees the perfect chance to have a calm relaxing period from his anxious life in N.Y. Along with him comes his neurotic second wife Delia (Catherine O' Hara) who regards her stone monstrosities of statues as skilled art and will do anything to promote them, and his daughter from the first marriage Lydia (an alarmingly pale Winona Ryder in one of her first acting steps). Lydia is a miniature of a Black Widow, dressed in black and self acknowledges her existence as ""strange and unusual."" She hates her step-mother as much as Delia hates her. The two ghosts want to get rid of the intruders: after several unsuccessful ""hauntings"" they have no other option but to contact a weird ""Bio-Exorcist"" called Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) to help them. This propagates a series of uncontrollable situations which culminate into a hilarious climax.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is truly one of the most visually stunning and imaginative movies ever seen. Where to begin....well the cinematography is very good. The scenes in the afterlife world which depicts it as a surrealistic public service full of bureaucratic hints and tricks, is wonderful and gives us a strong satirical aspect of our world ( HELL! - even in the afterlife you need priority numbers !!!) along with beautiful-for-the-eye scenes. The director of photography made an excellent job with his colorful lighting. The sets, costumes and make up are exceptional. Who can forget the scorched ""Cigar Man"" who ""is trying to quit?"" Who can forget the room with the pit of ""exorcised souls"" with the Escherish designs? Who can forget the ending sequence which is simultaneously creepy (an occult exorcism with paganistic spells taking place on a stormy night) and funny with Beetlejuice gatecrashing the session, evoking chaos.<br/><br/>The SFX team really outdid themselves. For a 1988 movie we have some of the most original SFX to appear in screen for years. Further than the afterlife sequence we have hilarious scenes in Beetlejuice's miniature graveyard or the notorious whorehouse sequence or the climactic metamorphosis of the Beetlejuice to a neon lighted sparkling fun-fair hammer which sends the guests to the ceiling (the entire movie seems to be a roller-coaster with a ""terror train,"" dark and kind of scary but great fun). Not to mention Delia's sculptures which come to life. There are other examples but I think I gave away too many spoilers. The music score by Danny Elfman gives the right two-natured feeling of a horror carnival the film has. There are some great existential moments which have a dreary moody feeling like when Lydia discovers the miniature city in the attic fully illuminated by white lights. The performances from all the actors are great. Winona Ryder shines here (no pun intended) in a very unusual role. The same goes for Michael Keaton as the fast talking deranged voluptuous Bio-Exorcist called Beetlejuice. The word ""perfect"" can't do this man justice. See the movie and judge for yourselves.<br/><br/>Although Beetlejuice drops in literally half way through the film (time-keep for yourselves if you don't believe me) he is the definition of a scene stealer and he even occupies the film title!! However I would like to underline that the best scenes in the film are the opening ones when the Maitlands try to figure out what is going on and struggle to adjust in the new status quo. Beetlejuice is a semi-dark masterpiece and a classic movie which can be viewed over and over many times. If you are a fan of dark satirical flicks like Gremlins then this is definitely a must-see for you.<br/><br/> BEETLEJUICE     9.5 / 10"

"dee.reid","10","1","2","16 July 2003"," Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice! My number 8 movie.
","I always used to love those three magical words growing up. I've watched Tim Burton's best pre-""Batman"" film over 100 times since I was a kid. I was only three years old when ""Beetlejuice"" hit the theaters back in 1988 and though I didn't see it then, it has had a remarkable effect on me. No, I'm not morbid or ""strange and unusual"", I just view it as one of the best movies I have ever seen. The special effects and make-up, though seriously dated by today's standards are still amazing. The acting is intentionally campy from what I can see. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are pretty convincing as the recently deceased couple forced to call upon the ""Ghost with the Most"" (Michael Keaton) to deal with the obnoxious family (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and a very good Winona Ryder) that has moved into their home. <br/><br/>So what is so great about it? First off, MICHAEL KEATON!!! This is the movie that introduced me to one of the most gifted comic actors of our time.<br/><br/>I would be blown away again by his second collaboration with Tim Burton a year later in ""Batman"". He is off the wall in this movie. You can hardly tell that it's him underneath that ghastly make-up, but only his voice gives him away. <br/><br/>Second, Tim Burton. To me, ""Beetlejuice"" is Burton's first great film and unlike many of his following efforts, really has that dark humor thing going. I mean, I love Tim Burton movies and I've seen all of them (""Planet of the Apes"", being his only ""bad"" movie). I consider Burton's films ""Beetlejuice"", ""Batman"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" to be his three greatest by far. ""Beetlejuice"" is Burton's first outing, ""Batman"" made him big, and he took a shot at critical-respectability with ""Edward Scissorhands"".<br/><br/>Winona Ryder. My how she has grown up since this movie. Not caring too much about her recent legal troubles, I think she is one of the most underrated actresses today. I loved her character, Lydia in this movie. It's strange how her fascination with death suddenly rings home after she gets to know the Maitlands a little bit. <br/><br/>""Beetlejuice"" is one of my favorite movies of all time and I love it.<br/><br/>10/10"

","This is a great movie, totally insane yet still very funny. There is something about this movie that makes it a winner, and I think that something is Michael Keaton. He is just hilarious as Betelguese which is a character that fits him like a glove. The style of the film is totally different from anything I've ever seen before. Everything in it is so bizarre that looks right out of a cartoon.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are likeable as he recently deceased, with Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara and Winona Ryder as the new home owners. But it is the stand-out performance of Michael Keaton as Betelguese that is the real gem. The director Tim Burton does a fantastic job of bringing this unusual story to life by keeping it very over the top. Another plus to this film was the music score by Danny Elfman, who always does good work.<br/><br/>This is a completely off the wall movie which put together a great combination of director, cast, story, music and effects which resulted in a truly great and enjoyable movie."

The film moves along very nicely, with no dead spots in it at all. This is not one for the young, but anybody over 12 or so should be able to handle the SFX, some of which are scary or gross.

","While Michael Keaton is the ""name draw"" despite his character's relatively small screen-time (and as he cuts loose in one of these occasional ""insane"" roles that Keaton likes to take on), the real focus is on the rest of the cast.  Baldwin and Davis are great as the bewildered ghosts, Ryder is great, and Jones and O'Hara (often overlooked) are great comedy actors.  There's a kind of ""anything goes"" attitude to the whole thing, giving Beetlejuice's antics a Robin Williams-sort of improvisational air (how would Williams have played the part)?  Keaton is still great though:  he doesn't even bother to try make his character likeable, but just kind of sweeps you along."
"raop74","9","1","2","17 December 2001"," Tim Burton's hits his prime with Beetlejuice, but now he directs drivel...
","I love Tim Burton's early works, such as Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Ed Wood.  His more recent films (Mars Attacks, the horribly awful Battle of the Apes remake) just don't have the darkly comic zing of these earlier works.  Beetlejuice is a hilarious film, and to quote the title character himself, ""...It just keeps getting funnier every time I see it!""  <br/><br/>The cast of the film is superb. The fact that the film gleefully mocks death & afterlife and that it comes off so well shows what a tremendous imagination Tim Burton has (or had). Michael Keaton (where is he these days?) is magnificent as Beetlejuice, a disgusting dead guy mooching off the dearly departed - in this case, the goofy but lovable Maitlands. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis (two more we don't see much now) are perfect as tbe clueless, recently-deceased Adam and Barbara Maitland.  Winona Ryder is cynical yet sweet in her role as Lydia.  Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones masterfully play Lydia's parents as clueless, selfish, and wacky urbanites.<br/><br/>
Watch this movie and you will pine for the days that Burton was so innovative - before Hollywood corrupted him."

I love the scene where the couple first meets Beetlejuice and ends with Betlejuice kicking over a tree model and screaming ""Nice f***en model!"" I give Betlejuice 9/10."

","[possible spoilers] Having nearly forgotten this 13-year-old film, I recently took it down off the shelf  to watch it again, and  was reminded of its enduring charm.  An offbeat and original story line, an intelligent and witty script, some truly off-the-wall special effects and scene-setting, and an essentially warmhearted and gentle tone make this a movie that has possibilities of attaining the status of a minor classic.  Michael Keaton of course steals the show as Betelgeuse (pronounced Â‘beetle-juice') an indefinable creature of the nether regions, whose manically offensive crudeness comes close to moving beyond repulsive to endearing. It is a unique characterization, but then never before - or since - has such a character been committed to cellulose. Provides a very enjoyable evening's entertainment, and leaves a surprising feeling of well-being, as ghosts and humans live happily ever after."

","Beetlejuice, in recent years, has become a favorite for TV - it seems to be on every couple of months - so, I have seen it in bits and pieces, frequently happening upon it as I channel hop. I consider it a charming, little delight, and it never fails to create a warm feeling as I watch it. I have seen some bad Tim Burton, and some good Tim Burton, and I consider this to be his best. Also, it is Michael Keaton's best, in my opinion. It doesn't seem to be Michael Keaton, in fact, it doesn't seem to be anyone but Beetlejuice - the character has a life of it's own, transcending any actor happening to play him. Catherine O'Hara is another actor who shines here; she's a comedic force in just about everything she's done. One of the biggest delights of this gem is the inclusion of the Harry Belefonte tunes on the soundtrack - I love them."

"aesgaard41","8","1","2","27 November 2000"," Great Movie,Lousy Premise
","I'm a big fan of ghost movies,but I do tend to go into them with a certain knowledge of ghosts and paranormal activity. This movie seems to suggest that a sub-culture exists beyond our knowledge and has been developing into a society beyond the confines of our reality. This movie is pure Tim Burton as we see the point of view from the ghosts who realize that strangers have moved into their house and have to hire a poltergeist named Betelgeuse who must have been a really obnoxious New York City cab driver before he died. Michael Keaton is the title role with the least screen time, but he is so wild and crazy with his appearances that it's barely noticeable. Winona Ryder is the psychic daughter who feels his presence. Cute and gothic as Lydia Deets, this is definitely one of the highlights of her career. Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara are wildly eccentric as the new owners who viciously rearrange the ghost's enviroment and character actor Glenn Shadix puts in a great role as the wierdly eccentric kook who becomes a remorseful exorcist. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are the one-dimensional traffic cops in this barrage of humor and wildness as they experience Burton's slanted views of purgatory and the afterlife. This is where the movie really deviates from actual phenomenon and instead suggests that ghosts have civilized the afterlife instead of crossing over. I'm sorry but ""Casper"" made more sense. The movie does succeed in creating images and dark visions straight from Tim Burton's imagination and that's where the appeal of the movie lays.  The Harry Belafonte score, however, is contagious, but the overall movie has a corny but hilarious laugh a second roller coast ride to it.I give it eight out of ten stars."

","Beetlejuice is a very unique movie, but I'm not surprised. Tim Burton, master of the macabre, directed this odd movie. I have to say that this movie isn't only dark, it's hilarious. The movie is truly funny, and the blend between horror and humor was superb. It's about a wife and husband, played by Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin, who die in a car accident. The two still live on Earth, but as ghosts. Suddenly, a family moves into their house and changes it all around into a cold and weird house. The two ghosts are now miserable, so they decide to try to scare them out. It doesn't work. They go into the spirit world to ask for some help. Their advice lady gives them some excellent ways to scare them out. It still doesn't work. But something else happens, too. The family's weird daughter, played by Winona Ryder, finds out about them. She becomes they're freind. It still doesn't stop the ghosts desire to get them out of the house, so they do something no one thought of. They called a man from the spirit world, one who specializes in these sort of things. His name is Beetlegeuse, pronounced Beetlejuice, and the scares he has in his  bag of tricks are much, much scarier than the ones the two have tried already. But they start to figure out that Beetlejuice isn't doing this for them, but for himself. He loves to scare, and he'll do anything to do it. They find out that he threatens the life of the family's daughter, and themselves. They must stop him.<br/><br/>Although it sounds sort of like a serious horror story, the movie is a total comedy. Still, it has a lot of Tim Burton style quirkiness in it. Michael Keaten is wonderful as Beetlejuice, and once again, Danny Elfman does a great score. If you like dark comedies, and you love Tim Burton, go rent this movie this second."

","I've seen this film multiple times, and it never ceases to entertain me. I might not say that it gets funnier and funnier every single time I see it, however, Keaton's showmanship in this film remains unmatched by any portrayal of the filthy undead that I've ever seen.  The casting is perfect, from Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara as the Deitzes, to Davis and Baldwin as the Maitlands, to Juno, to Miss Argentina, to everyone.  While Ryder's performance of Lydia was a bit rough around the edges, it's certainly great work, especially for one of her first films. There's not a single person in this movie whose performance I can't say was dead on (no pun intended). The comic timing was perfect, Elfman's score was fantastically jaunty while at the same time eerie, and of course, the scenery and direction were genius. This is certainly some of Burton's best work.  And can I just say that I LOVE Glenn Shadix (Otho)?  I think he should just be in every movie.  Just put him in there, Forrest Gump style.  The layers of this movie are infinite, and I can't say enough good things about it.  Certainly both a conventional and a cult classic.  A quintessential ""10""."

","The main problem with ""Beetlejuice"" is that its supposed main character, Beetlejuice, or ""geuse,"" doesn't seem to hold any relevancy to the plot. He's there, but why? He doesn't really make up the film at all. His total time on-screen is probably about thirty minutes, yet they play him up as if he is what the film is about.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a newlywed couple, Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, moving into an old house in the middle of nowhere. However, their lives are cut short after they die in a car accident.<br/><br/>But their actual spirits are far from dead. They are attached to their house, and they cannot leave, or ""sandworms"" will kill them. Er, kill them more than they are killed already, I suppose. I guess Tim Burton didn't realize that dead people can't die. Anyway...<br/><br/>Soon, a couple (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) move into the home with their gothic daughter, Winona Ryder. They redecorate the home, much to the dislike of Jeffrey, and pretty much change everything about the house.<br/><br/>This makes ghosts Geena and Alec mad, and they want the new occupants of their home out. As Baldwin says in one scene, ""Do you want to have to eat breakfast with these people for the rest of our lives?"" I'm not sure if this line is meant to be funny, since they are already dead, or if it is supposed to be serious. It's hard to tell in this film that confuses the dead for the living many, many times.<br/><br/>So the two ghosts take a trip to the other side, where they learn from a dead counselor that they must scare the owners out of the ghosts' old home if they want them to leave.<br/><br/>The couple of ghosts try this haunting thing in an effort to scare the new home-owners out of THEIR home. But, unfortunately, O'Hara and Jones only find the supernatural figures living in their attic amusing and see it as a profit. <br/><br/>The two ghosts are left with no choice. They call upon Beetlegeuse (Michael Keaton) to help them rid the house of its unwanted occupants. Beetlegeuse is called upon by saying his name three times, a technique later to be ripped-off in ""Candyman."" He comes, he tries to rid the home, but in the process causes a lot of mayhem. <br/><br/>But here's the catch. Beetlegeuse comes in about an hour into the film, which is only some 90 minutes long. You do the math. He is not in the film nearly enough.<br/><br/>The beginning is quite good, but they should either have a) sped up the beginning a bit more to fit more time with Beetlegeuse in or b) made the film a half hour longer, which would probably have been a better choice. Michael Keaton is wild in his role, and entertaining. His sporadic and crazy personality is a mix between Ace Ventura and Jerry Lewis, only ten times funnier.. And I would liked to have seen him some more before the credits started rolling.<br/><br/>The film takes too much time setting everything up, when, in fact, it could have been set up in half the time. Beetlegeuse just doesn't get enough screen-time, and because of this, he seems like an empty character that pays nothing to the plot, even though the entire film is named after him. He comes, he scares the people twice, and then he disappears. Credits.<br/><br/>
If you really analyze the film, you will realize that with Beetlegeuse (the character), the plot really gained nothing.  He doesn't really pay anything to the plot at all. He scares the occupants once or twice (which wasn't Keaton but visual effects one of the times). This could have been done with someone else. He saves the ghosts from dying at the end. This could have been done by the dead counselor from the other side.<br/><br/>Of course, that wouldn't have made the film any good, but my point that is Beetlegeuse really didn't need to be in the film. The writers could easily have put existing characters in his place to do actions he performs. This is bad for a film that is named after a character who barely appears in it at all, and really pays no relevancy whatsoever.<br/><br/>The writers apparently wrote themselves into a corner with Beetlegeuse (the character). What does his character give to the plot? What is the relevancy? Nothing, really, as I said before. They should have skimmed on the other characters (like the dead counselor) and played up Beetlegeuse a bit. Then the film would have been a whole lot better than it is.<br/><br/>I suppose the sheer originality of the film makes it worth seeing, and one of the scenes involving a group of people being possessed and singing and dancing is very funny. But again, the filmmakers should have taken more time to write Beetlegeuse into the script before they started filming.<br/><br/>3/5 stars -<br/><br/>John Ulmer"

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","1","3","30 September 2015"," It is so sweet to be dead and haunting
","That's the real beginning of this Tim Burton of great fame. This film is absolutely crazy as for the tomfoolery, the ghosts, the people and the situations. It is off limits in all possible ways but it is great because this time there are two things that hold the whole story together.<br/><br/>First of all there is the music. The calypso is a phenomenal good idea. That music in itself is the music of the dead, of happy newly deceased who finally get their last word in this world: they can stay in their home and they become the real soul of this home that is inhabited by some living people and haunted by them with the full agreement and collaboration from the living inhabitants. Death is finally the pleasant delirium that it is supposed to be and not that ordeal so many people are afraid of. When you die you must make friends with some living people. The point is to find how you can make yourself useful to them so that they will welcome you in their home that used to be yours.<br/><br/>The calypso is the gluing element of this fable. Just for it I would watch the film twenty five times if not more.<br/><br/>The second element is that death is a world in itself, a world that is beyond limits and off limits at the same time, in other words infinite and limitless. Death is a real paradise if you accept to be a ghost and to welcome the living in your ordeal. The world of the dead is a vicious world you do not want to linger in. They are so dead that they have to wait for their turn to even get the slightest attention, to wait millions of turns before they just have one chance to maybe see Juno or whoever can help them change their diapers or dance the polka with flies in a spider web waiting for the spider to come and swallow you alive, well that's a way of speaking since you are dead.<br/><br/>In this crazy world of the dead there is one character you must absolutely meet though you will lose your head, your brain, your sanity and even probably your dead virginity if you meet him. He is the concoction only the dead can relish. He is a breakfast drink for living dead, the extracted juice of some bugs generally known as beetles. And these beetles are not singing even if Beetlejuice is as gross and aggressive as most other beetles, I mean the type that sings. Remember his only and sole goal is to be resuscitated and in this crazy world of the dead you can only be rejuvenated, reborn if you marry a living being and in this case do not dream you can escape the straight marriage of those old days. I guess the Supreme Court had not yet ruled on the subject. Maybe the land of the dead is beyond their jurisdiction.<br/><br/>This way of laughing of the dead, of death is probably the best thing you can do while you are still alive and it is so easy to trespass onto the other side without even knowing about it and certainly not looking behind. Anyone who is a little bit anxious about the end of their life on this earth should enjoy this film that is more than entertainment, it is undertaking. Next time be careful and just run over the dumb dog who is trying to send you into the hellish sands of the dune inferno vastly traveled, run through and browsed by sand worms that have more teeth than a whole herd of dragons. <br/><br/>But remember that getting on board one of these sand worms is the best way to get rid of the bad demonic Beetlejuice and to conquer your haunting place in this here world of the living. You could even consider you have become the new Messiah, Moadib.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

Screw It I am counting anywhere SPOILER ALERT EVERYBODY I guess)I mean the scene when the mainlands poses all the new people in their house and make them do a hilarious dance sent me and the rest of the audience into hysterics and the ending when Lydia starts flying about while singing jump in the line while Beetlejuice gets his head shrunken and the ghost football players make an appearance this Movie is funny."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","3","9 February 2010"," Tim Burton, the early years.
","Well, to be honest, this movie was better in my memory than it actually turned out to be when I just recently re-watched it again.<br/><br/>I really like Tim Burton and than of course especially the style and atmosphere that he always brings to his movies. In that regard this movie is also really a typical Tim Burton movie. It however is also a very early Tim Burton movie. The only major movie that he had done before this one was ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"". Seems to me that in those early days he was still somewhat searching for the right balance between the visuals, quirkiness and a story. The balance in this movie is at times still a bit off, with makes it a somewhat awkward movie at times.<br/><br/>Still I can appreciate ""Beetle Juice"" for being the cult-classic that it is. It's certainly a different movie and obviously a very well made one. It's a fun, light-hearted movie, even with all of its heavy subjects that are actually in it. I mean after all, this is a movie about death. But death never looked so colorful and hysterical.<br/><br/>The movie knows how not too take itself ever too serious and lots of stuff in the movie and its story simply make no sense. They simply decided not to let it. It's were part of the movie its quirkiness comes from.<br/><br/>But of course visuals also play an important role in that. If you have seen a Tim Burton movie before and of course you have, you'll know that his movies are very visually orientated and he has his very own distinctive style. This time the movie is not just partly Gothic looking it's also obviously inspired by German expressionism. Like basically all of his movie, it's a very surreal one but above all also constantly entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Quite amazing to watch these days the actors that are in this movie. None of them were really big names at the time but they soon become after this movie. The most obvious names are Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder and Michael Keaton. I wished the movie had more of Michael Keaton in it as it though, as Beetlejuice. He's one over-the-top going, crazy, fun clown like character that can be hired in the afterlife as a bio-exorcist to scare out the living. But we also really shouldn't forget Jeffrey Jones and Glenn Shadix who both were also really hilarious and perfectly cast in their roles.<br/><br/>One of the other things that really adds perfectly to the movie its atmosphere, besides its impressive imaginative visuals, is the musical score by Danny Elfman. Ever since ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" he has pretty much scored Tim Burton's every work.<br/><br/>Even though it is not as smooth as a movie, especially story-wise, it still is an early Tim Burton movie that is worth seeing.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","1","3","29 November 2009"," Excellent film.
","Tim Burton has directed a lot of movies. I think one of his first ones though was probably Beetle juice. Beetle juice is a film of mixture. Beetle juice is funny, creepy, weird, and among many things, excellent. I should've reviewed this film ages ago, I didn't for some reason I don't know why.<br/><br/>Beetle juice is the story of a couple(Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who are killed in a car accident. Within a few months, their house is for sale. And these obnoxious people(Jeffery Jones and Catherine O'Hara)move in. so, this couple gets the help of this ass ugly guy named Beetle juice(Michael Keaton) to try to scare these people out of their home. But eventually, the daughter of these people(Winona Ryder)can see them.<br/><br/>I told you that this film was very creative. You can barely tell that that is Michael Keaton under there. Keaton is excellent as Beetle juice. Beetle juice is actually creepy, somewhat thanks to Keaton, and other weird things that happen in this movie. I guess weird is Burton's middle name.<br/><br/>I love Burton's films because they have such a way of weirdness. Just watch Burton's Edward Scissorhands. You''l know what I am talking about. Beetle juice isn't Burton's best. I will watch anything that Burton does. If you are the same way, watch Beetle juice. If you haven't already."

","It takes a certain kind of childlike, ghoulish glee to extract the words 'Beetle Juice' from a red supergiant located 570 light-years from Earth - and Tim Burton films are nothing if not ghoulishly gleeful.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton (born Michael Douglas, but someone had to move aside, and it wasn't going to be the son of Spartacus) is in career-best mode as the wiseass bio-exorcist (""I've seen The Exorcist about 167 times and it keeps getting funnier every single time I see it!!""), self-interestedly aiding dead couple Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis through the afterlife. A place that owes less to German Romanticism (with its heavenly mountains and lakes) than German Expressionism (with its angular shadows and skewed corridors straight out of The Cabinet Of Dr Caligari).<br/><br/>Of all Burton's early works, this must be the most fun (Pee-Wee Herman just looks increasingly dodgy and weird), and certainly contains the most imaginative use of a Harry Belafonte number, aside from the Muppets' take on 'The Banana Boat Song'. Appropriately, for a film and a character named after a star, Burton's singular take on the haunted house picture rocketed both director and Keaton into the stratosphere."
"blanche-2","7","1","3","27 October 2009"," Tim Burton ghost story
","There's nothing new about ghost stories, or even married couples who are ghosts, but there's only one Tim Burton. Here, in 1988's ""Beetle Juice,"" he puts his own zany, delightful spin on a ghost story, complete with ghosts who try scaring people with sheets over their heads.<br/><br/>Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) die when their car goes over a cliff, and, returning to their house, they soon realize they didn't survive the crash. One hint was no reflections in the mirror. They find a handbook for the recently deceased. They also find a family, the Deetzes, moving into their house (Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, and the goth-foreshadowing Winona Ryder). Adam and Barbara want the people out of their house, and when they meet their counselor from the other side (Sylvia Sidney), they learn they have to stay in the house for 125 years. They realize that they have to scare the Deetzes away. Though they have been warned against contacting the zombie Betelguese (Michael Keaton), they need help, so they call upon him. If he can't help them get rid of the Deetzes, no one can.<br/><br/>Bizarre, crazy film with all kinds of colorful effects and Harry Belafonte music. My mother was a great fan of Belafonte and saw him in concert; we had every one of those recordings. It was great fun hearing them again in some hilarious situations! Strangely, the actual Betelgeuse character is a small role, but Keaton is so bombastic and wild, it's enough. He's excellent. The focus of the story is on Baldwin and Davis, who are attractive and very believable as a married couple. Sylvia Sidney, Dick Cavett, and Robert Goulet have small roles, and they're all great. This was a breakout film for Winona Ryder, the only Deetz who can see the ghosts. She does a standout job, and Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones are appropriately ""out there"" as Mr. and Mrs. Deetz.<br/><br/>Few people have Tim Burton's sensibility or imagination. Sometimes I'm not sure if that's a bad thing, but there's no doubt that he's never boring. In anyone else's hands, this would have been an amusing movie. In Burton's hands, it's highly unusual."
"hall895","7","1","3","16 October 2009"," The ghost with the most
","There are so many comedies of the 1980s which provided some laughs upon their release but which all these years later are not remembered all that fondly if they are remembered at all. Beetlejuice is an exception. It may not be an all-time comedy classic but it has stood the test of time. The film has so many moments which are, if not exactly classic, certainly memorable. The movie is certainly a bit out there but it is that quirkiness which provides so much of the movie's charm. You haven't seen many movies quite like this one.<br/><br/>As our story begins we meet young New England couple Adam and Barbara Maitland, played charmingly by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis respectively. Yes, there once was a time when Alec Baldwin was capable of being charming. Anyhow our very charming couple are rather unfortunately about to find themselves quite dead. After a car accident they find themselves back in their home, rather unsure of how they got there. They will soon come to realize that they did not survive the accident. And thus begins their bizarre journey through the afterlife. Turns out they have to remain in their home for 125 years. Which wouldn't seem all that bad...until the Deetzes move in. The Maitlands find the Deetzes, with their big plans for remodeling the house, to be rather obnoxious and our ghosts are determined to scare them away. They will get sympathy from an unlikely source, the Deetzes' goth teen daughter Lydia, played beautifully by Winona Ryder, who can see the ghostly pair and relates to them a heck of a lot better than she does to her parents.<br/><br/>Now am I forgetting anything? Oh yes, Beetlejuice himself, the ""bio-exorcist"" as played so memorably by Michael Keaton. It's easy to go this far not having mentioned Beetlejuice because in the grand scheme of things the character really isn't on the screen all that much. But when he is he certainly makes an impression. The movie gets an unmistakable jolt of energy every time the ""ghost with the most"" shows up. Keaton turns in a crude, bombastic, manic and often hilarious performance. And to be fair Beetlejuice, the movie, is often crying out for the energy Beetlejuice, the character, provides. The movie is a little flat at times but Keaton is there to prop it up when needed. Director Tim Burton created a fascinating world here and inhabited it with some great characters. Not everything in the movie works. Some of the effects look cheap (Burton will tell you intentionally so) and the story definitely has some lulls. But when the movie hits it hits big. There are some scenes here which will always be remembered very fondly. Most notably two scenes which make great use of the music of Harry Belafonte come to mind. All in all it's a movie which should leave you with a smile on your face and sometimes that's all you really need a movie to do."
"pekinman","10","1","3","23 September 2009"," I feel a little .... anxious
","It is probably redundant at this point, 21 years after the initial release of 'Beetlejuice', to proclaim its status as a modern comedy classic, but it IS. This is probably Tim Burton's most commercially successful film after the two 'Batman' movies, airing on the cable channels on a regular basis and still as fresh and funny as ever.<br/><br/>I think the Hollywood money people are finally coming around to the fact that Burton has become a very bankable director, if they are willing to indulge him in the occasional outré production, like 'Mars Attacks!', for his loyal fans who long ago recognized a true 'auteur' (I don't like that word but...). Few directors have put their individual stamps on their films that are instantly recognizable; Hitchock, Bergman, von Trier, Herzog, Fellini, Tarnatino and some others, and now Tim Burton. In 50 years we will still be watching Burton films while many other current darlings of Hollywood will be forgotten.<br/><br/>'Beetlejuice' might seem like a dark, ill-tempered story to those who haven't seen it, but it is one of Burton's most light-hearted creations, in spite of the fact that the lead characters are killed at the beginning of the movie and, like 'Topper Returns', appear as ghosts who are instrumental in changing earthly affairs for the still living.<br/><br/>Michael Keaton is hilarious as the eponymous lead, supported by some great comedians at their best, notably Catherine O'Hara (what has happened to her?), Jeffrey Jones, Glenn Shadix and the late, great Sylvia Sidney as the chain-smoking, tough-nosed, abrasive-tongued spiritual guide.<br/><br/>There is one unforgettably hilarious scene set at the dinner table and all the guests are possessed by Beetlejuice and sing 'Day-oh-dayayay-oh!' while being manipulated like marionettes around the table. The climax of this scene is classic.<br/><br/>This film is highly recommended for all ages, even very young children will like it, though some of the facial f/x are a bit scary, and the scene in the heavenly waiting room, though screamingly funny, may not sit well with youngsters trying to go to sleep in a dark room afterwards. Depends on the kid, I suppose. <br/><br/>Another Burton off-the-wall masterwork."
"Pumpkin_Man","10","1","3","16 August 2009"," A Gothic Tim Burton Classic!!!
","I thought this was a really good movie! Since it's a film by Tim Burton, you get a dark, depressing feel, and Danny Elfman music, and stripes. Michael Keaton, Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, and Winona Ryder all did a perfect job! Michael Keaton is hilarious and awesome as Beetlejuice! Adam and Barbara Maitland die in a car crash, they are given a rule book to go by on how to be dead. The Deetz family moves in, but Adam and Barbara want them out. Somehow, they're hot Gothic daughter, Lydia can see them. They become friends, but they still want to scare them out. They seek the help of Beetlejuice, who is extremely obnoxious, and a bio-exorcist who tries to help Adam and Barbara, but he's too scary and obnoxious to leave and stop. The Deetz's bring Adam and Barbara back from the dead, but Lydia doesn't want them to because it'll torture them. Desperately, she asks Beetlejuice to help. If you love Gothic comedy, you'll love BEETLEJUICE!!!"
"hnt_dnl","10","1","3","7 August 2009"," Tim Burton's most purely fun film!
","Another gem from the 1980s and by one of my favorite directors...the unique and special Tim Burton. One of the few 80s films that I think is REQUIRED viewing, especially by wannabe filmmakers, BEETLEJUICE is a prime example of ""less is more"". With a relatively unknown (at the time) cast, cheap claymation effects, cartoony cardboard sets, simple location shooting, and I'll bet made in a short period of time with the most simple script, Burton has fashioned one of the most original films in the last 30 years! BEETLEJUICE is most certainly Burton's most purely entertaining film AND his oddest. It perhaps is the REAL Tim Burton at play. While films like BATMAN, ED WOOD, SLEEPY HOLLOW all have the ""Hollywood"" feel about them, BEETLEJUICE is the perhaps Burton's most ""personal"" film. It all feels totally HIM.<br/><br/>BEETLEJUICE is an amalgamation of comedy, horror, ghost story, animation, AND its a family film...weird?! It tells the tale of New Englanders Adam and Barbara Maitland (played with refreshing, confident, sublime glee by film newbies Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis), who die at the film's outset in a bridge accident and spend the bulk of the film as ghosts haunting their home of its new inhabitants. They are the Deetzes: daffy Charles (wacky Jeffrey Jones), his annoying wife Delia (hilarious Catherine O'Hara), and weird, goth teen daughter Lydia (brilliant newcomer Winona Ryder).<br/><br/>The eclectic supporting cast also includes Glenn Shadix as Otho, and the iconic entertainers Dick Cavett and Robert Goulet and veteran actress Sylvia Sydney...Odd, strange, yet utterly brilliant casting! <br/><br/>But the casting coup is the actor who plays the title role...Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice! Well, it's really spelled ""Betelgeuse"", but Beetlejuice is funnier. This has got to be the most inviting role/performance that Keaton has ever given. He plays Beetlejuice so uninhibited, raw, and vulgar that you can't help but be fascinated by the character. I say that Beetlejuice is the best ""villain"" of all of Burton's films, even the Batmans, because Beetlejuice just plain does not care. He is totally self-serving and lets NOTHING stand in his way! Keaton's Beetlejuice probably has more memorable lines in this 1 film than you'll find in any 10 random films combined! And that's incredible given that he is barely on screen. I rank this as one of the all-time comic performances! <br/><br/>BEETLEJUICE is just plain enjoyable from start to finish. It's almost like watching a live action cartoon. Amazing how you are drawn into this comic book world so easily and take for granted the afterlife and its ""rules"". The background music adds to the eeriness. And there are some actual scary moments in it, esp. when Beetlejuice enters the picture. The cast chemistry is also indelible: Keaton, Davis, Baldwin, Ryder, O'Hara, Jones ALL do excellent work. At a run time of around only 90 minutes, BEETLEJUICE may be Burton's most entertaining work!"
"mrspasm","10","1","3","27 July 2009"," Ooh la la!
","Imagine Batman crossed with Johnny Depp and you'll probably start crying. Beetlejuice has nothing to do with either of those things. It is a film starring Winny Roader, Michael Clayton, Billy Baldwin, and Macauley Culkin's mum and of course Genie Davis. Genie and Billy have just moved into a scary looking haunted house in a small town. On the way to a shop their car is attacked by a dog and they drown. They die but as we all know when you die you become a ghost, or sometimes a zombie. It turns out though that there are rules, bureaucracy, and a whole new world (don't you dare close your eyes!) of the undead. They are given a massive rulebook for ghosts called 'The Unholy Bible' which tells them their powers and responsibilities. It turns out that they can stay together, but that they are trapped within the confines of the walls of their house. If they step outside they'll be eaten by a graboid. Where's Steve Irwin when you need him! Just as they are getting used to this a new family of yuppies decides to move in to the house and wreck everything. The ghosts begin to haunt, but they may need some help<br/><br/>Help comes in the form of Buster Keaton. He plays a malevolent demon called Beetleguy, but if you say his name 3 times he turns into a bee and flies into your mouth. He specialises in ridding houses of pesky humeans, and will go to extreme lengths to achieve his goals such as making their trousers fall down in public. Genie and Billy give him the job but they realise he is too evil and wants to hurt the people. They have become fond of Winowner who plays their odd goth/emo/punk.metalhead/hippy/weirdo/son/daughter, and who happens to be able to see the dead. Beetleguy wants to marry her and then do things to her so they all have to work together to stop him. <br/><br/>There is top class acting from everyone here, especially from Keats just one year before he dons the cape to become Clark Kent. He improvises many lines and shows his comedy stylings from his days as a comedian in such shows as Taxi and MASH. His most famous line is of course 'Go ahead make my day punk!' but is also known for coming up with the popular phrase 'I'm the ghost with some toast'. He has many monologues, talks into the camera and has a dolphin of a times, coming out with filthy gems like 'Let's turn on the juice and shake out our juice!' when he sees a strip club has been built in his town. His chemistry with Winoprah is like Hydrochloric acid mixed with sulphur, but not as smelly- Betelguy: (after Lydia says his name three times) Time to playee!<br/><br/>Overall this is a mostly enjoyable film, but perhaps too scary for the younglings. It was certainly too scary for me. Good costumes, graphics, and music, featuring the classic Harry From Delmonte songs 'Shake Manure Yeah' and 'Jump In The Lime' as well as a useful score from long time Tim Bunion fan Danny 'Elf' Man.<br/><br/>Best Scene: When Beetleguy is annoying all the other dead guys so the voodoo lady sprinkles his head with dust until it grows and grows to the size of 8 heads. This makes me laugh every time I see it- (once)"
"kyle-cruse","8","1","3","17 April 2009"," I couldn't help laughing!
","To say I couldn't help laughing is not to say that the film was so stupid it was funny. I mean that ""Beetlejuice"" was so funny that I couldn't help laughing at it, and that's not something I say all of the time. It starts off with a couple (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) crashing their car and getting back to their house and discovering they are dead and are now ghosts. What's worse, a new (and somewhat crazy) family is moving into their home, and they are so disgusted with the new owners that they decide to haunt the house and scare them off. The film gets extremely funny from there, as they are torn between scaring them off themselves or hiring a Bio-exorcist (Beetlejuice, Michael Keaton). It's hard to know what else to say, because there are so many funny parts to describe. For me, perhaps the funniest scene was watching the ghosts scare off the family by controlling their bodies into singing ""The Banana Boat Song"" around the table while guests are present at dinner. The film is silly and over-the-top at times, but it has become one of my favorite comedies from the last 20 years. It's much funnier than I expected any film of its type to be, and is probably my favorite of the horror-comedy genre. It may not be for everyone, but if you want to laugh, I suggest you check it out.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

","Tim Burton who is the master of Gothic film making and has one hell of an imagination. Beetlejuice a film example of this and a very quirky film.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice starts with a young couple the Maitlands (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who live in a large house in Connecticut. They unfortunately died in a car accident and end up trapped in their house for a 127 years. With their death their house was brought by Deetzs, a family from New York City. The wife Delia (Catherine O'Hara), starts to ruin everything that the Maitlands had set up. They want to get rid of the Deetzs from their house. They try to scare them away, but were very unsuccessful, so in their desperation call for the help from Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton). But at the same time the Maitlands start to befriend the Deetz's teenage daughter, Lydia (Winona Ryder), the only human who can see them.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is a horror comedy, not recommended for children. The style of the comedy is mostly physical and fish out of water situations; it fairly humorous. Michael Keaton was funny and creepy with some good speeches as the sinister Betelgeuse/Beetlejuice. Winona Ryder was good as always, and Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis were pretty decent in their roles. This is a very different film which Tim Burton repeats with Edward Scirrorhands. The special effects were done with heart and had a real imagination behind them; I can see the roots of Burton's animated films The Night Before Christmas and Corpse Bride.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Burton's work then you will enjoy this film."

"Electrified_Voltage","7","1","3","26 July 2007"," Good, but certain elements prevent it from being great
","I first saw this movie a couple years ago when it came on TV on Halloween. I had recently seen some reruns of ""Beetlejuice"", the cartoon series loosely based on this live action movie, after not seeing any of it in over a decade (since the early 1990s, when I was probably six or seven), but didn't really like it anymore. However, I WAS impressed with this movie when I first saw it. I even found it more enjoyable during later viewings, and liked it a lot! After not seeing it for a while, I just watched it again last night, but wasn't nearly as impressed with it as I was before.<br/><br/>Barbara and Adam Maitland are a married couple who live in a large house in a rural New England town. One day, on their way home, just as they are about to cross a bridge, they see a dog in front of them, and quickly try to stop. They don't run over the dog, but they do fall off the bridge in their car and crash into the river! They quickly arrive back home, thinking they survived the accident, but soon learn that they are dead, and if they try to leave the house, they will find themselves in a dangerous place! It gets worse when an annoying family moves in, and the Maitlands are stuck with them! The recently deceased couple attempt to scare this family out of the house, but cannot seem to succeed. Is giving in and using a fellow ghost named Beetlejuice the answer, despite warnings?! <br/><br/>Some say that this movie gets better with more than one viewing, and a while ago, after watching it several times, I could see what they meant. However, after my most recent viewing, I can't imagine ever enjoying it as much as I used to again. I still found some parts funny, but found that most of the funny parts involve Beetlejuice, and he certainly doesn't have the biggest part in the movie. Michael Keaton's performance (as Beetlejuice) is the only one that really stands out, the other performances are really nothing special. The movie is exciting in some parts, but also a bit dull in others. Fortunately, the good in this movie does outweigh the bad to some extent.<br/><br/>""Beetle Juice"" is a very imaginative motion picture, but that doesn't automatically make it a masterpiece. Tim Burton is a director with unique vision, and many strongly admire him, while some think he's a terrible filmmaker. Personally, I am a fan, but this is not one of my favourites of his. If you don't like Burton's films in general, I don't think this particular film would be any exception, so if you haven't already seen it, I don't suggest you ever do. On the other hand, if you are a fan of the director, and like movies that combine the comedy and horror genres, you would probably like ""Beetle Juice"". You could even like it better with more than one viewing, though this MIGHT not be permanent."

","Whoever heard of a ghost whose name sounds like a very nasty bug drink? It's ""Beetlejuice""! The Ghost with the most. Of what? Fun, surprises, and plenty of gags that will keep you rolling. Here you have a couple who have perished in a car crash, go back to the house they were living at is now being tenanted by the Deets. There are nice, but fashionably challenged. They have a daughter named Lydia(Winona Ryder), who happened to be a little bit rebellious. The real deal here is that specter who can evict the most obnoxious tenant ever. His name is Beetlejuice. He is one rude, crude, and effect ghost you could ever find. However, the dead couple finds him very revolting. When he kicks the model tree and crudely compliments it, he ""honks his horn"". They try to get rid of the Deets, but to no avail. They weren't scary enough. The only effective thing is when the played Harry Belafonte's ""Day-O"". It was totally hilarious. Especially when the prawns became hands. Beetlejuice turned up the heat when he took on the Deets. And when he says, ""It's Showtime!"", he really means it. Very funny, and lots of gags, this movie got it all. 4 out of 5 stars!"
"fred-houpt","9","1","3","15 March 2007"," Hilarious
","Oh man, this film is just too much fun. If you need to laugh to release some tension then films like this just seep into the funny bone and you're away. The premise (of the newly dead) is quite an interesting concept. If you look at films like ""Ghost"" or ""What dreams may come"" they both refer to the same issues. Think of ""The Sixth Sense"" and again you have a director grappling with dead people. ""Beetle Juice"" could have made this into a creepy-scary film but the feeling here is all in good fun, while lampooning the yuppy generation at the same time. This is satire written large and we never feel upset at any time. The big winner in this film is Keaton who in my view just steals every scene he's in with an over-the-top bravura performance of an exorcist from the dark side. I watched his first major film the other day ""Night Shift"" and in both films he easily inhabits a totally manic but hilarious energy. His comic timing is spot on and he can run on high voltage for extended lengths. Although he is also an excellent serious actor (see: Clean and Sober"") he is perhaps best known for his funny roles and nothing beats his performance here.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin, boy did he look young here (because he was) and about 50 pounds lighter. Geena Davis is her usual simple and hilarious self. Catherine O'Hara is incredible and all her years at Second City show through.

"ElmStreetsLastBrat","10","1","3","11 February 2007"," My favorite movie of all time!
","I'm serious, ""Beetlejuice"" from 1988 is my all-time favorite film. I was four when it was first released and I have loved it ever since. No film can top this one in my book. You're probably thinking that this film was a little too scary for a four year old but somehow it didn't' scare me. This film is a classic! I think it was perfectly cast. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis were perfect as the couple the Maitlands, although Alec Baldwin's sense of humor can be totally dry sometimes. Winona Ryder, Catherine O'Hara, and Jeffrey Jones were also perfect as the kooky new residents of the Maitland's beloved home. But I thought Michael Keaton was absolutely perfect as Beetlejuice. I can't think of any other person who could have played him as impeccably as Michael Keaton. His mannerisms were perfect and he was actually perfect for the makeup! If that makes any sense. The graphics and the cinematography were stunningly visual, considering the year this film was released. The storyline was unique and the script was perfect. And there was never a dull moment in this film. The humor was excellent! I loved all the jokes. And of course the character of Beetlejuice spat out the best of them! I never tire of this film. It is so good and I absolutely love it. It is my #1 favorite film and I'm glad I have it in my collection. Thank you for reading my review!"

","I'm not a big Tim Burton fan, especially after watching that disgrace ""the Nightmare Before Christmas"". But I have to say, this is his greatest film of all time. The film was funny, creepy, and clever. This movie gets an A. The only thing I thought that was wrong with this movie was that they needed more scenes with Beetle Juice. This film was quite entertaining from beginning to end. The best scenes were with Keaton's character, of course. Sure the effects may have been a little corny. But it was 1988, you shouldn't expect anymore than that. This, and the ""Corpse Bride"" and ""Edward Scissor Hands"", are the only Burton films I like. These films definitely wash out the nasty aftertaste left by ""Mars Attack""."

","What I want you to do is go watch it... Well thats what I was told when my friend pushed this film on me for the first time.<br/><br/>I have always been a huge movie fan and will pretty much watch anything that goes into my DVD player. But when my best friend showed me this great masterpiece Directed by Tim Burton, that was a new starting point in cinema for me. My favorite director is now Burton because of this and many more films. You can check out other Burton films out there like,(The Nightmare Before Christmas), or (Ed Wood) and many many more. <br/><br/>Beetle Juice has a wonderful act played by Michael Keaton, as Beetle Juice (Known for many Burton appearances), and I feel that the part played by a young Winona Ryder (Lydia), was a great Job as well. The main thing about this movie that I love, is how you can tell it is a Tim Burton film.<br/><br/>Now if your not so familiar with any other of Burton's films, you are definitely in for a real treat.<br/><br/>What I want you to do is go watch it, And be very prepared to be surprised in a strange yet very satisfying way :)"
"Coventry","9","1","3","14 July 2006"," Dead. And LOVING it!
","God knows many have tried, yet only ridiculously few filmmakers succeeded in bringing horror-comedies that are actually funny AND genuinely macabre at the same time! And yet, since the beginning of his career already, Tim Burton manages to pull this off seemly without the slightest bit of effort. ""Beetle Juice"" in particular is the most spirited horror-comedy I ever saw and possibly even one of the best comedies of the entire 80's decade! It's an incredibly energetic movie, and you gladly allow the characters and situations to go immensely over-the-top. I don't know how he does it or what his secret is, but in a Tim Burton movie, there are equal amounts of devotion going out to the comedy aspects and the make-up effects! By the rather gruesome make-up art, you certainly can't derive that ""Beetle Juice"" is also a light-headed comedy! The portrayal of the ""afterlife"" is pretty eerie and notably the séance-sequence is quite frightening. Despite originally intended to be much more horrific, ""Beetle Juice"" is definitely creepy at times. It often looks like an obscure comic book story that came to life! The happily married Maitlands  Alex Baldwin and Geena Davis - both pass away in a car accident but have to remain ghost-residents in their own house for another 125 years. This wouldn't be such a problem, if it weren't for the new owners, an eccentric New York family with the intention of giving the old-fashioned nest an avant-garde makeover. In order to scare them away, they might require the help of the too-much-too-handle bio exorcist Betelgeuse. This immediately turns out to be a bad idea, as Betelgeuse is an unscrupulous, boisterous and totally deranged lunatic. This crazy flick terrifically stood the test of time and still benefits from its great music and excellent acting performances. All the players are great, but obviously Michael Keaton will be remembered most for his sensational role as Betelgeuse. He swears, transforms into snake-like monsters, dances atop graves, visits miniature brothels and fires off some of the most comical one-liners in the history of cinema, including: ""Go ahead, make my Millennium"" and ""I'm the ghost with the most, babe"". Thanks to him, you worry a lot less about having to die one day"

","Wow, this is one of the best Tim Burton's movies.It's funny, it's cute, it's well-acted, it's charming... It's very entertaining and interesting. All the actors are really good, specially Michael Keaton and Catherine O'Hara. They're very funny. <br/><br/>Very common in Tim Burton, always trusting in the wonderful composer Danny Elfman, who also has composed for many Tim Burton films like ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"". This time, Elfman's music is as great as those other films. He shows us a dark, original but simultaneously funny and cool soundtrack.<br/><br/>The script in the film is very good and original. Some situations are really funny and some characters say things that makes you laugh a lot.<br/><br/>""Beetle Juice"" tells us the story of a recently deceased married couple, Adam and Barbara, who are locked up in their big house after they had the car accident,so they can't leave their house. Days later, a strange and crazy family (a suffered man, Charles, his crazy artist wife Delia and his daughter Lydia) moved to their house. But Adam and Barbara don't want them to live in their house, so they decided to call a bio-exorcist called Betelgeuse, who can help them to expel the family. But there is one problem: Betelgeuse is not like Adam and Barbara hoped.<br/><br/>The protagonists in this film are Michael Keaton as Betelgeuse, Geena Davies as Barbara, Alec Baldwin as Adam, Catherine O'Hara as Delia, Jeffrey Jones as Charles and Winona Ryder as Lydia.<br/><br/>One of thew best parts in the film are very very funny, like the scene when Delia, Charles and Lydia are having dinner in the house with some friends and they begin to dance. Wow, that scene was really funny and I enjoyed it. Another great part in the film was the ending, when Adam and Barbara make Lydia dance after they notice she pass his Maths exam. A really cool and funny scene.<br/><br/>Please, watch this film. It's really a typical Burton movie, you should see it. You will like and you will fall in love (with Betelgeuse?). You also will enjoy with the fantastic Betelgeuse character. But only one thing: don't say his name three times!"

","What can you say about this flick that hasn't already been said? Like any truly great film, it stands the test of time and still delivers the goods. I never get tired of the soundtrack, the wacky sets and props, the amped-up cheese factor...what fun! Why can't there be more horror/comedy flicks that measure up to the Burton Gold Standard? Even when he makes a flop, he does so spectacularly.(see batman returns). Simply put, Beetle Juice remains (no pun intended) one of the great comedy horror masterpieces. If you like this film genre, well, Beetle Juice is one of the greats. The careful balance of kooky/creepiness is well maintained, and Michael Keaton is just plain brilliant. This is one of the stellar comedic performances in movie history, and does not get the real credit it deserves. Like House, Freaks, Arachnophobia, 8-Legged Freaks, Sleepy Hollow -movies that never lose their sense of humor - Beetle Juice keeps you laughing, which is after all the whole point. Still hilarious and disgusting after all these years. Hats off to Tim Burton, the master of all things simultaneously creepy and cuddly. If you want seriously good clean gory icky cinematic jocularity, then get thee hence to a video store and rent/buy this movie! And enjoy a yummy Zagnut for your movie snack!"

","I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid. I hid behind the sofa and vowed never to watch it again, as it was too scary, too dark, too kooky, perhaps.<br/><br/>A couple of years went by and I got increasingly intrigued by this weirdo film I had seen. so, when the opportunity to see it again came up, I watched it... AND ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!! As I've got older, it has found itself a special place in my heart, and every time I dig my old copy out, it's like seeing an old, dear friend, and I stop whatever it is I'm doing, and stick it on.<br/><br/>I think Beetlejuice is amazing. The whole movie has a sense of fun, with great lines and a great way of looking at life (and death, of course).<br/><br/>The principal cast are all great; Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are fabulous as the straight-laced Maitlands, Catherine O'Hara and Jeffrey Jones are very funny as Delia, the neurotic, spoilt brat of a woman, and Charles, her hen-pecked husband. Winona Ryder puts in a great performance as the morbid little girl lost, Lydia and Glenn Shadix is a barrel of laughs as Otho.<br/><br/>But the show belongs to one man, Michael Keaton. He is a revelation! He is the funniest, coolest and the best thing about this movie.<br/><br/>Everything else about this movie is great; Tim Burton's Gothic style, the score by Danny Elfman, the other actors, they are all brilliant, but Michael Keaton is breath-taking. He is like 20,000 volts of electricity, saying ""sit up and take notice of ME!"" We're glad to, Michael, because, as the film's poster says ""Michael Keaton is BEETLEJUICE""! Just Excellent!"
"chrisgiant","10","1","3","3 April 2006"," Burton at his best!
","When Tim Burton chooses a film to direct, you know he'll put his own controversial twist on it! He's a very dark and eccentric person, so his persona rubs off on his films. Burton does best with films that contain very dark undertones, in this case death and the afterlife! Indeed he seems to excel at these themes for example The nightmare before Christmas and Corpse bride! Almost all his big directorial hits have revolved around macabre and Gothic styling!<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is one of the best examples of this and sees newlywed couple Barbara & Adam Maitland involved in a car accident (see what I mean)! They return home, soon after and realise that they were killed and are now ghosts doomed for eternity to haunt their New England home! All is well for a while as they live out their afterlives in peace, until the Deety family move in. A troubled family to say the least! The father is a down to Earth kind of guy, the step-mother an eccentric modern artist and the daughter a goth with a death wish! So in order to expel these newcomers from their house the Maitland's hire a freelance bio-exorcist (Polterguiest) by the name of Beetlejuice. Although it soon appears that Beetlejuice has his own devilish agenda! <br/><br/>Tim Burton's classic comedy/horror is dark and extremely funny stuff, with every character expertly cast especially Keaton in the title role!"

","And laughs it what you'll have in this comic masterpiece. My golf buddies and I quote this movie 10 to 1 over ""Caddyshack"" on a weekly basis. Michael Keaton outdoes himself and proves that his ""Night Shift"" performance wasn't a fluke. Some of his lines had to be improvisation because they're just too weird and wonderful. What can you say about Tim Burton that hasn't already been said? He still delivers the goods in 2005. He'll probably never receive and Oscar because the old cronies that vote probably just don't get him. Maybe in 30 or 35 years they'll give him a lifetime achievement award. All you do is watch his movies over and over again. The best movie award every year goes to a movie you might watch once or twice at most. (I'm rambling). Anyway, the rest of the cast is marvelous (Robert Goulet and Dick Cavett-how did they come up with those two). Winona Ryder tries to ""steal"" the show (get it) and Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play their parts spot on. Bravo to all !"

Michael Katina was the perfect choice for the role he filled. I also believe that the way someone dies influences there appearances in the afterlife suck as the woman who was cut in half was actually two halves in the movie was ingenious. It gives a whole new perspective on the afterlife and the different roles that one can choose from in afterlife such as bio-exorcist, civil servant, and adviser, were very interesting. I also like the way the characters actually had a personality that they stayed true too instead of doing things that were completely out of character for them. overall i think it is a very well done and fun movie."

","SPOILERS In 2005, Roald Dahl's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is due to be released in a new film starring Hollywood golden boy Johnny Depp. Depp has previously worked on many occasions with the films director, the brilliant Tim Burton. Burton over the years has released some truly classic films, but perhaps his finest work is one of his earliest pieces entitled ""Beetlejuice"". Hilarious from the start to finish, this early Burton feature does feel dated by modern standards but with a Harry Belafonte soundtrack and some outstanding performances, it's impossible not to finish watching this film with a smile on your face.<br/><br/>Happy in their perfect home, things go hideously wrong for Adam and Barbara (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) when they are in a fatal accident. Now residing in their house, the deceased pair can only watch as eccentric couple Charles and Delia (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) move in. Working with the new couples Gothic daughter Lydia (a young Winona Ryder) the couple also accidentally unleash the sadistic Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton) upon the world. Things may never be the same again.<br/><br/>Whether Baldwin, Jones or Keaton, you need never look far to see a quality performance. With a cast of recognisable faces, the film is pulled along by a cast who know how to deliver a line. Michael Keaton in particular is superb as the deranged title character. We never really learn to hate Beetlejuice, but simultaneously he doesn't grow on us. Psychotic and horny, the character is someone we love to see on the screen, but simultaneously we know it'd be a nightmare to have to spend any time with him.<br/><br/>The other surprising thing about ""Beetlejuice"" is it's long running tribute to the works of musician Harry Belafonte. Two scenes are based around his songs and for hours afterwards you do find yourself singing these songs. Whether this takes away from the film is questionable, but one is definitely true in that the appearance of the songs gave them a new lease of life and there are huge numbers of us out there who only associate Belafonte's work with this film. It is a good partnership though.<br/><br/>The beautiful thing about ""Beetlejuice"" is it's obscure and surreal plot. With so many random moments, including the irrelevant appearance of the Belafonte songs, it thrives on the fact you never know what is going to happen next. The plot is brilliant and with Tim Burton's direction, it remains hilarious throughout.<br/><br/>Directed years before his bigger hits, ""Beetlejuice"" is one of the, if not THE, finest films Tim Burton has ever directed. Hilarious throughout, the film succeeds due to some great acting, some excellent directing, a brilliant soundtrack and an increasingly obscure plot. It is great fun and deserves all the praise it can get."
"itamarscomix","9","1","3","24 May 2005"," Remains one of my favorites
","Re-watching Beetlejuice more than a decade after it thrilled, frightened and enthralled me as a child makes me sad about Mr. Tim Burton's transformation into a Hollywood favorite semi-quirky remake-director (Planet Of The Apes, Sleepy Hollow) in recent years (Big Fish indeed signals a hopeful recovery - if only Charlie And The Chocolate Factory doesn't spoil it...!) At the young age of thirty, and in only his second full length feature, Burton created a cult favorite that is one for the ages. In this bizarre, off-beat script by Michael McDowell (who collaborated with him before on an episode of the 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' television series) he found the ideal vehicle for his unique and strange imagination - and indeed, Burton's unique vision is more apparent here than in any of his movies, The Nightmare Before Christmas being the happy exception. Though it's true that it's not as personal a creation as 'Nightmare' or Edward Scissorhands, this is the movie that would place Burton on the map as a major director, and would earn him his breakthrough job - directing the first Batman feature film. It is on Beetlejuice that he would also start several long-time collaborations with actors who would work with him again in the future - Michael Keaton (Batman & Batman Returns), Winona Ryder (Edward Scissorhands), Jeffrey Jones (Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow), Glenn Shadix and Catherine O'Hara (both of whom did voice-overs for Nightmare Before Christmas). So, again, while Beetlejuice isn't as deep and personal film as we would see in Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood or Big Fish, Beetlejuice is an incredibly imaginative and captivating film and is a perfect black comedy. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin are both more than adequate, but Michael Keaton in the title part is of course the real star of the show - although in reality his part is much smaller than those of Davis and Baldwin. Keaton is electric and mesmerizing as the bio-exorcist or 'the Ghost with the Most', Beetlejuice (spelled BETELGEUSE!), probably the greatest and most memorable performance of his career (with the possible exception of the part of Batman). Keaton really let loose in Beetlejuice, and he and Burton were seemingly having a blast - they created one of the most memorable horror and comedy characters on the big screen. Seventeen year old Winona is also terrific as Goth-girl Lydia, fascinated and repulsed by Betelgeuse's extreme personality. Similarities between her character here and the one in Edward Scissorhands are easy to find, but for my money her performance as Lydia is the better one.<br/><br/>And in conclusion, if there's any movie that I'd recommend to own on VCR or DVD, it's Beetlejuice; because Burton at his best made films that are well rewarding in repeated viewing, and Beetlejuice is Burton at his very, very best, even if it's not his best film. So even if it's not an essential masterpiece like Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice is one of the classic cult films of all time, and I can't imagine going through life without it - that is, if you have the tiniest bit of a sense of fun and humor."
"scarecrowman","10","1","3","24 April 2003"," Creative and Humorous!
","This is one of Tim Burton's first feature films, and it is still among his best.  With Beetlejuice, we are introduced into the wonderful vision and story telling of a man who has now become the most original and entertaining film maker in Hollywood. Michael Keaton gives his finest comedic performance, while Alec Baldwin (A man with such a dry and boring personality that he seems dead.) gives an almost biographical performance.  Wynona Ryder is a stand out, excluding Keaton.  The film is both wacky and outrageous.  It rates a 10 on the entertainment level.

","Adam and Barbara Maitland (Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) are both killed in a car crash, but return as ghosts in their family home. After their deaths, their house gets sold and a new family move in; mum Delia (Catherine O'Hara) dad Charles (Jeffrey Jones) and daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder). The Maitlands do not like this family and object to some of their plans for the home and try to drive the family out of the home by employing scare tactics. When this fails, they decide to enlist the help of bio-exorcist Betelguese (Michael Keaton), but Betelgeuse proves to be out of control and the Maitlands soon begin to regret asking him for help...<br/><br/>Beetlejuice actually starts out as an OK film; the Maitlands are both likeable enough (if a tad icky) and the idea of them trying to scare the living away from their home in a farcical way certainly sounds funny; sort of like an amusing take on The Poltergeist or Amityville Horror. Regrettably though, for me this just didn't work. Like I say, Baldwin and Davis are likeable enough and do OK in their respective roles, but the script is poor and gives them no amusing lines and not a great deal to work with. This also extends to most of the family who move into the house; the likes of O'Hara and Jones are capable actors, but in Beetlejuice their contributions are barely memorable and add nothing to the film. Shaddix seems to just be playing Associate Bob from Demolition Man again. Winona Ryder's character is explored better than the other characters, but her quirky macabre weirdness should have been used better and I was disappointed that she wasn't given any good lines either.<br/><br/>So we've established that the script is rubbish and the story (such as it is) is rather thin, but Burton still has 2 things up his sleeve; the first is Michael Keaton and the second is the visuals. In this context, the former is certainly energetic and occasionally amusing, but he's only in the picture for about a fifth of the running time which would mean he would need to be a strong presence and side-splittingly funny to make up for the shortfall elsewhere in the film; the truth is that he isn't and I think the only scene involving Betelgeuse that I actually found slightly amusing was the scene where they were all inside the model. The visuals are indeed bright and colourful, but once again it feels like Burton's outlandish visuals are merely there to detract from all of the other lesser qualities of the film creating a style over substance feel (that being said the visuals now look somewhat tacky, but hey this film was made 30 years ago so again this perhaps should be taken in context as well).<br/><br/>It's sad really because I think Tim Burton was definitely the right man to direct this film and perhaps that's the reason this film has a cult following, but unless you purely watch films to look at the scenery then there is little point in wasting your time here."

","I am a massive fan of Beetlejuice, as not only is it a Tim Burton comedy, but it is extremely inventive and witty. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are a really cute couple throughout the whole film, and Michael Keaton is one of the most underratedly evil characters in any film. Full marks.<br/><br/>To those of you watching in America, don't let the PG rating fool you. It would be a definite PG-13 now, and despite it being comical, there are two moments I would pick out being the Exorcism of the Maitlands, and the viewing of the room of Lost Souls in the Twisting Corridor. Also bear in mind that Betelgeuse is really pervy. If you look at the parents guide it really isn't Family viewing! Really fun and comedic, 10/10."

","I know this is a pretty old film, but believe it or not, I had never seen it before. It's one of those that somehow managed to escape me. I've seen bits and pieces of it when it's been on TV, but this is the first time I've sat down and watched it all the way through. I'll admit to being a bit of a fan of Tim Burton's work over the years and so I was keen to have a look at this one.<br/><br/>Adam and Barbara Maitland Live in a beautiful country house that they have decorated themselves. When they die in an accident they return to the house as ghosts. To their horror, the house is bought by a couple from New York, Charles and Delia Deetz, who move in with Charles' daughter Lydia. Delia considers herself an artist and, with the help of her friend Otho, proceeds to re-model the house. The Maitland's are now really distressed, what with coming to terms with being dead as well, it's all proving a bit much. Lydia can see the ghosts and, after talking for a while, the Maitland's take a liking to her. Help is at hand in the guise of the crazy spirit known as Beetlejuice. But the Maitland's, at first try to scare the Deetz family away themselves. This all goes wrong when they are enthralled by their efforts and want more! Can Beetlejuice save the day? Guess you'll have to watch it to find out.<br/><br/>Although it looks quite dated by today's standards, this is unmistakably a Tim Burton film. A lot of stop-motion animation is used for the special effects which reminded me of the much later Corpse Bride from 2005. Decent performances from all of the main cast, Alec Baldwin as Adam Maitland, Geena Davis as Barbara Maitland, Catherine O'Hara as Delia Deetz, Jeffrey Jones as Charles Deetz, Winona Ryder as Lydia Deetz and Glenn Shadix as Otho. And, of course, a special mention for Michael Keaton who was great as the mad-cap Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>A pretty entertaining film with some nice touches. It looks a little dated now but it still works. It has the unmistakable mark of Tim Burton and will always be synonymous with Michael Keaton's portrayal of the over-the-top Beetlejuice. Over all, good stuff, if a little dated: Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 6.4/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","10","1","4","16 April 2010"," A landmark supernatural comedy as well as being a refreshingly flaky fantasy
","Beetle Juice may be strange and oddball at first, but like several films I have seen over the years, it could well grow on you. Essentially it is a landmark supernatural comedy as well as being a refreshingly flaky fantasy crammed with wit and invention, that I think is one of Tim Burton's better films along with Batman, Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands. It is also a marvellously imaginative view of the afterlife as a ghoulish extension of mundane earthbound problems. The visuals once again are absolutely wonderful, with dark cinematography, imaginative sets and zany special effects. The script are filled to the brim with one-liners that are funny and somewhat demonic, the score from Danny Elfman is fun and the direction is pretty much superb. And I loved how offbeat the performances were, with Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis suitably low key as the recently deceased couple who want to rid their new home of human pests. Speaking of those human pests, Catherine O' Hara proves herself fantastically pretentious as the artist whose creations come to life in one of the film's most memorable scenes, and Jeffrey Jones and Winona Ryder are also memorable but it is Michael Keaten as Bettelgeuse, the unstable freelance exorcist who steals the show who portrays the character as unique and completely and utterly insane. Overall, unique, imaginative and lots of fun. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
"rooee","6","1","5","12 April 2010"," Black pantomime
","After the sugary fun of Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Burton made this ingenious and witty horror comedy. Bristling with imagination, it brilliantly showcases the visual style that Burton would come to call his own with comic-Gothic productions like Batman, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman Returns.<br/><br/>Adam (Alex Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) play the recently deceased homeowners who are desperate to haunt yuppie couple Delia (Catherine O'Hara) and Charles (Jeffrey Jones) off their property. Adam and Barbara find a useful ally in depressive goth kid Lydia (Winona Ryder), before the titular 'Betelgeuse' (Michael Keaton) throws a spanner in the works.<br/><br/>It's a pity the film has been granted a 15 certificate in the UK, because there's plenty here for kids to enjoy. Adam and Barbara's complete acceptance of their predicament (namely being dead) is a conceit usually reserved for children's films, and their ensuing antics play out like a kind of ghoulish Home Alone. But then Keaton's vile, swearing, swaggering Beetlejuice steps into shot. It's a hilarious performance, perhaps one that Jim Carrey might have a go at these days; and yet I doubt Carrey would be able to create such a magnificently obnoxious hick.<br/><br/>The production design and make-up is fantastic. The purgatory-style waiting room scenes, with all their shark attack victims and shrunken heads, perfectly house Burton's love for pantomime black humour. Some of the 'bigger' special effects, particularly in the desert netherworld that awaits Adam and Barbara outside their front door, look dated. But hey, no amount of CGI will look this charming after 20 years."

","I remembered seeing this movie in a theater when it came out. I recall the good makeup and camera work, but didn't think the story was that good. So, I watched it again these many years later and had the same impressions.<br/><br/>The idea for ""Beetlejuice"" was quite novel for the time. And there can be little doubt about the superb job of makeup, animation and special effects. And while the idea for the plot had possibilities, the screenplay is very lame. It's a challenge to stay interested because it quickly becomes boring. So much so, that the one very good performance in the film â€“ that of Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice, can't salvage the film. The comedy is flat. What little of it I could find was dull. <br/><br/>My five stars are solely for the exceptional makeup and artwork that went into the production.

"Leofwine_draca","2","1","6","26 June 2016"," A stupid film
","Tim Burton's BEETLEJUICE is a film so over the top that it makes PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE look like a model of restraint. I'll freely admit that I hated this film from beginning to end because it's so stupidly portrayed, particularly on the part of the entire cast. Everyone in this film mugs or shouts their way through the over the top roles, and the result was that I was cringing from beginning to end. I have no choice but to blame Burton for not asking for greater restraint from the participants.<br/><br/>The surreal plot is pretty original and that's the best thing it has going for it, but the execution is rather diabolical. Things happen and exist for no seeming reason other than weirdness, like Beetlejuice living in the toy town or appearing on TV. I was trying to get my head around it all but I never ended up doing so. I was amused to read that Michael Keaton says this was his favourite role, as his character is so generic absolutely anybody could have played the part.<br/><br/>Sure, there are elements of interest here, including some cool stop motion effects and the usual quirky monster creations which prop up Burton films. But when the whole cast are so awful and the characters are so grating, it becomes a film impossible to enjoy. A wooden Alec Baldwin and an embarrassing Geena Davis (closer to EARTH GIRLS ARE EASY than THE FLY, unfortunately) are a case in point, although a youthful Winona Ryder is out of her depth as well."
"renegadeviking-271-528568","8","0","1","17 May 2020"," Beetlejuice review
","On March 30, 1988, Warner Bros. unveiled Tim Burton and Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice in theaters. The cult hit film later claimed an Oscar win for makeup at the 61st Academy Awards. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below:<br/><br/>There's inspired lunacy to be found in the Geffen Company's Beetlejuice, a stylized comic fantasy about a freelance ""bio-exorcist"" hired by ghosts to evict a family who moves into their home. Box office will depend largely on how Warner Bros. markets this thoroughly original visual bonanza, which is sure to baffle moviegoers who favor films with a conventional narrative.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis star as Adam and Barbara Maitland, a happily married young couple living an idyllic life in the postcard-perfect New England town of Winter River, Connecticut. Like Cary Grant and Constance Bennett in Topper, their life together on earth is cut short by an accident. It is with some reluctance they finally accept the fact they are stone-cold dead.<br/><br/>As if being ghosts weren't bad enough, Adam and Barbara discover their real estate agent has sold their house to the mundo bizarro Deetz family. Dad (Jeffrey Jones, effectively understated) is a nerve-wracked New York businessman who hungers for peace and quiet; wife Delia (Catherine O'Hara) is a quasi-artist who professes to be truly happy only when she's sculpting. While their death-obsessed daughter (Winona Ryder of Square Dance) slinks about in varying shades of black, Delia and her pompous SoHo interior designer, Otho (Glenn Ryder), raize the Maitlands' beloved property, redecorating it in the garish style of a junk culture museum.<br/><br/>Guided by a a Handbook for the Recently Deceased, the Maitlands pay a visit to their other-worldly case worker, Juno (Sylvia Sidney), who informs them they're stuck with these urban misfits for 125 years unless they can scare them into vacating the premises. But Adam and Barbara are flops at inducing heebie-jeebies; it's going to take an expert in the field of spirit housecleaning to send the Deetzes packing.<br/><br/>Enter Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton, under mountains of special makeup), named after a star in the constellation of Orion, a grandstanding do-badder who shamelessly promotes himself as ""the afterlife's leading bio-exorcist."" While he's sleazy looking and has all the finesse of a supernatural snake oil salesman, there's no question that he's got a bag of tricks that would send shivers up Rod Serling's spine.<br/><br/>What happens next is as eye-popping as it is impossible to describe. And that's what makes Beetlejuice such a delight; it's an experience, rather than another helping of the same old thing. There isn't much to it, storywise (Michael McDowell and Larry Wilson conceived the idea), but it brilliantly creates a sense of wonder missing from so many current Hollywood films. Driven by director Tim Burton (Pee Wee's Big Adventure) and his fanciful imagination, the film is colorful, delightfully deranged and endlessly inventive - a grand-scale funhouse that can be enjoyed by children of all ages.<br/><br/>Technical credits are superior, a virtual who's-who of the filmmaking community. Ted Rae, Doug Beswick, Peter Kuran and Robert Short all make valuable contributions in the area of special effects and work by Thomas Ackerman (camera), Bo Welch (production design) and Danny Elfman (music) is similarly inspired. Burton's cast (Dick Cavett's weak cameo excepted) is excellent, too, with the nuthouse Keaton not-so-surprisingly stealing the show in his field-day performance as the rootin'-tootin Beetlejuice. Finally, a pop-culture antihero even Joe Dante can love"

","""Beetlejuice"" is famous as the film that launched Michael Keaton from comedy actor to Batman and superstardom.<br/><br/>It's just as well, as this horror-comedy hasn't aged well. It's not particularly scary, nor is it that funny, despite Keaton's brilliance and Burton's fantastic visuals. Compare that to another eighties horror-comedy classic ""Gremlins"", which had moments of genuine terror amongst the laughs.<br/><br/>Keaton plays Beetlejuice as a mischievous bio-exorcist, with a few mild menacing moments. He's supposedly hired by the newly departed couple Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis) to get rid of a snooty new family from their pre-death house. Beetlejuice is an anti-hero: you're never quite sure if he's a good guy or just looking out for himself and wanting to cause mayhem.<br/><br/>Other highlights include Burton's fantastic array of undead beings and other monsters (the claymation technology has held up well for a late-eighties movie), showing off his love of the macabre and gruesome that would become a theme of his work, and a teenage Winona Ryder in one of her earlier roles.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, the film never really goes anywhere, Beetlejuice is only in it for the second half, and the ending feels rushed.<br/><br/>Still, it's really a vehicle for Keaton, Burton, and Ryder, so the plot doesn't really matter.

","Despite there being some potential in the idea behind this movie, the end product is grotesque and unpleasant, and fails in most of its' attempts at humor. To get the positives out of the way, Winona Ryder does succeed in her portrayal of the quintessential emo-teenager. Catherine O'Hara also does pretty well with her character, but this is where the positives end. The overall aesthetic is unique, but often not in a good way, and usually ends up being an eyesore. The humor is largely sadistic in a very cringey sort of way, leading to a rather uncomfortable viewing experience. As a whole, it seems to cross over from ""artistic vision"" into ""self-indulgence"" territory.<br/><br/>And the cherry on top of this mess is Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice: an utterly loathsome and repulsive creation who drags every scene he's in into pervert territory. He's loud, obnoxious, uncouth, crass, and nauseatingly vulgar, and the overall weakness of the vast majority of the main cast, especially the main couple, means no one is able to counterbalance his vile persona. This is the ultimate failing of Beetlejuice: The namesake, and center of everything, is impossible to view with anything other than absolute revulsion. Not amusement, not enjoyment, not intimidation, just utter, abject loathing. Maybe this was the ultimate intent, but considering he doesn't even illicit a giggle, I'd say the whole thing is a pretty major failure, in my book."

","A clever opening of a haunted house story. Tim Burton paints a daunting surreal picture. That being said, the house in this honeymoon/vacation get away is reflective of Alfred Hitchcock's, Psycho. Though Barbara played by (Geena Davis) tries to defend their house against interlopers, she and her charming husband never really know what to do. The film jumps around a lot too, but I won't delve into that. After a while, it finally sinks into the mud of our emotions. The whole film is about scaring people, I get that, but do we really need to laugh at others mistakes. This is not funny! I anticipate Burton films to be somewhat like this, taking someone like Edward Scissorhands and, making that a symbol of how, we in society are to laugh at someone's misfortune. No ... not buying into it. At least, this is the main premise to Beetlejuice. A film about a freakshow. Enough of the bad stuff though. (timeout!!) I will say the best part of this film for me was the set and design. It's fun to watch these people crack up; and, if this was Burton's idea, it's genius. The table scene is an absolute delight to see on screen, and it's scenes like these that can absolutely change a bad film to something meaningful to your day. Even if you go into this film depressed you are bound to laugh at some point. Once the funny emotions come out it's the point of no return, it's on. What I like, too, about this film is that there's an operatic tone, but sadly Burton doesn't do anything with it. It would have been good to see something like this flipped into a musical.

In the afterlife, they continue to occupy the place, but, of course, the house is sold, and another couple moves in. This is disheartening as they now realize they are actually dead. We have a lot of potential here. They decide to drive the new owners out of the house, but they don't know what they can do, so they enlist an evil spirit, played by Michael Keaton, to do their dirty work. The problem is that he is totally uncontrollable and soon they are paying a bigger price than the new occupants.

Beetlejuice has Burton's prints all over it on its own, but with Keaton's performance, it's classic Burton. With that said, I don't know that the film survives if you aren't keen on the overbearing style of Burton. I like his movies as much as the next guy (Big Fish is in my top 5 favorite films of all time), but besides Keaton, there isn't a whole lot to ride home about here.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice has had fans clamoring for a sequel for decades, and I'm not going to be the one to shut those hopes down. With the talented cast, especially where they all are in their careers now, a sequel could be interesting. But I never found Geena Davis or Alec Baldwin's characters to be all that interesting. As they weave their way through the weirdness of the world of death, the film just veers more into a meandering area.<br/><br/>With all the dated elements to Burton's execution, the real gems of this film come from his unique vision.

","When a pale faced, mop-haired creature from beyond comes along to teach some recent dead about how to deal with the living while still roaming the planet as ghosts, trouble is about to brew. In the hands of novice director Tim Burton, one of the great comedy masterpieces came along to inspire others, yet has never been surpassed. Rising stars Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis portray the happily wed couple, having just moved into their new suburban home, yet killed in a freak accident. They are warned by their adviser Sylvia Sidney (think welfare worker for the dead) to totally ignore ""Beetlejuice"" and certainly never say his name three times, much like human beings were warned not to feed gremlin Gizmo after midnight.<br/><br/>Why are the unusually quiet Baldwin and Davis so desperate to scare the new residents (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara, along with Gothic daughter Winona Ryder) out of their house? That's because they are ghosts, and that is what ghosts do. The veteran 30's leading lady Sidney, smoking with the exhaust coming out of an obvious slit throat (which made me think that this was her aunt scared to death by the raven in ""Damien: The Omen II""), delivers her lines with that raspy crankiness of an aging New York Executive Secretary and is hysterically funny. Michael Keaton too takes on this role with a great challenge, devouring it like the zag-nut bar he offered to the title character's desired fly lunch.<br/><br/>As the WASPY artist family who has taken over the home, Jones and O'Hara are the perfect befuddled couple who obviously can't stand each other, with Ryder perfectly droll as Jones' daughter from an earlier marriage. The comic gags come fast and furious, first with O'Hara suddenly breaking into ""Day-O"" as the ghosts of Baldwin and Davis take over her and the guests, then when ""Beetlejuice"" shows them how to do it at a second dinner party where the frights are heightened.<br/><br/>The potential genius for Tim Burton had already been seen in the sleeper hit ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" and has continued on to this day. This is a director who obviously will one day be in the ranks of Hitchcock, Fellini, Vincent Minnelli and John Ford (among others) where just the mention of their name brings up visuals of great art within the world cinema. The only thing I can say about this movie is that unlike other Tim Burton movies, it hasn't aged as well, and often seems like a surrealistic experience which at times just became a bit perplexing to get through."

","Death is a strange thing in cinema because every filmmaker decides their own way of presenting the afterlife. In ""Beetlejuice"", Tim Burton has young married couple Adam and Barbara Maitland killed in a car accident in the first ten minutes of that film. Before they died, they moved into a large country house with the intention of fixing it up a bit. Now that they have died and are ghosts, an annoyed new family named the Deetzs' have moved into their house and the Maitlands want them out. They learn about a ""bio-exorcist"" who they want to hire to scare the people away. This just creates problems however. The story continues and they become friends with Deetzs' daughter Lydia who has more in common with the ghosts than her own family. Unfortunately, the movie isn't as worthwhile as it may sound because the majority of the characters just aren't interesting enough to hold the movie together. Also, with the incantations and all the references to the supernatural, it isn't even close to my Christian values. However, it is a silly movie, all done tongue-in-cheek and shouldn't be taken seriously. Still, there isn't much of a reason to see it other than Michael Keaton's insane performance as Betelgeuse which is quite fun to watch although he wasn't in it as much as I would have liked. And as always, Tim Burton's crazy visuals and ideas are always original."

","I thought this film was a blast when I first saw it some twenty plus years ago. It didn't quite reach that same level as I watched it again tonight, but it didn't miss the mark by all that much. For me, it's Michael Keaton's interpretation of the title character that makes the picture. As the free lance bio-exorcist straight from (can I say it?) hell, he brings a manic quality to the character that just cracks me up even today. To this date, whenever I hear someone say 'It's showtime', it's Keaton's showtime I'm reminded of.<br/><br/>Some will say this is a macabre story, but it's got a strange balance of wit and humor. My favorite scene is the Da-yo sequence, seemingly coming out of nowhere with no connection to the events of the story, but it captures just the right tone to make the film enjoyable. Other little quirks like the 'Handbook for the Recently Deceased' and the 'Lost Souls Room' are curiously amusing as well. Probably the best gag in the picture was that cool tribute to Vincent Price's 1959 flick ""The Fly"", in that scene with the Zagnut Bar and the fly crying 'Help me, help me'. You just have to see that earlier picture to get it.<br/><br/>With Alec Baldwin's recent conflicted real life history, I can't say that I'm any kind of fan of his, but he does a fair enough job here. Geena Davis is always pleasing to see, and I recall this early film appearance of Winona Ryder with some fondness. The coolest casting surprise in the movie was Sylvia Sidney as the after-life spiritual guide. Hey, she worked with some of the best in her career - Bogart, Cagney, Raft and Hitchcock - and you can't get any better than that.<br/><br/>If you're an old time movie or TV fan, you've probably seen an episode or two of 'Topper'. Well ""Beetlejuice"" is like 'Topper' on steroids, but without the St. Bernard. You know, that would have been a good idea, so if anyone's thinking of a remake, that would be a good starting point."

","Beetlejuice (1988) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>A newly deceased couple (Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis) are horrified to learn that a new family is about to move into their former home so they decide to scare them away. When that doesn't work the dead couple must call on a ""bio-exorcist"" (Michael Keaton) who has a few different tricks to play. BEETLEJUICE is a film loved by many but I'm not one of them. I remember going to see this film when it first came out and I remember being pretty disappointed in it. I finally decided to revisit the movie to see if it's grown on me any and it hasn't sadly. There's still plenty of stuff that I really enjoy here but in the end the film was just too cold for me. Among the stuff I do enjoy is the vision of Burton who really does a very good job at giving us a rather beautiful, deranged and surreal picture. I really loved the sets, the weird characters and of course the visions of what it's like to be dead. I'm really not sure if there was another director out there who could have done a better job because of purely a visual this film is a treat. Another major plus is the all-star cast even those who aren't given too much to do. I thought both Baldwin and Davis were very good early on as the happy-go-lucky couple but once they're dead I found the screenplay didn't use either of them all that well. Winona Ryder nearly steals the film as the strange teenager who isn't afraid of the ghost and instead turns out to be their friend. I really loved the Gothic style she brings to the role and I thought she was perfect at playing that laid back character. Catherine O'Hara. Jeffrey Jones, Dick Cavett and Sylvia Sidney are all good in their parts as well. Then, of course, there's Keaton who delivers a wonderful performance as the title character. The fast, maniac style that Keaton brings to the role is quite unforgettable and he really does a terrific job at coming off just like an animated cartoon character. I think Keaton really deserves a lot of credit because not too many actors could have played a part like this and it's doubtful many would have had the personality to shine through all the make-up and special effects. With all of that said you'd think I would be more warm to the film but I can't be. I think after a cute opening and set-up the only thing we get are gimmicks. There's not really much of a story. There's not really much to any of the characters. I'd also say that there aren't nearly enough funny moments. The entire film just strikes me as all style and very little substance."

","Tim Burton's 'Beetle Juice' is so much fun. About ten years ago, I had caught the last half hours of it on television. I didn't know the name of what looked like it was a funny movie. Later I learned that the title of the film was 'Beetle Juice'. I watched the movie last night and it had me laughing all the way. I was rooting for the two ghosts, Adam and Barb, to find some peace and for the Deetzes to...well, what can one wish for such a crazy family. In his later movies, Burton has already shown his strengtht in movies with a dark, wacky and Gothic tone while the story is easy to relate to and entertaining. Compared to his other works, 'Beetle Juice' is more comical in nature. The characters are quirky and likable. The art direction and special effects are simplistic but that works excellently. Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Winona Ryder, Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara are terrific. Michael Keaton is hardly recognizable as he does an effortless job in pulling off the title role.<br/><br/>'Beetle Juice' is an 80's classic. In several ways it's a tribute to horror classics (as is apparent through the references) such as 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'The Exorcist', to name a few. But one shouldn't be scared to show this to kids. Why would one deprave anyone from such energy, imagination and fun?"

","I've been spending some time with Burton. I like him, i feel strangely attracted to what he purposes, though i can't help recognizing the highly recognizable flaws.<br/><br/>In summary: he creates worlds, sometimes he is thrilling on that alone, others not so much. But everyone of his films is a true vision of its creator, and that's something i value a lot. But he is not a good director. Planely as a director, he can't be more than just competent, because he doesn't work on the specific issues of direction (editing, camera-work, actor-direction...) with the same passion and special angle as he does with molding the world he gives us.<br/><br/>So look at this. He was still a relatively young director (this was, i believe, his second long form). He didn't craft the world of this film as exquisitely as he did with later works. And the film is a relative failure to me because, once that rich notion of being side a quirky mind is gone, the rest doesn't hold.<br/><br/>Oh, one thing that saves it: Michael Keaton's performance. I've never seen him act like he did here. He holds this as his best performance ever and i support it. It's a great physical and verbal acting, that engages the audience as well as the characters of the film, so the plot develops around the idea of one trying (and failing) to resist paying attention to him. Great.<br/><br/>The animations are tender in some points, it has the flavor of old animations, that look artificial, but which we are willing to believe. I recently watched a crap film, Monster X, made by someone who should take some lessons here about honesty on film making.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","Beetlejuice (1988, Dir. Tim Burton) <br/><br/>Story <br/><br/>Beetlejuice is basically the story of a dead couple who requires the help of Beetlejuice. He's a bio-exorcist who helps with ridding the house of the new family who has recently moved in. Beetlejuice isn't the friendliest of bio-exorcist. Say his name three times, and he would be out to help you, but he won't take going back in an easy job. Tim Burton eerie atmosphere adds to an instant hit.<br/><br/>Actors <br/><br/>Before I get onto Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice, I want to start with the other actors. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis really do make a wonderful couple. The names Adam and Barbara for them were very simple but still made them fell as a nice American couple. They really work well together and you can feel the love between the two characters. The family which move in are completely different to Adam and Barbara. Each character is completely different and you can really sense much tension has happened between them off screen. The Dad is a bird spotter, the step-mother is a sculptor lover, who is quite obnoxious sometimes, and their daughter is a very dark character. There's also Otho, which you can see as having more of a relationship with the mother than the actual husband does. Finally, there's Beetlejuice. This is a character which you would have never seen before. Michael Keaton really brings life to him like no one else could have done. The make up on him is remarkable and he really does feel out of this world. The character is that distinctive that you will still get sudden memories of him long after you have watched this film.<br/><br/>Music <br/><br/>One of the many highlights of Tim Burtons' movies is Danny Elfman. Although you may see similarities from the soundtracks of Batman and Mars Attacks, the soundtrack of Beetlejuice still feels so new and original. It's so different to other soundtracks, and has it familiar Elfman spot. You can tell it's his work easily. It really fits in with the world of Tim Burton. There are some really good spots and some really strange tunes. There's a theme tune which is one of the best of Elfman's work which has been re-used in many trailers for other films.<br/><br/>Special Effects <br/><br/>The thing about the special effects in Beetlejuice is that it uses very old effects and not the blue scene techniques used at that time. The effects vary in believable. There are some amazing effects such as the floating daughter or the headless body running to lock the door. There are also some effects which are stop-motion are sometime look shoddy, but these doesn't take away from the experience. It's all part of the typical Tim Burton experience. Again, Beetlejuice comes with his own effects and not just amazing but also entertaining and humorous. One minute he might be engulfed in spikes and the next would have turned into a snake. All the effects are such fun to watch and doesn't put off from the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Conclusion <br/><br/>When you start watching a Tim Burton movie, you know what you're going to find. It's going to be a dark and sinister viewing experience. The story will be fun, the soundtrack amazing and appearance from some familiar faces. It's going to be a film you will surely not forget easily. Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice. Beetlejuice.<br/><br/>""Nice F***ing Tree!"" Â– Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton)"

","In 1988, prior to the inordinate success of ""Batman"" (1989) which would line his pockets, Tim Burton bequeathed this work which is from his own words: ""a comical version of ""the Exorcist"" told from two dead people's point of view"". I have never been a fan of William Friedkin's masquerade marred by extravagant, ludicrous special effects.<br/><br/>There are also special effects in ""Beetle Juice"" and they constituted the main attraction for many viewers when the film was released. But unlike Friedkin's enticing work they're much better tapped to serve as complements for the needs of the story but also to depict the beyond after death for Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin. On this point, one recognizes with pleasure Burton's trademark. The filmmaker had visibly pleasure to recreate a quirky vision of hell enhanced by extravagant scenery with rather loud colors and populated with funny monsters. This hellish universe has the look of a public services office.<br/><br/>Another positive thing about ""Beetle Juice"" is that it never really falls into the excessive or the very grim and genteel humor is also an asset for the film. The story has genuine looks in its beginning but takes a derivative direction as the film advances and certain characters verge on the space of cardboard characters. But the actors seemed to be well aware of this problem and perhaps that's why they offer subdued, enjoyable performances. But the prize for the best actor arguably goes to Michael Keaton as the grouchy, dangerous Beetle Juice, absolutely unrecognizable under his make-up.<br/><br/>""Beetle Juice"" hasn't got really its place among Burton's seminal works like ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), ""Ed Wood"" (1994) or ""Big Fish"" (2003) but if the filmmaker's set of themes and stylish job is your cup of tea, why not give it a chance?"

I love Alex Baldwin in this movie. He's kind and dorky, but in a cute way. And then there's Lydia, who could be the cynical Goth adolescent we all know, and secretly wish we could be as cool as. There is the high strung mother, whose fashion taste makes you recoil in disgust. Otho is deliciously slimy, who we wish would get the same treatment as John Goodman in ""The Borrowers.""<br/><br/>Only several things bothered me in the movie. When the couple is digging up Betelguese, you see ""Fragile"" on a piece of cardboard. If they're in miniature, why would it be that tiny?

On the other hand, if that were to happen, he would probably have to stay in the house, which would be horrible for everyone, including the audience.<br/><br/>All in all, its a darkly funny comedy, which i would recommend for those above eight, as several scenes, one including a ""horny"" Betelguese dancing towards a whorehouse, although you don't see anything inappropriate other than scantily clad women giggling on the roof. Another is the waiting room, showing rather graphic death results.

","Tim Burton understands the horror/goth genre, unfortunately his only addition has been the mediocre Sleepy Hollow.  Beetlejuice understands the basis for our fears, but never gets far with the idea.  The concept is not as well developed or exploited as it could have been.<br/><br/>The real star is not Michael Keaton or anyone else in the cast, it's Burton's use of traditional (stop-motion) effects, makeup, and set design. He is trying to be weird, but winds up being normal.  Without any sort of depth, the mood is humorous instead of deep.  Playing everything for gags in the afterlife more resembles Back to the Future Part II than anything else.<br/><br/>With weak performances, this movie can't help but suffer under its own ambition much like the rest of Burton's work.  He always starts strong, then fails at the end except with Planet of the Apes where he failed at the outset.<br/><br/>Overall, not as good as it could have been.

A manic poltergeist (Keaton) offers to help the spirits rid their beloved house of these newcomers since they can't scare them themselves. A bad situation quickly turns worse through a series of incidents blending horror and fantasy with comedy. The special effects are impressive and come at a nearly nonstop pace. Keaton is the real star here portraying the title role with some of the best comic moments of 1980's films."
"Big Movie Fan","Null","0","1","26 October 2002"," Tim Burton's Best Piece Of Work
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is Tim Burton's finest piece of work. This is a film that can be enjoyed time and time again. The cast are great and the gags are great too. And who can forget Michael Keaton as Beetlejuice? Michael is a great actor equally adept at playing serious or comedy roles. I believe this is one of his best roles.<br/><br/>Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis play Adam and Barbara, a couple who die in an accident but return to their home as ghosts. However, a bunch of people move into their house and lets just say they're not the type of people I'd want to live with. Soon, Adam and Barbara end up recruiting Beetlejuice to get rid of the owners. But soon after, Adam and Barbara realise that Beetlejuice is more trouble than he's worth and that's when the fun starts.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away about the humour in this film but it was hilarious. Michael Keaton always seems to enjoy himself in his movies and he was enjoying himself here. Beetlejuice is the funniest looking creature I've ever seen in a film. Adam Baldwin and Geena Davis do a brilliant job as do the beautiful Winona Ryder and Catherine O' Hara along with Glen Shadix.<br/><br/>Beetlejuice is one of the best comedy films of the 80's and the final scene is just priceless. Check it out."

","Beetlejuice... beetlejuice... BEETLEJUICE! A film I really enjoyed, it was just plain fun.. love the score done by Danny Elfman, who generally produces top notch scores.. the features are kind of dissapointing, but the movie more than makes up for it.. Micheal Keatan is great in it, now why he didn't do more character driven pieces like this? And he did Batman, and did it well! What's happened to him since then? Do we see him as a big star, or hell, I'd take a cult star? No, we see crap like Multiplicity.. WTF? Grrr.. Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin do their parts sufficiently.. don't really s ee much of Alec anywhere.. but Geena is keeping up appearances at least with her role in Stuart Little 1 and 2.. her best role would have to be Thelma & Louis, however.. then Winona Rider, who is one of my weird/strange likes.. who was in one of my favorate films; Girl, Interrupted - which was like representative of my experiences at SEPS (Seperations from the Navy), in fact, some of it was spookingly similiar.. and I had seen it barely months after that whole mess.. Anyway, back to Beetlejuice.. Tim Burtan is a frickin cool director.. Love many of his films, including Edward Scissorhands, and Nightmare before Christmas (he didn't direct, but his influence is clear).. I even watched the Beetlejuice animated series awhile.. which was ok, mildly entertaining.. but could in no way touch the film.<br/><br/>The special effects are appropriately off the wall, the humour is constantly flowing here and there, and Burtan's style literally leaks off the walls.. like a dream, where even in the after life, the problems never seem to go away, they just get more interesting..."

","I loved this movie from the first time I saw it when I was about 6 or 7, but 10 years later I'm fully able to appreciate the subtle adult humor.  This is probably my favorite ""scary"" movie.  The plot is great and the actors really bring the characters to life, (or afterlife in most cases.)  The waiting room scenes are great, but my two most favorite sequences are the snake railing and the end where Beetlejuice lets loose.  I hope for a sequel, and yet I hope they never make a sequel at the same time, because it just wouldn't do it justice.  The cartoon didn't even do the movie justice, what happened to Adam and Barbara?  And why did Lydia become such good friends with Beetlejuice?  The special effects in this movie are excellent, especially for the time the movie was made.  Too bad filmmakers today don't rely more on their own creations rather than computers."

Yes, I could've just said that I liked it, or I could've refrained from commenting on it, but I must speak my mind.<br/><br/>I didn't think that this movie was that funny. I couldn't even tell what I was SUPPOSED to laugh at. It was very bizarre, but a bad kind of bizarre. The acting was good by all the characters, but sometimes I didn't get why a particular character did something.<br/><br/>Well, just because it didn't appeal to me, doesn't mean that it won't appeal to you. Judging by the other comments and the critics, I'd say that you will probably like this movie. But if you don't, help me out here, will ya?

At once, you realize that while Elfman promises a light-hearted fare, the sincere wish of going home and not being able to will underscore the movie.<br/><br/>When Adam and ""Babs"" complain to Juno they wouldn't mind sharing their home with people different than the Deitz's, Juno finishes their thought by saying knowingly, ""With people more like YOU used to be.""<br/><br/>So what is Beetlejuice about? It's really all about what makes a home. When you lose control of your home, is it still your home? As the old man once said, ""Home is what you make it.""<br/><br/>That said, while Betelgeuse comments that every time he sees ""The Exorcist"", he finds it funnier every single time he sees it, everytime *I* see ""Beetlejuice"", I like it more and more, and I see new things every time as well.

","It's funny how some films work out. In a parallel universe, Beetlejuice could have starred Sammy Davis Jr and been called House Ghosts.<br/><br/>                     However, the eventual Tim Burton classic became a star vehicle for Michael Keaton, launched Winona Ryder onto an unsuspecting world and made the tousle-haired director a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood.<br/><br/>                     The 1988 horror comedy concerns a bland young couple (played by Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis) who die in a freak accident and have to suffer a pretentious family who move into their dream house while they are doomed to spend an eternity in the afterlife.<br/><br/>                     Unlike your classic cherubs and pearly gates vision of heaven, Burton's view of the afterlife is more like a garish dole office/airport waiting room. Tim was attracted to the project after spending a few years wondering what to do next. His hilarious Pee Wee's Big Adventure had mixed reviews and he was being offered all manner of formulaic flicks. Then media mogul David Geffen (one of the brains behind behind Dreamworks) suggested he take a look at this spooky tale and the director was hooked from page one. <br/><br/>                     ""It had no real story, it didn't make any sense, it was just a stream of consciousness,"" he remarked in one interview.<br/><br/>                     The flick was written by Michael McDowell and polished up by Warren Skaaren. However, much of the genius behind the dialogue comes from Keaton as the eponymous bio-exorcist.<br/><br/>                     Burton and his leading man spent many days developing the character from scratch, with Keaton trying different teeth and voices to get the feel of the 'Ghost with the most.'<br/><br/>                     It was not all plain sailing however. Burton grew tired of the studio questioning every little detail about his movie.<br/><br/>                     ""I remember having script meetings that lasted for like 24 hours over the course of two days, and by the end of it we were questioning every element of the script, which for me, is not necessarily that productive.""<br/><br/>                     The studio had run all manner of marketing tests with the title Beetlejuice and it scored very low compared to House Ghosts which made a lot of people sit up and take notice.<br/><br/>                     Tim was naturally incensed by such tampering with his baby. ""As a joke I said why don't we call it Scared Sheetless? and they actually considered it until I said I'd jump out of the window.""<br/><br/>                     The movie - title intact - was made for a measly $13million, with a mere $1million given over to special effects. On a movie of this size which is so effects driven, it's amazing that Burton managed to make the flick come alive. However, there's a wonderful cheesiness to the visual gags that make the whole thing work far better than the multi million dollar effects shot on that year's other big movie, Willow.<br/><br/>
                     The horror comedy eventually grossed (no pun intended) more than $73million and picked up an Oscar for the make-up crew.<br/><br/>                     As with most hit movies, it spawned a cartoon series, influenced the look of many an advert around the time and at one point, there looked like being a sequel - Beetlejuice in Love.<br/><br/>                     Alas, that was put on a backburner. Burton soon had his hands full directing the first two Batman movies, Edward Scissorhands, Mars Attacks! and one of this year's best films, Sleepy Hollow.<br/><br/>                     So what about next year? Any chance of another helping of spooky shenanigans?<br/><br/>                     Afraid not. Tim is now hard at work on The Visitor, a big budget remake of Planet of the Apes with Mark Wahlberg and Fight Club's Helena Bonham Carter."

"revival05","Null","0","1","10 July 2000"," Tim Burton's directing is so visible it's almost a cameo
","The best thing about BEETLEJUICE is without a doubt Tim Burton's directing. Tim Burton is one of the first reasons I got interested in film whatsoever. It was with BATMAN from 1989. A great, big masterpiece, if you ask me his finest piece of film. However, BEETLEJUICE, is not one of his best. But it's great, funny like few and in most aspects good, but it can't stand up to movies like EDWARD SCHISSORHANDS or BATMAN. I gave it a 7. It was great, but not ""very good"". Well, for this simple reason:<br/><br/>When the movie starts it is funny as hell. And the first half hour a 10-pointer. But I think that after an hour it's not that funny anymore. Beetleguise is funny all the time, but Juno and the waiting room and all that is old news buy now. It's not funny anymore. The first time I saw it, I loved it. And the storyline is also a bit disappointing. It wasn't a very great idea to make the family want to make money out of them. It would be funnier if they got terrorised and had to stay. Sure, it was a more realistic way out, but I think in a movie that's about two haunting-sucking ghosts and the link to another world, with evil snakes, Junos, Beetleguises and painted doors opening, it doesn't have to be. <br/><br/>7/10"

The excellent script make you laugh at Betelgeuse, and hate the New Yorkers. Unfortunately, you also hate everyone else, including the ghost couple, the girl and the business men.

DO YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE LIKE THIS???) to Otho to Jeffrey Jones's clueless dad to, of course, Winona Ryder's alienated but sharp Lydia (Plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food / ...I myself am...strange and unusual) to the concept that the ghosts have to get the PEOPLE out of their house.  Ghostbusting turned on its ear.   The dead are nice and harmless! The living are ruthless capitalist developer city slicker VanityFair licking fools!  Death is not perceived by all the dead and the afterlife is a surreal and chaotic place where people might learn some semblance of lesson (Miss Argentina:  And I'll tell you something.  IF I knew then WHAT I know now, I wouldn't have had my little accident.)  We learn that death is subjective - ""This is what happens when you die.  And THAT is what happens when he dies.  And THAT is what happens when they die.  It's all very personal.""  (Miss Argentina shrugs).  Michael Keaton is rather handy with the quick wit, be it ""attention, K-Mart Shoppers!"" to saying he's seen The Exorcist however many times, ""And it KEEPS GETTING FUNNIER EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE IT!"" There's so much more to say but not enough space.  For one of the  most charming movies with some of the best music, this is just adorable!"
