"Scaramouche2004","Null","181","213","4 July 2004"," A film not worthy of all these bad reviews..read on and I'll explain.
","So its fluffy and predictable. It's unrealistic and sickly sweet. Who cares...this film pretends to be nothing more than what it is intended to be. Light romantic comedy.<br/><br/>Since stars like Cary Grant, Kathrine Hepburn and Irene Dunne, lit up our cinema screens in the 1930's with films like The Awful Truth, Bringing up Baby and My Favorite Wife, Hollywood and of course the movie going public have reserved a special place in their hearts for RomComs, screwballs and battle of the sexes comedies.<br/><br/>Identical plots, Identical jokes but none the less jokes and plots that will never go out of style and will always be relevant in any age or location, whether it be New York of the 30's or New York in the present day.<br/><br/>Hollywood has always worked on the basis that they stick to what has been tried and tested and has proved to work, that is why with a small plot change and a rehash of old jokes and situations they are able to reinvent their movies for a new generation of film buffs. It was through this formula that Doris Day and friends were able to continue RomCom history throughout the 60's and every one of them box office winners.<br/><br/>A recent example of this would be Down With Love starring Ewan McGregor and Rene Zelwegger. Who could not see plot comparisons to Pillow Talk or Lover Come Back? Yet it did not make this film any less enjoyable. Our entertainment lies in seeing our actors of the day fill the roles of the great actors of yesterday and how the scripts and jokes are adapted and told within a backdrop of 21st century life etc.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson made this film with impeccable comic timing and enjoyable performances. Of course with Goldie Hawn for a mother, Hudson comes straight from comic stock so I would have been disappointed if she failed to meet the challenge but she didn't. Some of her facial expressions and mannerisms almost had me convinced I was watching an old episode of ""Laugh In"" <br/><br/>McConaughey also held his own and proved himself to be a gifted comic as he did in the Wedding Planner.<br/><br/>This plot seemed quite original and as a battle of the sexes comedy, they seldom come as good as this. Again the formula was followed and we were under no illusion on what the final outcome would be, but their journey to this ultimate destination is what we find entertaining.<br/><br/>This type of film has been popular for seventy plus years and their simularities are what makes them so. Instead of slamming them..watch some of the predecessors and appreciate their origins.<br/><br/>Be thankful they are still making these types of movies today as in an era which is threatening to be devoured by action thrillers, fantasy adventure and shoot 'em ups this seems to be the only diversity left in motion pictures."
"markandbeck","Null","90","112","30 December 2003"," Better than I expected
","The fact is, I had not intended to see this movie - ever.  I had not heard good things.  But my wife saw it, and liked it.  One evening she caught me in a mellow mood and I watched it with her.<br/><br/>To say it is contrived is an understatement.  To say it is generally predictable is to state the obvious.  It is a piece of fluff romantic comedy familiar to viewers of old movies.  But there are a lot of people who LIKE fluff, and frankly, I think we will probably watch it again some day.<br/><br/>The writing was occasionally witty, often funny, and sometime knee-slappingly hilarious, without degenerating into the completely silly. The chemistry between Kate and Matthew was great, and their performances were what made this movie rise above the mediocre.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time with this movie if you insist on depth or insight into universal truths - it ain't happenin'.  But if you want a good time with a charming flick, you could do worse."

","how to lose a guy is an original story, which is well-acted, very smart and very very funny. i found myself laughing out loud many many times. I think its one of the best romantic comedies of all time. I would encourage buying the movie: great for parties or anytime you want to good laugh. I quite enjoyed this movie actually. I didn't intend to see it but i'm not sorry i did. I like romantic comedies but the past couple of years they've been pretty disappointing & plain stupid + i'm not big on Matthew McConaughey. The main reason why i liked the movie is definitely Kate Hudson! She's so adorable & hilariously funny in the movie. Definitely the star. Matthew did a good job i guess, but i still don't particularly like him a lot. The story is original, the jokes are really funny & there's real chemistry between the main characters! Unfortunately it's just a chick-flick that will be forgotten pretty soon. But at least it's a romantic comedy with a real heart!<br/><br/>Entertainment Score: 9.9/10<br/><br/>Overall: 9.85/10"

","Matthew M. is best in romantic comedies. It's his best type of movie. He's not the most handsome guy, and a little on the random side. But for some reason he shines in these movies. Who knows?<br/><br/>This is some good stuff right here. Perhaps one of the best rom coms ever. The movie is about a man meeting a woman. The man is supposed to make a girl fall in love with him, while the woman is supposed to make the man fall out of love with her. She's a journalist doing it for a story, and he's doing it for work as well. They fall in love at the end.<br/><br/>It's a powerful vehicle. Both Hudson and M shine pretty bright. It has its dull moments, but comes together beautifully in the end. It's fun to see the relationship drama, and both trying to trick the other. Family gets involved too, mixed with career, it's a hit.<br/><br/>Watch it!<br/><br/>7 stars"

","Kate Hudson (one of a handful of women on the planet that can pull off a yellow dress ) shines in this adapted Taming of the Shrew with her brilliant comedic timing.

Matthew McConaughey is also very good and comedy is definitely one of his strengths. Bebe is terrific."

What is wrong with that. It didn't hurt that Kate is just as funny if not funnier than her mom (good genes) and Matthew should be credited for his great sense of humor. He is also really nice to look at. Had to be said! I loved this movie. The supporting cast was also excellent. Adam Goldburg can play a straight man better than anyone.

","`How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days' is not the collaborated work of all the first dates I have ever had. The name of that piece is `How To Lose A Guy In 10 Seconds'. `How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days' is a giddy but formulaic romantic comedy starring Hollywood vanities Matthew Mcconaughey & Kate Hudson. Mcconaughey plays a cocky advertiser named Ben Barry. Big Ben places a wager that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. Hudson plays Andie Anderson, a fem-themed magazine scriber who writes a weekly `How To Lose.' articles. Her next reality assignment is = How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days. Now these two self-agenda dating gamers are off to the races. Andie does everything irritable imaginable to make the male species quiver with fear: furnishing Ben's apartment as a bunny festival, filling the bathroom with vaginal products , nicknaming Ben's penile instrument with a female name, and interrupting a guy's night out by actually showing up. Yes! Guys! This is one of the scariest films I have ever seen. Poor Ben has to undertake this torture so he could win his bet and make Andie fall in love with him in 10 days. Mcconaughey & Hudson did demonstrate screen chemistry. Hudson, who is strikingly beautiful, will make many male fans wish they can take a ride in that Hudson River. I did find the charm in `How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days' but I also found that it lost its luster. ***Average"

I thought he portrayed his character very well.  he was actually quite funny. And then theres little Kate Hudson. Not only is she gorgeous, but at times, i swear i was watching Goldie Hawn.  she was so annoyingly funny in this movie, that you actually cringed when she did some of her horrible tricks.

Adam Goldberg is HILARIOUS with his dry sense of humor, and if you listen carefully to each of his lines, you will laugh your #@! off.  He and Thomas Lennon are two KEY roles in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, BEING A GUY, i give this movie a 7/10.  Adam Golberg saved this movie............."
"harpoonz37","8","4","5","17 February 2003"," Superb Acting.
","I totally agree with other user's reviews.  This is a generic romantic comedy, which follows the formula to a T.  The directing is nothing noteworthy (including the now-standard body-shots of Matthew to titilate the younger female audience - a very powerful buying crowd).  Plot is again standard romantic comedy fare.<br/><br/>I also agree that what sets this movie apart is not the plot...it is the actor's interaction with each other.  Having seen this gem, I would not hesitate to go to another movie with these two.  They alternatively leave you grimacing in discomfort at the obvious ridiculity of the situation, to laughing so hard your sides hurt.  Both actors are excellent with body gestures and 'non-verbal language' to show their feelings.  You become totally absorbed with the two characters...I can't recall any of the other actors in the movie, thinking back on it.<br/><br/>Too bad they don't give Oscars for anything other than 'serious' acting.<br/><br/>Kate and Matthew, take a bow.  This was a great performance, and lightened my day."

","Given the average ratings, I was prepared to be disappointed but I really enjoyed this rom-com! Andie's annoying tactics were really entertaining, from insisting on a diet coke during the final minutes of a basketball game to showing up at Ben's house during their boys' only night. The part where Ben proposes couple counselling with Andie's colleague posing as the therapist was just hilarious! It was also quite heartwarming to see her melting upon being welcomed so warmly into his family. The blow-up at the end was pretty funny, where they sang 'You're Vain' as a duet and tried to get back at each other. I don't think it was very believable that they'd behave in such a manner given that the dinner was in a professional setting, but it wasn't too much of a stretch. The final scene of Ben chasing Andie's taxi upon reading her article was somewhat exaggerated, but still considered a decent ending!"
"hyrumnephi","7","6","9","12 February 2003"," Forget the negative comments! Go see this film!
","This movie is very very funny.  Period.  I think that when you walk into a movie you have to walk-in with the correct expectations.  If you want a scary movie, you should expect to be scared.  If you want a drama, you should expect to be touched.  If you want a comedy, you should expect to laugh.  Whenever you read a comment on the movie from a critic that is negative, the reason is they are crtiqueing it for something it is not. Just go to this movie and you will laugh,  I did for almost an hour straight.  It is a good time, relax.  If you are a guy, even though it is a chick flick, you will enjoy this.  The movie is a parody of sorts because it portrays the way that girls treat guys sometimes.  If you are a girl, well, you will like it too, because it is a chick flick.  I saw Kate Hudson in Four Feathers and was not at all impressed with her, or the movie, so when I came to see this my expectations were not that high.  Folks, both she and Mathew McConaghey were great.  M. McConaghey has really mastered that masculine and funny dialogue much like Luke Wilson or Ben Stiller.  Sure the movie is predictable in parts, and it does follow the typical romantic film recipe towards the end, but who cares.  We don't go to movies to pick them apart.  A movie theatre is not a classroom.  Go.  Relax.  Enjoy.  You will enjoy yourself."
"TaylorYee94","8","2","2","14 May 2019"," Kate and Matthew's line exchanges, tiki-taka, and chemistry were great!
","Theme may be a little cliche. Two characters date to win the bet but find themselves truly falling for each other at the end.
However, Kate and Matthew's lines and chemistry make this move so special.
Rom-com sometimes is too cheesy and corny, but how the writer writes the line and how actors exchange them with so little effort make it natural and fun.
I couldn't stop smiling looking at this couple and brilliant screenwriting.
My favorite tiki-taka of lines in the movie when Andie and Ben meet at the bar for the first time:<br/><br/>A : Andie Anderson.
B : l'm Benjamin Barry.
A : Cute.
B : Thank you.
A : l meant your name.
B: Thank you two times.
A : Unattached?
B : Currently.
A : Likewise
B : Surprising.
A : Psycho?
B : Rarely.
A : Hmm.
B : lnterested?
A : Perhaps.
B : Hungry?
A : Starving."

Like the original Rocky, this movie appears to have many imitators and for good reason.<br/><br/>The movie has the following keys to success:<br/><br/>1) A thought provoking subject for sparing between the sexes, <br/><br/>2) A likable cast & very likable characters, <br/><br/>3) Good comic interludes,<br/><br/>4) A decent musically assisted ending with some minor action, <br/><br/>5) Subplots that tie well to the plot.<br/><br/>6) Some potentially useful advice about relationships: it's not about looks; other things cause women to drive men away (insecurity, self absorption). As I see it, you could say the same things about men who drive women away.<br/><br/>7) Many good ironies relating to the plot.<br/><br/>Despite the predictable and standard romantic comedy ending, I recommend this for anyone that wants to see a romantic comedy. <br/><br/>It's that good. They also manage a few surprises prior to that predictable ending, that make this movie worth it. Many critique it, in suggesting it has a standard romantic comedy movie ending that has been seen many times before, but that is romantic comedy. This is the general ending for this type of romantic comedy movie, and at least the song was good (Follow You Down - Gin Blossoms). Aside from that issue with the ending, you missing a lot if you don't see the subplot/irony of the card game at the parents house. It was that scene that made me like the movie and Kate Hudson as Andie."

","In my opinion you have to value film within its genre, and this lives up to all the standards. It is textbook example of what a romantic comedy should be. It has light plot filled with witty,catchy lines and a good chemistry between the two leads. Their timing is perfect. All of the actors and the rest of the crew did great job. As a big plus it has positive light humor, and occasionally it is hilarious. Maybe is getting too sweet sometimes, but regarding the genre it is okay. It doesn't pretend to be deep.

And I am not talking about when you just tell her you liked it to make her happy.........and to avoid the 50 questions that would follow if you actually told the truth.  The whys; whats; how comes; nag; nag; blah; blah; etc. I recently got bored one night, when I couldn't fall asleep, and decided to order ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days"" on pay-per-view.  The reason I chose this paricular movie was pretty deep and complex.  It was the only one getting ready to start other than ""Kangaroo Jack"" (worst current movie).<br/><br/>I have read some reviews of ""How......10 Days"" in which people complained that it wasnt romantic enough.  And others, that it wasnt risky/daring enough.      Now granted, there were a few other directions this film could have gone, and I am sure they would have worked well, but the one chosen for this movie worked great.  And I feel it was refreshing to see a romantic movie that wasnt trying to pull on your heart strings the entire time, nor trying to add in a bunch of side stories for added humor. (Please forgive me, for I give very vague descriptions of movies.  I try to give enough info to give my opinion, and just enough to try to help othersdecide if they want to see te movies.  But I neer  want to give away to much.  Its best to see a movie and be surprised, rather than already knowing the script before viewng it.) ""......10 Days"" was a funny movie.  It focused on a lady trying to play a man, in order to have a story for ladies magazine.  However, little does she know it, but he is also trying to play her......so that he can be in charge of the advertising/marketing of diamonds, at his advertising company. The movie focuses on Kate Hudson's character doing anything and everything to annoy Mathew's character. Tons of small little things that tend to either scare guys off, or just frustrate them.  However, Mathew's character, no matter how annoyed or just plain p***ed off he gets, refuses to end the relationship because he ants that business account mentioned earlier........which ticks her off.  So the whole movie shows them both being angry with each other, but refusing to dump the other.....due to the goals they wee trying to achieve.  And of course eventually, they truely do get close and care about each other. I think what I enjoyed the most about this movie was that the things Kate did to try to get Mathew to break up with her, most of which were real small things, are real things from real life.  Little things that real women do, without knowing it, that bothers guys.  So I saw a few things in thise movie that I had seen in real life, and it just made me laugh."

","""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days"" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's so lifeless, stupid, ugly and inept, it's hard to believe that anyone involved, from the director to the scriptwriter to Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, titled, with a false generosity, ""stars,"" received payment for their services. This is one of those movies where, frame by frame, you sit there saying, ""How could anything this bad ever have reached theaters? <br/><br/>""Lose a Guy"" is meant to be a romantic comedy, but there is no romance, and no comedy. Hudson and McConaughey have been more charismatic in tabloid TV talk shows. There's no timing, no tension, no wit, no music, no flair, just inert matter moving, like sludge, in front of your eyes. Not even good enough for one of those days when you are exhausted from work and just want to watch *something*. Staring at a blank screen for ninety minutes would be more uplifting."

The ""plot"", of course, was regurgitatingly ridiculous, but I can deal with a paltry premise if it's at least played out in a relatively clever way. There is not one clever moment in this movie, alas and alack, and although Hudson is adorable even when she's being more obnoxious than Joe Dirt (she gives Matthew's male member the monicker of Princess Sophia, for instance, and she sabotages his boys-only poker game in such foul ways that they cannot be described without resorting to severely inappropriate 4-letter words), and although Matt of course is dangerously and disgustingly attractive, this just aint enough to justify this tastelessly trashy travesty, which ends really really badly, subjecting their peers (at their devastastingly dreary ""frost-yourself"" diamonds advertising campaign party) to an astoundingly embarrassing duet (yes, they're SINGING by the end of this treachery, boys and girls), followed by the token let's-make-up-after-we've-put-each-other-through-the-tortures-of-the-damned-(not-to-mention-the-audience)-because-aw-shucks-we-actually-love-each-other scene.   <br/><br/>The good news is, I had more fun writing this review than I had sitting through the movie, and I thank imDB for giving me this opportunity."

","Thank god I saw this at a screening and didn't waste money on it. After the horrid reviews, I had low expectations but still -this movie is so predictable, so false, so by the numbers that it just unfolds because it has to. Who thought the names of the leads was a cute idea - see, she's Andi Anderson and he's Benjamin Barry and they say the names all the time in the movie as if it's catchy and clever as opposed to forced and created. I must be in the minority because I find Kate Hudson so irritating and an awful actress. She can't seem to play a three-dimensional character so she resorts to pretty much mugging for the camera - watch me make funny faces as I eat a hamburger, watch me giggle just like my Mom did thirty years ago. I'm sorry - but if Goldie Hawn wasn't her mom - she'd be lucky to get a dinner theatre part. Bebe Neuwirth and Adam Goldberg try their hardest but seem embarrassed to be in the movie. SPOILERS************ (as if there's ONE actual surprise in the movie) But, once again, the reality of a cabbie stopping on a bridge in New York - especially post 9/11 -please.

Maybe for some, for me I was happy only because this insipid tripe was actually ENDING. Look, that's what makes the world go round - but when smart, clever romantic comedies like MR. JEALOUSY OR NEXT STOP WONDERLAND have trouble finding an audience and this coloring book rakes in the money, well, hell, you get what you deserve."

","This movie was fairly funny. It was a combination of humor, formula, and predictablility, but still funny. Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaghey have two different agendas about what to do in ten days-Hudson to drive a guy away and McConaghey to get a girl to fall madly in love with him. Of course, their plans go awry and chaos ensues. I liked it. The two stars had definite chemistry, and it was a likable chemistry. It was well written. I think there were many memorable scenes, such as the Knicks games and the black tie party. Hudson especially gave a terrific turn as the magazine writer who does her 10 day thing for a magazine article she is working on, and gives a good over-the-top performance. You might like it if you like the stars and this type of movie. See it for those.<br/><br/>** 1/2 out of ****"
"=G=","5","5","8","3 July 2003"," Romcom by rote
","""How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" is a little bit of contempo fluff for the 13-24 demographic which bets heavily on the popularity of the two protags, Hudson and McConaughey. The flick's premise has a built in problem as it requires both protags to act uncharacteristically during most of the run thereby making the superficial character development even more superficial. Sorely lacking the creative department and with nothing going for it save Hudson's over-worked smile and McConaughey's overworked suavity, there's little to praise in this very average romcom which is sure to make broadcast in a heartbeat.

","This film is a one-trick pony as you might have guessed from the trailers. If you think a shot of a dog urinating is funny, you'll like this film as the dog gets to do it twice.  Pretty much that's the level of humor going on here with Kate Hudson trying to gross out  Matthew McConaughey.  She seems to have aged badly since Almost Famous.  Kate carries the day only when she can show her unique mixture of vulnerability and worldly sophistication, which amounts to mere seconds of screen time in this film.  Matthew McConaughey mostly looks confused and waiting for a punchline which I suppose is what the screenwriters intended.  Is there chemistry?  Sure, but again its confined to two minutes in the first part of the film and two minutes near the end.  The rest of it is a play-within-a-play and hey folks its not Shakespeare."

","I never knew Troma Films were making chick flicks. Oops, what was I thinking. Then again, this film is so lame and predictable, the grinding of millions of males teeth could be heard in the theater like a sonic boom. Hollywood's excuse for putting out inoffensive tripe like this is yet another pathetic cry for help, one where the rehashing of ideas and plots and almost banal dialogue makes one wonder if the sanctity of foreign films without the subtitles will be the respective norm of escaping such garbage. <br/><br/>This film also continues the rather lousy trend of trite chick-flick movies (I'm talking about Two Weeks Notice, Just Married, Deliver Us From Eva, and Maid in Manhattan) that mysteriously lead the box office. Perhaps the foreign film goers are right: American films are becoming a dull collection of clones and remakes. Here's an idea, instead of torturing captives and putting killers to death, make these individuals watch this film around the clock. Such inflicted pain will reform someone quickly and make any future terrorist squeal like a dirty pig.<br/><br/>The only one being honest about the rehashing trend seems to be George Lucas, who knows his Star Wars saga is retreading familiar ground, and does little to dispel such ideas. However, films like this cannot accept the truth, and sadly, the viewing public doesn't seem to care."

","Set in New York, ""How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" is a romantic comedy film directed by Donald Petrie. Mde in 2003, the movie is starring Kte Hudson, in a role of a journalist and Matthew McConaughy, in the role of an executive advertiser.The movie is based on a short cartoon book of the same name by Michele Alexander and Jeanne Long. The plot revolves around our main characters, Andie Anderson, who is a writer for a woman's magazine called Composure as the ""How to..."" girl and Benjamin Berry, the advertising executive for sports. Everything becomes quite gripping once the acting begins. Andie is setting herself a goal for her new article: How To Lose A guy in 10 Days. At the same time, Benjamin makes a bet with his boss, saying that he can make any girl fall in love with him. The riveting party begins really, when the two of them end up together, without knowing about each other's plans. How will everything end? In burning flames. One of the things that I have loved about the acting,or just this movie in general, is that the main characters are absolutely charming together, let aside the fact that both of them are stunning. Although, the romcom does have a few bad sides too.Even though the action is convultet and the whole story is pretty cheesy and light- hearted, the script is a bit too predictable and also, it has a silly premise. That said, I can say from the bottom of my buff heart, that this is one of my favorite movies. Intriguing,epic and full of drama, love and comedy, How To Lose a Guy in 10 Days is worth watching."

The secret comes to light and while they're distanced for a while, they come together and end up happily ever after. The people who are disappointed in this movie and those who are expecting more of it than a typical romantic comedy. Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson execute their characters perfectly.

","I like the idea that both characters are not 100 % into the relationship forming between them, but not for the usual reasons. Both are doing it for their job, but their goals are the opposite. And it's hilarious for the viewer to watch them struggling with what they got themselves into. Andie's driving Ben crazy, but Ben doesn't want to give up on the bet, so he tries to hold on to Andie, which frustrates her. The tension is amazing.<br/><br/>A lot of things in this film were pretty generic. The soundtrack is generic, so are the characters and the structure. But then again, in romantic comedies it's kind of good we can trust the structure to be similar. We don't watch romantic comedies to see an amazing art film, it's for fun and crying your eyes out if you need to. (This one didn't make that happen though.) The dialogue is also very generic, but! There was one specific piece of Dialogue I really enjoyed. It was when Andie and Ben first met. They mostly used one word lines, like ""Unattached?"" ""Currently."" ""Likewise."" ""Surprising."" I love that dialogue! It's so simplified! And that's what makes it amusing. It's also a kind of smart way to show how they are testing the waters. Neither of them is actually looking for serious relationship. Andie is looking for a normal guy she can hook and then destroy. Ben is looking for someone he can make fall in love with him. So why use long sentences when just trying to check if the other one seems alright for the ""mission""?<br/><br/>But How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days is an amusing film. It's entertaining and kind of cute. It's predictable, sure, and the writing is not the best, yet even though it's surprisingly long, it doesn't frustrate you, at least during the first view."

The things (that actually do drive most men crazy - and not in a good way) she does are so funny and out there; mixed with her facial expressions and energetic acting, it really makes the film memorable. The things she does, along with knowing how Ben would react - as would any man - really made me laugh out loud because it's so ridiculously funny, especially how well Hudson plays her role.<br/><br/>Also, an important factor, Matthew and Kate's chemistry is strong throughout and that really helps the movie tie together and stand out from it's typical plot.

","It probably can be very ungrateful for someone with any artistic ambition in film to make a romantic comedy that appeals to a large audience (here's a pleonasm). That's because this is probably the genre with more rules to be followed. The thing is fully tailored for the audiences to believe they are watching something fresh, while seeming to be new, and never seen before. As far as my personal experience in these films goes, there are 2 things that can redeem such projects: either the comedy lines and moments are exceptionally well done and catchy, or the protagonist actors/public characters are soaked on an aura of glamour and interesting personalities, like Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn throughout their careers or Roberts in Pretty Woman. There is a third option, which is to try and shake the genre, like say, the Coens did in Intolerable Cruelty, but that's some hard stuff to do, and hardly tried.<br/><br/>This film doesn't work well to me on any of the 3 options above, so it fades, and fails. This is a film where both the protagonists act their characters. Both are faking to each other, and that's the fun. It's actually an interesting starting point, but the actors have to play along. the thing is McConaughey is an absolute disaster in every respect. He simply can't act, and he tries to disguise that under his over the top accent and his own sense of public personality, which is simply vacuous to me. Kate Hudson has a few poses, and knows how to smile and show her pretty face. Other than that, there's not much more we can count on as well. We are left with a few interesting funny bits, allowed by the writing of the scenes, by the very situations characters are in.<br/><br/>Some bits work well enough as space fillers, but this is not worth an extra look.<br/><br/>My opinion: 1/5 <br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Amazing how often films preach one thing and then perform the very same sins they warn against. The `moral' is to be particularly self-aware in how you present yourself: the `yourself' in the story is woman creating a little drama of love. The film itself started out with one heavy strength: the always reliable notion of actors playing characters who are actors. Everyone is scamming everyone else. Rich stuff, that.<br/><br/>But it also has a heavy burden, the untalented, plain Goldie Junior. Her mom has built a career on a giggle, but at least late in life, she has learned enough of the ordinary tricks of the trade to not embarrass. This film, by Sandra Bullock's creator of promotional vehicles, has the double burden of pleasing us and her managers.<br/><br/>You can see where the original film wasn't bad: especially some of the various episodes where the humor is in our discomfort. But you can also see where the test audiences forced a completely reshot ending: the original ending was at the basketball game with the forgotten necklace, something set up with great elaboration. The reshot ending fell back on the most rigid rules of the formula: a public fight which must involve microphones followed by a chase through city streets.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 4: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","Thank God for beautiful women. I especially thank God for my fiancÃ©. It's just too darn bad she has such conventional taste in movies. So of course I have gotten very used to the occasional chick flick. They make her laugh, even if I don't get it or care too. They fill her with glee but they fill me with loathing. But every once and while a chick flick comes along that is so conventional, and so silly. That I'm am filled with Apathy instead of loathing. So I guess that's the only way to describe HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN TEN DAYS: a conventional film that filled with apathy.<br/><br/>Like every romantic comedy 10 DAYS tells the story of two beautiful people and how they get to know each other, falling in and out of love with each other, and then telling there less attractive friends about how happy they are. <br/><br/>In this film those two people are Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson, Almost Famous) and Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughy, EDTV), they are so adorable their first names have that same first letter as their last name (they might want to shoot their parents). They each meet under dubious circumstances, she has to write and article about the mistakes women make while dating, and he has to make her fall in love with him to win an advertising account. So of course in the process they both fall in love and wild comedic scenes take place.<br/><br/>What works in the film are Hudson and McConaughy, they have really nice chemistry together. They have a really sweet conversation when they first meet. It is constructed with just pithy little statements, and it is both silly and charming. Hudson also relishes torturing McConaughy with her silly dating games. The scene in which she breaks up the boy's poker game really enchanted me. Not a terribly inspired scene but it has a really nice comedic tone. So at least it worked for me.<br/><br/>I also liked the scene at Ben's parent's house. The game of B.S. was inspired. This scene works because for once the colorful family doesn't act like buffoons. This scene is also much too good for this movie.<br/><br/>I just hated that the film was so conventional. In the course of an hour and forty minutes, they meet, fall in love, fall out of love, and realize they both really love each other and live happily ever after. Its plot is constructed out of every romantic comedy cliche ever made.<br/><br/>
What also bothered me was that our two star-crossed lovers are far to good for the material. The concept would work without sitcom jokes and witty one liners; but of course in Hollywood unconventional ... If you are looking for a good night out with your lady friend, 10 DAYS will make her smile. But may I recommend a better romantic comedy, Benny and Joon. It's just a suggestion."

However, as this movie progressed, Kate's character's tricks got to be more mean than funny, and as a result, I stopped laughing and just felt sorry for McConaughey's character.  The scene where he takes her to meet his family, and she stops (temporarilY) acting like a little jerk, were actually the best in the movie.  The climactic scene at the diamond party resembled the worst of the Jerry Springer (et al) show where people hurt each other in public.  YUCK.

","This movie was ridiculous. The plot is completely unbelievable. A woman bets her boss that she can 'lose a guy in ten days.' A man bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days. What can go wrong? Too much. The movie was not funny. It showed women as catty and men as stupid. There is no reason why he would 'want to keep her' and there is no reason that she 'would fall in love with him.' Granted, they are doing stupid and idiotic things on purpose, but after finding out that they were lying to each other, all is forgiven! And of course the climax is played out in public. Typical Hollywood. In reality, they would be so upset that they lied to each other that they would never see each other again. And any talking would be out of the line of curious ears. But of course, movies are not based on reality.<br/><br/>Kate Hudson is very pretty and Matthew McConaughey is quite handsome. The costumes, especially the yellow dress that Hudson wears at the end, are gorgeous. I do think that Hudson as Andie Anderson and McConaughey as Benjamin Barry did well with their talents, but the movie itself stinks. No matter how talented you are, you cannot save a sinking ship.<br/><br/>I'm sure several people will like this movie and that is fine, everyone has different tastes.

First of all, Benjamin's plot is less than original as everyone appears to have a friend who has made a bet on such a subject. Secondly, (and this is where my gender may get blended into it) his crime is PETTY compared to hers. So I simply fail to see her indignation when she learns the truth. And as her part of the plot is highly original, it brings a further lack of balance to the whole story.

","When I first heard about ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"", I thought that it was just another romcom, and although it does hit a lot of similar beats that most generic romcoms would have, the characters more than make up for it. This movie also throws in a bit of a twist. It uses the trope in which a guy makes a bet that he can be with a girl, and adds to it by having both the guy and the girl essentially using the other for their gain. This adds a lot of funny and clever moments where you see two manipulative people going back and forth trying to use the other for their gain. And Ben and andi have a lot of chemistry, that despite some of the cheesy lines, really helped you to want them to be together. The movie ends about how you would expect it to, but thats not necessarily a bad thing, not all movies need to be six sense. I really enjoyed this movie, but it did have flaws. Some of the writing was obvious and predictable, and id say that the jokes had a 60% chance if landing. This movie won't win any Oscar but its a great quick watch. Love it or hate it, this movie is a 2000s movie, and that means humorously cheesy looking outfits and dialogue. But honestly that kind of adds to the movie, and the guy friends in the movie were unironically very funny.

Both believe they can snare a mate and have them fall in love with them  only with opposing objectives in mind  and go about their task with single-minded determination uncaring of what damage they may do to the other. There are a few laughs along the way  not many, but a few  and the ending is, of course, mind-numbingly predictable, but then it's obvious that nobody was out to win an Oscar here."

They went well with each other and played the role as best as they could, and succeeded.<br/><br/>Many people do not believe this movie would be good or funny, but it was because I let my boyfriend watch it and you know guys, there aren't many who like chick flicks and cry about boring it will be and all that crappy stuff.

","The reason i gave this film an 8 out of ten is because for a female, this film is watchable, yes yes it maybe cheesy but we all need it to be cheesy for us to escape from reality for at least an hour a day!i have watched this film 3 or 4 times and love it!id watch it again now if i had it! Yes this is a boy meets girl film and we all know what the ending will be but this is quite a funny film!The film stars Kate Hudson as the lovely Angie and her co- star, Matthew McConaughey as Ben who as you can guess fall madly in love with each other, but again as always there is one simple twist that makes the whole film stand out!that they are both using each other but for very different reasons. Angie is using Ben for an article as she is a journalist for a woman's magazine and she proposes to her boss that she will write an unpredictable article about ""How to lose a guy in ten days"" and she uses her man repelling friend, Michelle played by Kathryn Hahn as her case study. Meanwile Ben ""crashes"" a business meeting with his boss and his two female colleagues as he wants to prove to his boss that he can pitch an idea for diamond jewellery better than his two female colleagues, pretty quickly his two colleagues come to the conclusion that he doesn't know anything about how women feel and he ends up making a bet with them that he has to make a girl fall in love with him before the diamond ball, and guess who they choose to be his victim, Angie knowing full well what her agenda is, To lose the guy in ten days. So as the beautiful Angie and the gorgeous Ben start to date,Angie is trying to put him off her by making photo albums of their future children and putting cuddly toys around his apartment. She does anything she can to try and put him off her she even makes her friend Michelle dress up as a funny looking psychiatrist so they can have ""couple therapy"" so that it will pt him off her. Although poor Ben sticks with it like no other man would. It is only when they go to Ben's parents house that they start to fall for each other, and start to get too involved with each other on their romantic break away. When they get back, Angie still hasn't managed to finish with him but does she want to? Wile at the ball everything unfolds and they find out each others games.But will they fall deeply in love again or will they just let each other go?"

OK enough of that...<br/><br/>This movie is a typical romance film with the cliché curveballs and the overwhelming plot of ""how is this going to end up."" How quickly we forget how evil both of them are and how manipulating they were. Ah, romance movies. For those who do not know, Kate Hudson plays a writer for a ""Cosmopolitan""-like magazine and Matthew McConaughey plays an advertising exec. They are both put to the challenge to fall in love, but the circumstances differ for each person. McConaughey has to keep a girl in love with him (for the sake of his confidence going to his head, and proclaiming that he can make any woman LOVE him), and Hudson has to write about how exactly to lose a man in 10 days (from the start of their relationship until it ends...it was more of a ""what NOT to do"" story).<br/><br/>To break it to audiences everywhere who like this film, it was OK. That's all. All the music was pretty standard, the shots were all pretty standard, and although Kate did a pretty good switch of character in the middle of the film, the acting was pretty bland and boring.

"triple8","6","0","0","30 April 2005"," light bubbly comedy
","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: <br/><br/>OK-I am the first to admit this movie had flaws. It was quite ridiculous in some areas and many scenes aren't as funny as they should be. It still warrants an above average rating though. This is mainly because of Kate Hudson. I doubt that had anybody else played this role I'd have tuned into this movie for more then 10 minutes. But she plays this role very well. Hudson has a naturally mischievous quality that lends itself well to a movie such as this and makes one want to watch. So I did.<br/><br/>I think there were a few problems with this movie, one being some of the jokes become a little more obnoxious then funny and come very close to wearing out their welcome. There's also the problem that no matter which way you look at it, and no matter how unbelievable many romantic comedies are, these two people BOTH having bets going on simultaneously, is almost just to much. I think it would have maybe been better to just have Hudson involved in the whole bet thing and concentrate more on the wit factor.<br/><br/>The other problem I had with 10 days, is the ending. I'm SO tired of all these romantic comedies ending the same way. One's about to leave town(usually the female) and then the male lead goes racing after her....I wish this movie hadn't done that, it's getting SO overdone, we get the same ending almost every time. The movie was somewhat creative, so I ask, couldn't a more creative, WITTY ending been used? They still could have wound up together just not in the same standard bland way!<br/><br/>The movie's main positive was Hudson who made this occasionally laugh out loud hysterical. Some things WERE very funny and the wit came not just from the stunts Hudson pulled but from Hudson herself. Like her mother, Kate Hudson has a wonderful sense of comedic timing, great facial expressions and she had me roaring in some places. I loved the line where she says something similar to: ""I love you but I don't like you right now"", turns away and then mouths what she just said with an expression of utter befuddlement. <br/><br/>That's just one example but the fact is, though this movie had some problems the movie makers hired the right leading lady and that's the main reason I'm giving this a 6 of 10. This is not going to go down as one of the greatest romantic comedies ever made (though I think it really could have been even funnier.) But for what it is it's not a bad way to spend some time. My vote is 6 of 10."

","After viewing several times, I found the movie ""How To Lose A Guy In Ten Days"" extremely cute, heartwarming, and charming.  This movie, starring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, is based on a plot about two twenty-somethings who make bets with friends and colleagues to fall in, or out of love within the allotted ten days.  Andie Anderson, Hudson's character, is Composure magazine's `how-to-girl.'  She writes low quality how to articles for women.  After witnessing a friend's devastating breakup, Andie volunteers to do her next article on `how to lose a guy in ten days,' in which she would `catch' a guy and do everything in her power (by doing things that `normal' women do) to get the guy to dump her within the ten days.  With her project in mind, Andie and her friends go out to a bar to find her man.  There she meets Ben Barry, McConaughey's character, and Andie thinks she has met her match.  However, Ben also has a bet of his own to win.<br/><br/>
Ben works for an advertising group and is trying to break into the field of diamonds, a female dominated field in advertising.  He makes a bet with his boss and two female colleagues that if he can get a woman to fall in love with him in ten days, he wins the diamond advertising pitch.  So, when they first meet, both Ben and Andie are looking for someone to help them win their bets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
The first night goes relatively smoothly, and the relationship continues from there.  Andie tries her hardest to get rid of Ben, but Ben is bound and determined to have Andie fall for him.  The whole movie revolves around the will-they-or-won't-they idea, and I was on the edge of my seat until the end, not knowing exactly which road the characters would take.  I think the purpose of this film is to give the audience some whole-hearted laughs, and allow them to see some of themselves in the characters.  The critical techniques used in this film are obvious through the settings, secondary characters, and the music used throughout the movie."

","(NOTE: This review contains some spoilers of sorts - but if you've seen more than a few romantic comedies in the past, you probably know how this one's going to shape up anyway. Nonetheless, you have been warned!)<br/><br/>
First off, for those who read the summary line of this review, I'm well aware that the film actually ran for closer to 120 minutes. However, if it's laughs you're after, the last quarter of the film barely registers. That's not to say this is a bad film. Quite the opposite, actually, but it is weighed down by a couple of flaws inherent to the genre.<br/><br/>I'm getting ahead of myself. Anyway, the concept behind the movie has Kate Hudson's Andie Anderson, a burgeoning magazine columnist, looking for an article to escalate her to something more than a ""How to..."" girl. At a nearby advertising company, Matthew McConaughey's Ben Barry is searching for a way to prove that he knows women enough to be fit to handle projects geared towards that half of the market. Andie comes up with the notion of writing an article on how to lose a guy in 10 days, Ben places a bet that he can make a girl fall in love with him in - you guessed it - 10 days, the two are paired up by a couple of scheming mutual friends, and so the scene is set. Andie and Ben's relationship develops rather unusually, with each of them unaware of the other's hidden agendas.<br/><br/>This is a fun concept for a romantic comedy, and it works quite well as Andie sets about naming Ben's penis, refurbishing his home, interrupting his get-togethers with friends and generally turning his life upside down. This might have been annoying, but Hudson is a smart actress and she infuses Andie with an unrelenting energy that is equal parts wicked and charming. Quite simply, Hudson not only steals the show, she carries it, and many of her scenes are downright, rolling-in-the-aisles hilarious. McConaughey handles his role nicely as well, and the two leads keep the energy flowing (which helps, given that most of the supporting cast are rather forgettable) without pushing the jokes so far as to become unbelievable. It's definitely worth noting that this is just about the funniest romantic comedy to emerge in several years, largely because it doesn't overstep its bounds and become silly.<br/><br/>Sounds good, no? It really is - until the expected change sets in and Andie and Ben develop real feelings for one another (surprise surprise). It's an overly familiar development, but it doesn't entirely tarnish the film, even if the last 25 minutes descend into mushiness. In a lot of ways, this movie is a nice throwback to vintage romantic comedies of yesteryear, and despite the fact that it fails to step outside the boundaries the genre has been largely confined by for over a decade, most people will still get more than a bit of enjoyment out of it.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","When I rented this movie, I didn't set myself up for Oscar material.  I expected a cute movie with plenty of charm but not an extraordinary amount of brains.  Sometimes, a flick like that is just what you're in the mood for.  <br/><br/>What I got was in fact two movies:  The desired cute one, which suddenly morphed into a brainless, trashy one.  <br/><br/>The first half of the movie is enjoyable.  Kate Hudson is adorable as a writer who is working on an article about all the things women do wrong in relationships.  She is assigned to date a guy, drive him away, then write about it.  Her victim is Matthew McConaughey.  Unfortunately for her, he has made a bet that he can make her fall in love with him, so try as she may, she can't seem to drive him away.  <br/><br/>Hudson's stereotypically-female antics in the first part of the movie are hilarious.  She is possessive, whiny, overbearing, and obnoxious.  I enjoyed the social commentary here on how women with low self-esteems act around men, then wonder why they get no respect.  My favorite part- when they are in a restaurant together, and Hudson's character suddenly starts crying and says embarrassingly loudly, ""I can't eat in front of you!  You think I'm fat!""  I thought to myself, 'I know women like that!  I want to strangle them!'  <br/><br/>Hudson is definitely adorable.  McConaughey doesn't act so much as sit around looking hot in this movie.  I would have cast someone else, but his job is to sit and look pretty for the camera, and he does that just fine. <br/><br/>
A premise with hilarious potential is set up here.  Then, suddenly, the writers drop the ball.  The characters, of course, have begun to genuinely fall in love, and the writers don't seem to know how to resolve the plot. So, as seems to be the style these days, they resort to trashy, lowbrow, toilet humor and ruin the whole thing.  The main heroes of course find out about each other's real motives, chaos sets in, and the stars somehow end up on stage singing a vulgar version of ""You're so vain"" to each other.  At this point, all humor and intelligence is lost.  <br/><br/>My advice:  watch and enjoy the first part of the movie.  As soon as you see Hudson and McConaughey return from visiting his character's parents' house, turn the movie off, and use your imagination to create your own ending."

I thought even the dog was stealing the scenes it was in!  It almost has that part where you want to jump up and down and scream, ""YES!"" and then it lets you go.

When her friend, Michelle, is dumped, Andie's boss thinks it's a good idea for Michelle to use it as a story. Not being able to exploit her personal life for an article, the boss hands it up to anyone. Andie doesn't want the story being taken by an annoying little co-worker, and therefore takes it upon herself to write the story. She explains that she will do all the silly things that women, like Michelle, do that eventually lead to men being driven away. `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' is born.<br/><br/>
Matthew McConaughey plays Benjamin Barry, the other lead role as the confident, well-built, handsome man that thinks he can make any straight and available woman fall in love with him. Two of his co-workers make a small bet with him; he has to make a woman of their choice fall completely head over heels for him by next Sunday; 10 days. The two co-workers notice that in the same bar is the woman they met doing the `How To' article! And if you hadn't guessed already, she is the one they tell Ben to make fall in love with him. We witness the next 10 days of these people's lives as Andie does everything in her power to drive Ben away; while he does everything he can to make her fall madly in love.<br/><br/>
I was dragged along to see How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days by a few of my friends, and thought that I was going to see some mediocre chick flick that is scarcely original and would leave me gasping for air as I choked on my own throw-up after having to sit through this horrendous thing they want to call `film'. I am happy to say that my worrying was in vain and that How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, though not a masterpiece, is a solid comedy that'll keep you laughing 'til the expected, yet unavoidable, conclusion.<br/><br/>
One of the key factors of this film that kept it from being run-of-the-mill was the amazing performance by the beautiful Kate Hudson. Seeing as how her role in Almost Famous completely stole my heart, I knew that she would not disappoint. She plays very well, and has the right energy and quirkiness to capture the audience and make them care about Andie Anderson. Matthew McConaughey plays average at best in his role as Benjamin Barry, but with such a dislikeable character it is hard to find praise. His character is arrogant, and unbearable, aside from a few scenes with some hilarious one-liners that kept him from giving this movie a lower rating. His co-workers Tony and Thayer, played by Adam Goldberg and Thomas Lennon, were much more funny and likeable than Ben, and provided comic relief when in the same scene.<br/><br/>
How to Lost a Guy in 10 Days provides solid comedy with believable dialogue, and a great cast of characters. The witty script matched with some solid performances keeps this movie fast and entertaining. A few tiresome scenes, an unpleasant character here or there and the aforementioned predictable ending slightly detract from the light-hearted fun; but the movie still managed to have enough fun to keep me entertained from start to finish.<br/><br/>***/****<br/><br/>Note: **/**** if it weren't for the talented Kate Hudson to pull this picture out of mediocrity."

In some places, you have to work hard to suspend your disbelief, because the characters' actions didn't always make sense based on their circumstances.

Also, I thought that Andie and the other female characters were written largely with stereotypes of women in mind.<br/><br/>In spite of these shortcomings, after accepting that it was more a ""light"" comedy than a well-written movie, I found myself frequently laughing out loud: the saving grace of the movie is the humor, which works well in most places.<br/><br/>The movie's not excellent, but its' not atrocious, either.

","Being who I am, I admit that romantic comedies can get no higher than 4 out of six stars with me. This is because those movies often aren't that deep (Which is OK, movies don't have to be) and because they're often too alike and usually mediocre at best. Still I think this movie has some good parts.<br/><br/>Okay, there ARE a lot of overused cliches at work here: They have to pretend to be something they're not, the hate each other, then they love each other, they learn something, etc... BUT the fact that in 80% of this movie the actors aren't gazing dreamingly at each other, but in fact being really MEAN gives it a nice twist. Kate Hudson is VERY evil at times, which at some points are funny, and McConnaughy makes a good effort at trying to put up with the madwoman that those parts actually work. But alas, when they begin to fall in love and Hudson realizes that she really doesn't want to hurt him, etc. that's when the story becomes mainstream, boring and cliche.<br/><br/>

It was just as good the 2nd time around.  My only gripe is a particular scene towards the end that i thought could have been dealt with a little differently (perhaps a little less headache inducing, woulda been nice) but I don't want to give anything away.  Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey had chemistry, much more than say he and Jenifer Lopez had.  Kate Hudson is gorgeous as ever, funny and dramatic at all the right times and places.  McConaughey does a decent job though the role doesn't stretch far from what I've seen him in before.  This is a keeper for me, and hopefully I offend no one when I say it reminded me of the classic screwball comedies from back in the day.

","Though there was nothing horrible about any of the acting in this flick, it wasn't particularly believable either. As far as chick flicks go, this is a movie that you can take guys too without having them puke, which might be the highest compliment for this movie you can give.<br/><br/>The idea behind the story was sound, however it may not have had the best treatment of it in this film. A woman (Hudson) watches as various of her girlfriends make the classic relationship mistakes that drive boyfriends away. So she decides to write an article on how avoid the classic mistakes by setting up an experiment that will commit those very mistakes and drive a guy away in 10 days. The unbelievability of this story is that why it would take 10 days to drive a guy away, it should be much easier and faster than that if you're in a brand new relationship. If this were an established relationship of a few months or a few years old, then this would be a real challenge. <br/><br/>At the same time, the other party in this relationship (McConaughey) has made a bet that he could get a woman to fall in love with him within 10 days. And if this happens, then he will win a big advertising contract worth millions. So he has a vested interest in making sure the relationship works out. The sad thing about this is that why it would take a multi-million dollar contract to make you want to make a relationship work out, and not just for the sake of the relationship itself? <br/><br/>Eventually, they do fall in love (how surprising!), but it all felt a little hurried and unnatural."
"bkam","5","0","0","5 July 2003"," I laughed a very few times in spite of myself
","Having seen the previews, I thought this movie would pretty much be How to Lose a Guy Viewer in 10 Minutes.  To my credit, I saw it on an airplane to Hawaii and paid nothing extra to see it.  To the film's credit, it managed to keep me staring at it for its duration.  Plot-wise, there is nothing to say.  Everything you need to know is explained in the previews.  There is not a split second of suspense throughout the entire film.  Yet this is entirely expected and to hope for a complex storyline is to be sitting through the wrong film.  The acting was exactly what was expected, the cinematography wholly unremarkable, the realism unsurprisingly lacking, and the score unmemorable.  Realistically, the only elements that have a chance of redeeming the film are the romance and the comedy.  Considering the nature of the film, the romance is, like all else, as predictable and superficial as the rest of the film, although not as annoying as it might have been.  So we come to the aspect of humor.  I must say, that despite all of these markedly low expectations and the desire not to laugh at such a tragic example of the flaws of American culture, the film was overall fairly amusing.  I found myself smiling or laughing enough to keep me from unplugging the headphones from the armrest and unplugging my mind from its consciousness.  Kate Hudson, whose acting in Almost Famous was good if memory serves, pulled off the role as reasonably as can be expected for a film with such low potential.  McConaughey was also occasionally funny, although perhaps his friends were the most humorous.  Overall, while I couldn't recommend it to anyone, I know those who like this sort of drivel will see it anyway, and for its genre it's slightly more bearable than similar films.  See it if you have little dignity, little choice, and little expectation, and you may laugh a little.  [5/10]"

","The trouble with being a single guy at my age (32) is that typically, all your male friends are either married or living with someone.  So if you want to go to the movies with your friends, you typically wind up watching what their wives want to see.  This is how I was roped into seeing ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"".<br/><br/>This film has one thing going for it (and only one thing):  Kate Hudson is hilarious playing the psycho girlfriend (and I've had a couple). Unfortunately, that might be enough for a 5-minute SNL skit or a guest appearance on a show like ""Friends"", but it's not enough to carry a 2-hour movie.<br/><br/>Everything else in the film comes from the sitcom ""Just Shoot Me"":  Kate Hudson's character is a serious journalist ""trapped"" working at a shallow fashion magazine, and the characters played by Bebe Neuwirth & Robert Klein are carbon copies of Wendie Malick & George Segal respectively in the aforementioned TV show.<br/><br/>The ""plot""--so to speak--is that Hudson's character is going to pick a guy to clamp on to, then drive him away with all the stuff that women do when they feel more needy than desirable, after which she will write an article called ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"".  Meanwhile an ad exec (Matthew McConaughey, who I met a couple of times when we were in college together) bets his co-workers he can get anyone to fall in love with him.  They pick each other for their respective projects and the bad chick-flick comedy cliches ensue.<br/><br/>Another big problem I have with the movie is that it has nothing to do with the real world.  Since when are the Knicks in the NBA finals each year? That hasn't happened since Jeff Van Gundy left.  Also, as a Texan, I have come to accept that my accent is used for all sorts of rural types (Ohio in ""Heathers"", Alaska in ""Northern Exposure"", Minnesota in ""A Simple Plan""); and I realize that in the movies, everywhere outside of New York City proper is supposed to be the sticks.  But surely even the most elitist Manhattanite must realize that people from Staten Island do *not* speak with an exaggerated Southern drawl.<br/><br/>For a single heterosexual male, watching this movie is like waiting for your sister to finish trying on outfits at a department store when you were a kid.  You just wanted her to hurry up so you could go home and play video games.  After watching this movie, I pulled ""Tetris"" out of the mothballs (OK it's on a hard drive, but you get the point) and found it immensely more entertaining than this film.

I sat 3 rows back from the front, and even while stuck between my friend and a total male stranger, this film was witty, funny, well structured and held my attention. The audience was in hysterics. The two leads Kate and Matthew were well cast and their chemistry was brilliant, and sure it is romantic.<br/><br/>This film isn't out to change anyone's life, but it was really very entertaining. Two of my friends, one of whom is very critical of all films, and the other who falls asleep half the time, both enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>

","How to lose a guy in ten days? I can think of three things a girl can say to lose a guy that second: 1) ""I'm pregnant."" 2) ""I can explain your newfound burning sensations."" 3) ""I have a penis."" Can I expect anyone to utilize these fool-proof dating tactics?<br/><br/>Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) is a fashion magazine writer with the juiciest column of her up and coming career. She will catch herself a man then torture him for ten days by subjecting him to mistakes women make in relationships (calling too much, tampons in the medicine cabinet, asking if you look fat).<br/><br/>Benjamin Barry (Mathew McConaughey) is a hotshot ad exec convinced he can make any girl fall in love with him. His confidant colleagues put him to the test and select a girl he has ten days to fall in love with him. Any guesses which lucky lady gets picked?<br/><br/>Hudson and McConaughey have a weirdly effective chemistry that seems to grow on you as the film continues. The over animated and cutesy antics of Hudson gel nicely with McConaughey's sly charm and syrupy drawl. Their battle of the sexes doesn't really reach the simmer and zip of classic screwball comedies but the journey along the way to the predictable coupling is rife with healthy gender crossing doses of humor.<br/><br/>'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' plays its proceedings very close to the chest, following the well-worn path of romantic comedies that have come before. I guess it's what to be expected when the source material is a picture book. Seriously, look into it.<br/><br/>The movie even ends with the Man running against time to stop the Woman leaving on some vehicle - set to a moderately upbeat, Top 40 pop song. Yes, 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' has its formula down: initial clashing and trashing leads to lip mashing that's just smashing. This is the kind of film where they hold the leads apart as long as they can and then let 'em at each other.<br/><br/>Bebe Neuwerth plays Hudosn's mercurial boss and is made to look way older than she is. Why did they put so much make-up on to emphasize her crow feet when this very attractive woman is only like 45? And while we're at it, why are the main characters initials AA and BB?<br/><br/>'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' is a decent date for you and your honey, especially if romantic comedies are really your bag. For me, the lack of surprises gave me much time to think and three things kept circulating in my brain:<br/><br/>1) Aren't too many romantic comedies today built upon some premise of deceit? Isn't this a bad idea to start a relationship?<br/><br/>2) Does Mathew McConaughey always act this stoned?<br/><br/>3) Does Kate Hudson not realize she desperately needs a padded bra before she gets confused with an ironing board?<br/><br/>C+"

Matthew is great, of course (that accent just makes you smile and some of his facial expressions are hysterical), but Kate just sparkles.  The plot is a tad far-fetched, but then again that is not the point.  It is the back and forth, give and take between Ben and Andie that is the fun part.  Yeah, yeah, yeah...they both use each other, how horrible, blah blah blah.

","Being the male chick-flick fan that I am, I went to this with my girlfriend expecting something cute and maybe memorable.  I don't think I can sit through one more Matthew McConaughey movie ever again.  I did not believe for even ONE second that he was a marketing man from New York.  Not a chance.  He is (and always oozes) a hick from Smalltown, Texas, which worked for EdTV and even Contact, but not for this and not for The Wedding Planner. Every time he opened his mouth to speak, I wanted to punch it in.  Plus, the Princess Sophia/Krull the Warrior King bit was TOO TOO lame. <br/><br/>
This movie's saving grace was Kate Hudson's believable and tossed-to-and-fro journalist Andie Anderson.  She was darling enough to make up for McConaughey's looks over talent casting misstep.  The supporting cast's performances, I thought, were ghastly (especially the two nasty Judys and Ben's friends at times).  It was worth watching once, I suppose, but in the end, another weakish chick-flick.  One chick-flick that came out recently that I recommend far more is Two Weeks Notice (which provided far more than a standard formulaic chick-flick)."

I wouldn't say though that the acting was superb, but it was descent.  I'm not used to seeing Mathew McMonaughey in a romantic comedy.  The last movie I saw with him in it was `A Time to Kill'.  And in that movie he was co starring beside Samuel L. Jackson, who hasn't been in too many chick flicks if you know what I'm saying.  I was surprised in what a good job he did in this romantic comedy, he held his own nicely beside Kate Hudson who is an excellent actor who can obviously play many different roles (Almost Famous).  I'm glad they made this movie more into a comedy than into a sappy chick flick, I know I would have fallen asleep in the theater if it was unbearably sappy.  I thought the movie had many comedic parts and which had girlfriend and I laughing hysterically in our seats.  All in all, it was a good pick by my significant other and I gave the movie a 7/10.

This is the only reason I can think of that would make so many people find such a mediocre movie, ""wonderful"" and ""hilarious"".<br/><br/>
Now, I'm not saying that all movies have to be considered classics to be good.  I like many genres of films.  I just think that people are becoming so used to films the likes of Old School, Dumb and Dumberer, and Daredevil, that they are starting to think that movies like my Big Fat Greek Wedding and How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days are ""masterpieces worthy of an Oscar"", when they really are just mediocre."

","I hesitated on seeing this movie because of the title alone. In reality, it doesn't take ten days. Try ten minutes. And after ten minutes you know you'll get a another formalic comedic/love/drama chick flick recycled with a new lead actress (in this case Kate Hudson)and a predictable ending. We've already witnessed Matthew in this genre, so have we seen anything different? No.<br/><br/>On the positive, I did enjoy watching this movie simply for the entertainment, and to give Kate another chance. I had only seen Ms. Hudson in Four Feathers and thought she didn't do anything special with her role. But she lit the screen in this film. Like her mother, she has a flare for comedic talent and can carry a lead role pretty well. I hope she doesn't get a boob job either.<br/><br/>The problem I find with this film is the cliches. All the characters are high maintenance, shallow, and superficial. Its ideal but not attained by all. The whole time I was thinking the audiences reaction if the characters were working class people who didn't live in New York or LA but say Ohio or Houston. Not a poor girl falling in love and marrying a rich guy either. People with problems. People on Xanex. People in debt and getting calls by the credit folks every other day.Not every guy knows how to cook, be patient, and be as polished and well groomed like Matthew's character. Lets just say people who aren't as privileged and advanced as these hollow characters. <br/><br/>Let me also add that its a bit sexist. Why do the views always have to be one-sided? Women always trying to get a man. Trying to impress. Playing games. What about the truth of what makes guys tick and what women allow. And for that matter, if you really wanted to know what it took, learn to operate under discernment cause you may want to lose that guy in ten seconds."

In the act of defining the quality of the GENRE of a film, you are limiting your potential to enjoy diversity.  On a personal level, I can only watch one movie like the Pianist and About Schmidt in a given week, before I find MY attention span beginning to wander (yawn).  Variety is the spice of life. It may be a cliche, but I think you'll find that cliche's become cliche's because they carry a kernel of wisdom.<br/><br/>This 'chick flick' has a unique aspect of appealing very much to the men as well.

Andie McDowell managed a pretty good career taking similar roles, and without much acting ability, but she had a great nose for a script (or else the best agent in Hollywood).  Hudson, on the other hand, stumbled into one big winner, which she managed not to ruin, and has since been dead weight in sinking ships. How To Lose A Guy may not be as simply awful as Four Feathers, but it stinks.<br/><br/>Matthew McConnoughey, who is a pretty decent actor, is miserably miscast both as a high-tension Madison Avenue adman -- a part that sits badly with his down-home everyman charm -- and as a fluffy romantic lead.  Bebe Neuwerth is a cartoon.<br/><br/>The inviting premise falls apart after five minutes.  The acting is poor and the script and directing are, if possible, worse.

"Endemonaida","Null","0","0","14 February 2003"," Wanting more, and not getting it
","As a guy (even one who steps outside the lampooned trinity of guns, trucks and aliens) I was eager to see this film.  On so many levels this radiated ""romantic chick-flick"" but the trailers did a great job of selling the immovable object and irresistible force qualities of the characters.<br/><br/>Great premise, great actors.  ""Hey,"" I figure, ""maybe this will be one of those rare chick-flicks that even the men get a laugh out of.""<br/><br/>I think it hit it's mark.  I laughed out loud.  I cringed in all the spots men were supposed to cringe at.  I shook my head in gobsmacked disbelief at the scenes that had the women howling in laughter.  Good movie.<br/><br/>But.  The central premise of writing tight action for your characters is to ratchet up the tension and not give them an easy out.  Herein lies the problem.<br/><br/>QUASI SPOILER BELOW!!<br/><br/>The situation the characters were in was a toughie.  It appeared even the film's creators could not figure a way to get these two type-A personalities to forgive and forget.  The climax was fair, but our boy Matthew never actually seems in danger of losing the big advertising account and dear Kate doesn't have to dump him to get her article.  After their climactic argument and inevitable split, all it takes to repair the damage is for one of them to say ""Hey, I think you should stay.""  ""Ok.""  And that's it.  It wouldn't be a romantic comedy if they *didn't* get back to together, but it should be under more convincing conditions than just having a couple days off to sit back and relax, shouldn't it?<br/><br/>Shouldn't it?<br/><br/>The film 7/10.  Final five minutes:  3/10<br/><br/>One final note:  ladies, the moral of this story is not that acting as mean and evil as possible will still earn you the love of the man you want if he's worth it.  Please don't act as irritating as my wife did after this was over.  She thought the lesson was that the teeth-grating guy-losing behaviour ""was cute."""

","After dragging my wife to see LOTR (both of them), she was quite adamant that I ""owed"" her a chick flick.  So I took her to see ""How To Lose..."". Matthew McConaughey is her ""honey"", and I figured I could stand to look at Kate Hudson for two hours, so it was worth the risk.<br/><br/>I was quite pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable the movie turned out to be.  Easy to predict, perhaps not very original in plot, but the chemistry between McConaughey and Hudson was really nice.  Hudson in particular showed some great comedic talent, far surpassing her mother at the same stage in her career.<br/><br/>What made the movie for me, though, was the ""Bull****"" scene with ""Ben's"" parents.  I really had to laugh... that game was a favorite of my parent's, and we used to play all the time.  Seeing it in the movie, and the underlying meaning of it in the whole movie, was nice.<br/><br/>8 out of 10... would have been higher but Ben's two friends really bugged me, as did the friend of Andie's whose relationship problems started the whole thing rolling.

","Not a big fan of click flicks, but this one had some elements in it that I thought were noteworthy.  Firstly, Matthew's character.  His family isn't disgusting or one that you would hate to be in.  The friendly card games they play remind me of how my family spirit is.<br/><br/>Secondly, it's a classic match up of two people going after the same but opposite goals.  How is that possible?  It reminds me a lot of 'What Women Want' in the effect that it's the guy who's going after the prize this time.<br/><br/>
Lastly, the humor level touches on both women and men levels.  I laughed at a lot of scenes.  It may be a ""chick flick"" or a ""date movie"" but it's to me, a light hearted love-comedy (which is ultimately what I see as the goal).<br/><br/>See this one, but try not to go for more than a cheap early bird if you're tired of the same predictable storylines.

"Agent__Smith","3","0","0","11 February 2003"," More ""chick-flick"" than date movie...
","I got dragged to this one by my better half and -- what a yawner! First of all, this is THE ""chick flick"" of all ""chick flicks."" I read a poster for this movie somewhere which had a tagline stating something to the effect that it was a ""chick flick for guys."" What a load of crap! Although this film boasts two stars, a guy (McCaughnahey) and a girl (Hudson), approximately 85 percent of the story is told from the perspective of the girl. Now, normally, I wouldn't mind sitting through one of these rom-coms as long as I enjoy watching the female lead. But as much as I liked Hudson's multi-dimentional performance in ""Almost Famous,"" she's stiff as cardboard in this one -- although, luckily I don't mean that in a physical sense. In fact, guys, perhaps the best part of this movie is the dress she wears in the next-to-last scene (the one in the movie poster) -- there's lots of ""moving parts"" to that dress, if you know what I mean. *wink* Another thing -- this is a technical point -- what's with all the ""twos"" in this flick? McCaughnahey has two best friends giving him advice, Hudson has two best friends giving her advice, and the plot's main antagonists -- are TWO FEMALE sales reps. What is this, was SAG giving out a two-for-one deal to the casting director? All these characters only serve to unnecessarily complicate the dialogue and flow of the movie. Finally, I'm not so shallow as to paint all rom-coms with the same brush -- there are some good ones out there if you look hard enough -- but this one is slow-moving, and LONG, coming in at 2 hours and 15 minutes! I mean, what is this, Lawrence of Arabia? Sheesh! In fact you could easily cut 30 minutes from this film and it might be just long enough. (I should note that I NEVER complain about the length of movies...usually.)<br/><br/>So, guys, don't say I didn't warn you! If your female counterpart is pressuring you to see a chick flick this weekend, steer her to ANY of the other nameless rom-coms out there -- by all means necessary! Save yourselves...it's too late for me...<br/><br/>Rating - Only 2.5 out of 10."

Kate Hudson is an exceptional actress with great comedic timing as she volleys great one liners off McConnaughey's character.<br/><br/>
I loved this movie for what it is...an hour and fifty minutes of laughing till it hurt and crying because you can't laugh anymore.  The general idea of the film: a writer, played by Hudson, has the wonderful idea to write a column about how women ruin relationships by doing things that we all do at one point or another.  She says she can get a guy to dump her in ten days. At the same time, an advertising representative, played by McConnaughey, takes a bet with his fellow employees that he can get a woman to fall in love with him in ten days.  The rest of the film is the two main characters doing their best to win their respective bets and ultimately failing miserably in the end, when they eventually fall in love.<br/><br/>Don't go expecting to see an Oscar winning film about love and relationships.

Matthew M. does exactly the same performance as he did in the Wedding Planner (which though after I first watched it I gave it a favorable review here, I now can't stand). Kate Hudson is charming as ever, but definitely not as good as she was in Almost Famous (for which she should have gotten an oscar). After the movie was over I turned to my brother, and told him to never take me to another romantic comedy again. Just rent any romantic comedy if you want to see this movie, it is much cheaper.

","Romantic comedies and other chick-flicks are rather predictable, we always know the two stars are guaranteed to hook up--it's the process that everyone enjoys.  Early front runner of the genre such as Sleepless in Seattle was great but since then there has been too many drivel copies.  How to Lose a Guy avoids being one by it's unique take.  The end gets a tad predictable but we still get the fuzzy conclusion.  Watching them get to the end is fun and many of the jokes about what women do to lose guys had the test screening roaring.

ITS NOT!!! matt does the same thing. he wants his boss to use a certain slogan he thought of, and somehow they get into the topic of if he can make a girl fall in love with him after 10 days (by these two bitchy womens help) they pick kate! then it just kind of goes from there... kate drives him crazy trying to get rid of him and matt has to try his best to deal with her and get her to fall in love with him... anyway, while it is sort of like ""shes all that"" or one of those ""bet movies"", theres a twist... and though it is kind of predictable, thats not the point. the point isnt the end, the point is the middle--which makes you smile."

","That's not to say it's great, but it is to say that not only is it much better than I was expecting -- a friend had to talk me into seeing it -- it's quite good.  The clichéd parts are kept to a minimum (although their presence in an otherwise good movie makes them that much more glaring). Both leads perform the rom-com cute/serious balancing act well.  Not a classic by any means, but more entertaining than most of the others in the same class, certainly by modern standards."

","This movie was predictable - which is predictable in and of itself given that its a romantic/comedy. I was disappointed though because its such a great premise that with just a smidge more creativity could have been a helluva lot funnier. I felt like it went for the easy laughs and the plotline was just too ridiculous to swallow. Basically - I love Kate Hudson and will go to see any movie she is in (unless she makes too many of these!) but I was disappointed that a potentially hysterical subject was dragged through the hollywood, canned-humor mud. Of course, the rest of the theater was laughing hysterically at every lame joke, but thats what mass humor is all about I guess."

","How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a sweet, funny but admittedly predictable romantic comedy. It's not supposed to be a serious movie, and that's the beauty of it. Matthew McConaughey is quite handsome, and while not perhaps the world's greatest actor, he's good in this role. But Kate Hudson is absolutely stunning. She's radiant and beautiful, just like her mom Goldie Hawn was at her age. She brings this movie so much spice and liveliness, it's hard to imagine anyone but her in the role--Gwynnie's got nothing on her! Bottom line, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is a humorous, cute romantic comedy with a delightful star, and another nice one."

","***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This movie is your basic romantic comedy storyline that has been done over and over again. It's the simple guy makes a bet that he can get the girl to fall in love with him so he can get a promotion, while girl does everything to turn a guy away in 10 days for her ""how to"" column. Guess what, they fall in love and a big fight breaks out (while trying to sing a duet...which is not funny at all), but she does the right thing by changing her article to a story about how ""he's the only guy she's ever fallen for"", blah blah blah. Anyways this movie is pretty bad, and here's why. The couple of Mc Conaughey and Hudson doesn't work that well (you have to have this to have a good romantic comedy). It's not particularly bad, but you see as acting not very believeable. Everytime I see Kate Hudson, I'm thinking this girl looks like she's 12.  Also this movie portrays men as very ignorant, and easy to manipulate.Every guy in this movie is mindless and easily swayed by a woman. True maybe, but I don't know any movies where anything like that is implied about women.The story is generally boring and drags on, and drags on.There isn't anything you haven't seen before.As far as the good things, (and they are few) I must start with Adam Goldberg and Thomas Lennon. I am huge fans of both, and they have some good one liners as Mc Conaughey's friends that do just enough to keep you awake. Shalom Harlow, enough said.Also some of the stuff Kate Hudson does is pretty funny (especially the Celine Dion concert and family album), but any real guy would have sent her packing if not before then, by then for sure. Kate Husdon was ok (I'm not a fan at all), I mean I was expecting horrible, but she had moments. None of this quite saves the movie, however.<br/><br/>Anyway, I did take one thing away from this movie. How long will women shell out 8 bucks to see the same stories over and over again, with two different leads. Well I guess as long as they do, people will write the same screenplays and keep getting rich."

","Was this movie entertaining? Yes. Did everything work? Yes. And perhaps that's the problem with it. The fact that we don't see anything the matter with it's principles, its presuppositions on which it builds in order to make us laugh and feel. These people are living ""the good life,"" wouldn't you say? A young, healthy advertising agent and a columnist in the fabulous New York City. They make two simultaneous immoral, crusty bets and don't suffer for it. Instead, it is presented as a comedy. I laughed too.

"Cedric_Catsuits","3","2","5","7 May 2006"," Hard to hate
","I really thought I was going to hate this, and I tried hard to - unsuccessfully. The problem is the characters are so obnoxious you feel bad things should be happening to them. Instead it develops into a slushy, happy romance. McConaughey comes across as utterly arrogant and self-centred - impossible to like. Hudson just cannot convince as the manipulative columnist, or as a glamour girl. I loved her in 'Almost Famous', where her 'Penny Lane' was one of the most memorable characters of any movie I've ever seen. But I can't help feeling this needed a more extrovert player - someone like Brittany Murphy perhaps, who can tell a story just through facial expressions! Unfortunately I found myself being drawn into - and gradually developing an affection for this story. I still think it could have been done better, but after all's said and done I was quite impressed. Hudson definitely looks better - and more convincing - with curls and 'hippy' styling, so I'll forgive the occasional straight-hair and glamour relapses here. McConaughey however, always comes across as a bit too cocky to be likable, despite his accomplished performance.<br/><br/>The 'hard-to-like' feeling spreads through the supporting cast, with a host of unpleasant characters on show. The overall, uncomfortable effect is to repel the viewer, which can't be good! Yet somehow it doesn't seem to matter. Maybe it's Hudson's ability to light up the screen with her big smile and golden hair, or maybe it's just very clever directing. There are a few touching moments, even with McConaughey's character - maybe just enough to tip the scales in their favour.<br/><br/>I still can't quite make up my mind about this. The characters are all shallow, egotistical, and aloof. Yet I don't hate them as much as I feel I should. I won't be rushing to see it again, but I wouldn't avoid it if it were on TV. I do want to see more of Hudson and McConaughey, but in roles that exploit their strengths not their weaknesses. I'd definitely say give this film a go, but if you haven't seen it already, watch Hudson in 'Almost Famous' afterwards to see what sh'e really capable of."

After hearing of the latest dating laments of her relationship-challenged friend Michelle, Andie sells Lana on the idea of writing a piece on the things women do to alienate the men they love, which she'll demonstrate by winning and then driving away a man in a mere ten days. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ben (McConaughey) is an advertising man who wants to land a prestige diamond account at his firm. Ben is competing with his pals, Spears and Green, for the assignment, so Ben tells his boss Phillip Warren that he's the man for the job because he understands the fair sex so well he can make any woman fall for him in less than two weeks. <br/><br/>As fate would have it, Andie and Ben end up choosing one another for their mutual assignments, with neither knowing about each other's secret agenda as Ben strives to hold on to Andie while she does everything in her power to annoy him.<br/><br/>The bad thing about this movie is that it is far from realistic.Both Ben and Andie tried to be awful with one another and yet they fall for each other.Why?What's the reason for them to fall for each other when they were certainly creeps with one another for most part - 100 minutes - of the film? The only reason I could think of is the requirements of the plot especially for a chick flick and a romantic comedy at that.<br/><br/>Also,the premise looks good on the screenplay but it was poorly executed in the movie as it looks absolutely implausible.Also,there was an apparent lack of chemistry between the lead stars - Hudson and McConaughey.The only good thing about them is that they are pleasing to the eye and good to look at in the entire movie.<br/><br/>And most of all,it relied heavily on clichés and contrivances that are preeminent on romantic comedies.It should have relied on jokes and laughs for it to be more effective instead of the reason stated in the previous sentence.<br/><br/>Finally,the game of ""Bullsh*t"" was played towards the end of the movie.Instead of that crude humor being used for them to get together,the writers should have been a little more creative than that.The conclusion just looked empty and fabricated in the end."

There, she writes a monthly column of ""how-to"", that is, how to talk your way out of a traffic ticket, how to feng shui your digs. But, she'd rather be writing on world hunger or something else equally important. One day, Andie helps a co-hort, with a recent broken heart, stop crying and make it to work on time. At the ensuing staff meeting, Andie's boss (Bebe Neuwirth) asks Andie about her next column. Having no concrete ideas, Andie decides to take up her fellow worker's dilemma that, perhaps, she drove her boyfriend away. How about a column called ""How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days""? Andie will pick out a nice guy and then drive him crazy, causing him to drop her like a stone. The boss lady likes, yes indeed. Later, at a couples bar, Andie sets her eyes on ad agent Ben (Matthew McConaghay). But, unknown to her, he has just taken a bet from his staff that he can make any woman fall for him in a week's time. As they draw each other in, the stage is set for an epic battle of affection between Andie and Ben. Who will win? This is a very cute movie with great-looking stars in Kate and Matthew. Supporting them is a nice cast, also, including a most funny combination of Adam Goldberg and Thomas Lennon as Ben's best friends. Lennon, especially, is a most underrated performer, for his dry wit is terrific and steals scenes easily. Neuwirth is always a hoot, too, with Robert Klein on hand to please the audience as well. As for the costumes, they are especially lovely, and the NY setting, production values, script, and direction are above average, also. In short, if you love comedic tales of love, get this one soon and lose yourself in its winning story of a loving competition of the sexes."

","Considering I watched this straight after 'A Cinderella Story', some of my opinions may be slightly biased, but I'll continue none the less.<br/><br/>From the outset, this film is obviously based at a more mature audience. The characters are more complex, as is the writing and comedy.<br/><br/>Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughy fill the leading roles perfectly. Their characters are three dimensional and well observed, and are both performed with honesty, and brilliant comic timing. Even away from the humour, dramatic scenes surprisingly pack a punch. It is the relationship between the actors on which the whole film rests.<br/><br/>Supporting characters, such as Michelle and Jeanie, and Tony and Thayer, add a real level of comedy that I thoroughly enjoyed, and lent a 'Boys Vs Girl' mentality early on. In general, the acting was very good indeed.<br/><br/>The writing was brilliant, as was Donald Petrie's directing, which kept the film going along at a great pace.<br/><br/>Once the credits rolled, I couldn't help but feel I had really enjoyed the film.

Hollywood has churned out yet another boilerplate romance comedy with the leads playing their usual charming, but secretly altruistic (at least a secret to each other) characters who make a wager with friends that they, the self-appointed Casanovas, will be able to lure the other into a false relationship and get what they want out of it. And oh! What a coincidence, they actually wind up finding out that they're perfect together and fall in love, immediately torn apart when each discovers the other's initially fraudulent motives, before dismissing that for the sake of their love for each other. **Yawn!**<br/><br/>Unfortunate for the viewers, not only does Hollywood (who keeps scratching their heads at plummeting box office figures) never get tired of making these movies (which do date back to the cinematic age of our grandparents who might've only enjoyed it then for the sake of the novelty of seeing movies), they also never add much of anything new.

"cherold","5","1","2","1 June 2004"," Half quite good, half truly awful
","This movie is based on a book you can read in about 15 minutes that is simply a funny list of things women can do to alienate guys.  That's not a lot to base a movie on, and I thought the movie's central idea - a woman writing an article on how to lose a guy dating a man with a bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him - was fairly clever, although more clever in the telling than the execution.  <br/><br/>The first half hour of this movie is quite dull, as the wheels are awkwardly set in motion.  Then the movie becomes very funny as Andie drags Benjamin to a Chick Flick marathon and destroys his poker game.  The getting-a-woman-to-fall-for-a-guy part is pretty much dropped; it seems to have just been there to give a reason for a guy to stay with a psycho chick other than the usual reason: sex.  <br/><br/>The movie is funny for a good hour, until the movie decides it has to resolve its clunky set up.  The last half hour is truly, utterly painful: the ""You're So Vain"" is possibly the most poorly conceived and badly executed thing to ever appear in any romantic movie in the last hundred years.  <br/><br/>While most of the movie's failings can be laid at the feet of the writers and directors, it should be noted that, for all their efforts, Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey fail to manage anything more than a sort of lukewarm chemistry.  Which would be fine in another sort of movie, but in something that wants to be a sparkling romantic comedy, chemistry is key.  Because an absurd romance only makes sense if the principals seem perfect together, which they don't.<br/><br/>I would probably give the funny hour of this movie a 7, and the bad part a 2.  I'll give the overall effect a 5/10."

","While I usually enjoy romance comedies and would consider movies such as `Sleepless In Seattle' and `You've Got Mail' to be among the best movies that I have seen, I have noticed that they seem to have deteriorated recently in terms of both the acting and the storyline. `How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days' would probably have to rank as the worst movie in any genre that I have seen for a significant period of time.<br/><br/>For a good romance movie/comedy to succeed it needs a good script, a good storyline (which even if predictable still contains enough substance to keep the viewer engaged), chemistry between the main actors, a strong supporting cast and flowing dialogue. It also has to make you laugh and make you feel good. In some cases the presence of one of the above features is so strong that it cancels out the lack of the other characteristics and makes the movie a success regardless. The problem with `How to Lose A Guy In 10 Days' is that it lacks all of the above characteristics.<br/><br/>The storyline contained in this movie is not only exceedingly predictable but contains all the clichéd characters and twists that have been recycled time and time again in romance movies and novels. There is nothing new to keep the viewer engaged you can predict almost every minute of the movie as it unfolds. You can see the ending from the beginning and there are no surprises.<br/><br/>The script writing is equally bad. The character development is unrealistic and weak, the dialogue clichéd and stilted, the jokes very unfunny and needlessly crude and everything down to the costumes and scenery is out of place in the movie. The only thing going for this movie is the music and even then it is quite often much too high quality for such a weak film.<br/><br/>
It is still possible that all this could have been offset by excellent acting by both the main players and the supporting cast. And I'll give Matthew McConaughey credit he does give a star performance and provides his character with a considerable amount of depth and believability despite the bad script and weak dialogue. The rest of acting, however, is of a poor quality (this most probably is not the fault of the actors but rather of the script) and makes the movie even more painful to watch.  It's hard to feel any degree of sympathy or empathy for anyone in the movie which goes against the whole idea of these types of movies and quite frankly the acting and the characters in the movie were downright annoying and made me want to turn off within about ten seconds of beginning to watch the movie.<br/><br/>This is a poor attempt at a movie in this genre and is exceedingly boring, weak, predictable and lame. Out of a rating of 10, I would give it a -5 and it's only that high because Matthew McConaughey's acting rescues the film from being a total disaster and nightmare"
"FeverDog","3","1","2","23 April 2004"," FUNNY ABOUT LOVE V2.0
","HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS threw out all credibility when it was revealed that Kate Hudson has a Masters from Columbia.  Granted, suspension of disbelief is required throughout the movie's interminable two hour running time, but, please, Hudson looks and acts way too young to make this believable.<br/><br/>And the details of her job are both unethical and (to quote the script's recurring expletive) bullsh*t.  It's common knowledge that Cosmo articles about men are routinely written by men and are therefore predicated on a lie.  There's nothing stopping Kate from fudging the details in her piece or even making up the entire story.  She could have simply written one thing and done another, sparing the viewer the string of clichés that the movie hangs from.  We've seen other movies.  We know they're gonna find each other out, and break up, and miss each other, and one is gonna move away and be pursued by the other, and they're gonna kiss and make up, and the credits will roll.  Why the obvious takes so long to happen I don't know.  Two hours of this creepy story?  Agony.<br/><br/>This is billed as a comedy, but the motivations of these two dullards stretch beyond credulity.  We're supposed to believe these two college-educated urbanites are so blind to the ways of the world that neither can intuit that something strange is going on between them.  That their oh-so-shocked reactions when the jig is up don't reek of hypocrisy. That two high-profile New York companies encourage petty bets for the benefit of their bottom lines.  That two yuppies-to-be are so cynical to go through with their bets but so idealistic to really fall in love after a week and a half of mind games.  Whatever.  Like the equally clueless and annoying couple in FUNNY ABOUT LOVE, perhaps these two dimwits belong together, if just to spare other New Yorkers their stunted mental capacities.<br/><br/>There's only one scene that works:  The afternoon at Matthew's parent's home.  No lies, or psychotic behavior, or general stupidity.  (I could have done without the farting uncle, though.)  The screenwriters should have dumped all the crap before and after this scene and constructed an interesting courtship between these two and simply allow their relationship to develop with some semblance of reality.  Instead, we get dogs peeing on pool tables and a truly embarrassing singing duet with Marvin Hamlisch on piano.  (I wonder how Carly Simon felt when she realized how bad ""You're So Vain"" was disgraced?)<br/><br/>So, we have one believable scene between the two stars, and a couple nice shots of Matt's waxed chest.  And I enjoyed seeing Matt and Adam Goldberg together again after DAZED AND CONFUSED.  And I'm pleased that Lieutenant Dangle from ""Reno 911"" is getting some big-screen work.  But that's about it for the plusses.<br/><br/>Other things I questioned:  How did a low-level Cosmo girl score tickets to the NBA finals?  How does Matt get into Kate's office when she, in an earlier scene, had to swipe an ID card to enter the building?  And a cab pulls over to a construction site?  On a bridge?  In the middle of the day? And there's not a huge traffic jam?  And the cabbie is a native New Yorker? Who speaks clear English?  And a NYC rep house is running SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE and MYSTIC PIZZA?  Uh huh.<br/><br/>So we've got a movie with only a tenuous connection to any known reality, featuring characters who are supposed to be smart but display little intelligence, in a script with numerous scenes cribbed from countless other movies.  And this latest example of Hollywood idiocy grossed over $100M. Go figure.  Why?  What American female can possibly relate to anything depicted in this movie?  I believe that SECRETARY, despite its kinkiness, is an infinitely more honest, funny, and revealing portrait of the modern mating dance.  Why audiences settle for such superficial chick flicks like this one, I don't understand."

","The last romantic comedy I remember Matthew McConaughey was in was the Wedding Planner with J-LO. That one was not very good because J-Lo and he had no chemistry and were boring together. This movie is different. Kate Hudson and him look so cute together, it's believable that they would fall for each other, but of course not in just 10 days.  I found a lot of things funny in this movie. MM has a bet to make KH fall for him while she is writing a story about how to get a guy to dump you.  She starts acting needy and clingy and that is when it gets good because any guy would dump a girl like that after 2 dates, but he can't because he needs to win the bet.  She brings over a love  fern, gets an ugly dog, brings over her bathroom stuff, and the  best part was when she brings over an album with pictures of their ""wedding and kids"".  The look on MM face was priceless.  Also this movie knows how to get a laugh out of the name Princess Sofie.  The ending is so predictable, but with these type of movies, does it ever end any other way?<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:  I thought it was good and recommend it as your next chick flick to watch."

","First of all, I would have been a fool to expect anything more than crap from this movie, but I watched it anyway...because that's what good boyfriends do. But unlike some of the romance comedy tripe I've been exposed to, this one failed at every possible opportunity to redeem itself from total crapdom.<br/><br/>First of all, how am I supposed to believe that Kate Hudson's character is really interested in political journalism AND enviromental issues AND this AND that AND the other stuff she claims to want to write about in the movie? Here's a bright, young journalist who has already made the worst career move in her lifetime by joining the staff of a dippy women's magazine, whose subject matter doesn't interest her in the least.  Ooops. THEN, she comes up with this great idea to do research on relationships by doing ""all the classic things that girls do wrong.""  Well, I've never been in a relationship where the woman was even close to being as psycho as Kate Hudson acts throughout the film...but maybe that's because I'm still young. Apparently ""all the classic things"" includes buying an ugly dog, giving her boyfriend's member a female name (?!) and otherwise being a complete socio- Nazi.  Classic, dude. The film culminates in a god-awful karaoke battle (which is actually one of the good parts), but dang, it wouldn't be a date movie if the couple didn't have a fight, go home, get all sad, suddenly decide they love each other and then start making out while some crappy song swells (to make certain that the audience can identify this scene as emotionally important, you see). My friends, this is why divorces happen."

"sddavis63","6","1","2","10 August 2003"," Predictable With A Few Laughs Throw In Along The Way
","I had heard good things about this movie. ""Hilarious,"" I was told. Well, not quite. It has a few chuckles along the way but for the most part I thought this was a pretty routine account of two people having to overcome obstacles to fall in love, etc., etc. Nothing really unique in the premise, in other words. Kate Hudson plays ""Andie,"" a woman's magazine columnist who is writing a column about the mistakes women make in dating and is getting her material by picking out a guy, getting him to fall for her and then making all the mistakes to drive him away. Unknown to her, though, the guy she meets - ""Ben,"" played by Matthew McConaughey - also has an agenda. He's an ad executive who makes a bet that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days, and if he does, he gains a huge advertising contract. (Is it believable that an ad agency of any credibility would assign a contract that way?) So you have Ben and Andie working at cross-purposes. She's falling for him but has to drive him away; he's being driven nuts by her but can't let her go. And so it goes.<br/><br/>It is amusing at times (sometimes downright funny, in fact.) But the whole premise of two people lying to each other had a rather nasty, mean-spirited feeling to it, which really comes out at the party when everything is discovered. Surprisingly, I found it a little bit dark as comedies go and just wasn't able to let myself enjoy it perhaps as much as some others have. That having been said, Hudson and McConaughey were absolutely perfectly cast for their roles. They were believable, and there was a real chemistry between the two of them which gave the movie a more realistic feel. But it really didn't leap out at me as I know it has some others. And with an ending that you see coming before you even start watching the movie (is there anyone who doesn't know how these funny romantic movies are going to turn out?) there really isn't any fun in the end; the only fun is the road you take to get there and that, I thought, had a few potholes along the way.<br/><br/>Largely on the strength of Hudson and McConaughey, this movie gets a 6/10."
"senortuffy","6","1","2","20 July 2003"," How to lose an audience .......
","I'm sure you know the basic premise of this movie:  girl gets assignment to write an article on how to lose a guy in ten days, guy takes a bet that he can make any woman fall in love with him in ten days.  Nice setup.  So, why aren't I laughing?<br/><br/>This is a classic battle of the sexes, mistaken identity comedy, the kind audiences have been entertained by for centuries.  I kept thinking this was a 60's movie, that Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant or even Doris Day and Rock Hudson would have taken the premise and made into a classic out of it.  Was it just the actors?<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey is a very handsome man, but he's not a very good actor. He delivers his lines in a steady monotone, as he does in pretty much every movie I've ever seen him in.  There's no inflection in his voice, and he doesn't know how to milk a scene, which is necessary in comedy.  He may be eye candy for the ladies, but the movie flatlines every time he's on the screen.<br/><br/>Kate Hudson is a pretty good actress - you can really see her mother's influnce on her comedy skills in this movie - but she can't carry this film. For one, her character lacks a foil to work off of - McConaughey is much too serious.  Plus the script has her being a bit too obnoxious for my liking.  There's a nasty edge to the plot to dump her guy, and that just doesn't work in a comedy.<br/><br/>If this were a 60's movie, you'd have an entire ensemble of comedians playing secondary roles, like Paul Lynde or Thelma Diamond, to keep the laughter going.  But here, the supporting cast draws a blank.  Hudson's boss at the magazine should have been played for humor, but instead she's mean-spirited and controlling.  The two female rivals at McConaughey's advertising firm are conniving and hard.  The only bit players who understand this is a comedy are Robert Klein and Liliane Montevecchi (the jeweler's wife).<br/><br/>As a love story, it doesn't really work either because you're left wondering at the final scene where they reconcile on the Brooklyn Bridge whether these two really know each other.  I mean, they've been role playing the entire movie, and except for a brief moment at his parent's house, they really never let their guards down.  They look good together, and I guess in this modern era of movie making, that's supposed to be enough.<br/><br/>Mildly entertaining and funny at times, but you'd have to consider this movie a failure."

I saw this movie on a date and about fifteen minutes into it I realized that I was going to be stuck for another hour or so in one of the more painful situations in my life.  My mind naturally wandered (as it was not occupied by the screen) as to what would be the better way to kill myself without leaving my seat:  hammer a nail through my forehead or drill a screw through my temple with a Black and Decker.  I decided that the power tool would be the way to go.  Unfortunately the movie was still playing when I arrived at this epiphany and my attention was diverted back to the atrocities on the screen.  Basically these were very shallow, annoying people doing very shallow, annoying things.

But as a Saturday night low-brainer you could do a lot worse. Gorgeous bubbly blonde women's magazine writer gets off with successful advertising hunk. That's the slightly cheesy ending, but you've been entertained thoroughly by the time it gets to the predictable bit, so why not just gulp down the standard fruit-and-ice-cream finale as you move on to the nightclub after the cinema or whatever you're doing next. The bubbly blonde is Kate Hudson (from Almost Famous) and the hunk is Matthew McConaughey (from Wedding Planner). Watching her friend and colleague lose every date by doing all the wrong things, she offers to help out by writing a column on all the wrong things to do when dating a guy - things guaranteed to put him off. McConaughey, meanwhile, is pitching for a lucrative deal with a diamonds firm and boasts he can advertise anything, just like he can make 'any woman fall in love with him'. They call his bluff and offer him the contract if he can make any woman fall in love with him by the time of the presentation (his competitors subtly nudging him towards Hudson, who they know is writing the 'How to Get Dumped' article. The two devote themselves to each other for purely financial reasons but (surprise, surprise lol) fall in love anyway.

","Women repeat the phrase `How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days' over and over again as if it's a brilliant concept in the film of the same name directed by Donald Petrie.  Screenwriters Kristen Buckley, Brian Regan, and Burr Steers' unimaginative choice for the title is indicative of their collective writing ability, but one exits the theater wishing they had more appropriately dubbed this comedic disaster `How to Lose an Audience in 10 Minutes.'  The story is expectedly built on clichés, not a criticism as it is inherent to the subject matter and a truth that applies to many films in this genre, but the writers rarely discover creative ways to turn hackneyed ideas into humorous situations.  The dialogue often lacks ingenuity, the scenarios are much too familiar, and the script is nearly void of an honesty that makes people want to believe in predictably trite romantic comedies.	<br/><br/>Headlines that lure women to purchase fashion and beauty magazines fall off the covers and slide across the screen as morning activity ensues at Composure, the fastest growing women's magazine in the country.  Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) finishes a political masterpiece at her computer, and her colleague commends the article but reminds Anderson that she works for a publication that prefers articles about fitness, cosmetic surgery, and shoes.  The clientele just isn't interested in poverty, religion or the environment.  Poor Anderson.  Straight out of Columbia's Graduate School of Journalism with a column of her own and a schedule and salary that affords her plenty of free time both during the day and at night, a 5th Avenue apartment in Manhattan, and extra cash to spend on Knicks playoff tickets. Perhaps taking a more typical beginning journalism job covering the crime beat and town meeting after town meeting would have satisfied her desire to write about things that matter.  The staff meeting at Composure provides a bit of enjoyable light humor and a peek into an exaggerated display of new-age office tactics, but introducing Anderson in this context with her firm agenda in such a flimsy atmosphere is awkward and unbelievable.<br/><br/>Single-life lover Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey), how cute--two A's for Andie and two B's for Ben, accepts a bet offered by his boss and associates at the advertising agency, which pairs him with Anderson.  The couple plunges into a romantic relationship, and both characters conceal their real objective after agreeing that all is fair in love and war.  The conversation that takes Anderson and Barry out of the bar and into the restaurant where they feast on lobster and get to know one another is the first glimpse of a witty and refreshing exchange; enjoy these fleeting moments as they are the exceptions rather than the rule.  Laughable moments do return, however, in full force during late-middle scenes in this nearly two hour film.  The first dinner date at Barry's apartment, the boys' night poker scene, and the couple's therapy session all rescue the drowning viewer from the depths of ennui.<br/><br/>But even these rare moments cannot save How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days. Nevertheless, the film does find some redemption in its two lead actors. Individually, Hudson and McConaughey add spark to dull words and circumstances.  Together they are dynamite, and one laments the fact that they were not endowed with a script that matches their talent.  Hopefully they will reunite at another time--after both actors prove themselves in other roles that better display their abilities.  In this film, though, both performances are expressive, intelligent, and warrant acclaim for adding something laudatory to a film that should have been canned and hidden away forever out of public sight or left on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>One does not learn anything from the `how to girl' in this film except that love ferns die just like relationships if they are not properly nurtured. Diamond companies do not pay advertising companies great sums of money to come up with a slogan like `Frost Yourself'; one can only hope this was a failed parody attempt.  Men do not come back carrying flowers and missing the smell of perfume on pillows to women who are prone to dating faux pas. No man should tolerate ten days of Andie's erratic behavior, and no woman should want a sports-fanatic boyfriend who skips game seven of his team's playoff series to go to a Celine Dion concert.  Andie is annoying but occasionally endearing and the gestures by Barry are valiant, but none if it is real.  Comedy doesn't need to be steeped in reality, but How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days suggests that something needs to resonate with the audience or all is truly lost."

Meanwhile Ben Barry is a slick advertising exec who has just been beaten to a big diamond contract by two female colleagues. He challenges them in front of the client by saying that selling diamonds to women is just like selling love to women and proposes that he make a girl fall in love with him before the sales pitch in 10 days  if he succeeds then he wins the contact. However his colleague Spears spots Anderson and, knowing about her proposed story, points Ben in her direction. So begins a short relationship where Ben tries to win over a woman who is actively trying to push him away.<br/><br/>Early on this film is very forced in how it sets up the actual plot, which is perhaps understandable when you think about how very unlikely the whole thing is. However once it manages to swallow this very big pill, it moves forward with good humour by only focusing on the moment and trading on the charisma of the stars. Of course by doing this it means it never gets beyond the superficial and silly, not a major problem since it is quite fun at times. Of course it is very predictable and anyone who doesn't know where it is going probably hasn't long come out the womb! The predictability of the story does mean that, when it does have to bring the film to a close, it isn't that great and losses the fun of the main body. Fans of clichéd rom-coms will love it because it serves up just what you expect and does it with solid laughs.<br/><br/>The cast are a big plus because the lead two work well together and almost (almost) carry off the near-impossible task of selling their weird character dynamics between them. Neither McConaughey or Hudson are people that I would make much effort to seek out (although the former is OK) but here they work well together and have a nice chemistry and delivery that is funny and convinced me that maybe they did have a spark below all the betting and game playing. Support from Goldberg and Lennon was amusing but underused, while Michele and Harlow make for good turns and eye candy.<br/><br/>Overall this is a predictable and obvious stuff that romcom fans will probably eat up. For the rest of us, it is probably too simplistic and forced but the middle section is fun and maybe even fun enough to get you into in and past the clunky ending that we all knew was coming. Silly fluff but not without some entertainment value."

","""Andie Anderson"" (Kate Hudson) is a journalist for a magazine that basically caters to a female audience. One day while helping her friend overcome a recent breakup she comes up with the idea for an article that focuses on certain mistakes some women make while dating that effectively destroy intimacy. To that end, she proposes to begin dating a complete stranger and in the process use certain tactics which are sure to cause the man to abruptly end their relationship within 10 days-and then write an article detailing everything. However, as luck would have it, she selects a man named ""Ben Barry"" (Matthew McConaughey) who just happens to have a bet with his boss that he can pick up a woman at random and in 10 days have her fall madly in love with him. The end result is that no matter how hard she tries he resists all of her efforts to get him to break up with her. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, despite a decent effort by everyone involved, the film itself ultimately ended up as a routine and predictable rom-com and I have rated it accordingly. Average."
"danielgibbs-69210","6","0","1","6 July 2016"," Just tolerable viewing!
","I'll be honest, when I first started watching this, I wasn't expecting anything too great, or original. The premise doesn't exactly feel logical (woman wants to become a respectable journalist, therefore writes article on deliberately sabotaging a relationship) or natural (mans accepts bet to make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days because...the plot demands it, I guess!), and to be honest, this is the films biggest failing. <br/><br/>Any chemistry between the two leads is completely worthless, because the audience knows the entire thing is a sham. That said, there are a few laughs to be had here, and the adequate performances all round mean this isn't awful viewing by any means. Matthew McConaughey doesn't exactly break any new ground here, playing a smug, well-off everyman, but he does serve as a good foil for Kate Hudson, who delivers a performance that really tests the viewers patience. Yes, I realise the point is to be annoying to try and drive off the guy, but it doesn't exactly make for good viewing!<br/><br/>The supporting cast is what you'd expect, an array of mildly entertaining but decidedly two-dimensional characters whose sole purpose in life is to gravitate around the leads. The film-making and plot of the film are passable, nothing special but nothing awful either. <br/><br/>All in all, I would say this is by no means an awful film, and if it happens to be on and you've no other choice, it's worth wasting a couple of hours on. But it is incredibly average, and let down by a premise which makes you wonder if you even want a happy ending!"

","Despite charismatic leads and some funny situations, the 2003 comedy How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days doesn't really sustain its paper-thin premise for the film's entire running time.<br/><br/>The film stars Kate Hudson as Andie Anderson, a magazine writer who has been assigned to write the title article for her magazine and has chosen one Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) as the objective of demonstrating her article. Unknown to Anderson, Barry has bet co- workers that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days.<br/><br/>his film, based on a pair of books by Michele Alexander and Jeanne Long, just doesn't possess the substance to actually admit to being inspired by two different books. I can't believe that it took 2 books to come up with an uninspired comedy that comes off as a tired retread of the Doris Day Rock Hudson comedies of the 60's.<br/><br/>Donald Petrie's direction is a little on the pedestrian side, but the leads are attractive and there are effective supporting bits offered along the way by Bebe Neuwirth, Robert Klein, Adam Goldberg, Kathryn Hahn, and Celia Weston, but I guess your appreciation of the film depends on how much you love Hudson and McConaughey, whose obvious on screen chemistry just wasn't enough to make this film work."

","This movie has everything a perfect rom-com needs to have : a slim blonde, a sporty man with six packs, an agenda (actually one on both sides) to move the story, the judgement day (the 10th day) to look forward to, some misunderstanding created by the side characters to stir the things up and then, the epilogue (the 11th day) with the car chase scene, final boy-girl confrontation and the last scene with the camera zooming out on a long and deep kiss. Everything in this movie is tried to be made so perfect that its perfection is what kills me. The irritating behavior of the girl increases so much, that 40 min into the movie, my digestive system gives up. I literally had cramps in my stomach. Her insensitiveness increases exponentially upto the three-fourths of the movie, and then suddenly she gives up to the love of the boy, even when there were two more days to the judgment day (thats because the directors need an emotional scene and a bed scene; and both those requirements are fulfilled by that change of heart, even if it not fits in the storyline). How could anyone watch a movie made with a recipé? Too cliché to watch. Recommended to only those who are the fans of either of the leads or like the cliché itself."

","Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) writes fluff for Composure magazine and longs for more substantive articles. She has a work friend Jeannie (Annie Parisse). Her other flustered friend Michelle Rueben (Kathryn Hahn) is the inspiration for a new article for her boss Lana Jong (Bebe Neuwirth) 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'. Benjamin Barry (Matthew McConaughey) is an advertising executive competing with co-workers Judy Spears (Michael Michele) and Judy Green (Shalom Harlow) for the right to pitch the biggest diamond merchant. Spears and Green know about the article. They come up with a contest to have Benjamin seduce Andie in 10 days for the right from their boss Phillip Warren (Robert Klein) to do the pitch.<br/><br/>The problem for this rom-com is that both parties are faking it. It makes it hard to decipher any real chemistry in the relationship. It's not until Andie meets the family does the romance starts. It's a very late start. They are good at their jobs and pull it off. However there is a real need for both of them to sacrifice something to push the romance over the top. The comedy part has some good points. The problem there is that it feels very one directional. It's all about Andie annoying Ben. It would be better if Ben actually had a deeper game. He's very superficial. He needs the girl but it seems like he's just not bringing the whole playbook. He needs to show that he's really trying rather than passively taking it from Andie. It's an attempt at something different than the traditional rom-com but it's not all together successful."

","From director Donald Petrie (Grumpy Old Men, Richie Rich, My Favourite Martian, Miss Congeniality), I had idea of what to expect in this romantic comedy, so I tried it. Basically advertising executive Benjamin 'Ben' Barry (Matthew McConaughey) makes a bet with two female co-workers at the diamond company he works for, that he can make a woman fall in love with him within ten days, and he is thinking of diamond promotion in the process. Fashion magazine journalist Andie Anderson (Kate Hudson) also has a bet on that she can meet a guy, and get rid of him within ten days, and she gets to write about whatever she wants if successful. So Ben is trying to make her love him, and Andie is doing everything possible to get him to dump her. To be honest, I think the one making the most effort is Andie, being the most bitchy, irritating and over emotional girlfriend possible, and Ben is struggling to put up with it for his bet. Of course, eventually they both find out each others bets, and split, with Andie getting to write what she wants, about fashion, which she refuses, and Ben realises she is making a mistake moving away, and of course they love each other, so all is settled in the end. Also starring Adam Goldberg as Tony, Michael Michele as Spears, Shalom Harlow as Green, Bebe Neuwirth as Lana Jong, Robert Klein as Phillip Warren and Kathryn Hahn as Michelle. Hudson does well as the deliberately irritating girlfriend, and McConaughey is alright playing his usual ""Mr. Nice Guy"" character, but I can agree they don't have much chemistry, and it does lose its humour in parts.

But right there is one of the problems. Having been turning herself into an increasingly girlfriend-from-hell character, suddenly Andie blends right in, does not show herself irritating in any way, and proves sharp as a pin in playing the family card game, beating Ben. Doesn't Ben notice the inconsistency? Another that has been noted, that she claims to be a vegetarian after having eaten lobster, is explicable, maybe, in that not all vegetarians avoid fish and seafood, but might at least give him pause for thought. Can't remember what she is shown eating at the family occasion.<br/><br/>And then there are the hackneyed features, especially the chase at the end to catch her before she leaves for ever. And for them each to have two 'best friends' might fit reality but seemed a wearisomely familiar plot device.<br/><br/>So, I have to say, I have seen rom-coms that hung together better and that I therefore remember with greater pleasure."

Yeah, it's a chick flick and the film develops more or less as you'd expect, but as long as you recognize those two factors (not crimes in and of themselves), the dance is fun. It's an entertaining film and I guess disposable candy entertainment, but all the same, both characters remain honest to the objectives their characters have and they handle their feelings for one another in attractive ways. However the film doesn't seem to be manipulating the viewer's feelings which is always a deal-breaker for me. Charisma of Hudson and McConaughey and a clever comedic/romantic hook keep this movie ticking along nicely. I've seen a few rom/coms...never of my own free will....but this one really was not terribly unenjoyable."
"moviaholic","9","0","1","19 July 2005"," A True Romantic Comedy
","Not since Pretty Woman has there been a romantic comedy this good. There are so many movies made that are put in that category. Maybe I am to much of a romantic but there are really so very few movies made that are both romantic and hilarious. I have to say this movie really does it for me. Not only is Matthew the ultimate hottie, but Kate Hudson makes me proud of my small chest. She is so sexy and comfortable with herself. Their chemistry is amazing. The script is great and there comedic talent was exceptional. I hate movies based on lies, where one person lies about being something they are not to win over the other person, and then it starts a horrible cycle, which is the basis of most romantic comedies. But here it is something fresh, they are both out for themselves, not out for love at all and watching it backfire is hilarious. <br/><br/>Andy Anderson (Kate Hudson) is writing an article on How to lose a guy in 10 days and has to date a guy and try to get him to dump her. Benjamin Berry has made a bet with some work mates saying he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. Unfortunately for both of them they end up with each other, and all hell breaks lose because it just isn't as easy as they thought it would be. <br/><br/>Now of course there are a couple of holes in the plot. But honestly there are not that many, and every movie has them. But the truth of the matter is if it had been cast differently it just wouldn't be half as good. They should really only ever make romantic comedies with these two from know on. I mean, Pretty women is romantic and it is funny and there is good chemistry between Julia Roberts and Richard Gere and I love it but neither of them are naturally that funny especially Gere. Kate Hudson has the genes for comedy and McConaughey: well it is surprising how funny he is here. With Kate he is great, with Jennifer Lopez he is not so good. Besides they look great together and they are so nice to look at. I get to drool over Matthew and my husband gets to drool over Kate and everyone is happy."

","Must see a few times to appreciate and get the subtleties. Thoroughly planned and put together in form of a great entertaining plot. Just try to see how many adults aim to pass time and have fun dating while ending in failed relationships. The movie shows how to look deeper into the other person to see if he/she is the right person for you !!! How: by being patient, tolerant, loving and building on positive aspects instead of running away. When all is done it can be a happy experience. Also, it gives you a warning to see if you may be doing something wrong and blame yourself, instead of blaming the other person. When you do that you can start by doing self refining to bring the best in the other guy. JUST TRY TO DO JUST THAT TO BE HAPPY IN RELATIONSHIPS - a subtle lesson learned form the movie. Andy and Ben are just the best for being so natural. Their style is great for under-acting instead of the over-acting as many do. Both will for sure have a great success in future movies."

I believe the opposite sexes can and do act in this fashion, but to have it play out in such a perfect setting with these two 'professional' lovers was a bit overdone. The dialogue was sometimes corny beyond description, and all the scenes where the girl tries to lead the guy got to be a little tedious.

","Bear in mind that I'm not categorically opposed to chick flicks. As far as I'm concerned, ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Titanic"" were watchable movies. But to me, chick flicks are movies that are best watched with a girlfriend. If I'm alone, they are definitely not my cup of [herbal tea] coffee. This movie pretends to be something other than a chick flick, but when it comes right down to it, it's about as predictably chick flick-ish as ""What Women Want.""<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey plays the ambitious and manipulative advertising executive who makes a bet that he can make Kate Hudson [the senior prom queen!] fall in love with him in order to win a diamond advertising account. Kate Hudson plays the ambitious and manipulative reporter whose job it is to snag a guy with charm and sweetness, turn into a psycho hose beast to make the guy dump her, in order to write a story called ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days."" So they manipulate! They scheme! They play charming and sadistic mind games with each other! Neither one of them knows they're being played like a violin! But, get this... they both really have hearts of gold and despite all of their machinations, they fall for each other!!<br/><br/>And I'll bet nobody who watched the movie could've guessed that would happen!<br/><br/>Oh, don't get me wrong, there's a few mildly funny bits, like when Hudson names McConaughey's member ""Princess Sophia."" At which point McConaughey objects that it should be called something more masculine, such as ""Krull the Warrior Barbarian"" or some such thing. But most of the gags just didn't strike me as funny. Yappy dogs that pee on pool tables are not funny, because pool tables are a serious business. (Heh!) Pretending to weep in a restaurant while telling the waitress and other ayngry lookyng womyn that your boyfriend thinks you're fat, when you are obviously built better than a statue of Aphrodite is not funny either. The elderly wife of a diamond executive flirting shamelessly with McConaughey was more yark-inducing than a bottle of ipecac. Maybe a lot of other men or women found this stuff to be hilarious, but I've read funnier installments of Hagar the Horrible in the Sunday Comics section.<br/><br/>The cliches are sprinkled throughout the movie like rice at a wedding. You've probably seen the Scheming Reporter With The Heart of Gold in other movies, such as ""Mr. Deeds"" or ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" among others. And for the love of all that is holy, why does Hollywood keep resurrecting The Bet That Goes Bad plot that should have stayed dead with ""She's All That"" and ""Not Another Teen Movie?!"" I dunno, but these plots are like randy zombies that keep rising from the dead so that they can skull**** you over and over and over again.<br/><br/>Naturally we have the revelatory scene where He Learns She Is Tricking Him, and She Learns He Is Tricking Her. Kate Hudson doesn't exactly get to be prom queen, but she gets to wear an outrageously expensive diamond necklace that reminds you of a scene in ""Pretty Woman."" After they find out they've been tricking each other, they have a duet where they extemporaneously sing accusations at each other that reminds you of a cross between ""Ally McBeal"" and the trash-talking from White Men Can't Jump. Okay, maybe I'm reaching a little too far for my analogies here, but screw it, I'm tired.<br/><br/>And finally there's the obligatory chase scene: ""Oh my God she's moving to Washington, so now he's got to chase her cab on his motorcycle before she gets to the airport to let her know he loves herrrrr!"" Trust me, you've seen this scene played out in a dozen teen and adult romantic comedies, and it's utterly missable here. McConaughey reads Hudson's magazine article ""How To Lose A Guy in 10 Days"" which is so saturated with sugary pathos that it will definitely remind you of Drew Barrymore's newspaper article in ""Never Been Kissed.""<br/><br/>Now you may be thinking ""If you had such a low opinion of this movie, why did you watch it until the end?!"" And I have a great answer. It was because I wanted to see how many times I could catch this movie ripping off another movie. And besides, I felt like an ambitious reporter taking notes at the scene of a really bad plane crash. I really couldn't have cared less whether handsome Matthew and pretty Kate got together or whether they died in a freak accident involving high voltage electric eels. Actually, the latter would have been a more interesting ending. The irony of it all is that the movie beats you over the head that Matthew and Kate are playing a game of 'bull****' with each other by having Kate visit Matthew's parents where they actually play a card game called Bull****! Man, I never would have gotten the message if it weren't for the card game...!<br/><br/>So my final score for this movie is 4 stars out of a best possible 10. And since I  took the time to write all of this up for my blog, I thought I would go ahead and vent my annoyance with this movie on IMDB. You know, as a public service.<br/><br/>I mean, not everybody enjoys a game of Bull**** played this badly.<br/><br/>

"Old Joe","Null","0","1","7 January 2004"," One Of Them Is Lying. So Is The Other. I have heard many negative comments on this movie, but I do not care, cos I liked it
","It has been a long time since I have genuinely laughed at a movie, but I could not contain my laughter when I was watching the 2003 romantic comedy How to lose a guy in 10 days'. This film is a very refreshing romantic comedy, one that helps keep the genre alive and well. The other great part to this film was the cast, lead very well by Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, and thanks to some great casting, the pair have some truly wonderful talent backing them up. I totally agree with Shawn Edwards' opinion on HTLAGITD' from FOX-TV  A fabulously fresh and totally ENTERTAINING BATTLE OF THE SEXES' I could not have put it better myself.<br/><br/>
 As the `How to...' columnist for trendy Composure' Magazine, Andie Anderson agrees to write a first-hand account about what it takes to drive a man out of her lifein exactly 10 days. At the same time, eligible and agency bachelor Benjamin Barry accepts a high stakes bet that he can lure any woman into falling head-over-heals in love with himalso in 10 days. The resulting romantic head-on collision ignites a series of deliriously comic deceptions that prove when it comes to true loveyour heart cannot tell a lie.  <br/><br/>The wonderful screenplay is the most impressive aspect of HTLAGITD'. It was both romantic and funny at the same time, which I am sure must have been hard to get right, but the writers Kirsten Buckley, Brian Regan and Burr Steers got it spot on. I am sure they would have had think long and hard about what is was they wanted to show, but they showed it perfectly. The other aspect I liked about the story was how even it was for both the sexes, women get to see their part, and the men can see theirs. It shows how good a story this film has, when the writers can delicately balance it the way they did. <br/><br/>The director of HTLAGITD was Donald Petrie (from Miss Congeniality). He did a fine job in showing this quite unusual predicament we see our lead characters in. Petrie also gave the movie a very fun feeling, which many romantic comedies can lack. Another good thing about Petrie's direction, are the many wonderful shots we see around New York that he allows us to see. They make the city look very grand and show it to be a fascinating place to live in. This was achieved thanks to cinematographer John Bailey.         <br/><br/>
This takes me to the great cast, which was very very good. Andie Anderson (played by the voluptuous Kate Hudson), was a fun character to see. I cannot remember a movie where I was hypnotised by an actresses look, but Kate had me stunned. Her smile is hard not to like. I love the way she was able to make herself seem like such a dumb blonde, with the many scenarios we see Andie in, just hilarious. The only problem with this character was that she did start to become a bit annoying after a while. <br/><br/>The male character in this film was a man called Ben Barry (Matthew McConaughey), a man all the girls want, and who the guys want to be like. Matt suited his role well, as the man who is very much a male guinea pig'. The situation he finds himself in is very delicate one, as the girl he is with has many different personalities', a line Ben uses in his defense at one stage. McConaughey and Hudson shared a great onscreen chemistry, with one, making the other look even better.   <br/><br/>As I have mentioned the supporting cast for this film was great. Andie's friends include workmates Genie (Anne Parisse) and Michelle (new comedy actress Kathryn Hahn). Hahn has a very funny introduction, as she is the girl that inspires what transpires. Then Michelle plays along with the joke, becoming a some what unorthodox relationship counselor, one of the many funny parts of the film. Another female character I liked was Andie's magazine editor, Lana (Bebe Neuwirth), with real magazine people saying Bebe played her part perfectly.<br/><br/>Ben's friends are just as convincing here. Tony (Adam Goldberg) and Thayer (Thomas Lennon) are just as interested in their friend's plight on his conquest, like everyone else in NY. These guys almost seem joined at the hip. I also like Ben's boss, Phillip (Robert Klein) a man who wants Ben to succeed at his bet. We also get to see Ben's very strange, but unique family, with their favourite word, turning out to be a very queer card game. Ben's family has a strong effect on Andie, and they had the same effect on me as well. <br/><br/>The music of this film was another thing that helped win me over. The soundtrack was composed by the legendary David Newman, and had a great blend of great old tracks like Let's stay together Al Green and You're so vain' by Carly Simons, with a great new song Weight of the World' Performed by Chantal Kreviazuk.<br/><br/>This is a very clever romantic comedy, which shows what disasters can happen when people play around with the strong emotion of love. I am someone who has been a bit of a failure when it comes to dating, but after watching this film, I realise I am not the only person who suffers from the dating blues'. There were many funny in-jokes in this film, that had me in stitches many times and I am sure they will have that affect on you too. HTLAGITD is a good film, and that is no bulls*%t!<br/><br/>CMRS gives How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days': 3.5 (Good - Very Good Film)"

The problem starts when the guy (Matthew) is on an opposite mission -- meet a girl and make her fall in love with him in 10 days so that he can get the plum diamond advertising assignment.<br/><br/>So they begin. Some of the things she does -- make him get her a soda near the end of a Knicks championship playoff game so he misses the final winning shot. Take him to a ""Chick Flick Marathon"", then when he actually is enjoying himself picks a fight for him with the big guy behind them. For dinner at his place she brings a box of stuffed animals and other things to decorate his place for her, then at dinner says, regarding the lambchops, ""I wish I ate meat."" During a seduction she decides to name his ""member"" Princess Sophia, which turns him off. Brought him a dog to his office, and called him ""Bennie Winnie"". Left most of 17 phone messages one day, each a few minutes apart. Made a ""family album"" showing how their kids might look.<br/><br/>The breakthrough came when at a fake therapy session, Andie's friend posing as the therapist suggests they spend a weekend at his family's home. They do, she loves his family, mom hugs her and says ""please don't hurt my boy."" But at the big diamond extravaganza she finds out about the ""bet"", he finds out about the ""article"", and in a great funny scene with Marvin Hamlish they do an impropmtu duet ""You're So Vain"", then spilt up outside.<br/><br/>Later, when he reads her article, he comes to realize how she really feels, and goes to find her. She has quit her job and is headed to D.C., and, in a great little chase scene he rides his Triumph through NYC, splitting lanes, to find her in her cab.

She's obviously just watched all her mums films and tried to copy her mannerisms, sorry Kate your astonishingly annoying and Mathew McConaughey is downright painful to watch. Its a simple film for simpletons.... And so should appeal to white middle America.<br/><br/>I really look forward to the sequel 'How to lose your F'ing Mind in just over 2 hours'"

","Kate Hudson and Matthew McConoughey got the chemistry - and a great script! This movie is soooo funny (and romantic). The fact that Andie and Ben fall for each other despite Andie's attempts to make Ben break up with her and Ben's rather clumsy and desperate attempts to keep their ""relationship"" up, lets me hope! Especially Andie's 10 000 ways to drive Ben crazy are hilarious (family album, plant, baby talk,...). What can I say except: If you don't watch it, you miss out a great movie!"

","* Terrible * * Below Par * * * Not Bad * * * * Good * * * * * Brilliant<br/><br/>WARNING *POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Rom coms are common place these day's.Common place and quite a mixed bag.No sooner have both 'Two weeks notice' and 'Maid in Manhattan' left our local cinema screens then this effort from director Donald Petrie is foisted on unsuspecting movie patrons.It's the story of two young successful New York inhabitees,Ben Barry(Matthew McConaughey)and Andie Anderson(Kate Hudson).Andie who is a columnist for a womans magazine is struggling to come up with a new brilliant article to impress her boss and editor(Bebe Newirth).It's when her clingey pal is dumped by her boyfriend that inspiration hits her.She will find a guy, reel him in, date him and then deliberately make all the mistakes that some woman do that loses them their man.What she discovers will go in to her latest article, 'How to lose a guy in 10 Days'.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ben who is something of a lady's man is struggling to make a deal for himself with a major jewlery company.Two female competitors already have the deal but Ben plans to change all that.To make the deal come through he must convince the company's boss that he could sale himself to any woman.It's with that in mind that Ben makes a bet that he can make any woman he want's fall in love with him.The boss agrees and Ben must accomplish this so he can introduce the young lady to the company boss at a big promotional gala in about ten day's time.He challenges his two female competitors to choose the lucky young lady.Guess who it is the pair decide upon.<br/><br/>'How to Lose a guy in 10 day's' is not as good a movie as it would seem to be.Let's face facts here.The premise it self, while intriuging and slightly original is a bit far fetched.Are we really exspected to believe that Ben would actually fall for Andie.In reality she is a charming, intelligent, attractive woman.But let's face facts.After what she puts him through as her annoying alter ego it's a miracle he ever does.<br/><br/>Both actors give truly likeable and charismatic performances.McConaughey is as charming as ever.Being cocky but never the less endearing as does Kate Hudson who I have never watched before but having watched this hope to do so in the near future.If her performance in this is anything to go by she is as capable an actress as she is a beautiful one.She certainly seems to have inherited her mother Goldie Hawns talent for comedy.Both actors make amazing chemistry together.They are also brilliantly supported by a truly splendid cast of actors that includes Bebe Newirth(Lilith from 'Cheers' and 'Frasier' fame) and Adam Goldberg who you may have seen in 'A Beautiful Mind' and 'Saving Private Ryan'.<br/><br/>Sadly however that does not detract from the fact that this is a movie that is seriously in need of a script doctor.It just feels immensely contrived while the movie's climax where Ben chases after Andie(who after the whole affair has been revealed to the pair of them)who is     leaving for Washington DC. in a taxi cab, just smacks of unoriginality. It's the sort of thing that we have seen in god knows how many Rom Coms in the past few years.Both stars certainly deserved better material to work with here.<br/><br/>If you want to see a decent romantic comedy this year you are better off watching 'Two weeks Notice'.While that movies star's(Hugh Grant & Sandra Bullock)are not the good actors that this movies pairing are it's a good deal better.I can only hope that McConaughey and Hudson both find a future movie that is deserving of their respective talents.<br/><br/>Robs Rating:* *"

","This was your typical run of the mill romantic comedy. I like the genre. In fact, two of my all-time favorite movies were When Harry Met Sally and American President. However, this movie was only average for this genre.<br/><br/>I like Matthew McC. quite a bit. I see no reason he can't star in any light-hearted movie and be a major strength. But, Kate Hudson sucks. Oh, that the movie would have cast a Meg Ryan or Julia Roberts or someone OTHER than Kate Hudson. Despite my wife's strong disagreement, I don't find her attractive or interesting. Part of it was that we were supposed to kind of dislike her character until the end. But, that was a small part of my problem with her. She just sucks and I don't want to ever see a movie with her in it again. I have no idea on this planet why she is popular! Goldie Hawn would have been better in the role - today!<br/><br/>I also found the story weak. I thought the concept was potentially brilliant and certainly peaked my interest. But, the reviews were very so-so. That didn't stop my wife from renting it. And, now I get the last laugh as I write the final chapter on the saga. There are many better romantic comedies. Save yourself the trouble unless you are an insane Matthew McC. fan."

","I'm not a big fan of chick-flicks, but since this was billed as a comedy I decided to watch. Big mistake. My concepts of comedy obviously differ from the scriptwriters by a big margin. If you like cringing in your seat at truly awful dialogue and scenes then I suppose it is funny. But I just found it boring and tedious.<br/><br/>The basic premise that a person would go out with someone only to try and lose them in short order was highly obnoxious. (Yes I know, its a comedy, but I still found this objectionable in the extreme.)<br/><br/>In the end, I only watched the first half. I couldn't stomach any more. It was just too stomach-churningly dire. Plus, the whole story would have been better and more believable with younger (i.e. teen) actors.<br/><br/>I guess this is a ""you either love it or hate it"" movie. No prizes for guessing which camp I'm in."

","It's hard to assess why McConnaughey and Hudson would agree to work in this kind of film project.  It only hints that a career turn to sitcom TV is probably an inevitability for the likes of both of them.  It's hard not to bring up Hollywood nepotism while watching Kate Hudson perform in crap like this, and, as for McConnaughey, he's quickly becoming chick-flick fodder faster than you can say: THE WEDDING PLANNER.  A horror flick."

"puckbond007","6","0","1","14 March 2003"," How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days-6/10 is just another so-so silly romantic comedy
","Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is just another so-so silly romantic comedy that tries to be charming and fun. I have just about hit the wall with these type of films...for the most part they are silly, formulaic, predictable and their only saving grace is maybe two decent leads who have some form of chemistry and maybe the movie is filled with some witty and fun dialogue. I am not a fan of these type of movies, but if you are I'm sure you will enjoy this one too. The lovely Kate Hudson is quite fun and charming as Holly, the ""How to"" girl of Composure Magazine (the fastest growing women's magazine in the country). Call it what you want...its Cosmo, Vogue, Elle etc. a trashy women's magazine about beauty, fashion, cosmetics, health, gossip and realtionships etc. Anyway Holly's newest assignment is to get with a guy and then get him to leave her within 10 days by doing all the annoying things that women do in relationships and guys hate. Matthew McConaughey plays Ben, a hot young advertising executive who pitches sports equipment, alcohol etc. He is gunning for the account of a major diamond company and is competing with two other ladies. They strike up a side bet where Ben must make a woman fall in love with him within 10 days...and if he succeeds he gets the diamond account. Naturally of course the two of them wind up meeting each other in a bar just after the assignment and bets have been made. That is really my major problem with films like these. There has to be some sort of cute, stupid way,to get the two leads together,which of course leads to somebody finding out about a bet at the end and getting mad...only to realize they really are in love. Please! It's enough wih these moronic ""meeting ideas""...what happend to just two people meeting under normal circumstances and things not working out. Anyway as I said Hudson and McConaughey are qute good together, with Hudson doing every imaginable annoying thing to drive a guy away including redecorating his bathroom, keeping him away from sporting events and ruining his guys night poker game and McConughey still never takes the bait. You can figure out the rest fom there. Overall, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days is not a terrible movie by any means...its just another silly romantic comedy that puts two young leads in a silly formulaic plot and has a little fun and not much else."

","Andy (Kate Hudson) is a columnist for a woman's magazine--to cheer up a depressed, jilted girlfriend she proposes an article on getting a guy to love her--and then do everything wrong to get him to dump her in 10 days. Ben (Matthew McConaughey) is an ad executive who wants to do a campaign for diamonds. His boss says no--what does a man know about love and diamonds? Ben says he will get a woman to fall in love with him--in 10 days. Guess what happens.<br/><br/>There are two problems with this movie--the script and McConaughey. The script isn't believable for one second and it has such unpleasant characters--are we supposed to feel sympathetic to Andy and Ben who would stoop to manipulating an innocent person for their jobs? Also it does have some very funny lines but has even more unfunny, labored ones. McConaughey is all wrong for a romantic comedy--he is very handsome and has a great body but he seems very ill at ease with the material. He both overacts and underacts and has no sense of comic timing. And him and Hudson have about as much chemistry as Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis had in ""Top Gun""--meaning no chemistry at all. Their kisses looked painful.<br/><br/>The real reason to see this is Hudson. She's beautiful, bright, energetic and one hell of an actress and comedian. She's absolutely hysterical when she tries to drive McConaughey crazy. Also when begins to fall in love (I don't think I'm giving anything away) she's totally believable.<br/><br/>Worth seeing for Hudson and some great lines. Otherwise--routine."

","In my own opinion, I LOVED this movie. It was funny and very cute.  Kate Hudson did an excellent job.  The thing is, it was a chick flick.  For my own rating, as in what I thought of it, I gave it a 9.  Because it was a chick flick, obviously all of the world wouldn't enjoy it like me.  BUT, for a chick flick, it was awesome and I still think everyone should give it a chance.<br/><br/>Kate Hudson did an awesome job. I Loved her role in the film because you saw two sides of her, which she pulled off really well. One side being herself, and then the other, the girl trying to get rid of McConaughey's character. On the other hand, Matthew McConaughey did an equally impressive job for the same reason. He had to be two different characters too.<br/><br/>I loved in the movie when it's towards the end and you see Andie (Hudson) starting to act like herself around Ben (McConaughey) when they're at his parents house. I was personally really happy because it was like 'oooh the characters are starting to realize they do have feelings for each other blah blah blah'.  I thought it was great when Andie made Ben go up to the stage and sing and then Ben made Andie come up too and they were singing together.<br/><br/>McConaughey has been in a couple chick flicks. For instance, he's been in The Wedding Planner, EdTV(it could be seen as a chick flick just because of the romance), Boys on the Side, and probably more, but...<br/><br/>IF YOU LIKED THE WEDDING PLANNER, also starring McConaughey, YOU'LL LOVE THIS EVEN MORE. Personally I don't really like J.Lo. She's a good actress, but there's something about the roles she plays that I just don't like, so seeing Matthew with someone else was awesome.<br/><br/>Honestly though, I could see why someone would not like How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, but with the way the film is, I think it depends on the viewer. In my opinion it's not your typical chick flick where the guy is usually wrong and the girl is the victim, blah blah blah. They're both being wronged and doing wrong.  Everyone should go see it."
